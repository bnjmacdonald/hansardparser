1964,28th July 1964 - 1st October 1964 Page 1-999,7551,speech,,bobbie,169313104332,"The East African Power and Lighting Company was put at the top of the list, but hon. Members may not appreciate that this Company operates under legislation and under licenses issued by the Government. The rates which are charged for electricity are subject to agreement with the Government. The Government has a director on the Board and, in addition, is the biggest shareholder."
1964,28th July 1964 - 1st October 1964 Page 1-999,7552,speech,,bobbie,169313104332,"I would like to emphasize this, that the Government is the biggest shareholder in the Company. There is provision, nevertheless, in legislation for the terms on which the Government can take the Company over, but so long as this public utility is operating efficiently, subject to proper Government control, it would be foolish to divert capital resources from other projects in order to buy it out. The Government, in cooperation with the East African Power and Lighting Company and Power Securities, is planning the Seven Forks Hydro-Electric Scheme. The first stage of this scheme is likely to cost about £6 million and will, I hope, actually start before the end of this year. It will be financed by money raised by the East African Power and Lighting Company and Power Securities. The Tana River Development Company, in which the Government will have a share, has been registered, and once the loan funds that will be needed to carry out this scheme have been repaid, full ownership will revert to the Government of Kenya, and this is an example of cooperation between the Government and private enterprise which is fully in accordance with the principles of African socialism."
1964,28th July 1964 - 1st October 1964 Page 1-999,7553,speech,,bobbie,169313104332,"But I heard that if this programmers goes through it will help us to irrigate the Tana River Scheme, and also we hope that we shall be able to electrify the line between Nairobi and Mombasa so that we can have faster trains than now. It was also proposed that the Kenya Bus Services Limited should be nationalized. The hon. Member who proposed this may not be aware that this Company operates under an agreement with the Nairobi City Council. The rates which it charges have to be agreed with the City Council, and the agreement also contains a clause setting up the terms on which it can be taken over. The amount of profits which the Company can take is also limited in the agreement. If the City Council decided to take over the bus services and run their own service, then this could be done, but it would lose us money which would otherwise be available for other services which the Council supplies to its citizens. However, like the Government, the City Council needs to utilize all its available funds for the running of existing services and for their expansion and improvement, and I here endorse fully the remarks made by the hon. National Member. Mr. Malinda, to this extent. In relation to public utilities, the availability of outside sources of private capital is an advantage to the country, provided proper controls are exercised to ensure that the particular service provided by private enterprise is controlled in the interests of the public. What is really relevant in the context of development in Kenya "

Also, why, in his reply, has he missed out the all vital tourist industry which could, properly promoted, employ many more thousands of our people?"

Therefore, I ask him to advise his local authority to bring up some plans."

It is not intended that that power should be exercised to delegate anything but comparatively unimportant administrative or ordinary routine duties. I think that it would be advisable to make it plain in the Bill that that power shall not be exercised the power of delegation shall not be exercised in respect of any rule-making power which is conferred by an Ordinance upon a member, and therefore, sir, I shall move in the committee stage to add a proviso to the new clause to this effect: ""Provided that nothing in this section shall empower the Chief Secretary, the Attorney General, the Financial Secretary or a member to depute to any person any power to make rules"".
