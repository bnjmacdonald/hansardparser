THE CHILDREN (AMENDMENT) BILL
(Loud consultations)
The Temporary Deputy Chairman
(Hon. Kajwang’): 
Hon. Members, this is the 
Committee of the whole House to consider the Children (Amendment) Bill, (National 
Assembly Bill No. 18 of 2014). We will be considering two Bills in the Session. We will 
also be considering the Climate Change Bill, (National Assembly Bill No. 1 of 2014).
However, we will begin with the Children (Amendment) Bill.
Put a little attention to this because it is important. There are two Members who
have proposed amendments. The first one is the Chairperson of the Departmental
Committee on Labour and Social Welfare and the second one is the Member for 
Matungulu. I would like to start with the proposed amendments by the Member for
Matungulu because he proposes to delete the clauses of that Bill. The effect of those
proposals would be to completely delete the entire Bill. If the entire Bill is deleted there
will, therefore, be nothing to add a new clause to. So, that is why we want to start with
 the ones which intend to delete the whole Bill before we go to the one which seeks to
insert a new clause. So, that is the reason why we begin with the amendments proposed
by the Member for Matungulu.
All right. We shall now begin.
Clause 2
Member for Matungulu, I can see you have an amendment to this clause.
Hon. Mule: Thank you very much, hon. Temporary Deputy Chairman. I beg to move:-
THAT, Clause 2 of the Bill be deleted.
