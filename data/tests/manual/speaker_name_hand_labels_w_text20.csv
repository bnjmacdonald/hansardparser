1999,"1st July, 1999P_32",12,12,22,,<Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Is Mr. Ayacko also not here? Let us move on to the next Question. </Newspeech>
1999,"1st July, 1999P_32",15,1,7,,Dr. Ali asked the Minister for Education and Human Resource Development:-
1999,"1st July, 1999P_32",16,NA,NA,,"(a) why Bute Secondary School dining hall is in a deplorable state, forcing students to eat their meals under a tree;"
1999,"1st July, 1999P_32",17,NA,NA,,"(b)	what happened to the money that was allocated for the purchase of cookers for the school five years ago; and,"
1999,"1st July, 1999P_32",18,NA,NA,,(c)	what he has done to improve general facilities in the school.
1999,"1st July, 1999P_32",19,12,22,,<Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Is there anybody from the Ministry of Education and Human Resource Development? Next Question. </Newspeech>
1999,"1st July, 1999P_32",243,12,47,,"<Newspeech>The Minister for Health (Mr. Kalweo): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move that Mr. Speaker do now leave the Chair to enable me to initiate debate on vote 11 - Ministry of Health."
1999,"1st July, 1999P_32",244,NA,NA,,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, as hon. Members are aware, my Ministry has the overall mandate to provide and promote quality curative, preventive, promotive and rehabilitative health care to all Kenyans. To this end, the Ministry has concentrated its efforts on increasing coverage and accessibility of health care to all Kenyans. The Ministry has maintained a long-term vision of creating an enabling environment to enable non-governmental private organisations and the communities to participate in improvement of health care services in Kenya."
1999,"1st July, 1999P_32",245,NA,NA,,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the past, the Ministry has made major strides in the provision of health services, as can be attested through a number of parameters. The life expectancy improved from 44 at Independence, to 60 years in 1993. Crude death rate dropped from 20 per 1,000 to 12 per 1,000. The fertility rate declined from 8.1 per cent in 1997 to 5.4 per cent in 1992. The infant mortality rate stood at 120 per 1,000 at Independence, and at 73 per 1,000 in 1998. Indeed, this is no mean achievement, given that the annual budgetary allocations for the Ministry have hardly matched the actual health demand costs. Although the allocations have steadily risen from K�50 million in 1980, to over K�738 million in 1998, the per capita expenditure on health has declined in real terms from Kshs570 ten years ago, to Kshs300 in the last financial year."
1999,"1st July, 1999P_32",246,NA,NA,,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, one striking feature in the health status, dating from the middle of 1990, is the reversal trend in the gains in the health status. This, indeed, is due to the emerging and re-emerging of diseases which have contributed to high morbidity and mortality, alongside increasing the poverty bracket. The worsening situation of HIV/AIDS with prevalence of 10 per cent, and now occupying 50 per cent of our medical beds in our hospitals, is threatening to consume the Ministry's Recurrent Budget. The resurgence of tuberculosis and the related infections have complicated the scenario even more. The emergence of malaria strains resistant to conventional treatment and the outbreak of epidemics like cholera, has kept the Ministry on its toes at all times, consuming the limited resources allocated to it. To this end, my Ministry is in the process of constructing the National AIDS Council to co-ordinate activities geared towards addressing the worsening AIDS epidemic."

I rise to support this Motion and first and foremost, I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for the manner in which he presented his proposals. I also congratulate the management team at Afya House for the manner in which they have handled the Ministry for the last few years."
