Mrs. Jane Adhiambo Odawa, the widow of the late Mr. Isaac Yonah, APN/PC 421, will be paid the dependant's pension as requested by the District Commissioner, Siaya as per his letter, No. FIN.4/49 Vo1.XXIV/(142), dated 12th May, 1992. <Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance (Mr. Keah): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. My Ministry will pay the dependant's pension when we receive the relevant death certificate and completed declaration forms from the widow of the late Isaac Yonah, APN/PC 421. Until receipt of this Question, we were not aware that Mr. Isaac Yonah, APN/PC 421, had died as no communication had reached us. The litter of 12th May, 1992, No Vol.4/924(142) from the District Commissioner, Siaya, had not reached us by the time we received the Question. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Jalang'o: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would, first of all, like to thank the Assistant Minister for being here on time on a Wednesday morning. What astounds me is the fact that the Ministry is not aware of the death of Mr. Yonah, which occurred six years ago, and the widow has been receiving pension cheques on Isaac Odawa's name. All that the widow wanted is to have the cheques drawn on her name because she h:is been receiving her late husband's pension for the last six years and yet the Assistant Minister is saying that he is not aware that Mr. Yonah died six years ago. What is happening in the Ministry of Finance? Mr, Falana Confusion! </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr, Keah: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as you can appreciate, unless the Ministry is informed that a pensioner has died, we continue, to release cheques in his name. In this particular case, ray Ministry was: aware that the pensioner had died six years egg. We, do not have those records but, as t said, we have, duly taken up the matter because on receipt or this Question, we were equally astounded as hon jalang'o. We immediately telephoned the District Commissioner, Siaya, and he sent us a copy of the letter hon. Jalang'o is talking about. We are now in the process of looking for more details; we want to be provided with the relevant death certificate in order to put our records straight. </Newspeech>Mr. Kith: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there seems to be something wrong in this matter. If the widow has been receiving cheques, hew come that the Assistant Minister is saying that they are not aware that Mr. Yonah died six years ago? it seems that there is inefficiency in his Minbity. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Keah: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that does not exist, and the Treasury is not in a mess. Quite legitimately, those cherities have not been drawn in the name of the widow, but in the name of Mr. Yonah. In the absence of information to the contrary, we have been sending those cheques regularly as we normally do since we were not aware that Mr. Isaac Yonah had died. Now that We know that he is dead, we are taking the necessary action. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Fatana: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is a shame for the Assistant Minister to confess in this House that his Ministry not aware that Mr. Isaac Yonah died six years ago. The officers concerned assumed he was still alive and they continued paying him his dues. Would the Assistant Kmister accept that there is a lot of confusion and mismanagement in his Ministry. For instance, there was a head count of civil servants in the country to flush out "ghost" workers, and this goes to prove that there is inefficiency in his Ministry because the officers there are taking the dead to be alive, let alone taking the living for "ghosts"; They even do not know that they are paying the dead  Would the Assistant Minister admit that there is a lot confusion in the Treasury, which is actually becoming a liability in terms of paying fellows who do not even exist? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Keah: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think hon. Falana should be ashamed of himself. How can he say that the Treasury is a mismanaged place? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Falana: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the hon. Keah in order to say that hon. Falana should be ashamed of himself? Is that language parliamentary? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: That is, certainly, not parliamentary language. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Keah: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that language is unparliamentary; and I am sorry for having used it What I want to say is that I do not accept the allegation that there is mismanagement in the Treasury. If somebody dies out there in Siaya, how does hon. Falana expect the Treasury to know that a pensioner has died unless we are duly informed and given the death certificate by his dependant? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Falana: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Assistant Minister has withdrawn the remark he made against me and I do not want to pursue it, with all due respect, but when it comes to operations at the Treasury, hon. Keah should be ashamed to face me. The Goldenberg issue is</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Order, Mr. Falana! I think you should similarly withdraw the remark that the hon. Keah should be ashamed of himself. He withdrew this remark in the first place, and I do not think you want to start some early morning wrestling with hon. Keah. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Falana: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not want to start some early morning wrestling with hon. Keah, but if he admitted that he was ashamed in the Goldenberg scandal when he misled the House and swallowed his own words, that is all right. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Will you simply withdraw those  remark, Mr. Falana? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Falana: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have made my point, and I now withdraw my remark.I think the Treasury should know who is alive and who is dead when it writes out cheques to pensioners. That is its fluty. It should know whom it is paying. </Newspeech><Newspeech>An Hon. Member: Tell them! </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Is that a supplementary question? It is more of a protest than a supplementary question, Mr. Falana. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Falana: It is a protest, Mr. Deputy Speaker,Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Salat: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in view of the regulations which have been made in this House regarding payments being made to pensioners who are already dead, and bearing in mind that there may be many other similar cases existing, could the Assistant Minister promise this House that he is going to undertake a head count of all .the pensioners in this country? That is the  only way of ensuring that taxpayers money is not misused. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Keah: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I cannotundertake to do that because we do have controls. I would like to take a little time to explain the controls that we have. Let me also explain that controls may be very sound, but they are applied by human beings and there could be some flaws. Every year, there is supposed to be a return to the Treasury from each pensioner to state that the pensioner is alive. That is one control which we use to safeguard public funds.In this particular case, we are totally at a loss to understand exactly what happened. I believe that there is a return in the relevant file indicating that the pensioner is alive. So, there could be a possibility of wrong information being supplied to the Treasury. Information from the pensioner to the Treasury is supposed to be corroborated by the district Administration. So, in this particular case, what we will do on receipt of this death certificate will be to carry out extensive tests. This is because regulations say that when a pensioner dies, his dependant will continue to receive payment from the Treasury for five years. In this particular case, this happened for six years. So, I quite accept the concern expressed by hon. Members about looking after public funds, but mistakes occur, and I do not know exactly what happened in this case. Until we receive the relevant information from Siaya, it is difficult for me to say what exactly happened.As for a head count, this would certainly be a mammoth task and, if the hon. Member insists on it, then the Budget will have to come here for approval. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Jalang'o: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, pensioners and their dependants in this country are being frustrated by the Pensions Department of the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance. Almost every week, questions are asked in this House about pensions. There appears to be some problems within the Pensions Department in the Treasury. We, as Parliamentarians, are trying to point out that there are problems and the Assistant Minister should undertake to find out exactly why pensioners are frustrated.This lady has provided all the information required the death certificate and the relevant declaration forms to the District Commissioner, Siaya. That was done over two years. Would the Assistant Minister kindly undertake to get this information from Siaya to save this widow from further frustration and delays? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Keah: The answer to that question, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, is "yes". I started by thanking hon. Jalang'o by saying that on receipt of this Question, we started investigations with the District Commissioner, Siaya, and what we have so far received is the letter that was written on 12th May, 1992. The hon. Member has probably hit the nail on the head in terms of the problems that exist between the Pensions Department and pensioners relating to proper communication. If all the relevant details were given to the District Commissioner, Siaya, two years ago and he has been keeping them, instead of forwarding them to the Treasury, I Should like to exonerate the Treasury. This is because that information has not reached the Treasury, and that is the truth. It is, therefore, up to hon. Members to assist in such matters. In this particular case, if the hon. Jalang'o were to collect those documents from the District Commissioner, Siaya, and bring them to me, I would certainly undertake to take the necessary action. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Falana: One a point'of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister has told us that if a pensioher dies, the Treasury continues to pay the widow for five years. Now that he has been made aware that this man died six years ago, when is he going to effect payment? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Keah: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am unable to give the exact date until we? receive the relevant death certificate. </Newspeech><i>Question No.521</i> <Header>Vehicles at Hulugho Police Post</Header>Mr. Salat asked the Minister of State, Office of the President:-(a)	how many vehicles are currently stationed at Hulugho Police Post in Hulugho Division; and(b)	in order to enhance security at the border, whether he could provide serviceable vehicles for the post.<Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Is anybody here from the Office of the President? We will leave this Question until the end. </Newspeech>.»(Question deferred) <i>Question No.543</i> <HEADER>HOSPITAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS</HEADER>Mr. S.M. Am in asked the Minister for Health:-(a) how much money the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) has Collected from Contributors between January, 1990 and July, 1992;(b)	how much, out of the total amount collected, has been used to cover medical expenses incurred by the contributors during the same period; and(c)	since the in-patient fees charged by private hospitals, such asNairobi Hospital, are too high for the ordinary mwananchi, whether he would direct the Board of Management of this Fund to be meeting half of the medical expenses incurred by contributors in all private hospitals throughout the Republic.<Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Is anybody here from the Ministry of Health? We will leave this Question until the end. </Newspeech>(Question deferred)<i>Question No.490</i><Header>Kenya Wildlife Services Budget</Header><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Is Mr. Malebe not here? We will leave his Question until the end. </Newspeech>(Question deferred) <i>Question No.491 </i><HEADER>POTHOLES ON MUDAVADI ROAD</HEADER>Mr. A.K. Kimemia asked the Minister for Local Government:-(a)	whether he is aware that Mudavadi Road (formerly Court Road), in Nakuru Town, is full of potholes and needs urgent repair; and(b)	if the answer to the above question is in the affirmative, when this road will be repaired and how much it is expected to cost<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Local Government (Mr. Wagura): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a)	Yes, I am aware.(b)	It will be repaired in June, this financial year, at a cost of Sh.309, 000/=.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kimemia: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the . Assistant Minister is misleading the House. He has been giving the same promise for a long time now. Roads in Nakuru Town, particularly Mudavadi Road, have many potholes. Why does it take so long to carry out repairs on this particular road? I am sure the Ministry collects service charges for the maintenance of roads. Why does it not carry out its work? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr..Wagura: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not misleading the House. In fact, I have just said that we are going to have the road repaired in June,this financial year. We are aware it has many potholes due to heavy rains and it will be repaired because we are very concerned about the state of some of these roads. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr.Ndirangu: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir could we know from the Assistant Minister whether in June, this financial year, his officers are only going to repair Mudavadi Road? We know that nearly all roads in Nakuru Town have potholes, which arc very dangerous to the road users. When are they going to repair those roads? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wagura: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is not true that all roads in Nakuru Town have potholes, but this particular road will definitely be repaired this financial year. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ndirangu: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is misleading the House. He has denied the fact that all roads in Nakuru Town have potholes. Apart from Kanu Street, in Nakuru Town, which was repaired recently, which other road is in a good condition? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wagura: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, all other roads, except the one in Question, are in a good condition. <Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kimemia: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister is totally misleading the House. Most of the roads in Nakuru Town are impassable. For instance, Railway Road, Government Road and Baringo Road are all impassable. Could he tell us when he is going to repair all these roads? There is no rain now. <Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wagura: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, once again, I would like to assure my good friend that the Ministry is very serious and all those roads are going to be repaired next year. <Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ndirangu: On a point of information, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I would like to inform the lion. Assistant Minister that all roads in Bangladesh and Racecourse Estates, Nakuru, have potholes. What is he going to do about them? <Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wagura: Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for the information. We will definitely take action. <Newspeech><i>Question No. 530 </i><Header>Electricity for Lamu West</Header>Mr. Wakole, kwa niaba ya Mr. Bujra, alimwuliza Waziri wa Kawi Wizara ina mipango gani ya kusambaza nguvu za umeme katika sehemu za Mtondoni, Kipungani na Mokowe, Wilayani Lamu.<Newspeech>The Minister for Energy (Mr. Kyalo): Bw. Naibu Spika, naomba kujibu.Sehemu za Mtondoni na Kipungani, katika Kisiwa cha Lamu, zitapata nguvu za umeme katika mradi unaoendelea. Kazi yenyewe inahusu kuongeza kilomila nane za Iaini ya stima kutoka 11 Kb zinazopitia juu ya stesheni mbili za kueneza umeme pamoja na kazi nyingine ambazo zinahusika. Sehemu ya Mokowe' itafaidika kutokana na mradi wa Kilifi, Bura na Hola ambao unafanyiwa uchunguzi sasa. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wakole: Bw. Naibu Spika, Waziri anaweza kulieleza Bunge ni lini mradi hifu uCikapoanza kutekelezwa hasa sehemu za Bura na Mokowe? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kyalo: Bw. Naibu Spika, uchunguzi unaendelea na baadaye pesa zitatafutwa za kutekeleza mradi huo. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wakole: Bw. Naibu Spika, ni uchunguzi aina gani unaoendelea kuhusu mradi huu? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kyalo: Bw. Naibu Spika, uchunguzi ni kuhusu kazi ya mchoro (survey) wa laini hadi Hola. </Newspeech><i>Question No. 494 </i><Header>Resettlement of Garsen Residents</Newspeech>Mr. Wakole asked the Minister for Energy:-(a)	if he is aware that Gadeni Village, in Garsen Division, was destroyed by floods caused by the dykes which were constructed by Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority (TARDA) in the on-going Tana Delta Rice Irrigation Scheme because the dykes blocked the natural cause of the flowing water,(b)	since this calamity was man-made, if the Authority could make suitable arrangements to ensure that the displaced wananchi are re-settled in their old village; and(c)	if the said Authority could compensate the local Maendeleo ya Wanawake Organisation whose social hall, which was built at a cost of KSh.300,000/=, was swept away by the floods.<Newspeech>The Minister for Energy (Mr. Kyalo): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.It is not true that the flooding of Gadeni Village was caused by the dykes constructed by TARDA because flooding is not a new phenomenon in the lower reaches of Tana River. The heavy flooding of Gadeni was as a result of unusual heavy rains at that time. The flooding that occurred was not man-made since flooding in this area is recurrent and natural. Right now, Gaden Village is protected by the dykes and re-settlement in the old site could render the village vulnerable to seasonal flooding. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, TARDA cannot compensate Maendeleo ya Wanawake Organisation for the damages caused by the floods. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wakole: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Gadeni has been there .since 1954. Could the Minister explain why it was just recently, after the start of TARDA, that the village was, completely flooded? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kyalo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, work is going on to control floods in the lower parts of Tana River and, until what is going on, is completed, there is bound to be problems. What the hon. Member needs to do is to give the Ministry time so that it can complete the work which is going on <Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wakole: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir; is the Minister aware that right now Gadeni villagers are in a TARDA farm? Could he assure this House that the villagers will not be moved from the farm and that ways and means will be sought by TARDA to help the villagers to move back to the old. Gadeni Village? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kyalo; Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, what I can assure the hen. Member is that the villagers will be taken care of and there will be no unnecessary disturbances that will cause hardships to them. We are there to ensure that floods are controlled. Our purpose is to ensure that the people who are there are taken care of and that the annual phenomenon of floods does not disturb them.. </Newspeech><i>Question No. 482</i><Header>DEATH OF MR. DADI'S CATTLE</Header>Mr. Wakole asked the Minister for Livestock Development:- (a)what the outcome of the investigations carried out to establish the cause of the death of 148 head of cattle in June, 1988, belonging to Mr. liantiro Dadi, of Kipao Village, in Tana River District, which was promised by the Minister in his reply to Question No. 180 given in this House on 12th July, 1988, was; and (b)whether, since the cattle died due to negligence on the part of veterinary officers, the Ministry could compensate Mr. Dadi and other livestock farmers whose cattle died. <Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Livestock Development (Mr. Chesire): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. (a) The Ministry's technical personnel. visited Kipao Village and investigated the cause of the death of 142 head of cattle belonging to Mr. Hantiro Dadi and others farmers. They established that the cause of the death of the cattle was massive allergy after a CBPP vaccination. (b) Since the investigations Carried out revealed that the death of the animals was not deliberately caused, Mr. Dad and the other farmers involved could not be compensated. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kubo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has said that the death of the cattle was caused by the carelessness of members of staff of his Ministry, this means that they are guilty of negligence. Could he confirm that the wananchi concerned are going to be compensated for that negligence? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Chesire: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I mentioned that these animals died out of allergic reaction after vaccination, and allergy cannot be carelessness. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Malebe: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Since the Assistant Minister has accepted that these cattle died from allergy after vaccination, that is the carelessness of the Ministry. I think it is not in order for him to refute what he has just accepted that this was a side-effect of the animal's reaction to vaccination. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Chesire: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it should be understood that allergic reaction is something that occurs at any time after treatment. It can occur to both human beings and animals. Certain human beings are allergic to certain types of vaccination and, similarly, these animals got  allergic to this type of vaccine. It cannot, therefore, be taken to have been deliberate. In any  case, I would like to say that there was no deliberate action on the part of the officers involved. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kubo: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is misleading this House and he should not be allowed to continue doing so. We know that an allergy is not the same as a side effect. If this had been an allergy, it would have involved a few animals out of the total, but it affected the total heard involved.. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>Mr. Chesire: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for the benefit of hon. Kubo, we vaccinated a total of 52,565 head of cattle, out of which only 142 head died. So, you cannot say that the total heard died. In fact, 142 head of cattle is a very small percentage in relation to the total population of cattle in the district. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Hon. Members: On a point of order. On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Mr. Deputy Speaker: Order! Order! Jest for the benefit of the Chair, Mr. Chesire, is it, as is said in the Question, that 148 head of cattle belonged to one farmer? You seem to suggest that only 142 head of cattle, died in the whole district, but the Question is specific, in saying that 148 heads of cattle belonging to one farmer, Mi. Dadi, died. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Chesire: Mr., Deputy Speaker, Sir, the information I have is that these 142 animals belonged to a Mr. Hantiro Dadi and other farmers. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Barng'etpny: Bw. Naibu Spika, swala hill la ng'ombe. 48 za mfugaji mmoja kufa ni la kusikitisha sana, na ni ingefaa Wizara ya Ustawi wa sana. Siku moja, daktari wa mifugo kutoka Wizara hii alikuja kwangu kuchanja ng'ombe na ng'ombe 14 wakafa. Jambo hili linafaa kufikiriwa sana kwa sababu ukitembea katika Jamhuri nzima, utaona kwamba watu wanalalamika kwa sababu ng'ombe wengi wamekufa baada ya kuchanjwa. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Chesire: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for the benefit of hon. Barng'etuny, the number of animals that died in this case is not 48 but 142. I would like to assure the hon. Member that the Ministry takes seriously the need to carefully handle farmers' animals whenever they are being vaccinated. There are standing instructions that every hygienic method should be carried out to ensure that there is no contamination of the needle when vaccinating and that every health care is taken during vaccination. In this regard, I wish to state clearly that there was nothing deliberate and that if anybody tells us that certain officers are doing these things deliberately so that farmers' animals may die, I can assure you that we, in the Ministry, will take appropriate disciplinary measures against the officers concerned. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Order Mr. Chesire! I think it is important for you to realize that what the hon. Members are concerned about is negligence establish any form of negligence, one needs not show that a certain act or omission was deliberate. In fact, an omission can also result in negligence and that is what hon. Kuho and other hon. Members are trying to draw your attention to. Therefore, the question of animals dying as a result of an allergy following a vaccination seems, on the face of it, to indicate negligence. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>Mr. Chesire: Mr. Deputy SpealCer, Sir, we have no evidence that the cause of death of the animals was as a result of negligence. In any case, I wish to point out that </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kipkorir: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister really in order to try and evade the question? The question that he has been asked is whether he is aware that there was negligence on the part of his officers who vaccinated the animals as a result of which 148 cows belonging to one farmer died. Does he know what loss this farmer has suffered as a result of this negligence? We would like the Ministry to accept responsibility and pay compensation to the farmers concerned. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Chesire: Mr. Deputy Speaker. Sir. compensation cannot be paid because in accordance with section 12 of the Animal Diseases Act, Cap.364. we are told:- "No action shall lie against the Government, organization or any public officer for any act done in good faith in connection with the diagnosis, control, prevention or treatment of modifiable diseases of animals including the preparation of biological products. No compensation shall be payable for any act done under this Act unless the Minister, otherwise directs." </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is a tragic case in which many cattle belonging to one farmer died, and the incident cannot be attributed to an allergic reaction to any pharmaceutical product. It is unfortunate that the Assistant Minister has failed to tell this House the safety of these drugs. Does he know what percentage of animals would react against this drug? Furthermore, in Uasin Gishu, vaccination was carried out the other day against the foot-and-mouth disease, as a result of which many animals died. The truth of the matter is that the particular drugs supplied for this particular vaccination were not properly tested by the appropriate institution. Secondly, some of these imported drugs were found to have expired, resulting in the death of the animals and thereby causing a big economic loss, not only to the farmer concerned, but also to the entire country. Could the Assistant Minister deny or accept this? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Chesire: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not a veterinary  surgeon as hon, Dr. Misoi is, but, according to the information I have here, 142 animals died as a result of an allergic reaction to a CBPT vaccination, which causes severe reaction due to the introduction of anti-germs called microsprasma, m icroidis, vermicroidis and other vaccine components, for example, veptone. These are foreign proteins and the animal body over reacts in order to get rid of these things. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Barngetuny: Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Naibu Spika. Ni haki kwa Waziri Msaidizi kusema juu ya mambo mengine ambayo hajaulizwa? Aliulizwa ni kiasi gani cha dawa ambacho ng'ombe hawa walipewa. Tunauliza hivyo kwa sababu inaonekana wazi kwamba ng'ombe hawa walikufa baada ya kupatiwa over-dose ya dawa. Mimi nilikuwa msimamizi wa mifugo katika Wilaya ya Nandi wakati Waziri Msaidizi alipokuwa Mkuu wa Tarafa, na anafahamu kwarnba mimi nilihudhuria masomo ya matibabu ya mifugo kwa muds wa miaka miwili na ninafahamu ninavyosema. Ninastaajabu kwamba yeye anajibu juu ya mambo mengine mbali na yale aliyoulizwa, na jambo hili linaonyesha wazi kwamba yeye hajafanya homework ya kutosha wakati alipolipata Swali hili ili kuweza kujua kama wale waliowadunga ng'ombe hawa sindano walikuwa veterinary scouts au veterinary officers. Yeye hawezi kusema kwamba si veterinary surgeon kama mhe. Dr. Misoi. Alipatiwa jukumu la kulijibu Swali hill na ingefaa awaeleze waheshimiwa Wabunge ni kitu  gani kilichofanyika iii ng'ombe 14.8 wafe baada ya kudungwa sindano. Hii ni hasara kubwa sana kwa mkulima mtnoja na kusema kwamba Serikali haiwezi kulipa ridhaa ni jambo ambalo Bunge hili haliwezi kuelewa kabisa.. Ingefaa aeleze ukweli kuhusu jambo hili. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>Mr. Chesire: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not understand hon. Barngetuny's point of,order. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Neither do I! </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Falana: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister undertake to investigate these. allegations because this could be why animals are dying countrywide? It has been said that veterinary officers inject animals with very little dosage. This is because they are money hungry and they dilute the medicine so that a dose that is supposed to be given. to one animal is given to four or five animals. In that case, that medicine becomes useless and does not serve the purpose it is intended. to serve., These are the sort of allegations that  the Assistant Minister should investigate on .top of the negligence these officers are being accused of. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Chesire: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think hon. Falana's point is very hypothetical because if the drug used in this case had been diluted, I am sure the reaction from the animals would not have been felt. If he could have argued that the officers have been administering an over dose of the drug, then perhaps there could be some reason for investigating the allegation. However, this is a very technical problem and one cannot really establish exactly whether the death of the animals was caused by negligence on the part of the veterinary officers or whether it was an allergy as I have stated. Therefore, it is very difficult for us to be in a position to say that there was negligence on part of our officers and that compensation is therefore, due: However, according to my understanding, the death was caused by an allergic reaction' due to the treatment given, and I am sorry to say that this was due to bad luck. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Mr. Chesire, when you are dealing with the question of negligence, there is a very common doctrine used, namely, facts speak for themselves". In this particular case, it appears that the burden of proof is on your officers, and it is unfortunate that you have to go back to the same officers to try and get more information regarding this terrible loss. The tendency is that they will was to find an explanation to reach a conclusion that there was no negligence involved. The Chair wishes that there could be a .private and independent opinion on this matter, so that upon a report being produced by that independent person or body to4he Minister, then he could exercise his 'discretion. , You quoted Section 12 of Cap. 364 which says, "unless the Minister otherwise directs." The ruling of the Chair on this matter is that upon receipt of that independent opinion, the Minister should then exercise his discretion and offer compensation if it is found that, indeed, there was negligence. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kiilu: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Arising from your ruling could the Assistant Minister tell the House how long he is going to take to give us a report on this issue? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>Mr. Chesire: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I. accept your ruling in this matter and we shall definitely carry out thorough investigations into this matter because it involves loss of livestock and wealth. With the indulgence of this House, and in view of the importance of the issue, I cannot promise to report back in two days. Therefore, I request to be given at least one month to come up with a proper answer. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Let us go back to Mr. Sallies Question. </Newspeech><i>Question No. 521</i> <Header>VEHICLES AT HULUGHO POLICE POST </Header>Mr. Salat asked the Minister of State, Office of the President:- (a)how many vehicles are currently stationed at Hulugho Police Post in Hulugho Division; and (b)whether, in order to enhance security at the border, he could provide serviceable vehicles to the post. <Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Is anybody here from the Office of the President? </Newspeech>(Question deferred) <i>Question No. 543</i><Header>HOSPITAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS</Header>Mr. Kubo, on behalf of Mr. S.M. Amin, asked the Minister for Health:- (a)how much money the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) has collected from contributors between January,. 1990 and July, 1992; (b)how much, out of the total amount collected, has been used to cover medica1expenses incurred by the contributors during the 'same period; and (c) whether, since the in patient fees charged by private hospitals, such as Nairobi Hospital, are too high for the ordinary wananchi, he would direct the Board of Management of this Fund to be meeting half of the medical expenses incurred by contributors in all private hospitals throughout the Republic. <Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Health (Mr. Sompisha): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Mr. Sompisha, has it occurred to you that you have come very late and that this Question has already been asked before? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Health (Mr. Sompisha): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I apologize for coming late. I now beg to reply. (a)The amount of money collected by the NHIF from contributors between January 1990 and July 1992 is Sh.1,582,692,795.35. During the same period the Fund paid an amount of Sh.1,100,992,737.65 on medical expenses through Government and private hospitals, which is 63 per cent of the total amount. The amount represents an expenditure of Sh.33,699,724.50 on medical claims. (b)Although I agree with the hon. Member for Mandera West in his sentiments that in patient charges in private hospitals are too high for ordinary wananchi, people are free to go to any hospital of their choice where they can afford the charges. I, therefore, recommend that the ordinary mwananchi patronizes Government hospital amenity wards where in-patient charges are met by the Fund. (c)In view of the above information, the Minister does not consider it necessary to direct the Board of Management of the Fund to pay more money than the amount allocated at present. The Fund does not have enough money to cover half the cost of medical bills in such hospitals as the hon. Member refers to. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kubo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while I accept the Assistant Minister's reply, I would like to say that, on the other hand, the cost of running these hospitals has also gone up. It is, therefore, natural that the Ministry should to increase its charges. Could the Assistant Minister consider increasing the amount paid by NHIF! </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Sompisha: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister considers the amount being paid at present as enough. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Let us go back to Mr. Malebe's Question. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Malebe: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to apologize for coming late. </Newspeech><i>Question No. 490</i><Header>KENYA WILDLIFE SERVICES' BUDGET</Header>Mr. Malebe asked the Minister for Tourism and Wildlife:- (a)how much money the Kenya Wildlife Services (KWS) had budgeted during the 1992/93 financial year to support the social economic development of the communities living in the Kanjoo, Lakathi and Kindani areas of Igembe Division; and (b)whether the KWS could grade the Kindani-Maua Road to provide access for tourists to the Meru National Park through the Kindani Gate. <Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Tourism and Wildlife (Mr. J.K. Terer): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. (a)The KWS does not allocate funds to specific sub-locations or locations. KWS allocates funds to support community projects chosen by the communities. This is determined after discussions between the game for a certain area warden and the respective communities through their DDCs. If there are any request to support community projects in Igembe area, they should be directed to the Senior Warden, Meru National Park. (b)The KWS has no plans to grade the Kindani-Maua Road for the time being. This is because there are two main entrances to Meru National park namely Ura. and Mulera which are adequate for the flow of tourists. In any case KWS does not maintain roads outside the parks as that is the work of the Ministry of Public Works. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Malebe: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not think the Assistant Minister has answered my question, in which I want to know the amount of money budgeted by the KWS during the 1992/93 Financial Year. Could he, therefore, tell us how much money has been budgeted to assist the community projects in the areas adjacent Meru National Park during the 1992/93 Financial Year? Once we know that amount we will be able to discuss with the Senior Warden the relevant budget of the project we intend the KWS to assist. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Sompisha: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for the benefit of hon. Members, I have the following supplementary information. The KWS revenue is an essential part of its management costs and the maximum amount that it can afford to spend on this project is 25 per cent of its park and reserve entrance fees. However, it aims at building this up carefully over a period of about three years depending on several factors. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the 1992/93 Financial Year, the KWS will share approximately Sh.15 million from its revenue with the communities adjacent to national parks, including Meru National Park. These services will be extended to Tsavo West, Tsavo East, Shimba Hills, Meru, Nairobi, Longonot and Marine National Parks. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Malebe: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister has still not answered my Question. He says that there is S11.15 million that has been set aside for all national parks in eastern Kenya, but I want to know how much of this money has been allocated to Meru National Park? If we know this sum, the people living adjacent to boundaries of this national park can approach the Senior Warden with a view to the Kenya Wildlife Services (KWS) assisting some of their projects in the area. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Terer: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is no specific amount of money that has been set' aside for Meru National Park. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kubo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the answer given by the Assistant Minister that his Ministry has set aside about Sh.15 million to help people in those areas, I would like to say, that what we have witnessed is that such money is sent to the district development committee (DDC), which may then allocate it to an area which is not adjacent to a national park. In my constituency, for example, those, who live adjacent to the national park there never benefit. These people. who are the ones who actually suffer damage by wildlife, do not benefit as this money is, in most cases, given 10 completely different people who have not suffered any damage by wildlife. Could the Assistant Minister make sure that this money goes only to projects in areas adjacent to national parks, and not to other areas in the districts concerned? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Terer: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Members of this House are members of DDCs in their respective areas,-and it is up to those concerned to help the Ministry in ensuring that the money that is meant to he spent in areas 'adjacent to national parks is actually spent there, and that it is not diverted elsewhere. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Malebe: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in answer to part (b) of the Question, the Assistant Minister Says that the KWS, has no plans to grade the Kindani-Maus Road for the time being, but, in answer to another motion last year, the Ministry agreed to open the Kindani Gate, to tourists because it is very convenient to tourists travelling from Maua. Since this road also serves the community living near Meru National Park could the Assistant Minister provide road construction equipment  I know that such equipment is lying idle in Meru National Park - so that, when the Ministry of Public Works provides the necessary diesel, this road may be graded to form easy access to Meru National Park through the Kindani Gate? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Terer: Mr. DepUty Speaker, Sir, my Ministry will undertake to liaise with the Ministry of Public Works to see that some action is taken regarding road. </Newspeech>POINT OF ORDER <Header>OPPOSITION ENGINEERED CLASHES IN BARING() EAST AND ELGEYO MARAKWET</Header> <Newspeech>Mr. Kipkorir: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I would like to request the people of my constituency to work together and assist each other. I appeal to Kenyans to resist totally the behavior of the opposition. It was only recently this year when women and children were killed in clashes between the Marakwet and the Pokot. It took us a long time to work out a solution to the problem. The people of Baringo East and Elgeyo Marakwet complained about this for a long time and we request the former District Commissioner of Baring to assist us, but he refused to do so. As a result, the Marakwet and the Pokot have been fighting for a long time now, killing innocent women and children. We discovered later on that the opposition have sent people to Baringo East to advise the Pokot to fight the Marakwet. Mr. Kibaki and his colleagues have alleged that the Government accepts that it was the former District Commissioner of Baringo who was carrying out the evil directives of the opposition. People have been slaughtering one another in Baringo East and Elgeyo Mamkwet, and the former District Commissioner of Baringo has been acting on behalf of the opposition. Mr. Kibaki and his colleagues have confirmed this in the Standard issue of 27th September, 1992. I appeal to the parents of my constituency who have run away with their children to ask their children to come back to school in Kerio Valley because the Government has sent security, personnel to the area to monitor the situation. I thank the Government for having taken action to protect wananchi in the area., I also appeal to the elders of Etgeyo Marakwet and Baringo East to sit down and work' out a solution to the situation so that we may live in peace and harmony as the President of this country advises us. </Newspeech> MOTIONS <Header>WATER RESERVOIRS FOR MAKUENI </Header><Newspeech>Mr. Kyonda: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I move this Motion, I would like to make a correction with regard to the number of locations mentioned here. In my draft Motion, the last location mentioned was Kalawa, which is administratively also in Wote Division. I do not know why the location has been omitted here, but the last sentence of this Motion should actually end "Mavindini, Kathonzweni and Kalawa Locations of Makueni District." Sir, I beg to move the following Motion:-THAT, while appreciating the Government efforts to provide clean piped water to all Kenyans both for domestic and animal consumption; and noting with concern that the residents of Wote Division, formerly Makueni, experience acute water shortages, particularly during the dry seasons; and realising that a lot of water goes to waste during the rains, which, if properly harvested, could alleviate their problems; this House urges the Government to solicit for funds from local and overseas donors specifically for the construction of water dams (reservoirs) in Lower Mbitini, Lower Nzaui, Wote, Mavindini, Kathonzweni and Kalawa Locations of Makueni District. It has been said in this House many times that water is life, and this can be proved when travelling in places where there is no water. Unless there is an important activity going there, such as oil production, very few people would be found to be residing there. My Wote Division, formerly Makueni, happens to be dry, and a time like this, the people there experience serious and acute water shortages. Except in two locations, Nzaui and Mbitini, where you find a few hills, there is no water in this division since there rest of the area is flat and dry. However, the division is very productive. For example, we have serious food shortage because we have not had rains for the last two years, if not more in some places. In some places people did not even plant during the last rain season because of shortage of rainfall. So, lack of water for people's consumption, livestock and other uses is a serious problems. Therefore, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have brought this Motion in very good faith. During the colonial days this area was not settled. In Kathonzweni there was a big detention camp because it was all forest with many wild animals and even if any of the prisoners escaped they could got very far. The colonialists thought that, perhaps, that area was not worth being settled in by people. However, due to shortage of land in better areas like Machakos, Kangundo and so on after Independence people moved down there and settled. These people, including myself, are there to stay. We have schools, hospitals, markets and so on and we are saying that at the moment some schools may even close because the nearest place from which they can get from is more 10 kilometres away. Boarding schools have to depend on waters transported to them by on tractors. A drum of this water is going for about. shs100/- in some places. How many drums would you use in a boarding school with 300 students? I know a secondary school which is about three kilometres away from a big dam, which is not likely to dry up even during this serious drought, and this schools pays about shs 10/- per drum of water, which is considered to be reasonable in that area. [Mr. Deputy Speaker left the Chair] [The Tetnporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mahihu) took the Chair] So, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, looking at the situation we have no hope of getting piped water. Our only hope was getting water was from the Kilimanjaro Water Project. The original was for a big water pipe from this project up to, at least, to the new Makueni District Headquarters. That did not happen. I have talked the Permanent Secretary and a few other officers in the Ministry of Water Development and all that they are telling, which I do not fully believe, is that there is not enough water at the source which can be supplied to us. Our other hope is that water would be piped from Athi River, which has water almost throughout the year, to us. We have checked on the Ministry for this, but we are told it is too expensive. We somehow agree that this is so. We are also discouraged by existence similar projects up the river at Wamunyu, Mwala and Mbiuni, which do not function for the most of the water. However, we know it is very expensive and at time like this when money seems to be scarce it might be the right thing to ask for. It is not worth pouring a lot money into a project and within a short time it stops functioning. We have looked around for other alternatives because people in this area will not move away due to lack of land. People went down to the coast, Chyulu and other places but now there is anywhere else where people can go for land. "People who were in Chyulu had to be moved down and even around there are many people who are landless. So, we are saying since these Nyayo people who have no water As I have said here during the rainy season millions of litres of water flow into the Indian Ocean. We think the best idea would be for us and the Government to put our heads together and think of having dams in the area for providing water an a permanent basis for the residents of these divisions. I would even add that the same solution should be applied in other areas which get as little as we do. We have rivers and streams which overflow during the rainy season and even wash away people, shambas and cattle. This is water, if properly harnessed, as I have said, can ,give the residents of the area a lot of water. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we, therefore, suggest to the Government that funds be sought from both within and without the country and to introduce a water for the residents of this area. It has been said here time and again that it is the Ministry's wish I hope it still is to provide water to every homestead by the year 2000. That is only eight years from now and only a miracle will make that happen. Even if it happens elsewhere I do not see happening in my place. However, that is not what we are saying, although it is a good dream if it could ever come true. We are saying that for heaven's sake a lot of water is flowing down to the ocean and we are urging the Government to look for funds and construct dams. We have a number of dams now. One is at Manooni and its Water has gone down up to, Mink, more than 10 kilometres and 'people are very happy. We have another one at Kilili whose water has been pumped to places nearer to people's homes. We have Kathonzweni which has schools, markets and so on and people travel long distances to fetch water here. When all the people and animals travel long distances to one water source, then soil erosion takes its toll. That is why I am saying that more dams should be constructed so that we can reduce soil erosion and people will be travelling about two to three kilometres to fetch water. If big dams arc constructed, their water can even be piped and brought nearer to the people. A lot of time is wasted by wananchi searching for water instead of being more productive in nation-building. If more dams were constructed, schools could not be in the danger they are in now. The little money available in schools, which could be used for development purposes, is now being used in drawing water because pupils cannot do without water. [The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mahihu) left the Chair] [The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mivam.randi) iook"the Chair] It is my humble submission to the Government that the best it, could do is to construct big dams two to three kilometres apart in Order to alleviate the acute shortage of water in this area. If this is done, our people will have time to do other things in the development of this country. We need dams in dry areas like mine so that </Newspeech>QUORUM<Newspeech>Mr. Salat: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. There is no quorum in the House. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi): Ring, the Division Bell. </Newspeech>(The Division Bell was rung) <Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi): We have a quorum now. You may proceed, Mr. Kyonda. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kyonda: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. . It is only fair that hon. Members sit in the Chamber to listen to the problems that we have in my area. Those of, us who have been to Masinga will have noticed the effect Masinga Dam has made on the surrounding areas. We are not asking for reservoirs of that size. The area is very productive; horticulture is abundant and people never go thirsty. There is enough water for every living creature around there. That dam has transformed the whole area. We are simply urging the Ministry to look into the possibility of harnessing the waters of Athi River. If a few dams could be constructed along this River the whole area could he transformed. This area is very suitable for horticulture. Horticultural crops can earn this country a.lot of foreign exchange. Therefore, on behalf of Wote residents, I urge the Government to come to our help and build big dams in this area, and the whole area will be transformed and we will be proud like the 'other' Kenyans who have water in their areas. With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move and call upon my friend, hon. Dr. Misoi, to, second the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I rise to second this very important on the need to supply adequate water to the people of Makueni District who have been suffering for a, long time due to lack of sufficient water, especially during dry seasons. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sit, hon. Kyonda has told the House that billions of litres of water flow down into the Indian Ocean when it rains. This is because there are no reservoirs in the area to contain this rain water. If there were reservoirs in that area this water could be harnessed for proper use. Considering that this is a semi-arid area, it would been wise for the Ministry to institute measures to alleviate the suffering of these people. The MiniStry could alleviate that suffering by constructing 4am along the River Athi and in other areas where a lot of water accumulates during the rainy season. I wonder will, the Ministry of. Water Development has norseen the need to construct reservoirs in that area. The functions of that Ministry include planning and formulating policies which would facilitate the supply of water to the people of this country. It appears that this Ministry has not even set its own priorities to determine where there is need for its intervention. When an hon. Member comes to the House with a Motion like this one, is it not really a shame for Ministers to be sitting here with no reports as to what type of projects have been initiated in that area. The Ministry should tell this House what programmes it has to provide water to the people. It should also be able to tell us how many water projects have been initiated, how many of them are operational and how many are not operational, giving us the reasons why those projects are not working. It is disappointing to hear from the Mover of the Motion that they expected to get water from the Nol Turesh Water Project, but the supply from that project was not even extended to Makueni District as planned before. The question is whether the Ministry has gone back to the area and told the people why this has not happened. It is even more worrying indeed to hear that available water supply networks in the area are not functioning? Could the Ministry explain why those little investments are not functioning at all? These are the "white elephants" we keep on hearing about. The Government has invested money in many areas but those investments are of no use to the people. We must get acceptable reasons from the Ministry as to why people are unable to get water. But people cannot accept any reasons because what they want is water. The Ministry should not talk about lack of spare parts, equipment or technicians because what the people want is water and nothing else. What the people want is service from the. Ministry through its programmes. We cannot let people walk many miles looking for water. We should not let our people pay so much money for a drum of water. Ours is a Government which cares about people's needs, and it is for the Ministry to implement its programmes. We know that water is a necessity in all forms of life. The Government should help the people living in those areas where there is no adequate water. Even the Ministry's Water Instute should have a specialised unit to facilitate the fabrication of engines, water pipes and rehabilitation of machinery. The Water Institute must acquire the necessary technology so that what we have in the country will always be functional. We should, be able to acquire spares and maintain the machinery that we have. Spare parts for the machines should available in all districts and divisions. This is the work of the Ministry. They should not leave the maintenance of equipment to suppliers, distributors and businessmen whose major aim is to sell and make money. It is the work of the Ministry to ensure that whatever machinery is imported into the country will remain functional. The Ministry should rehabilitate and modify ageing equipment so that we may benefit from these investments. We have discussed many Private Members Motions in this House on water supply to various constituencies. I moved a Motion here on water in Eldoret South. That Motion was accepted by the Ministry. It is now a year or so since that Motion was accepted by the Ministry, but we do not know what the Ministry has done about the implementation of that Motion. We do not know whether the Ministry has sent people to the place where we had thought water should be tapped. Where we have dams there is water there already. What is needed is to supply that water to the people living in those areas. Some dams are just lying idle. Even the Ministry has not managed to scoop out the silt and soil that has filled the dams. In fact, some of the dams are well over 40 years old and nothing is being done to make them at least clean, say, by clearing the bush around them. Nothing is happening. The silt is just filling up the dams. Now, unless these dams are rehabilitated, soon or later, they will be filled up with silt. So, the Ministry ought to educate the people on what to do. We can do cost sharing in some areas, if funds are not available. With reference to my area, I would like to call upon the Ministry to come up with a Plan, as they agreed when my Motion was passed in the House and accepted with minimum amendments. What plans do they have to tap and supply water from Kipkaren Dam which is nearly complete? I thank the Government for that work which cost over Sh.600 million. We want that water tapped to Eldoret Town and other areas. We also have other dams like Timboroa and other micro-dams. But people cannot get water from those dams. We need equipment, machine and electrification so that piped water can be taken to the homesteads. Now, in order for this development to take place, we need peace, harmony and unity. It is unfortunate that the opposition parties - who have been advocating democracy are now working against democracy. They are the biggest jokers in politics in Kenya today. They are alio the biggest tribalists since their aim now is to get Moi out of power. The issue for them now is not to provide services to the people, or even to create unity, but to remove Moi out of power. That is shame! Every time you read the newspapers, there is nothing good from them. With those few remarks, I beg to second the Motion. </Newspeech>(Question proposed)  <Newspeech>Mr. Mahlhu: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me a chance to contribute on this important Motion. I would like to congratulate my good friend from Makueni for bringing this Motion to the House. Water is a commodity that controls virtually the lives of all living things, human beings and animals included. Without water, life cannot be what it is. Therefore, the Ministry of Water Development should be seen to plan and appreciate the hardships that the country is facing 'in terms of water. It is fitting for us to congratulate His Excellency the President for creating the Ministry of Water Development to handle all problems related, to water. There have been complaints year in year out. Makueni is just an example of what is happening throughput the Republic. In fact, I agree hit hon. Kyonda that it is essential that the Ministry must plan how to restore water daring the rainy season. At the sable time, it is also important for the Ministries' of Water, Agriculture and others to look into possibilities of having joint efforts so that we have a catchment programme to stop water and soil, erosion that goes to the Indian Ocean. We would, like this controlled so that we have 'a better development. Again, the entire tourist industry depends on water. Kenya needs foreign exchange, and today it is accepted that the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife brings in more foreign exchange than any other sector of industry, Therefore, Kenya has become a very Popular destination world-wide in terms of tourists. But more important, this industry can easily die if there is no water. We have said here many times that we need another Mzitna Spring to the Coast. Why do we talk of that? It is because water is not only needed for the tourist industry but also for the people at the Coast. The pipeline that was put up in early 1950s has become too small and due to age it bursts up often. I am sure when the Minister goes to the Coast, he takes his cup of tea from a five-star With!. But it is not strange to find a guest leaving, a five star hotel after staying there for only two weeks due to lack of fresh water. So, those of use who are in the industry get terribly embarrassed due to lack of fresh 'water in 'out 'tourist hotels, Those of us who are involved in this industry get terribly embarrassed from time to time when guests continue to complain of lack of water. We have gone to an extent that guests are now being exploited by people who are putting water in bottle's calling if fresh. I call upon the ministry to investigate those people who are selling water its bottles claiming that it is fresh water, but when you open the bottles you find that it has insects. Our people are being exploit and selling water has now become big business. There are those people who are running around in Mombasa and other towns selling water, and that has now become a big business in those areas. Mr. Temporary Deputy. Speaker, Sir, we are appealing to the Ministry of Water Development to highlight the priorities to help the Government to prepare its programmes. As we understand, there have been financial shortages, but Kenya has a good name worldwide It is very important that the Ministry prepares agenda which can be marketed worldwide in soliciting funds to come and support our our programmes. I am aware that the biggest number of tourists who come to Kenya ,are germans, and, you will remember that recently the German Government allowed Kenya more than Shs.9 million debt reduction on appreciating the situation in which we are today. We congratulate them for helping Kenya to develop even faster. This happened not by accident but because ,those guests who came to this country go back home and say; "Yes, these people need help". Kenya has many friends, worldwide, and this is why in, wildlife preservation we are getting a lot of international support. Thanks to His Excellency the President, who has travelled worldwide putting Kenya on the world map. The Ministry of Water Development, together with the Executive arm. of the Government, cannot let the President down. It is very common these days, when you ask the officials what programmes they have for a certain project, they produce a piece of paper. A piece of paper does not mean anything to anybody; we need researchers who can prepare volumes Of programmes to be marketed overseas. The Executive arm of the Government should wake up and prepare these urgent, projects which wilt not only be important to the industries concerned but to the entire development of human life in Kenya. We, need to create employment by expanding our industries but we cannot expand those industries unless there is water. Water is the commodity which controls everything. So, it goes without saying, that it is very important for the Government, particularly the Ministry of Water Development, to support this Motion entirely. We support the Motion sincerely, and the Ministry must solicit funds to implement it. When we pass a Motion like this, we should ensure that every Where in the rural areas water is available. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if you drive across to Mt. Kenya, you will notice that the water level in Tana River has gone down. We have even been threatened that electricity is going to be rationed because there is no water since the rivers are drying up. These rivers may be drying up because we have allowed everybody .to farm, and irrigate Where Alley should not be irrigating. So, there is need to control soil erosion, which: is the biggest danger threatening this land. Recently in Malindi a lot of hue and cry, vitiate tourist re endangered due to the soil that goes to me sea. It is very important that the Government addresses itself to this problem. With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Water-Development (Mr. Mweu): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to make a few comments on the Motion. On the whole, we have no quarrel with the Motion. Indeed, we are very thankful to the Member of Parliament for Makueni for bringing this Motion, which is very important, particularly with regard to areas which are arid or semi-arid. The Motion has come at the right time. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we know that dams arc possibly the solution to the problems of water shortage. If we can have a series of dams. along, certain rivers, perhaps we would be able to contain the problem of water shortage. Having said that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to propose some amendment to the Motion. .I wish to move that the Motion be amended by deleting all the words appearing after the word "solicit" in the sixth line to the word "water" appearing in the seventh line and insert the word "construct" instead thereof. I also wish to propose that the Motion be further amended, by deleting the full stop at the end and adding the words "as soon as funds are available". Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are doing this because we would like to feel free to look for funds without being directed where to get them from. It is important that we get money but not necessarily from overseas. This Motion is in line with the ultimate goal of my Ministry, which is to take portable water to all corners of this Republic without any discrimination and as soon as is practicable. The Government, through my Ministry, is fully aware of the various problems faced by our people who have not been provided with clean and safe water. However, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is not that the Ministry is not willing to help, nor is it because the Ministry is lazy as somebody has insinuated, but because of the financial constraint affecting the Ministry. It is for this reason that we have not been able to cover all the areas that do not have improved water sources as we would like. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, at times, we have problems which hamper the smooth running of programmes designed to supply water to our, people, particularly in the rural areas where the majority live. However, hon. Members Are aware that the funds given to my Ministry have to be shared between all the districts in the country. In other words, we cannot take all the money that we budget here for the Ministry and heap it in one, two or three districts. We have to spread that money evenly so that every district in the country can at least the presence of the Ministry of Water Development. Therefore, this Motion as amended, as I have said, is very crucial to us. Presently, the Government is solicitating for funds to implement major water supply projects in the country. For example, we have tile Mombasa Water Complex Project at the Coast. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as hon. Mahihu said, we are aware that there is a problem of water shortage at the Coast and in particular Mombasa and I am pleased to say that we have made a lot of progress towards finding a lasting solution to the water shortage problem in this area. We expect to get funds from the World Bank so that we can have Phase II of Msima Water Supply Project started. So, as soon as we get these funds, we shall be able to continue with the construction of the water pipeline to the Coast through Voi where we shall have a "T" joint supplying water to the people around Voi and then onto Mombasa. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when we have been negotiating for these funds from foreign donors for these large scale water project, we have found out that it takes time for us to get the money because donors would like to invest where they are assured of quick returns. This has been the major bottle-neck in getting donor funds. However, we are trying our best and we would like the matter to be left to us so that we can for the time being see what we can do with the money that is budgeted here in supply water to the people in Makueni. Although the hon. Mover said that it is crucial that we supply water in Makueni, there are certain things that do not need a lot of money in this respect. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is this in mind that I have moved this amendment so that the construction of dams in Makueni District can be handled with funds from our Government. I would like to touch on the locations that the hon. Mover has mentioned in Makueni District. First of all, there is Mbitini Location where there is Manoni Dam which is permanent source of water. This. was constructed by the Machakos Integrated Development Programme. After the completion of this dam, there were no funds to supply the water through pipes and. all we are now looking for are funds to supply the water downwards so that people in the lower parts of that location are able to get water without a lot of problems as soon as those pipes are laid. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch on the lower parts of Mbitini, namely, Nzauni Location. We have a dam here which is called Ndolo Dam which also will provide a source of water to people in area around the dam. This will be done by laying pipes as soon as we get some money. I know this will not cost us a lot of money because the water is going to move down by gravity. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have Mavindini Location which does not have a water dam but as the hon. Mover said, there is a possibility of taping water from Athi River to supply the people in this location with water. The survey work for this water project has already been done and completed and it is expected to benefit the whole location. Therefore, there will not be any need at the moment for a dam to be constructed in the location if we are going tap the water from Athi River. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, there is also Kathonzweni, location where we have a dam called Kathoniweni Dam which was constructed by my Ministry in the early 1970s. The Dam serves the area residents throughout the year. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, coming to Wote Location, I would like to say that this location does not have a dam but one has been proposed for construction at a place called Kilungu. After research work has been carried out; a suitable place for constructing a dam has been found at a place called Nzooni and when this dam is completed, water will be able to flow by gravity to the lower areas of this location. Mr. Temporary. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as a result of this run-down of-water projects that my Ministry intends to undertake in Makueni, it is quite evident that the Ministry is highly concerned about the problem of water. in these areas. This is why I am saying that my Ministry will continue to do its best to complete these projects despite the present financial constraints. I have said that through the funds we get from the Ministry, we shall endeavour to do the best we can, particularly in Wote Division, to provide the people with water. 'In the current, budget, it is true that we had not include certain projects because the hon. Mover had not sited these areas, but we have put these proposals in our list of priority projects, and as soon as we are able to get funds, we shall implement them. With those, few remarks, I beg to move. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The, Assistant Minister for Lands and Housing (Mr. Mutiso): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to second this. Amendment. In doing so, I would like to say that in reality, this is not a major amendment. In hid, I would just call it is very minor alteration to the original Motion. I am saying so because it is not seeking to do away with the gist of the Motion which is the construction of Dams. Therefore, I think it is important for the House to support the amendment. Mr. TeMporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, all !Nil is required in this case is to change the priority projects recorded by the Ministry of Water Development as far as Makueni and other areas in Ukambani are concerned. Geographically, when you look at Makueni and sonic other parts of Ukambani, particularly Yalta, you would, find that these areas are cut through two big rivers, that is Tana and Athi Rivers. These rivers draw water from Northern Kenya and takes it to the Indian Ocean and we know that year in year out, this water passes through very fertile land that could be very suitable for irrigation. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think it is time that priorities in Ukambani were geared towards dam construction in future. If we construct dams, we should not be experiencing the problems of drought as is the case today. Some of the areas which have been hit by famine are Makueni, Machakos and Kitui districts. If there were adequate dams capable of harvesting enough rain water during the rain seasons, it would be used in time of need thus eradicating this acute shortage of water. I recommend that the Ministry of Water Development seriously consider damming sections of Athi-River as was done on Tana River. The dams River generate electricity which is supplied to the whole country. However, Athi-River has not been touched although we have the Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authorities which were supposed to carry out such projects as the ones in Tana-River. If Athi-River was dammed so that the flow of water during rainy seasons could be harvested and stored, this Will alleviate soil erosion .tad the flow of water will be checked. In doing so the river banks will not be eroded during the floods and the water will be store. Could the Ministry of Water Development consider damming Athi River so that Malcueni District will be well served by such dams. If that is done this will help the people of Ulcambani in general and electricity will be generated. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, water is essential to all human beings and plants. These dams will not only provide water, but will create a conducive atmosphere for food production under the areas covered by these dams. I am sure the Ministry is taking my point very keenly. The Assistant Minister for Water Development comes from that area and is aware of its aridity. I, therefore, want to recommend to than to help the people of these arid areas especially during this period. The Assistant Minister has indicated that funds cannot only be got from ,overseas and the they can also be got locally. For the past one year, we have been operating our business without any foreign support When the donor countries froze their funds, it is happy to note that our Government has been running for over one year without, those funds. I strongly feel that if priorities are properly placed, funds will be generated locally to constructed these dams. These funds will be enough to create other development projects too. The idea that funds can only be got from overseas should not bog our minds because we can run this country on our own. We should, therefore, reorganize our income earning resources and put our prioritiesright. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister, hon. Leakey was very correct when he said that we can generate funds locally for our own development. This has been proved beyond no doubt for the past one year. I urge the Ministry of Water Development to see to it that as soon as funds are available they should reorganize priorities particularly on water so that things will move smoothly. With those few remarks, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to second. </Newspeech>(Question of the amendment Proposed) <Newspeech>Mr. Malebe: Thank you Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to support this very important Motion. We have an acute water shortage all over Kenya and particularly in Ukambani where hon. Kyonda comes from. Ukambani is semiarid, as the dry zone there covers all that area from Taita-Taveta all the way up to North-Eastern Province and beyond. All we need in the management of water resources is to get the Ministry of Water Development on its toes. I would like hon. Mweu to listen to this because this Motion is addressed particularly to his Ministry. This Ministry should be re-organised to enable it to handle water resources management. When Assistant Minister Mweu was replying to this Motion, he referred to dams that were build in Kathonzweni, Machakos, in 1970. These dams were built by colonialists, during the time of the African Land Development. Very many dams were built during that time, and what we now request is that the Ministry follows the style of the colonialists by constructing dams in every village. Some of the dams that were constructed in those early days have already been silted and forgotten due to lack of maintenance. As a result, there is a water shortage in Wote Division today. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I know that Wote Division is endowed with many dry valley full of sand. We also have Mbooni and Kilungu Hills, which are water catchment areas. If we conserve these hills, there will be more water flowing into Wote and Kibwezi. We should conserve the vegetation on these hills by not cultivating on hill-tops. The other day, when I passed through that area, I found that the hill tops there had all been cultivated and erosion taken its toll, thereby destroying the whole water catchment. If the Ministry of Water Development worked in conjunction with the Ministries of Agriculture and Arid, Semi-Arid and Wastelands, it could conserve those catchment areas and ensure that enough water flows into the areas which are the subject of this Motion. We have the Water Act, and it needs to be amended. I know that we have a Bill here seeking to amend the Act, but the proposals in the Bill portray conflicting interests. If we say, for example, that a borehole should be drilled a kilometre away from the nearest borehole, this will deprive the intended beneficiaries of the chance of having water supplies in their premises. If two adjacent industries here in Nairobi want boreholes and we stick to the one-kilometre distance between boreholes, it will mean that the second industry will not benefit, and yet Nairobi City Commission is not supplying adequate water to the factories here. Therefore, I think the Ministry of Water Development should go back and look into the section amendment to the Water Act which is to be brought to Parliament. The proposed one-kilometre distance between one borehole and the next should be observed only in areas where we have homogeneous ground water reservoirs. With regard to amendment of the Water Act, I have always been stressing the fact that the Ministry should review its management. We have many hydrologists sitting idle in the Ministry of Water Development, just as we have a lot of information which could assist us in developing our water supplies, but all this information is only kept in the Ministry's files instead of using it to publish technical reports, say, hydrological reports, for use by the public. If I require such information from the Ministry today, I will be told that this information has become classified and is not accessible to me. Private consultants are being deprived of access to such records; although they are in files, particularly in the Geology Section of the Ministry. These files are not open to the public although the information they contain is collected using public funds. When the Minister is replying to this Motion, he should tell us whether he will go back and ensure that such information is collected freely without having to seek any permission or authority. When you classify information on water management, it means that you are retrogressing the development of the country. You will find that the contractors and consultants in the Ministry of Water Development have formed apathy between themselves and their private, counterparts, and they always fight for drilling jobs. Since the Ministries contractors and consultants are supposed to oversee the work of their private counterparts, the former are definitely biased. So, I would like the Ministry to set up an independent unit to be in charge of looking into the regulations governing private consultants and contractors. The unit should be specifically under the Water Board because the people in the unit under the Geology Section have personal interests which conflict with those of private consultants and contractors. This unit should have technical officers, including geologists and engineers, doing nothing but regulating relationships among private consultants and contractors. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in trying to get water to Wote Division, we should note that there are Many water sources in the area. The Ministry of Water Development should, 'therefore, carry out subsurface investigations to establish underground water dams. There are many rivers full of sand in the area, and there is underground water in that sand. The areal; also lucky in that it has many racks Therefore, rock catchments should be established to lead into dams. In a smaller scale, the Ministry should also promote rain harvesting in villages to relieve the people of water shortages. The Ministry of Water Development has been making a matter plan for years and years now, and it keeps on reviewing' the plan. However, the Ministry should be specific and': come up with a master plan applicable to the whole of Kenya. Some donors are used to giving money to the Ministry for making a master plan, but this money goes back to those who gave it out because the donors have their co-ordinators and experts involved in our projects. In no case has donors have given out money and the money has gone only into the provision of water in this country. Much money in the Ministry used on studies and more Studies, and, in this way, a lot of it end up in the hands of those who donated it. I think we should 'concentrate on getting only those donations that can be properly used by wananehi. The Ministry has promised to improve Maua Township Water Supply. I know that the Ministry has budgeted this money, but we do not see any action being taken. Maua Township is growing every day, and many ,people have shops there installed with one inch water pipes, but the Ministry has not even gone there to review the planning of Maua Township Water Supply. We have non  governmental organisations (NGOs) that have mortgaged us up to some level. There is one briny constituency, for example, which has really Mortgaged us and the Ministry this not budget for Igembe Constituency because it thinks that this NGO has replaced the Government. I would, therefore, appeal to the Minister to confirm that NGO should not be allowed to mortgage wanachi. Mr. temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,  thank the Mover of this Motion and Support it fully. </Newspeech>(Question, 'that the words to be deleted, be deleted proposed) (Question; that the words to be deleted, be deleted put and agreed to) (Question that the words tote insertedIn place thereof be inserted proposed)(Question, that the words to be insertedin place thereof, be inserted, put and agreed to) (Question of the Motion as amended proposed) <Newspeech>Mr. Ndirangu: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, for giving me this chance to support this important Motion which, is urging the Government to construct slams and water reservoirs in various villages of Makueni District which are mentioned in the Motion. First and foremost I would like to say Mat our Government put put a tot of efforts in saving our rivers. For example, many factories in Nairobi dispose of their waste products into the rivers. Rivers like the one in , Nakuru National Park, have been, contaminated a number of factories in that area dispose their chemicals and aliments into the river. , Many sewerage schemes and factories in many, major of this country do the same thing. Another, good example is, Githurai area In Zimmerman there is a tannery andall its afflaents are disposed of into the Githurai River. The whole of that area is always giving out a very bad smell because of emissions of that river. We have to protect our rivers so that our people can, take water which is not contaminated with, chemicals. Sir, the policy of if you cut down one tree, plant two others has been ignored by, our people. It is high time we took our afforestation programmes seriously. If we are not careful, it’s the near future will have a desert in. Kenya is important that our people do not cut down trees carelessly. It is important that our people do not Cut down trees carelessly and it should; be made compulsory for them to plant more trees after cutting ,down a tree. So our Government should spare no efforts in expanding afforestation programmes. For example, the National Youth Service should play a major role in soil conservation exercises., Our people should also be reminded not to farm in the water catchment or cut down trees without replacing them., I have allot doubt as to whether by the year 2000 we will have taken piped water to all families in Kenya. In a place like Nyeri, which is a municipality, we still do not have water. You will be surprised to note that my constituency is surrounded, by. Rivers Gura and Chania and yet  these is no piped. How can you explain that? In  Nyeri. Town we have, only one water supply project, the ,Kamakwa Water Supply Project, which was completed in 1984. But since 1984 the Population Nyeri Town, the   has risen by more than five times. So, this water supply unable to cope with the demand for water in that town. This is so much so that most of the pipes in Nyeri Town and its environs are, dry. There were arrangements by local authorities to negotiate a loan, to, the tune, of shs2 million with the World Bank. I do not know what about these negotiations because we have not heard a word from the Ministry of Local Government. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in Nyeri there is a continuing water project. It is called Njeng'u Water Project, which is on the northern part of Nyeri. That project is lucky because, we received about shs500,000/- from the Canadian Government to construct the water intake at the Aberdares. We have constructed the water intake, but we do not have money for pipes. So, I would appeal to the Ministries of Water Development and Local Government to provide the residents of Njeng'u with pipes Co that we can get that water into our homes. If this project is completed it will benefit Kimathi Institute of Technology, which is facing an acute shortage of water, a major Catholic seminary, the residents of Muringato and all the primary and secondary schools in this region. Water is important for the continuity of good political environment and even the thriving of the economy. The Ministry of Water Development should ensure that our people are supplied with piped water. If this requires money which would not be available I would appeal to the Ministry to make use of ground water. There is a lot of ground water and it is important that we sink wells and install water pumps for use by the people. For example, there two very dry regions in my constituency called Nyaribo and Gachika where we have a serious water problem. I urge the Ministry of Water Development to provide us with only two water pumps so that we can provide water to over 4,000 people in this part of my constituency. ,Early this year, the Ministry promised to provide a water pump to the residents of Nyaribo and to this regard, I have raised two Questions over two times here in Parliament requesting the Ministry to provide a water pump to this area. But the answers I have been getting are "if funds become available." I would like the Ministry to honour its promise so that our people can get sufficient water. Makueni District is a dry area with a lot of potential for agriculture and apart from constructing dams in this area, it is the wish of our people that irrigation projects</Newspeech> <Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi): Your time is up, Mr. Ndirangu. Mr. Ndirangu With those few words, Sir, I beg to support  the Motion. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Information and Broadcasting (Mr. Kachila): Nakushukuru, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipatia wakati huu ili nami niiunge mkono Hoja hii. Kwanza kabisa, ningependa kumshukuru mhe. Kyonda kwa kuwasilisha Hoja hii inayozungumzia juu ya shida zinazozikumba sehemu kame hapa nchini kama vile, Makueni, Voi Division na kadhalika. Schemu hizi zinahitaji msaada mkubwa kutoka Wizara ya Ustawi wa Maji. Naona kwarnba inafaa Wizara mbili zije pamoja iii kuzisaidia sehemu hizi. Lakini kabla sijasema hivyo, ningependa kusema kwamba jambo muhimu ambalo Wizara ya Ustawi wa Maji ingefikiria sasa na ambalo limetiliwa mkaso na mwenye kuwasilisha Hoja hii, ni kujenga mabwawa katika sehemu hizi kame. Kama Wizara hii ingekuwa inafanya utatiti wakati huu wa kiangazi katika sehemu hizi, basi wangeona ukweli wa mambo na watigekubaliana na maoni ya Wabunge kutoka sehemu hizo. Sasa ndio wangeenda huko na kujionea vile mambo yalivyo kuhusti ukosefu wa maji. Ukame unaokumba sehemu za Makueni, Taita-Taveta na kwingineko ni wa hali ya juu. Njaa nayo imezikumba sehemu hizi sana. Hata ukipata unga, huwezi kuutumia bila maji; itakuwa kifo pia.. Kwa hivyo, kitu cha muhimu sana ni maji. Tungependa Wizara ya Ustawi wa Maji na Wizara inayoshughulikia sehemu kame, washirikiane kifedha ili wajenge mabwawa kwa sababu kipindi cha mvua kiko tayari sasa. Huu ndio wakati ambao ingcfaa wajenge mabwawa. Wizara hizi zikishirikiana, itakuwa vizuri kwa sababu moja ya Wizara hii inawajibu wa kuzitumikia sehemu kame:, Tunataka jambo hili lichukuliwe kama la dharura ili waanze kujenga mabwawa katika sehemu hizi. Tunatarajia mvua nyingi hivi karibuni kwa sababu lunaona dalili kupitia ukame ulioko sasa na jua linalopiga kwa half ya juu: Tusipoangalia vizuri, ardhi nyingi  itasombwa baharini. Mabwawa haya yakijengwa, itakuwa njia moja ya kuzuzia mmonyoko wa udongo. Ningependa kusema kwamba, sijaona shida kubwa ya maji kama ile inayoikumba sehemu ya Voi kwa wakati huu. Mifereji ambayo iliwekwa wakati wa ukoloni kuleta maji kutoma Mwamsha, imekauka na watu wanapata taabu sana. Hakunamaji pia katika sehemu za Kasigau na Mbololo nzima. Mifugo inapata taabu na watu wanapata taabu zaidi na hata watoto wanashindwa kwenda shuleni kwa sababu ni lazima watafute maji kwanza. Hakuna uhai bila maji. Hivi ndivyo mambo yalivyo na ningeiomba Wizara ya UStawi wa Maji iangalie sehemu hii ya Voi Division ambayo imekumbwa na ukosefu wa maji kwa muda mrefu. Jambo lingine ni kwamba kuna chuo kimoja huko Taita-Taveta ambacho tayari kinatoa.maji yake kutoka Mto Mwamsha. Inaonekana kwamba chuo  hiki kikitoa maji yake kutoka mto huu, hakitaendelea kwa sababu mto huu si wa kudumu; unakauka kila wakati. Tungependa chuo hiki kipewe maji kutoka laini ya Mzima Springs. Hii itakuwa suluhisho ya kudumu katika  upande wa maji. Hata survey imefanywa tayari na tunatoa maoni yetu kwa sababu tunajua sehemu hizi sana. Kwa hivyo, naiombd I Wizara hii, kupitia mhandisi wao hula) Voi, ikiiaidie chuo hiki iii kipate maji. yake kutoka Mzima Springs na sio kutoka Mto Mwamsha. Ningependa kusema machache kuhusu chemi chemi ambazo zinatoa maji kwa wingi na sasa zinakauka. Chemi chemi hizi zinakauka kwa sababu sebemu za misitu zinaanza kukatwa. Tusipolinda chemi chemi zilizoko sasa, sehemu nyingi zitakuwa majangwa kaina vile mhe. Ndirangu alivyosema. Msitu wa Mbololo unasaidia katika utoaji wa maji mengi sana lakini inalaa wale wanaohusika na jambo hili wawe na ujuzi fulani. Inaba wasielekeze maji kwenda upande mwinginc kutoka chemi chemi yenyeWe bali wayaongoze na wayashikilie mbali na pale yanayotoka. Hui ni kwa sababu ikiwa chemi chemi itainguliwa na mazingara yake kuchafuliwa, basi itakauka. Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, mto huo hupata maji kutoka msitu wa Mbololo. Kwa hivyo. ningciomba Idara ya Misitu ihakikishe kwamba watu hawaikati misitu hii. Yafaa sheria kali ipitishwe kuilindd misitu yetu. Yafaa iwe sheria iii kwamba wale wanaopeWa leseni kukata mill wawe wakipanda miti hata ishirini bandit ya 'kukata mil minoja. Hii ni kwa sababu watataka mbao baadaye. Ni lazima vile vile kuhakikishwe kwamba wale wanaokata mil ya kuterigeneza mbao hawakati miti hiyo kwenye sehemu za chemi chemi. Hii ni kwa sababu miti huchukua muda mrefu kukomaa. Ukiicata mti ambaci una uniri wa miaka 30 yafaa ufahamu kwamba miti ile mingine :mbar utapanda itachukua miaka 30 kukomaa. Kwa hivyo ni-lazima Wizara zote zinazohusika ziweke mash: rti makali kuhakikisha kwamba sehemu zinazotoka maji haziharibiwi na wale Wanaokata miti. Ni lazima sheria maalumu ipitishwe ili kuzilinda seherriu zinazotoa inaji. BW. Naibu Spika wa Muda, utaona  kwamba chemi cliemi za 'Mzitna sizipoangaliwa vizuri zinaweza kuangamizv,ia. Ikiwa watu wataruhusiwa kulisha "mifugo yao icaribu na Mzima Springs, mimi nina hofu kwamba hizo chemi chemi huenda pia zikahatarishwa. Tungeiomba Wizara ya Utalii na Wanyama a Porini iagize idata inayolitisika iweke ulinzi maalumu kuzilinda chemi chemi za Mzima. Hii ni kwa sababu Mungu alitupatia hizo chemi ch  ili tuweze kuwa na maji ya kutosha. Kwativyo tusipo uwa waangalifu hizo chemi chemi zitaharibiwa kabisa. VVakati mmoja nilipokuwa nikizungumza na Director of Wildlife, aliniambia kwamha yeye mwenyewe ana hofu kwamba wale watu ambao wameachiliwa wawe wakilisha wanyama wao huenda wakahatarisha chemi chemi hizo za Mzima. Ni lazima Wizara ya Maji ianze kutayarisha mipango kuzilinda chemi chemi hizo. Namshukuru Waziri kwa kusema kwamba watu wa sehemu za Mbololo, Voi, na Kasigau watapata maji kutoka mfereji wa pili wa Mzima. Nasema hivi kwa sababu italcuwa'si haki vitu vitolewe kwangu na mimi nikose kunufaika navyo. Namshukuru Waziri kwa kutushirikisha katika mpango huo. Hii ni kwa sababu maji yote yanayopelekwa Mombasa yanatoka kwenye Mzima. Springs, lakini Witaita hawanyi maji hayo. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi): We have only two minutes left before the Mover is called upon to reply. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Technical Training and Applied Technology (Mr. Thuo): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for sympathising with me. I have been standing to catch the Speaker's Eye and I am happy I have caught it. I will utilise those two minutes. I take this opportunity to thank the Mover of this Motion because it is a very important Motion. The area he is speaking about is a dry area and I think he is justified to bring this kind, of Motion to the House. The Assistance ,this Motion is seeking is justified and I am sure that the. House will pass the Motion so that it is implemented as soon as possible. There are problems relating to shortage of water in many areas of this country. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Ministry of Water Development for initiating the greater Kigwno Water Project. That project is in my constituency. They did advertise in the Kenya Times of 20th May, 1992, that they  are looking for 'contractors through disqualification and that process has been going on for some time now. I am sure that they must have identified the contractors and I would urge the Ministry very humbly, on behalf of the Kigumo people who have been waiting for this water for very many years, to ensure that a contractor is appointed as soon as possible and be put on site so  that the constituency which is a very hilly area can start getting water, Definitely the lower area of the constituency is very dry and requires water as soon as  possible. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank you for those two minutes. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi): It is now time for the Mover, to reply. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kyonda; Mr. TeMporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, first of all I would, like to thank, the Minister for agreeing, although in general terms, with this Motion. But I am not so happy about the way Motion has been amended particularly that bit which says "as soon as funds available." We know that that expression has been I used, sometimes, to kind of shelf some important Motions for life. I hope this is get going to be the case with this particular Motion. I want to thank my honourable colleagues for supporting this Motion. This is because we are talking about serious realities in this part of the country where like somebody said there is shortage of water and food and sometimes you do not know what should come first You may manage to get some little maize or unga only to find that there is no water. Some schools pay about KShs.40/- or KShs.50/- only for one drum of water We have a district hospital at Makueni. I am sad to say that the hospital is stinking because of lack of water. You can imagine what the situation is like in the maternity ward if there is no water to wash the linen. Sometimes people have to lake water to their patients in the hospital. Sometimes this becomes a business at the expense of those who are suffering and those who have come from very far. The hospital is in a wry, very bad shape because of lack of water. With adequate water we could increase the number of tree nurseries that we have. If dams are constructed there we could establish several tree nurseries near each dam and this would boost our afforestation efforts in that area. We ask people to plant trees but you will find that the seedlings have to be brought from very far and by the time they reach that place some of them have died. We want to thank the Government for creating a new district, Makueni. With that came the new district headquarters  Wote. This new district headquarters is growing very fast. This is because many Government workers are being posted there. Also some non-Governmental Organizations have opened offices in that Area. If there is no water for the hospital then it is obvious  that the ordinary people in the new district headquarters are facing serious problems. The Ministry does not seem to have any plans to supply sufficient water to the new district headquarters. Mr. Speaker even the Assistant Minister is not listening to this. He is not even taking notes and up to this time he has not even paid attention, that the new district headquarters at Wote is in serious shortage of water and the Ministry does not seem to have plans as little as I know. Mr. this is something the. Ministry should address itself to urgently. If there is a shortage Of water in a hospital then it is even much more serious-for the ordinary wananchi in the new district. Some of them have come from places where water is not a problem and they come in here where they have to buy water from the river bed or go and draw it themselves. So they are to pay a lot of money. This makes their morale for working go down Mr. Speaker. M. a district headquarter we are bound to have factories coming up soon or latter and without water then, this is not anything for us to think about. We have a new division at Matiliku and as I am saying, when there is a problem in the headquarters, there will be more in the division. Mr. Speaker, we would like to thank the government for constructing Manooni Dam on the top of the hill. An Assistant Minister said that it is not finished, we would like the Ministry to come in and finish up the Dam! I don't think it is a lot of money is required to finish up with pipes and everything. So that the people can benefit and the Ministry should also pay attention to the fact that the water is coming from Manooni and is feeding people who are down but those who are up on the hill don't seem to be benefitting a lot. I would ask the Ministry to ask those who are constructing the darn to come up with the project of water catchment. I could be simple through women groups and it could be very cheap Mr. Speaker. Now we heard of a dam construction unit in Eastern Province, so we are looking for this construction unit and it does not seem to be anywhere. If we had a dam construction unit in this new district it would go a long way to alleviating the water shortage problem we have in this area. Mr. Speaker, the question of soil erosion can be fought a lot, I won't say adequately. If there are people travelling for a kilometre or two to fetch water other than cows, animals like donkeys and so on going for over 20 kilometres to a water point on the other side and when it rains causes a serious soil erosion. Mr. Speaker, I want to submit the Ministry that the chiefs acts should be used to make sure that people who shambas in sloppy areas dig terraces. And this is for their own good. Like somebody else said, the Arthi River, which comes along down below where we are should be used but it does not seem to have been used by TARDA, neither does it seem to have been touched at all for giving us water. If this was done people would benefit a lot. We know there is no enough money but then there should be priority when we talk of water, and particularly where it does not exist or where it is in serious shortage, like in Wote Division, I would ask the Ministry to come around and help the Nyayo people who are there to develop. We have said that with a big dam and irrigation, horticulture and even food would be produced in large quantity because the soil is fertile. With this few remarks Mr. Speaker, I hope the Ministry is not going to shame this motion and is going to come up with a master plan to provide adequate water to the people of Wote. For their consumption, animals and even for irrigation. What I am saying is that with big dams our animals can get enough water and we can also practice irrigation for food production. With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the Motion.                        (Question of the Motion as amended put and agreed to) Resolved accordingly:- THAT, while appreciating the Government efforts to provide clean piped water to all Kenyans both for domestic and animal consumption; and noting with concern that the residents, of Wote Division, formerly Makueni, experience acute water shortage, particularly during the dry seasons; and realising that a lot of water goes to waste during the rains and which if properly harvested could alleviate their problems; this House urges the Government to construct dams (reservoirs) in lower Mbitini lower, Nzaui, Wote, rriavindini, Kathenzweni and Kalawa locations of Makueni District as soon as funds are available, </Newspeech><Header>SETTLEMENT SCHEMES ALONG RIVER TANA</Header><Newspeech>Mr. Saha: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the following Motion:- THAT, in view of the effects of severe drought on the residents of Garissa District, whose mainstay of economy is livestock; and while appreciating the Government's efforts and concern in providing food to the drought victims; this House urges the Government to solicit funds locally and , internationally in order to; set up settlement Schemes along the River Tana so as to change the nomadic habits of the in the area by encouraging them to grow food and cash crops by means of irrigation. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is a known fact that Larissa District has experienced a severe drought for the last three, years or so, As, hon, Members are aware, the districts mainstay of economy is livestock and when there is drought naturally, livestock, is the one, which is affected and people lose a lot of livestock. 80 per cent of the population of the district are nomads who  move from one placed to another looking for green pastures and water.Garissa is a very large district. It is not only this one which is affected by drought; many districts in this country have been similarly affected. However, at the moment my main ,concern is Garissa District which, besides the drought, has, experienced a lot of influx of refugees since the Government of Somalia fell apart. Mr, Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the River Tana is the biggest one in this country, and, it flows along Garissa District. In fact, the river forms the boundary of Tana River and Garissa districts; flowing along for nearly 300 kilometres. Before the drought Garissa had, over one million cattle, over two million sheep and goats, over 500,000 camels and more than 100,000 donkeys. Today Orate figures ,are not there. Virtually everybody who has been keeping animals in that district is a. destitute today. Many people have flocked into refugee camps in search of food, water and clothing because all their assets, which were in form of livestock, have perished. Garissa being a semiarid area has had very high temperatures. The mean annual rainfall was between 300 and 500 millimetres per year. We have not been able to exploit River Tana which flows through this district which is known to be a highly agricultural potential area Today about 1,200 hectares of land in the district, is Under irrigation along the Tana River. You cannot imagine that the citrus fruits that are , produced in that area, such as banangs, papaws, water melons and so on are' exported to London a few years back. Along, with these, maize and, beans are also grown there. Mr. Temporary Deputy speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Government for the good work it has done in supplying relief food to drought victims. However, much more needs to be done in this area. I would like to thank the United Nations High Commission for refugees for assisting thousands of Somalia refugees who have come to this country and are currently camping in Garissa, District. Today, over 500,000 refugees are camping in Garissa District. I also wish to Thank the Muslim and Christian Organizations as well as other organizations such as the non-governmental organizations who hate come to the of Kenyans who have fallen victims of the drought. However, the question here is for how long are these organizations continue assisting the Kenya drought victims? The answer to that question is that they cannot continue doing that for much longer now. This is because they have limited resources and we cannot therefore expect them to continue assisting, those people for ever. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker: Sir, this is why I have brought this Motion to the House so that these people, can be provided with an alternative source of livelihood. As you know, livestock are always affected to, drought just as crops are; but River Tana being the largest river in Kenya, has not been fully exploited This water is flowing into the Indian Ocean and although many, districts have benefited in the upper and lower Tana, Gatissa District is yet to benefit from this water that has continued to flow down to the Indian Ocean. If this was used for irrigation in Garissa District this would encourage the residents of the area not to fully rely on livestock for their livelihood. Today, you find, that many children in this area have abandoned school to accompany their nomadic parents Who fully rely on livestock for their livelihood. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Bura Irrigation Scheme in Tana.  River, has benefited tile residents of that area quite a lot. afraid to say that this scheme is not serving the purpose for which it was established. This is because the nomadic population has threatened the iconological set up of the district through over grazing which has brought about soil erosion. So if our people could also be advised to reduce the number of livestock to a minimal reasonable number and also revert to other means of livelihood like growing crops, I am sure they would, not only produce enough for themselves, but also for export. Farmers should be encouraged to do mixed farming. We all know that the semiarid areas in northern Kenya, constitute a high beef potential in this country. In fact, these areas arc supplied beef to the rest of the country. However, I am saying that since these areas are prone to drought, our people should be encouraged to grow crops alongside rearing livestock. The Ministry of Regional Development and the Ministry of Agriculture in conjunction with the Ministry of Reclamation and Development of Arid and SemiArid Wastelands should assist these drought stricken victims. Over 10,000 families have moved from the areas surrounding Garissa and are currently living in darissa Town. Their situation is worse than that of refugees. The people are hungry and suffering although the Government and Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO's) have provided them with food. We cannot rely on famine relief as an everlasting solution to this problem. I wish to congratulate His Excellency the President for the recent visits he made to that areas to see the plight on the people in that area. This has boosted the morale of the residents in that area and assured them that the Government is minding their welfare. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to castigate Mr. Mwai Kibaki, the leader of DP, because he said that President Moi's visits to North-eastern Province was a waste of public funds. Although thousands of Kenyans are dying from famine His Excellency the President made an initiative to provide these people with the necessary assistance when he visited them. Why should the man calling himself the head of a political party a would be President of Kenya  say that President Moi has wasted public funds? That out rightly indicates that the head of that party does not have the interests of the nomadic community in Kenya at heart. The people of that area have made their stand very clear as regards the party they belong to. They do not even know who Mwai Kibaki is nor do they recognize him. They only recognize the ruling party Kanu and His Excellency the President. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Garissa has got a population of over 200,000 people of whom 80 per cent live in the rural area and so the only way we can guarantee the future of these people is to have a permanent settlement for them. Soil surveys have been done along River Tana and the results showed that the whole area is very fertile like any other area in Western or Central Provinces. We planted coffee to find out whether it can do well although it withered after a few months. We were fully convinced that if proper care was taken, it could grow. The Ministry should not underrate our district. The Ministry's officers should go there and see the plight of these people. If resources are pumped into this area, a lot of cash crops can be grown. Many NGO's and international agencies particulary the African Muslim Agency are willing to assist such programmes. The Government should, therefore, take up this matter with all the seriousness it deserves and ensures that the people in that area benefit from the river's natural resources. With those few remarks, I beg to move. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Falana: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to second this very important Motion. I say that the Motion is important because it deals with livestock, and pastoralists and nomads are the less privileged lot in Kenya. The group of people needs more attention, concern and sympathy from the Government. Of late, nomads, particularly in northern Kenya, have had many misfortunes in the form of drought and banditry. These people have really had it very rough. Drought is God made and we cannot blame the Government nor the system for it. In the case of banditry, however, with more concern and proper arrangement, it could be lessened. When you lifetime earning and inheritance, such as camels and goats, vanishes overnight, you are left almost lifeless. This is very bad, and the Government should exercise more concern in this regard. I am not saying that the Government has never had any concern in this respect nor neglected any area, -but I think more concern should be assumed perhaps in terms of re-stocking these people with the cattle that they have lost through banditry. Cattle keeping is the only life that these people know, and it is very difficult to change people's lifestyle overnight. Changing people from pastoralists into business people or farmers is not all that easy, and the best the Government could do is to re-stock them and bringing them back their livelihood. The second point relates to re-settling these people. Famine relief is not really a long term nor a permanent solution to these people's problems. It is very temporary. Providing famine relief to thousands of families which have lost their stock through drought and banditry is not really a solution. In fact, it is even more expensive to the Government and the people it is meant for than would otherwise be the case. You may be surprised to hear that a good number of the refugee camps in Kenya today are actually Kenyans. Let us not cheat ourselves that all the refugees in refugee camps are from Ethiopia or Somalia: they are Kenyans who have no other choice. They have lost their herds and their only source of food is the famine relief provided by the Government and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). What would you do if you saw that your only chance of survival was to join a refugee camp? You would, under any name, go ahead and join the camp. It would not matter whether you were called a Somali or an Ethiopian refugee provided you survived materially. It is embarrassing to observe that Kenyans can go so low as to become refugees in their own land. Therefore, although we appreciate the concern of the Government and NGOs in providing famine relief, this is only a very temporary solution. It would do the residents of this country more honour and give them better life if the 300-kilometre water stretch that goes to waste in the sea was put into some use. If a settlement scheme is established in Garissa, it will not benefit only the people of Garissa: it will benefit not only northern Kenya but also other parts of Kenya that need assistance. So, a scheme to help these people is very .important and need to be given top consideration. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, while we think of establishing a new scheme I think at this stage it is very important to also comment on a scheme that is as good as "dead". Billions of shillings have been put into the Hola Irrigation Scheme, but today it is a total failure. It is a failure in the sense that all the spare parts for the pumps and machines are only available from New Zealand. Whenever repairs are needed the Kenya Government has to pay flying and hotel expenses for an expert to carry out the repair in addition to the cost of the repair itself. In fact, whenever a pump breaks down the cost we go into is enough to buy a new pump. I think this is, perhaps, due to lack of foresight in the Ministry. We have heard about very many times from the hon. Member for the area, Hon. Galgallo. I recall, him even at one time calling the former Minister for Regional Development, Mr. Midika, names over that project. I think there is some negligence, or laxity, in the Ministry in connection with this project. May be the position is as it is because the project is intended for a population in the dry zones which does not country very much. It is very painful to see resources which can be used to uplift the economy of this country going to waste. Perhaps, the attitude is that all those who live in Northern Eastern Kenya are bandits and it does not matter whether they survive or perish. Perhaps, some people in responsible positions in this system do not care. If only some responsible elements in the system considered the people concerned as fellow Kenyans, who are brothers and sisters the situation would have been different. Use of the gravitation in the supply of water would have been simple. But I know the story is always that it is very costly and there is no money for it. While I do not want to contradict the Motion I am seconding, if the existing project is not helping Kenyans it would appear we are making fun by thinking of initiating a new project. Therefore, while supporting the establishment of this other scheme as per the Motion I would also like to take this opportunity to ask the Ministry concerned to addressed itself very seriously </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Arte: (inaudible). </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Falana: Well, hon. Arte, it is not easy for the system to put nomads, who understand the situations, in charge of Ministries. But we want those who have been put in positions to understand. With those few remarks, I be to second. </Newspeech>(Question proposed) <Header>ADJOURNMENT </Header><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker: Hon. Members, it is time for interruption of the business of the House. The House is, therefore, now adjourned until this afternoon at 2.30 pm. The House rose at 12.30 p.m. </Newspeech>
