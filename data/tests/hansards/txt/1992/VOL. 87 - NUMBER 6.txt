Mainye, TE No. 020435, will be paid her total dues for 1989/90.Mr. Deputy Speaker: Anybody from the Ministry of Agriculture to respond? None. Next Question.<i>Question No. 162</i><Header>Payment of Mr. Chopkut's Dues</Header>Dr. Misoi asked the Minister for Labour :-(a)	when Mr. Kiprono Chopkut of Kerita Farm, formerly employed by F.D.M. Erskine Ltd., N.S.S.F. No. 576004292, I.D. No. 4897002/67, will be paid his retirement benefits; and(b)	what recall system does the Ministry operate in order to keep the members fully informed on their claim requirements.<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Labour (Mr.Maina): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.A cheque for payment of Mr. Kiprono's claim is ready and is here with me. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do appreciate and I am very happy indeed to the hon. Assistant Minister whom I thought was new in the Ministry. He has done a very good job. Thank you very much. I will take it personally to the person concerned</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Would I be in order to request the Assistant Minister to hand over the cheque directly to the hon. Questioner now? It may not be there. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Maina: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will do that in. my office. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: But most seriously, my own mind is not' very clear as to whether die hon. Assistant Minister should hand over the cheque directly to the hon. Questioner or should lay it on the Table? I invite hon. Members comments on that I think the proper procedure should be to lay it on the Table. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the normal practice is that whatever is laid on the Table is the property of the House and is kept in safe custody. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Indeed, Mr. Mwamzandi, you are quite right on that I do not think the Chair wishes to encourage the practice of handing over documents across in the House. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I quite agree with you. But if ,the cheque is laid on the Table and becomes the property of the House, then I may not be able to take it to the owner. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: But hon. Mwamzandi was quite right. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I believe the Assistant Minister has a written answer to this Question and the cheque is part of the answer, and I should have received it together with my copy. So I do not have to go to collect it from his office!Mr. Deputy Speaker. Well, the Chair remains satisfied that the cheque will find its way into your hands, Dr. Misoi, and pass it over to the owner. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Momanyi: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. This is the first time I have seen a cheque being passed over to the Questioner in this House. Is that really in order? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>Mr. Maina: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I said, I will give it in my office. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Would the Assistant Minister be kind enough to direct me to his office? I do not know where the office is situated. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Order, Dr. Misoi! Certainly, that is in bad taste! Let us go to Mr. Ndirangu's Question. </Newspeech><I>QUESTION NO. 190 </I><Header>Bura Dispensary Staff Houses</Header>Mr. Arte, on behalf of Mr. Salat, asked the Minister for Health:-(a)	if he is aware that the contractor of Bura dispensary's staff houses abandoned the project in 1990;(b)	what action the Ministry has taken against the contractor; and(c)	when this project will be completed.<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Health (Mr. Ogur): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a)	Yes.(b)	The Ministry terminated the contract on 25th April, 1991, after issuing several notices which were not responded to by the contract.(c)	Plans are already underway to provide funds during the financial year 1992/93, for the completion of the project</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Arte: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister tell us how much money is earmarked for the completion of this project? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, at that time the contract sum for two staff houses type 'F' was Shs.599,935/-, and the date of commencement should have been April, 1988, with expected date of completion being 22nd September, 1989. However, we shall have to retender for this project</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Arte: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Since 1989 is a long time. Staff of Bura Dispensary have no staff houses. How much money have they earmarked for the completion of this project during the coming financial year? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me speak slowly for the hon. Member to understand me. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker. Order, Mr. Ogur! Talk at your speed! </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sure the amount has gone up from the original figure which was Shs.599,935/-. We are going to retender and get a reasonable bidder. We are prepared to complete that project during this financial year. <Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am a little bit conversant with the tendering procedures and the allocation of funds. The procedure here is to allocate money as the tenders come" in and you will therefore have a set figure to spend even before you send out the tenders. This is the figure we asking the Minister to tell us. We want to know how much was earmarked for this particular dispensary? The contractor ought really to have quoted within a given figure and this is the figure we want the Minister to tell us. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have already quoted the figure that we had set aside which was Shs.599,935/-. However, due to the delay in starting the project, we shall have to put in an additional amount which has already been catered for. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Arte: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are not asking the Assistant Minister to tell the us the amount of money allocated to this dispensary in 1989 but rather, we want to know from him how much money has been set aside for the completion of this dispensary in 1992/93 financial year. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the figure is comprised of the amount I have quoted, plus an additional amount which we have to put in due to the delay in starting the project</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Arte: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I am not satisfied that the Assistant Minister is not evading the question. Could he tell this House, out of the amount he says that was allocated to this dispensary in 1989, how much was left .and how much was given to the contractor? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the contractor absconded before he could start the work and therefore, we did not give him any money. This money is still available and we will only put in an additional amount to complete the dispensary. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Arte: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister really in order to mislead this House? I know that half of the building has been completed and he cannot say here that the contractor absconded before starting the work and that therefore, no money was given to him. I know that this contractor did some work because the building has a roof on it and therefore, he must have been given some money. Is the Assistant Minister in order to mislead the House? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, when this contractor absconded, we did not pay him any money and I am saying now that we are going to put in an additional amount to complete the bit that is remaining uncompleted. We shall have to issue tenders for the completion work and that will be all. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Mr. Ogur, perhaps you could address yourself to part (b) of the Question which specifically asks what action the Ministry has taken against the contractor. I think that is the pointhon. Arte is trying to make. He is saying that the contractor must have been paid some money, but you are saying that he was not paid anything. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the contractor was not paid anything because he broke the contractor and we have the law in this country which will take its course. This contractor wasted our time and we shall follow up the matter with a view to having the law takes its course. With regard to the completion of the project, I have already said that money has been set aside and with an additional amount, we shall be able to complete it. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Arte: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the hon. Assistant Minister really in order to deliberately evade the question? This particular Assistant Minister is fond of pushing the House the way he wants and this is a very bad habit. I am asking him to tell the House, out of the shs.599,935/- allocated for the completion of this dispensary in 1989, how much of it was the contractor given and how much is remaining. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have already said that nothing was paid to the contractor and therefore, the amount that was. originally set aside, that, Shs.599,935/- is still there. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Mr. Ogur, are you actually saying that this contractor was not paid for the amount of work that he did up to the level the hon.Member is talking about? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Deputy Speaker,Sir, I am saying that this contractor disappeared and could not be traced. How can you pay somebody who has disappeared and has not even come to you to make a claim. We have looked for this contractor but we cannot get him and . </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Order Mr. Ogur! The contention here is that this particular contractor actually did some work. Perhaps what you should indicate is to whether he did submit any completion certificates or some kind of documents to enable you to pay him. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we cannot pay anybody who did not do any work. There was no completion certificate and for this reason, we could have paid him. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: We must now move on to Mr. Momanyi's Question because we must complete the bit on Questions before 9.30 a.m. and the Chair will have to be very strict on this because we do not want the time catch up with us. </Newspeech><i>Question No.241</i><HEADER>PAYMENTS TO NYAMIRA TEA FARMERS</HEADER>Mr. Momanyi asked the Minister for Agriculture: -(a) what has delayed thepayment of Mr. Orina Rabago, Tea Grower N1.TE 020316, from 1985 to April 1992 and when he will be paid, and(b) when will Mrs. Zipporra K. Mainye, TE No.020435, be paid her total dues for 1989/90. <Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: The Minister for Agriculture is not present? The Question will have to be deferred. </Newspeech>(Question deferred)<Header>Question No.204</Header><HEADER>TARMACKING FOOT PATHS IN NYERI</HEADER>Mr. Ndirangu asked the Minister for Local Government whether he could consider tarmacking the road path that links Kingongo Estate and Majengo to enable workers who walk on foot easy access during the rainy season. <Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Local Government (Mr. Mbori): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Currently, the Nyeri Municipal Council has no funds to tarmac the foot paths in question. However, the council has already constructed concrete footpaths liking Kingongo Estate and Majengo through Kiawara and Shaiiriyako at an estimated cost of Kshs.200,000/-</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ndirangu: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for that answer, could he tell this House whether they intend to tarmac the footpath that links the River Chania and Kingongo Estates. I am asking this because the Ministry has done very little work on the path linking Shauriyako and Majengo. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mbori: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member knows that Majengo Estates is a very old estate whose constructional work was carried out in the 1940s. The Ministry considers it too expensive to construct these foot paths as the hon. Member is asking. It would cost the Nyeri Municipality, something to the tune of shs.3 million to tarmack these footpaths linking the two estates. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister confirm to the Hbuse-whether the foothpath linking Majengo and Kingongo is being used by wananchi and yet he turns around and says that it is going to be very expensive to tarn\pc the foot-path. How does he expect wananchi to move between the two estates? To fly? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mbori: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, accoding to available information, wananchi have no problem in using the foot path in its present condition. At the moment, the Nyeri Municipality has given priority to other roads which are of more service to wananchi. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ndirangu: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am the Member of Parliament for Nyeri Town and most of the times when I am visiting my constituents I use this path. So, I speak with authority when I say that that path is impassable when it is raining. There are gullies all over when it is raining because of soil erosion. So, the Assistant Minister should not tell this House it is too expensive to improve this path because shs3 million is a lot of money. This road links Nyeri Town with Kingongo Estate, one of the most important estates in Nyeri. If we were to compute the amount of services charge paid by businessmen and tenants in Kingongo Estate Shs.3 million would be very little money. Can the Assistant Minister promise this House that they are going to improve this path so that wananchi can move easily to town? If this path is not tarmacked it will give us. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Mr. Ndirangu, can you put your question? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ndirangu: Can the Assistant Minister promise this House that he will improve this road as soon as possible? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mbori: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the fact that the hon. Member is the Member of Parliament for Nyeri Town is not disputable. But we are also a Ministry in charge of areas in Nyeri and we go by priorities. I will not promise that we shall do some improvements on this particular road because as far as I know King'ong'o Estate is a site and service scheme project. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The hon. Member is, indeed, competent to argue on this point because he says he uses the footpath. Is the Assistant Minister telling the House that he favours to improve roads. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Dr. Misoi, are you satisfied that that is, indeed, a point of order? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: Yes, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, yes I am wondering whether the Assistant Minister is in order this House that this is not a priority when the Ministry is supposed to be servicing the less able. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Dr. Misoi, are you satisfied that that, indeed, a point of order? On that score I overrule you because you are really putting a supplementary, which you cannot really be seen to do. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is a point of order. Is the Assistant Minister in order to mislead the House that the Ministry cannot improve this road when the road is needed by the people? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Dr. Misoi, I will overrule you; that is not a point of order! </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has said that they cannot tarmac this footpath which, I think is normal, but could they not put murrain on it and make it passable? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mbori: Yes, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that can be done and is being done. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Mr. Wakole's Question for the second time. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Arte: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I ask Question No. 237 I wish to apologise on behalf of Mr. Wakole. </Newspeech><i>Question No. 237</i><HEADER>NUMBER OF CATTLE IN TANA RIVER</HEADER>Mr. Arte, on behalf of Mr. Wakole, asked the Minister for Livestock Development: -(a)	how many head of cattle there are in Tana River District; and(b)	how much Novidian and Barlin drugs have been delivered to the district between January and April and whether he could give a break-down of the quantity of drugs supplied and the delivery date.<Newspeech>The Minister for livestock Development(Mr. Kabingu-Muregi): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a)	Cattle population in Tana River is estimated to be 320,000.(b)	25,500 tablets of Novidian have been delivered to Tana River District between January and April, 1992. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Arte: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the area we are talking is Tsetse fly infested and we know right now there is no Novidian and Barlin in the district veterinary. Can the Minister consider supplying more drugs to that district? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kabingu-Muregi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, on 24.3.92 15,000 tablets of Novidian were supplied. On 25.4.92 2,500 tablets of Novidian were also supplied. On 5.5.92 tablets 8000 tablets of Novidian were again supplied. The Novidian tablets were not available because manufacturers problems; so, instead my Ministry supplied 15000 grammes of Samorin on 27.4.92. I wish to promise the hon. Member, Tana River people and those others who are affected by the trypanosomiasis problems that Novidian and Evidian tablets are now available in large quantities. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, going by the figures the Minister has given on the tablets supplied and comparing it with the number of livestock in the area - if I heard him well he said that heads of cattle in that area are in excess of 320,000 - does he not agree with me that the supply is far below the demand and that there is need to raise the supply? Supplying 8000 tablets against the figure of 320,000 of head of cattle is far below the demand. Will he consider increasing the amount of supplies? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kabingu-Muregi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, normally all cattle do not suffer from Trypanosomiasis at once. Our estimates are that within a given time you have 10 per cent of the population, or less, suffering. Therefore, we cannot supply 320,000 tablets for every animal; we go by our estimates and I think the supplies, as stipulated here, are enough. If more are required, they are available to those who need them. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Next order. </Newspeech>POINT OF ORDER<HEADER>CHARACTER ASSASINATION ON LATE MZEE KENYATTA</HEADER><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I rise on a point of order to clarify some accusations against me. I have been accused that during the debate on 3.6.921 assassinated the character of the late founding father of this nation, Jomo Kenyatta. I went through my copy of the HANSARD to find out whether I actually used that bad language, but I actually failed to find those words. What I said about the late old Mzee Kenyatta referred to his old age (inaudible) and a few of us here can actually attain that age. I would like to quote what I said from the HANSARD. I used age reference in connection with Mr. Odinga's ambition to the presidency today, and I said:-"Odinga amefikia umri mbaya sana. Unaweza kufikiria h atari iliyotukabili wakati hayati Mzee Kenyatta alikuwa hawezi kujiamulia mambo kwa sababu ya umri wake mkubwa."The word "senile" is much stronger than the words I had used. I did not say that the late President was corrupt or senile and there is nothing in the HANSARD like that. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Your time is up, Mr. Mwamzandi. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: Therefore, I believe my hon. colleagues will understand this and had they taken the trouble to read the HANSARD, they would have known what I said. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: On a point of order, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: No. Unfortunately, we must get on now with the rest of the business on the Order Paper. If you look at the clock, Mr. Okondo, you will agree with me that we cannot allow further points of order. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: On a point of order, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Overruled! I have given an explanation and I am sure you are able to take it. </Newspeech>Next Order.COMMITTEE OF WAYS AND MEANS MOTIONTHAT, MR. SPEAKER DO NOW LEAVE THE CHAIR(The Vice-President and Minister for Finance on 4.6.92)(Resumption of debate interrupted on 9.6.92)<Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this very important Motion. This Motion arises out of the Budget Speech which was delivered here on 4th June, by His Excellency the Vice- President and Minister for Finance.The theme of this year's Budget is "Economic Reform for Renewed Growth". This is a very valid theme and we must congratulate the Vice- President and Minister for Finance for presenting a very balanced Budget this year. It is balanced in the sense that when you look at our economic survey which was launched here by the Minister for Planning and National Development, you will realise that the Vice-President and Minister for Finance has done quite well. We know that our economic growth rate is low and things are not favourable as we would have expected them to.The implementation of this Budget and any other financial provisions lies on the Civil Service. I would like to urge civil servants to be more accountable and transparent. It is regrettable that in the past, some of the actions and behaviour of our top civil servants, particularly the accounting officers, have led this country to be blacklisted internationally. There have been complaints that we do utilise our finances well andthat is why some donors have had to curtail some> of the assistance due to us. This has adversely affected our projects in this country.The administration of the Rural Development Fund is a case in point. This fund has grossly been misused. Even now as I am speaking, a small item like the Rural Enterprise Fund, is not being utilised properly in the districts. I have cases in my own district, Bungoma, where, as leaders, we sat, subÂ¬divided the money, approved and recommended that the wananchi be given this money. But the civil servants who are administering this fund are doing their own things. There are cases in my constituency, Kanduyi, where the people who are now getting the money are not the ones we had approved. Civil servants just sit in the offices and alter the names.In the process, some of these become glaring examples of misappropriation of funds and when such information filters to the international communities, particularly, donor agencies, they start thinking of abandoning their aid. This is the reason why we have stalled projects and I hope that this year's Budget and any other financial provisions, should be directed to projects which have stalled for some time so that they are completed. There are several cases which I can quote in my own district. We have the Webuye District Hospital, Nzoia Water Project in Kimilili Constituency and Mabanga FTC which we have to complete. We hope the little funds which are going to be provided should be utilised properly so that these projects are completed for the benefit of the people.I agree with other speakers who spoke yesterday to the effect that the Vice-President and Minister for Finance should ensure that there are as few mini-budgets as possible. To my understanding, mini-budgets are the source of occasional shortages of essential commodities in the market. This is because unscrupulous businessmen will use all means possible to find out if there will be mini-budgets on certain commodities and will start hoarding those commodities. Why should traders start hoarding certain commodities if they have not had access to some information either from the Treasury or elsewhere? This idea of mini-budgets should be discouraged because to me, they have given unscrupulous businessmen a ticket to hoard goods at certain times of the financial year, since they know that the prices of certain commodities will be increased, they will hoard them.One problem which I noticed in the Budget is that the Vice-President and Minister for Finance reduced certain taxes on some essential commodities like bread and soda but the actual position on the ground is that there has been no corresponding reduction in the prices of those items. The prices of soda and bread are just the same and they have even gone up in certain areas and yet we were told by the Government that taxes on those items had gone down. We urge the business community to also be patriotic; they should not be profit minded all the time but they should also co-operate with Government policies as and when they are given.Because of the bad activities that some of the civil servants have been doing on the local scene, the international community has not been very kind to Kenya. We thank those donors who have continued to help us. For instance, in Western Kenya, the Government of Finland is assisting us in water programmes and in health care. The international community has been hammering on certain personalities that because such and such personalities in the Kenya Government are this and that way, they, therefore, want to blackmail the whole country. This is unfair.I know that because of that kind of attitude towards our country, I have a feeling that there is an international conspiracy to rig Kanu Government out of power. This is unfair because these people just want to rig the Kanu Government out of power claiming fictitiously that So and so in the Government is not good. However, we know ourselves. We also know that our Government has done very well. His Excellency has done very well for this country. Where credit is due, it should be given, instead of blackmailing the whole country. As a Third-World country, we have done our best to develop ourselves.As you know, we are, at the moment, hosting a large population of refugees in the country. Therefore, we should be understood in the perspective that we also care for human lives just as we care for the freedom of both the citizens of the country and our visitors. So, the international community should not be very hard on us, pointing an accusing finger at a few individuals here and there as if these individuals were the whole Government. At the same time, I would like to urge the Government to implement proper structural adjustment programmes so that we may win the confidence of the international community.Finally, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to talk a little bit about the cuirent voter registration and urge all countrymen to register as voters in as large numbers as possible. I was in Bungoma last Monday and found that the turn out for the exercise was good. It started as low, but it later turned to be good. However, I have a small complaint to raise here. We have the Youth for Kanu 92, but this body is not helping the right Kanu officials on the ground in Bungoma. Instead, it is trying to undermine them. All of us here, as members of Kanu, would like to urge Kanu headquarters to assist us in this problem. The Youth for Kanu 92 is the proper body to help the Kanu Government What it is doing in Bungoma, however, is to undermine Kanu leaders in certain areas, and this is a dangerous game.With those few remarks, Sir, I beg to support the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mcharo: Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to enable me to contribute to this Motion.I want to join my colleagues in congratulating His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance on bringing here a good Budget. It is good in that the taxation measure that have been mentioned are very important and useful to the ordinary mwananchi. We have seen that the mwananchi has not been adversely affected by the present budgetary proposals. The increase of beer prices that has been made in the Budget is immaterial because beer is a luxury, an increase in its prices does not really affect us as a country.We also congratulate His Excellency the President on having done everything possible to maintain stability in the country. It is this political stability that is going to assist in the development of the economy of the country. We are aware of the political and economic problems ahead of us, and we urge all political parties in the country to do everything possible to assist in the maintenance of the stability we have today. We are also aware of the world economic problems which do not spare us. There is economic depression and inflation around us, but we are aware that these problems are not beyond our control.It is a fact that the country's economy will only be developed by us, and we must emphasise that those who are managing this economy must be very serious indeed. We have to ensure that tax collectors are serious enough to ensure that all due taxes are collected. Time has come that we must not continue to rely on foreign donors. As a country, we have a right to received donations because donor countries have, since the colonial days, been taking away a lot of wealth from us. Western donor countries determine the prices of our raw materials, such as coffee, tea and others. This is one of those things that make us demand back some of what they have taken from us. These donors are, however, giving us very stringent conditions, and we seem to be in a position to make them do what we want. We cannot get the kind of money we want from them because the conditions they attach to their grants are too difficult for us to fulfil. Therefore, we must use every possible means to depend on ourselves. This is why I feel that we should now do everything possible to carry out our own development using our own resources. I think we can actually do this by collecting all taxes that are due.We should also try to encourage investors to come and invest here in the same way that newly industrialised countries are doing or have done in Asia. Is it not possible for us to request investors to invest on & charitable basis in things like road construction? I have in mind here the Mwatate-Taveta Road, for example. This is a very important road to us and, instead of depending on donors to fund this project and we pay them later, it is my view that investors can be asked to come and assess the economic viability of this road with a view to building it and constructing a toll station on it There are many businessmen who use roads like this one. So, after some time, the toll collected at this toll station will eventually be used to pay these investors. This is just one way of encouraging investors to invest here. It does not apply only to roads; there are also water project which can be used to generate income. Let us request investors to come here and invest in such projects that can generate a lot of income." We will use this income to pay the investors. We do not have to take loans that carry a lot of interest However, we must create the right kind of climate to encourage investors to invest hoe on their own accord rather than having to beg for loans that later give the country many problems.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the policy of urban- rural balance and small-scale enterprises is very good, and we hold with appreciation what the Government is doing in this regard. We were told by the Vice- President and Minister for Finance, in his Budget Speech, that rural trade and production centres have now been developed, having received aid worth Sh.105 million.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we want them to do more. We want a production centre to be identified in every division. Money should be made available to develop these centres because it is in these centres where Jua Kali projects can be developed to assist in providing employment for our people in the country. In this regard investors can also be encouraged to come and invest in these small developing towns throughout the country. We want encouragement to be given to those who can invest in these areas in order to develop them.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like to join my colleagues in saying that if we are going to create stability so that economic development can be realised in this country, the democratic process must be allowed to take its course. People must be encouraged to register themselves as voters in large numbers. I am happy that I have no problems in my area. People in my constituency are registering as voters without any problems. We should encourage people to register in large number so that the strongest party can win. In this respect we have no doubt that Kanu is going to win. The proposals contained in the Budget are going to assist in making Kanu as a party win the elections and get President Moi to continue leading this country.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we must condemn those who are telling our people to boycott the registration exercise. This is because such a move is not in the interest of this country. It appears as if these people are not ready for the elections. Last year, when these people were given the opportunity to form their own political parties, they said that they wanted only six months to prepare themselves for the elections. The six months are over now and I do not see why they are not ready for the elections. They have their own internal political problems. Their internal problems should not affect the affairs of this country. So, the process of registering voters inreadiness for next general election should be allowed to continue and we are happy that the Government has taken the necessary measures to continue in this regard.Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, and I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Livestock Development (Mr. Kabingu-Muregi): Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my colleagues in congratulating His Excellency the President for presenting such a workable Budget to Parliament. He has given a lot of consideration to poor people; those who have low incomes. I am saying this particularly because he has removed the tax on milk; the 5 per cent tax on milk was excessive and farmers were very unhappy about it particularly because of the increase in the prices of cattle feeds. The prices of cattle feeds are not controlled by the Government. So, every incentive available should be given to the dairy farmers and other farmers because they have a great task ahead of them and that is the task of feeding this nation. We do not subsidize farming activities and taxation imposed on farmers should be as low as possible so that the task of making this country self-sufficient is achieved. It is through this kind of incentive that His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance. We hope that these incentives will continue to be given in future so as to ensure that we have adequate food in this country.Veterinary drugs were also put into consideration. This is because we have to have healthy animals. Above all we have to protect these animals from diseases through the availability of veterinary drugs. Veterinary drugs are not manufactured in this country and we hope that Government will also find ways and means of procuring veterinary drugs more cheaply.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, owners of motor vehicles were also considered in this Budget; tax on motor vehicles was lowered. That is a very important step because we have a problem of unemployment in this country. This is because when a person buys a passenger vehicle he must employ a driver and other supporting staff to make that vehicle remain on the road. Therefore to encourage our people to acquire vehicles is another way of creating employment.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also wish to thank His Excellency the President for his dynamic leadership since he took over the reigns of leadership in this country. His leadership has been dynamic even during the time when he was the Vice-President. He has proved to be a very dynamic leader. He is a man who has delivered the goods to this nation. However, of late we have see the emergence of magazines like Society and others which are publishing very abusive statements about His Excellency the President. I think this is an issue which came up during a meeting in Machakos where one of the opposition leaders called for civil disobedience in this country. I hope that this leader did not know what he was doing. All he has in mind is to grab leadership by force. That is why he did not see the need to make a statement that would bring peace. They have instead decided to disrupt the peace that has prevailed in this country for many years. We have seen and witnessed lawlessness and killings and particularly what happened on 18th of last month in Nyandarua just along our border with Kiambu District; on the Nairobi-Nakuru Road. This is where an unruly crowd stopped vehicles along that road. Some youths made themselves police officers to check on travellers; to look for Kalenjins. Unfortunately they were able to get one and they slashed him to death. They killed him mercilessly and this is an action which should be condemned. This shows that the opposition parties are not for peace. They were not formed to create checks and balances that would be necessary for any good government where multi-partyism is practised. The oppostion parties we have are meant to disrupt this nation and grab leadership by force. They do not care about the welfare of wananchi. Nobody applied to born a Kalenjin or a Kikuyu.So, it does not mean that that man who was killed was involved in any controversy whatsoever. To make the matter worse this gentleman was a clergyman. But they found it fit to kill him. He pleaded and prayed for mercy but they found it fit to kill him. This is a very terrible situation and we cannot find words to describe it. All this emanated from lies spread by Kimani wa Nyoike and his group; that 51 children and seven teachers were murdered in St. Mary's Primary School in Kinangop. Not a single child or teacher had been killed in that school. It was just a scare meant to create fear and hatred to the Kanu President and followers. It was through the mercy of God that no child was killed. They had planned to kill about 10 children in that school, but their plans were unsuccessful.Thanks to God that it never happened because that is how they wanted to prove that there were Kalenjin warriors in that forest who were behind those killings. What is the use and who would ever plan to kill so that she or he is elected in the next general elections? How can I plan to kill so that I succeed in the next general elections? Why should a Kalenjin go to Kinari and Njabini Forest? What are they looking for in those forests? This situation is saddening. I call upon our people to think before they act. They should be vigilant and protect the peace that has prevailed in this country for years. During the Colonial and Mau Mau days such a thing never happened. The Mau Mau killed healthy Mzungus who prevented them from achieving their goal. How are children going to help Ford or DP achieve in the next general elections?      Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, I wish to thank Kanu supporters, and yourself too as our Organizing Secretary, for having acted very well. We should continue behaving in this way. We should be patienct and tolerant and respond to the situations as they prevail. The Independence of this country was fought for by a few people and they still live today. Thanks to His Excellency the President for appointing General Gachui as a nominated Member of Parliament as a sign of respect to freedom fighters. They fought for Independence and never did so for a particular tribe. They fought for Independence for every tribe in Kenya to enjoy that freedom. If a Somali is elected as President, we should respect him. Likewise, if a Turkana is elected President, we should also respect him. An intelligent human being should not abuse a legally elected leader like our President because he has done so much for this nation which is visible.With these few remarks, I support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ndong': Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me the chance to support this very important Motion.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Budget was quite fair. Many wananchi thought that because we did not get donor funds this year's Budget was going to be very harsh. To the contrary, the Budget has been quite considerate, moderate and fair. However, I have a few observations to make on how we can revitalise our economy. The Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance has tried its level best to improve the foreign exchange situation in the country. It has also tried very hard to impress upon investors from outside to bring in the needed foreign exchange into Kenya. In this respect, the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance has created the Export Processing Zones (EPZs), in Nairobi, Athi River, Mombasa and I understand that one is coming up in Nakuru. I would like the Ministry to consider starting up an EPZ in Kisumu. I hope the Assistant Minister is listening. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, Office of the Vice- President and Ministry of Finance (Mr. Kariuki): Yes, I am listening. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ndong': If we have one in the central part of Kenya, another one in Athi River which is just about 10 kilometres from Nairobi and one in Mombasa, I think it is proper that we also have an EPZ for Western Kenya and be based in Kisumu.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has tried by introducing the Foreign Exchange Bearer Certificates, for people who have firms to allow them bring money into the country legally. However, all these arrangements have not done, much to bring back the foreign exchange which has been sent out of this country. If you look at developing countries like Taiwan, Pakistan, India and Mauritius, they have removed the foreign exchange control system completely. My recommendation is that the time is now ripe in this country for us to remove the foreign exchange controls completely so that we can stimulate our economy. A lot of our tourists are moving to Mauritius because of its foreign exchange control system. By so doing, we will attract foreign exchange into country and our economy will be revived. I am appealing to the Ministry to do away with foreign exchange controls. Why have a system which does not work? We have foreign exchange controls at the moment, but at the same time people are still taking money out of the country. Let us do away with foreign exchange controls and have a free market economy so that people can bring in whatever they want rather than take it out.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me now turn to banks interest rates. Wananchi are having it very rough indeed because of the bank intrest rates because loans are becoming almost impossible to service. For example, if you borrow shs.l million, after five years the loan will be double because you will -be repaying at the rate of 20 per cent. I am, therefore, requesting the Ministry to look into banks intrest rates so that wananchi can be able to borrow and service their loans on time.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the divesture of parastatals is a good move. I would request that whenever we want to sell these parastatals this should be advertised in the local newspapers so that people can know what is on sale. Usually, we are only told that such and such a company has been sold, but we do not see advertisements in the newspapers. We should have an open system whereby every parastatal being divested is advertised in the newspaper and tenders awarded. Lake Victoria is the second largest lake in Africa and we have used very little of this water. My recommendation here is that we should try and use Lake Victoria to do some irrigation along the lake. So that we can be self sufficient in food. I do not see the need of having a pipe-line all the way from Mombasa to Kisumu when there is no oil-field in Mombasa. We should have a pipe-line from the source. So why have a pipe-line running all the way from Mombasa to Kisumu when we have no oil in Mombasa? Instead we should have a pipe-line running from Lake Victoria to Mombasa to give people in Mombasa water.In the budget, I have seen a section from the budget called election budget. I am wondering what is in this budget or what is being budgeted for election. Whether it is the amount for ballot boxes, ballot papers or it is for campaign, we should know what it contains. Whether inside here we have money> for campaigns and if it is so, in developed countries, they allocate money for all parties including rival parties. This election budget should cover all the parties in this country because this is "mali ya Uma; mali ya wananchi". So, if Kanu is represented here, we would like to see DP also inside here. We would like to see FORD also here and all the other parties interested.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the balance of payments have increased from time to time and I am blaming our Ministry of Commerce because their Commercial Attaches have become clerks in our Foreign Embassies. They do not move. They cannot move. There is no money. They should be given enough funds to be able to move. They have become clerks in our Foreign Embassies. If the Ministry of Commerce cannot do it, then we should do away with that Ministry and have Cater' being an autonomous body to market the products of this country properly like we have in Japan.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would request the Ministry of Works to try and murrain some roads in Rangwe particularly the roads connecting Kochia and Kadam Locations. These roads are impassable during the rains.[Mr. Deputy Speaker left the Chair] [The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi) took the Chair]Lastly, I know my time is almost over. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for a long time we have spoken about tourism in the Western circuit that is coming from Masai Mara going to Muhoro Bay, Kalungu Bay, Mbita, Homa Bay, Kindu Bay and along the lake up to Siaya and then joining Kakamega. If this Western circuit is opened up, I believe theoretically, it is be able to multiply income received from tourism. At the moment we have the Eastern circuit which runs from Tanzania border to Malindi which goes on from October to March. If we can open the Eastern side to run from April up to August, theoretically, we should be. able to double the income received from tourism. I would appeal to the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife to think of opening up of Western tourism circuit.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am surprised that some people are telling Voters not to register. With those few remarks I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: Thank you very much Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my colleages to first and foremost thank His Excellency the President for his firm stand in the face of very adverse pressure from both within and without. It is that stand which has enabled His Excellency the Vice-President to present a budget which in all ways and aspects is quite excellent, simple, partinent to the problems facing this nation. The problems which are both of political and social. This is a people's budget which expresses the manner in which the Kanu Government is indeed a representative Government. It is responsive to the needs and aspirations of the Kenyan people. Let me say that our people are very happy because of this budget. This budget at the same time has indeed confounded all those who have had ill intentions to subotage to ruin the economy of this country and cause chaos and misery to the people of this great nation. We have managed to stand upright and we will continue doing thatWe also know that the ill intentions, the evil- minded characters in our society who are mushrooming around within the opposition parties have realised that we have a party which has ruled this country for the last 30 years with firmness, vision and always ready to offer practical solutions to the problems of this nation. The call by the opposition to the donors to discontinue with their aid is bad. They have now realised that we can operate within our little resources to manage the services of the land. This has been a lesson to us, and we should continue doing that since we are not ready to be subservient to anybody.The theme for this year's budget was "Enhanced Economic Reform for Renewed Growth". This is indeed a noble aim which we can only attain and make it better by being very strict in the implementation of all the provisions of the budget, financial or administrative. We must be more accountable to the people of this country, and it is through that we shall be able to translate this budget in a proper manner.We must also warn those who have been mismanaging the institutions of this land to take note that there is no more time for casualness, indiscipline or laziness for their own self-interest. That time is gone and they must read the signs of times. The law will take its course if any of them misapplies the rules or misappropriates public funds or misuses their positions for their own interest. We also know that some of the problems that we face at the moment are due to our own poor management. We know that due to the international prices which have affected the incomes we receive from the commodities we export, we have been facing a lot of problems. For this reason, we need to increase the production of these commodities so that we can move into international trade. We Should also introduce new products in the area of horticulture to supply the European Economic Community markets and other world markets, where such products would fetch very good prices since they are in high demand there.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Government for removing the taxes on various essential products, such as milk. Today, milk is in very high demand and I would like to say that farmers are very happy to know that they are going to sell their milk freely and the milk prices will be rising according to the market demand. I would also like to thank the Government for increasing the prices of various produce, particularly cereals. I am saying this because this morning, we read in the newspapers that this country is likely to face famine and that about one million people are starving due to drought which has affected a large portion of our country. So, giving farmers a better price for their produce is one way of encouraging them to produce more.At the same time, I would like to call upon the Agricultural Finance Corporation, the Kenya Grain Growers Co-operative Union, the Co-operative Bank and other financial institutions to take note of these adverse conditions that this country is facing at the moment so that when they are collecting their loan repayments, they do not subject farmers to extreme hardships. I am saying this because we have heard of cases where particularly the Agricultural Finance Corporation has sold land, tractors, and vehicles belong to farmers just because they have been unable to repay their debts. These financial institutions should be able to reschedule their loans and perhaps waive some of the arrears that have been building up on farmers loan accounts for years. I am saying this because a continuous overloading of loan arrears, will be a burden on farmers. Even when they take away assets from farmers, they may not recover all the money owed by the farmers.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would now like to say something about land politics. This country has to remain united even during this era of multi-party politics. Kenyans must realize that they can only survive if they unite and reject any move by anybody to bring about chaos in this country. We know in recent time, some of the opposition leaders and their sympathizers have been irresponsible, short-sighted and extremely rude if not politically backward. I am saying this because all their political statements have tended to create condition which might lead to anarchy and this is very dangerous. They have called upon wananchi to boycott national day celebrations and this is a misconception on their part. If they do not want to attend these celebrations, they have no right to interfere with the rights of wananchi who are free to do what they want. These opposition leaders have not even been elected by wananchi and one wonders how they can claim to represent anybody. This is ridiculous! We cannot listen to people who have no mandate. They call themselves interim chairmen and the rest and I congratulate Kanu for not heading to their call for meetings. How do you meet with people who have no mandate of wananchi. Let them hold elections so that wananchi can elect them first so that we know whom we are talking to. We have been elected by the people in our constituencies and we can claim to speak on their behalf. Let them therefore prove that they are democratic minded by holding elections so that wananchi can choose whoever they want We must as Kenyans reject their boycotts whether on registration or of attending national celebrations. After all, Kenyans are free to do what they want because they are mature and cannot agree to be spoon-fed by a few individuals.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Government has said that the elections will be fair and free so that wananchi can elect the people they want and I do not know why these people are making noise.With those few remarks, I beg to support</Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Tourism and Wildlife (Mr. Gakunju): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for the manner in which he moved the Budget. The Budget aims at enhanced economic reform for renewed growth. Our economic growth has been reduced and the proposals made by the Vice- President and Minister for Finance need all the support so that we can grow economically. There were very positive steps recommended to cover increased investments, exports and so on. Emphasis was made on Agriculture and Tourism which are the two main areas where we can invest to boost our economy. However, I notice that he did not go far enough in farming. Today, the coffee farmers are demanding that presumptive tax on coffee be removed.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is amazing to note that despite the very low prices of coffee, Kenya coffee in recent weeks has done very well in the international market. This is very encouraging to the farmers and we would like this tax be removed. We would also like the cess money on coffee and tea, which farmers do not object to pay, being used properly. This money should be used for the maintenance of roads in the tea and coffee areas. I am saying this because Agriculture is very important to us and this is one area where we can continue to grow and generate more employment opportunities to our people. We' have, for example, the area of horticulture, where we can employ a lot of people. We should also in engage in dairy fanning by particulary adopting the zero grazing strategy. If proper encouragement was given to the farmers, I am sure they would produce a lot for both domestic and export. I was encouraged by what the Vice-President said regarding the restructuring of the Agricultural Finance Corporation so that farmers can get money to develop farming. I hope that this will include livestock developmentMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question of establishing an Agricultural Bank has been talked about for a very long time in this country. At the moment farmers use commercial loans to farm which is not good for them and our agriculture. So, the acceleration of expansion of. AFC, or its  translation into an agricultural bank, should be expedited so that farmers benefit from the facilities that are available to them. It is a pity that with all the agricultural land we have we have to get into a situation we are in, whereas if we increase our irrigation and water harvesting and storage the question of famine and so on when we do not have rains will be a thing of the past.But, as much as the Vice-President and Minister for Finance, the Government and, indeed, the President try to ensure that things are contained, we have among us leaders in this House who make utterances that damage, or interfere with, the work that is being done. We have recently heard of elected leaders, who are Members of this House, talk about the presidency when the President, Daniel arap Moi, when is alive and working hard. The people who are in his Government are wasting time about when the President goes. How do they know he is going? He is being re-elected to the Kanu and national presidency. So, why should these talk about the next President?Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have also heard about the revival of majimboism, which is a pity. For a long time we have talked about the evils of majimboism but their revival continues to be raised. Of late there has even been revival of tribalism. People speak about ethnic groups, that is Kalenjins, Kikuyus and so on. I really even do not know what the Kikuyus have done because many speakers have stood up and talked about Kikuyus having done this and that they should forget this and the other. I must confess that I am a Kikuyu and I am not very amused when people talk about Kikuyus in a bad way. They should talk about Kikuyus with respect because it is Kikuyus who fought for Independence when many of them were doing anything. What most of them were doing was to deny that they were Kikuyus. During the emergency I was arrested with a Luhyia and the first thing he said when we were taken in is that "I am not a Kikuyu". So, he was released just because he was not a Kikuyu while I myself was tortured and detained because I was a Kikuyu. The fact that we fought brought our Independence.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, you are aware that I represent Gatundu Constituency, which was represented by the late Mzee Jomo Kenyatta. The people of Gatundu were saddened and astonished because hon. Mwamzandi last week spoke ill if the late President. He showed a lot of disrespect to the founding father of this country. He talked about the last six years of the late President Jomo Kenyatta. Why did he not talk about the whole life of the late Kenyatta; how he struggled to make Kenya a nation; for the emancipation of Africa and that he is up to today is respected by the whole world. These kind of remarks saddened not only Gatundu people but, I think, the whole of Kenya nation. We would like hon. Mwamzandi to apologise to this House. The latePresident was not senile; he worked for the whole nation without even thinking much about Gatundu people because he was the father of this nation. According to the African customs, when people die we let them rest in peace; we do not speak about them because they cannot reply. We pray for the family and we would like hon. Mwamzandi to apologise for those very unfortunate remarks. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. For the guidance of other speakers who will take the Floor I think this issue was clarified this morning. I think it is out of order for hon. Members to go back to the issue of the late President when it was clarified this morning on a point of order after Question Time. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi): Actually it happens that the hon. Mwamzandi being talked about is right in the Chair. But I made the matter clear and if hon. Gakunju had referred to the verbatim report of my speech he would have known what I said. In any case, can refer him to Standing Order 73(3) and (4). Sub-section 3 states:-"It shall be out of order to use offensive, or insulting language, whether in respect of Members of the House or other persons". And Sub-section 4 says:-"No Member shall impute improper motive to any other Member except upon a specific substantive Motion calling into question the conduct that Member". I will let him escape with it but he was violating some of the Standing Orders. If he had anything to talk about Mwamzandi it could be better handled in substantive Motion. But I want to say again that I made it clear in the morning that there has never been insult: I talked of old age and nothing else. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Culture and Social Services (Mr. Ogingo): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to associate myself with some of the remarks that have been made by those who have spoken before me. In doing this I would like the Vice-president and Minister for Finance for the manner in which he presented the Budget speech last week. Hon. Members who have spoken before me have rightly said that the Budget was a common man's Budget I support them in that assertion.Having done so, I would also like to thank the President for the manner in which he has led this country during a very difficult time given the that we are in a multi-party era. I am sure that God will him additional powers to lead this country into the next elections and it is my hope that He will prevail. When we talk about the Presidency, I think it is important for leaders to take this office very seriously. The Presidency is the symbol of unity of any nation and, we, as a Republic, must guard our utterances. Of late, some of the leaders in this Government, have taken it upon themselves to balkanise the country into tribal units by calling upon their communities to start Staging in terms of the Presidency when, in fact, we have a President It is not fair to look at the Presidency from an ethnic community point of view. It must be understood very clearly that any Kenyan can be a President irrespective of his ethnic background When we start talking about a Luhya, Luo or a Kikuyu President and so on, we shall be balkanising the country. We shall not be helping the Government and the President for that matter who is the chief advocate for unity, peace and love in this country. It is most baffling when it is the Ministers who are talking along those lines.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like to say that it is unfair to revive federalism which has already caused this country a lot of problems. Ministers in the ruling party must desist from addressing this nation on the basis of federal government. I will be speaking on behalf of the Luo community where I come from when I say that we do not subscribe to a federal system of government for Kenya at all. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Arte: Sisi tunataka! </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Culture and Social Services (Mr. Ogingo): We are aware that this country does not have equitable resources and the moment we start talking about a federal arrangement we are going to starve certain areas badly. For instance, western Kenya provides the bulk of food for this country and when we start talking about a federal arrangement we shall be making it very difficult for certain areas, particularly the drought stricken areas, from getting food supplies at this time when some of us have become so tribal in our outlook and thinking.I would like to thank the Government most sincerely for trying to bring about infrastructural development especially in South Nyanza. I am happy that the Government has agreed to bitumenize one of the leading roads in the district This is Road C18 - Rodi Kopany/Karungu - which was done this year.Another thing is that I would like the Government to seriously consider the idea of rural electrification in so far as South Nyanza is concerned. Rural industrialisation cannot be a reality in the absence of electricity. If we have to curb rural/urban migration in search of employment we have to bring about the necessary facilities in the rural areas. It is a fact that 90 per cent of Kenyans live in the rural areas. The Government must make sufficient efforts to ensure that rural life is made easy.The other crucial aspect is in respect of medical care. Without sufficient medical care, we shall be in trouble. If I were to be a bit parochial, I want to say this as I have done before, that my constituency happens to be one of those constituencies with one of the highest child mortality rate. For instance, out 1,000 children that are born, over 216 die. I wish to urge the Government to upgrade Ndhiwa Health Centre to a sub-district hospital since it is the only reasonable health institution that I have in my constituency. The Government should also go out of its way and look for donor funding for this exercise. I am aware that it is not possible for the Government to get sufficient funds to put up a fully fledged sub-district hospital. Medical care is for human beings and taking into account the high mortality rate among children, I am sure the House appreciates that this is not a very good thing.I would now like to touch on the economy of this country. Some of the rich people in this country are being accused of encouraging capital flight out of this country. It is contradictory for us to ask donors to assist in developing this country when our own rich people do not have faith in their own country and economy. In order for us to be assured of donor funding, we must not be accused of encouraging capital flight Equally important is the question of human flight. The country must not be accused of brain drainage simply because our economy is not strong enough to encourage them to serve their fellow Kenyans.South Nyanza now been split into two districts namely; Homa-Bay and Migori and the wananchi there have thanked the Government most sincerely. They have first class land and I wish to draw the attention of the Ministry of Agriculture to the fact that the people of South Nyanza have been asking the Government to consider the establishment of another white sugar factory in the district. This is because we have land and resources for this purpose. It is also the feeling of the people there that with some effort, cement potential can be discovered and harnessed. I wish to ask the Government to consider carrying out the necessary feasibility studies.My constituency was recently affected by Cholera and I wish to appeal to the Ministry of Health to send medical personnel there to curb the spread of this epidemic. One of the reasons why we have Cholera in that area is lack of water. The Ministry of Water Development has been promising to do something about availability of water and I would like to urge them to do something about it as soon as possible. Lade of water is a contributing factor to the high mortality rate in the district and especially in Ndhiwa.I would, now like to touch on voter  Services registration. It is my appeal to the Government to ensure that registration units are brought as close as possible to the people as this will encourage them to register. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi): Your time is up, Mr. Ogingo. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Culture and Social Services (Mr. Ogingo): Since my time is over, I wish to support the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. A.H.O. Momanyi: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this time to contribute to this very important Motion that was moved here last week by the Vice-President and Minister for Finance. This year's Budget is not a bad one, and we hope that it is going run for the whole year. It will not be good for the Vice-President to increase the prices of commodities in the course of the year. At the moment, the price of sugar, for example, is about Sh.30/= per kilogramme and this is very expensive for wananchi. We would like the Budget to run as it is for the whole year. We know the hardships we are facing and if the Minister retains the Budget as it is for the whole year, wananchi will enjoy it. Let us not say that it is a good Budget only to increase the prices of commodities after two or three months. If this happens, what will we tell our people, who are now saying that this is a good Budget?I would also like to call on the Vice-President and Minister for Finance to look at some Ministries, such as Public Works. This is one of the most important Ministries we have in the country. This is the Ministry that maintains roads, and it should be given enough money to enable it to maintain roads all over the country because without roads, we cannot do much.There is also the Ministry of Health, which should also be looked at Hospitals in this country are in a bad state. Most of our health institutions do not have enough drugs. So, the Minister concerned should see the Vice-President and Minister for Finance and ensure that he gets enough money to enable him to maintain supply health institutions with drugs, especially in areas where we have ethnic clashes. In these areas, we need sufficient drugs and doctors to attend to clash victims. There are clashes in Kisii and Nyamira, for example, but we do not have enough drugs nor nursing personnel there. To make matters worse, people are dying, but the mortuary in Kisii Hospital has not Seen functioning for almost one year now. All the people who die there are taken to Nyamira Hospital, whose mortuary is very small. So, we would like the Ministry of Health to look into this matter seriously. All health institutions in that area should be equipped with drugs and qualified medical personnel.I would also like to call on the Vice-President and Minister for Finance to look into the Ministry of Agriculture. Fertiliser is one of the most important input used by farmers in this country. These fanners would like the price of fertiliser to be reduced. This price cuirently stands at about Sh.400/= per bag, and most of our fanners cannot afford to buy it So, I call upon the Ministry of Agriculture to look into the pricing of fertiliser. While still on agriculture, I would like to say that tea farmers are sometimes badly paid. They sometimes get Sh.2/= or Sh.3/= per kilogramme of tea per month. I call upon the Minister concerned to increase this monthly payment to Sh.5/= per kilogramme. I am surprised to note that there was a probe committee, chaired by hon. Mahihu, to look into this problem, but its report has not been laid on the Table of the House up to this moment. The farmers in this country should be taken care of because without them, there is nothing we can do. At the moment, we are crying about drought and food shortages, but if farmers are taken care of, there will be no more cry.There was a strike of tea farmers in my area some time back.Tea factory workers went on strike due to factory mismanagement. Transferring bad managers from one factory to another is, however, is not a solution. We want to know what happened to the money in these tea factories because up to now, the Kenya Tea Development Authority has not come out to tell the wananchi of Kitutu Masaba what happened to this money. When farmers were given their second payment, there was a huge outcry to the effect that the factory managers there had misappropriated money in a bad way. So, these people should be followed and wananchi told what happened to the money.With regard to livestock, veterinary drugs are very expensive. A farmer with a sick cow is charged Sh.1,600/= for the treatment of the cow, and poor farmers cannot afford it. So, the Minister concerned should ensure that the price of veterinary drugs is lowered. We are talking about milk production every now and then. How can a poor farmer maintain his cows if treatment for one cow costs Sh.1,600/=? If his four cows fall sick, where he is going to get 6,400/= from for their treatment? Farmers practise zero-grazing these days, but this is a very expensive mode of fanning. If the cost of veterinary drugs goes down, dairy fanners can enjoy their business and produce enough milk for the country.In Kisii and Nyamira, we sometimes do not get water even for a whole week. Keroka has gone without water for nearly two years now. We want the main towns in our areas to have sufficient water. Without enough water, hotels cannot run. The Ministry of Water Development should look into this problem, which is very serious. There is a water project in Nyambaria which was taken over by the Ministry, but nothing has been said about it. We would like this project to take off so that wananchi may benefit.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not have any electricity in my constituency. We want electricity to be supplied everywhere to enable schools to run smoothly and carry out studies properly. Most of the schools in my area use pressure lamps, which are very expensive to maintain. It is also very expensive to maintain an electric generator. So, rural electrification should be implemented everywhere in the Republic. Government officers should implement all projects approved by district development committees, but we find that most such officers, especially in districts, misuse the money meant for the implementation of projects in their districts. It is said that the Attorney-General is taking legal action against such officers, but when we go to the sites concerned, we find nothing going on. Therefore, Accounting Officers should be watched very carefully to ensure that projects take off as planned by district development committees.With regard to the Jua Kali industry. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, Office of the Vice- President and Ministry of Finance (Mr. Keah): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Hon. Momanyi is talking about officers misusing money throughout the whole Republic. I would rather he perhaps limits this to Nyamira or Kisii because it is unfair to condemn wholesale all Government officers. I am aware that there are some Government officers who are actually good. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. A.H.O. Momanyi: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this issue has been raised many times. In my area, Nyamira District, we have got funny officers. Projects in Nyamira District have not been completed for many years now. We want Jua Kali sheds to be constructed all over the country. We do not have any Jua Kali sheds in Nyamira District. These young men and women should be assisted so that they can get self- employment.With regard to telephone services telephone booths should be installed in schools, markets and with those few remarks, I support the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Tourism and Wildlife (Mr. Terer): Thank you very much, Mr; Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my colleagues in congratulating His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance, for having presented a balanced Budget to Parliament. He presented a progressive Budget. Under the present economic situation in the country and in the world we could not have got a better Budget.I will go straight to rural-urban balance and small scale enterprises. We were told by the Vice-President and Minister for Finance that there are eight established centres and we would like these centres to be decentralized. They should go to all the provinces in the country. Unless and until we take industries to the rural areas we shall continue to have the rural-urban migration.On the training of small scale entrepreneurs, I think the Government should endeavour to train small scale entrepreneurs in bookkeeping and in accounts. This is because unless these people are trained they may not know whether they are making losses or profits. So, the Government should step in and see to it that these people are trained.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, while touching on the Rural Enterprise Fund I think there were many anomalies because the people who deserved to get money from this Fund did not get the money. I think in future we should devise ways and means of really establishing who are the genuine people who should get these loans. This is because in my area there was a group of disabled children who had applied for these loans but they were not considered. This is a pity because those who were in charge of allocating these loans did not consider these disabled children. Even the graduates of youth polytechnics were not considered. I consider this to be wrong. This is because all the money ended in the hands of people who should have gone to the banks to obtain loans. These people who are aware that there are finance houses in this country. Mothers who have formed themselves in women groups are the people who should have got this money. I say this because women are very good when it comes to loan repayments; they are very careful. These are the people who should have been considered for loans.Coming to rural access roads, I think it is time the Ministry of Public Works considered employing local people even on honorarium basis so that they can maintain roads. Road users would not like the conditions of the roads to deteriorate. They would like these roads to be kept in good condition all the time because they are the beneficiaries. Sometimes the Ministry takes a long time before repairing the roads. I am particularly concerned about the road between Kericho and Sotik. This road has been in a very bad shape for a long time and yet the Minister travels along that road to his home. There are dangerous potholes on that road. This road has remained in a poor condition for about two years now. If a car breaks down because of photholes that costs, this country a lot of money in terms of foreign exchange. This is because we have to import spare parts using our scarce foreign exchange. These spare parts are not locally made and we should make sure that our roads are passable.With regard to the productivity of civil servants, I think the Civil Service should be restructured in such a way that the Government knows what each and every civil servant is doing. It may even be necessary to set up a supervisory team to supervise the civil servants. Some civil servants may not be all that productive. Those who are approaching retirement age should be retired in the interest of the whole Service. There is no point in keeping somebody in the Service if he is not productive.Touching on the National Social Security Fund, I think it is time the services of N.S.SP. were really decentralized. The services of this Fund should be decentralized so that people can go for their money at the district level. Money should be paid at the district level. That is possible. Why can the officers at the district level not pay these people their dues instead of telling them to come to Nairobi? We have a lot of problems with old people. Some of them find it difficult to get their dues in time. Some of them have no hope of getting this money because they are forced to travel to Nairobi. Some people have never travelled outside their villages. So, I think we should decentralise the activities of the N.S.S.F. to the districts.On the Kenya Co-operative Creameries, we have been told that the K.C.C. should be paying farmers in time and that is good. But we will not listen to excuses. We want money because milk has been delivered to the K.C.C. and money should be paid within a month. There should be no problem because milk is being sold. The price of milk has been decontrolled and there should be no problem.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the Ministry of Agriculture should encourage farmers to diversify crop production particularly the food crops. In certain areas you will find that they grow only maize and if that crop fails then there is disaster in terms of famine. So, the Ministry of Agriculture should be able to advise farmers to grow other food crops alongside maize. Farmers should grow crops like beans and potatoes. I call upon the extension officers to be available all the time so that they can advise the farmers accordingly.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when it comes to recruitment of people into the Civil Service, this should be done at the divisional level so that all the divisions are taken care of. We find that if recruitment is done at the district level people from some divisions may not be considered.With regard to cess money, my area is a tea growing area and there is a lot of money collected as cess from tea. That money has not been put to good use. There is no point in collecting this money and diverting it to other areas. It should be used for maintaining roads in the areas where it was collected. Farmers have a right to say that this money should not be collected until and and unless it goes back to improve the roads.Turning to the current exercise of registration of voters, I urge my constituents to register in large numbers.There is word going round in my constituency that since we were forced to join Bomet we should not register as voters. So, I am appealing, to them to leave the question of boundaries to proper authorities. Boundaries are not permanent and we are going to argue our case until we go back to where we rightly belong. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Galgallo: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is hon. Terer in order to say that his constituency has been forced into being part of Bomet District? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi): It is his opinion because he might not have been happy with that decision.Please continue, Mr. Terer. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Tourism and Wildlife (Mr. Terer): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for that advice to hon. Galgallo.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, harassing of Kalenjin students and travellers should stop henceforth. We are not going to leave Nairobi. Kalenjins will be in Nairobi for as long as it remains the capital of this country.With those few remarks, I beg to support.Mr. Galgallo: Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this Motion, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, first and foremost, I would like to thank the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for ably moving the Budget that has catered for the interests of the common man and for being very fair this time. Secondly, we all understand that there is a global economic recession. However, there are matters that are very important in this country such as national projects like irrigation schemes and supply of drugs which should be maintained. In the past three years we have faced problems in the supply of medicines and livestock drugs in the Northern part of Kenya. Although in the past drugs were supplied by the Department of Veterinary Services there was a desire by the Ministry to hand over these services to private entrepreneurs who would only concentrate on a few areas. I would like to call upon the Treasury to finance and ensure that we are supplied with drugs especially at the coastal area which is prone to these diseases such as tick-borne.On the other hand, although we have no complaint about the road infrastructure, I would like to call upon the Treasury to ensure that Bura and Hola Irrigation Schemes are revived so that people there live peacefully like other Kenyans. For the last four years, these people have been faced with starvation because due to shortage of water and subsequently they have not been able to sell any crop. Such projects which form the back-bone and economies of those districts should be looked into and sufficient funds allocated. The latter two schemes are the only ones in my area, but they have been out of order for quite some time due to lack of finances.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there have been too much talk all over the country that the presidency should be rotating from one tribe to another. When big tribes consider themselves to have the right of leading others, where will the small tribes be? Would an Emolo, Rendillee or an Omar ever think of being a President in this country? It is wrong for any individual to assume that because he hails from a majority tribe he has a right to capture the Presidency. Presidency should be based on competency. It is Kenyans' right to choose the type of President they want. Tribalism should not come in with regard to Presidency as it were the case where a Minister said that it is time for the Luhyias.This is the problem we have been facing from the moment we moved away from federalism. In 1964 when we started facing these problems. For example, in Coast Province, land adjudication came when influential people came to settle their friends there. There are people who own that piece of land, but they will never have it. On the other hand, since land was being issued through the bade door the real owners of that land have been rendered squatters because people from outside were issued with letters of allotment from Nairobi including leases and the indigenous people of the Coast Province were left out. So, it is Kamau, Patel, Wilson and so on who have benefited. This is the kind of trend that scares us. It is scaring us because if everybody wants to become something all he does is to snatch people's land. We will not accept this to happen. I personally do not own any piece of land in my area because there has been no land adjudication.In 1973 the Commissioner of Agriculture issued a leasehold for 43 years to a certain company for 750,000 acres without going through the proper channels. This is the kind of situation that is creating terror among the minorities. I support hon. Ntimama when he talks about majimbo. Federalism is not a bad idea because everything is secure. If land is going to be controlled centrally and the districts do not have any power over it, we are going to perish. How can they make use of all the land? How can that happen? It is very unfair. Therefore, we should go back to federalism so that we are able to control our own land, otherwise we shall be displaced within no time. I am sure between 40 and 50 years from now everything will be gone. Those other communities especially from the Coast will be displaced. How can we remain squatters in our own country? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the hon. Member in order to go back to the federal or majimbo issue? It has been clearly indicated here that majimbo debate was actually responsible for the tribal clashes. That is why a Select Committee of this House has been set up to investigate and it is already out doing exactly that Is he in order to revive that debate? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi): I do not think that the Select Committee is on majimbo debate. It is a Parliamentary Select Committee carrying out other duties. However, I think the hon. Member is expressing his opinion, and he is entitled to that. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Galgallo: Thank you, Sir, for protecting me against hon. Makhanu who probably feels that it is his time now to become a President, and would be the first person to come and grab land in my area! </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: On a point of order, Sir. While thanking the hon. Member for wishing me well in my future, is he in order to deny us, Luhya, our right to propose ourselves as Presidents? Even Pokomos, if they want to become President, they are free to go ahead and propose themselves! </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Galgallo: Hon. Makhanu is quite right However, they are the fust to propose that they have the right since they are the second largest tribe in Kenya.With those few remarks, I beg to support</Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Water Development (Mr. Mweu): Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, nataka kutoa shukrani zangu kwako kwa kunipatia nafasi hii.Pia nataka kutoa shukrani zangu kwa Makamu Rais na Waziri wa Fedha kwa makisio ya fedha ambayo aliisoma hapa wiki jana. Nataka kujiunga naye kwa mam bo mengi ambayo alizungumzia. Pamoja na yale alizungumzia ni kuhusu umilikaji wa pesa za umma kwa njia inayofaa kwa wafanyakazi wa Serikali, public servants.Ningetaka kuzungumzia juu ya jambo hili na kusema kwamba tunatarajia pesa ambazo tunqftisha hapa wakati waj makisio kama huu zitatumika kwa njia inayofaa ili mwananchi ambaye kusudi lake ni afaidike kutokana na pesa hizo ziweze kutekeleza kazi inayonuiwa.Tuna miradi ambayo bado haijakamilika kwa miaka mingi. Kwa mfano, miradi ya barabara, maji, shule, hospitali, na kadhalika. Wakati mwingine shida hii inatokana na kutotumia pesa ipasavyo, kama vile tumesikia hivi leo kuhusu kituo cha afya cha Bioa. Tangu miaka mitatu au minne imepita kituo hfld kilikuwa kimepangiwa kikamilike. Lalrini mpaka leo bado hakijakamilika. Kwa sababu hii naria kwamba mradi fulani umesimama kwa muda mrefu sana Hii ndiyo sababu pesa hazitumiki kwa njia ipasavyo. Serikali inalazimika kutumia pesa zaidikwa sababu mwaka huu si sawa. na kesho. Leo M inapanda juu kwa vifaa fulani. Kwa hivyo, kama miadi fulani ulikuwa unakisiwa kugharimu kama KSh.500,000.00, kesho uwe ni KSh.700,000.00, kuzipata pesa hizo ni shida kubwa sana. Kwa hivyo, utumiaji wa pesa za umma kwa njia ipasavyo ni lazima utelekezwe ipasavyo. Ikiwa pesa zimetengwa kwa mradi fulani basi yafaa kazi ianze mara moja.Jambo, hili la kupeana tenda linachukua miaka mingi sana. Nafahamu kwamba ilipitishwa kulingana na matakwa ya D.D.C. kwamba wilaya zitoe ama zipeane tenda. Lakini utapata kwamba kama ni tenda kuhusu barabara fulani, ni lazima tenda itolewe Nairobi na inachukua muda hata karibu nusu mwaka. Kazi hiyo inakawia na hata mwisho wa mwaka ama financial year, kazi inakuwa bado haijamalizika. Sasa inakuwa ni lazima tutafute pesa nyingine za kuongezea ili mradi huo ukamilike. Kwa sababu hii pesa nyingi za umma zinatumiwa vibaya sana. Lakini wananchi wanataka maendeleo kulingana na pesa ambazo zinatolewa kwa kazi yao.Hii ndiyo sababu nataka kuunga mkono matamshi ya Makamu-Rais na Waziri wa Fedha kusema kwamba ni lazima Accounting Officers waeleze ni kwa nini hawatumii pesa ipasavyo ili mwananchi apate haki yake. Ikiwa anakubaliwa atumie kama KSh.20 milioni, basi asitumie zaidi ya hizo au chini. Lakini siyo chini sana halafu anarudisha pesa nyingine katika hazina, yaani Treasury. Hakuna maana ya kurudisha pesa katika hazina wananchi wakihangaika huko.Jambo lingine ni kuhusu sukari, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda. Leo katika sehemu za mashambani, kama Kitui, utapata kwamba bei ya sukari ni kati ya KSh'.30.00 hadi KSh.35.00 kwa kilo moja. Sukari hii inatoka nje na haina bei ya kawaida. Lakini ni kwa sababu gani viwanda vyetu vya sukari kama Mumias, Chemelil, Sony na kadhalika zinafanya marekebisho ya mashine zao wakati mmoja? Why do they carry out service of their machines at the same time? Ni kwa nini hawawezi kufanya, marekebisho kiwanda kimoja kwa moja? Tukifanya hivyo basi tutakuwa na sukari ya kutosha nchini. Kwa hivyo, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, tunasema kwamb a ni lazima tuwe tukitumia akili. Ni lazima tufanya kila jambo katika wakati wake lakini si kufanya mambo yote kwa wakati moja.Ningetaka kuzungumza vyuo vya kuwafunza walimu. Jambo la kuwachagua wale Wanaoingia katika vyuo hivi, limekuwa likiendelea vizuri, lakini wakati unafika ambapo walimu wengine wanakosa kurudi katika vyuo hivi. Kwa wakati mwingine nafasi za walimuhawa, zinapatiwa watu wengine badala ya kupatiwa wale ambao walikuwa katika orodha ya kungojea. Mpango huu unafanywa na watu wengine lakini si yule district education officer. Ikiwa kile kiwango cha walimu wanaochukuliwa katika kila wilaya ni lazima kiweko, ni lazima yule district education officer afahamishwe na kuleta majina yaliyoko katika orodha ya kungojea.Hatutaki kuona watu wengine wakiletwa na kuwekwa kule bila idhini ya district education officer.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, baada ya kusema hivyo, ningetaka kusema kwamba mwananchi wa Kenya ana haki ya kujiadikisha kupiga kura. Ni ajabu kugundua kwamba watu wa upinzani ndio walikuwa wa kwanza kusema kwamba ni lazima uchaguzi ufanywe ili wananchi wawachague viongozi wanaotaka ili tuweze kuwa na Serikali nyingine. Wakati sasa imefika wa kujiandikisha na hawa viongozi wa upinzani ndio walikuwa wa kwanza kuwaambia wananchi wagomee kujiandikisha kama wapiga kura. Kulingana na gazeti la Nation la leo, walisema kwamba kuna kadi ambazo hazikuonyesha nambari za kujiandikisha, yaani registration number. Ni kweli kwamba haya makosa, hata wakati tulikuwa na chama kimoja, yalikuweko, lakini yaliyotokea, viongozi wa upinzani wanasema kwamba Serikali inataka kufanya rigging. Ni lazima watu waendelee kujiandikisha ili haki iweze kudumishwa. Tungetaka kuwaomba wananchi wafike katika vituo vya kujiadikisha ili waweze kupata kadi ya kupiga kura. Wananchi wenyewe ndio watakaoamua ni nani atayekuwa kiongozi wa nchi hii. Kwa hivyo, jambo la kuwaambia wananchi waugomee uandikishaji wa wapiga kura, halitatusaidia kwa njia yoyote na ni lazima wananchi walilikataze jambo hilo kabisa.Bw. Naibu Spika, ningetaka kusema kwamba sisi katika sehemu ya Kitui tumekumbwa na hali ya kiangazi na sasa tumekosa mvua kwa mizimu miwili. Ningeiomba Serikali ifanye mipango kamili ya kuwasaidia watu wa sehemu hii kwa msaada wa chakula kwa sababu baada ya miezi miwili, tutakuwa na njaa.Kwa hayo machache, naunga mkono. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Co-operative Development (Mr.Cheruiyot): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute on the Budget speech. Before I say anything, I would pay the greatest tribute to His Excellency the Vice-President for presenting a budget that is very fair. More important, I would like to commend his officers for the tireless efforts they have made in bringing up very constructive ideas and facts in the budget.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, the time has come when people like the supplies officers at the Treasury, the procurement officers, officers who deal with taxation measures, should be taken for advanced course to be able do their jobs properly. I am saying so because in many African countries, you cannot talk of any recurrent or development budget because it does not exist. You hear stories in countries like Zaire, where individual Ministers are given cheques to be fully responsible for whatever they spend. You hear of countries like Uganda where they no longer [The Minister for Co-operative Development]discuss development expenditure. If you go to Ethiopia, they no longer talk of development or any financing but rather they only talk about security and the welfare of the people in power. They are so uncertain about the future that they do not know what is going to happen in the country tomorrow. In the streets of Ethiopia now, the situation is so bad that you cannot sit down to budget.Therefore, this country must be commended and the officers who are responsible for preparing the budget must be fully commended. We are only accused of not doing this or the other by people who do not appreciate the fact that we are trying our best under the existing circumstances. The whole world is now in recession. Inflationary trends have lead many countries to be in financial crisis. It is now summer in some countries and many tourist centres are now hard hit because tourists cannot travel. Kenya should be commended because we are walking on a very difficult budget at a time when there is a recession. The budget is not biting the low income person or the consumer. At the same time, we are able to finance the budget deficit and this is why I am saying this is a very difficult budget This is why I will continue giving tribute to His Excellency the Vice- President for preparing such a nice budgetMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, with regard to my Ministry, I would like to thank the Minister for removing the presumptive tax on milk. It was only the other day that we decontrolled milk prices and today, many dairy farmers are going to benefit Although grass and fodder for cows is very expensive, I hope the removal of this tax, will assist the farmers a great deal. So, the decontrolling of milk prices, coupled with the removal of the presumptive tax, will help to improve the dairy industry. It is gratifying to note that the cash flow at the Kenya Co-operative Creameries has improved tremendously and we hope that we are not going to have problems in paying farmers in the very near future.The other area touched on by the budget was the areas of import duty exemption on industrial machinery. It was only the other day when the Minister for Industry allowed industrialists to import second-hand equipment However, second hand machinery will cost you almost 100 times as much as new machinery. This is because new machines are very expensive and a developing country like Kenya cannot afford. So, if those who own small-scale industries would be allowed to import secondÂ¬hand machinery as long as they are in very good conditions, this would assist them a lot.Mr. Temporary Deputy speaker, Sir, we are also very pleased to note that there is now not going to be any duty on machinery worth shs.40 million to shs.50 million. This is very encouraging because it means we shall now be able to set up small industries. In a country like Italy or India, people are flourishing on small-scale industries which are owned by small entrepreneur. This has been made possible because of exemption of duty on. machinery.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is, therefore, imperative and very important that we should appreciate the fact that there is no duty now on some of the machinery and this also goes for packaging. This is because if we are going to encourage export promotion; if are going to ensure that bring some hard currency into this country, regardless of how much we do, we should deliberately move out to ensure that we encourage our people to export. The basic export which does not require any skills is horticulture., I am saying so because it falls under my Ministry and we have gone out full blast to encourage our farmers to export When duty was removed on packages, certified seeds and anything that would encourage horticulture we thought this is a very good incentive; it is something which should make farmers to focus their attention on very many markets in Europe and the United where we can earn a lot of hard currency.On Development expenditure, the Kenya Government is going with erecting buildings with its money. The other day we were told that teacher training colleges would be built in Bungoma, Kitui and Voi would be build with Kenya Government money. No country ever now does any development budget. It is sad that although Bondo has been given a fantastic teacher training college, in fact one of the most modern in this country, it is so contradictory a member of opposition, who comes from Bondo, has been arguing that Kenya should not get any foreign aid. I think it was very good for the Government to have given such a college to that constituency to show the critics that when they go round world capital cities accusing Kenya and asking that we be denied loans they are cheating the world. They can see that the Kanu Government is succeeding and it will continue succeeding forever.The other thing is the fact that the opposition is also attacking the Electoral Commission. No so long ago last year they were campaigning very strongly, telling the foreign countries that we had no security of tenure forjudges, Attorney-General and the Controller and Auditor-General. They campaigned until we thought they had a case and the Kanu accepted and we restored the security of tenure of those four big offices. The Electoral Commission falls under the same category. It has been appointed under the Constitution of this country and should, therefore, enjoy the security of tenure. What has the Electoral Commission when it has been appointed in line with the Constitution of this country but now opposition has round to say it should be disbanded, litis is violating the Constitution and it shows they do not know what they are telling us and we should notlisten to them even when they say that we should boycott registration of voters. All that we can do now is to appeal to Kenyans of voting age to register in large numbers because the opposition are now panicking and are cheating. On one hand they say "do not register" and at the same time they make a call for people to register. We should never listen to the opposition; we should go ahead and we shall win the election with a landslide. As a Kanu Government we should start campaigning so that we make sure that we continue to bring this country to peace and prosperity.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the President for being one of the bold presidents to meet Mr. de Klerk. Many countries have attacked South Africa but you cannot never fear somebody; you have to a dialogue with him and express your views. I know many countries have complained many times that we are allowing South Africa landing rights in this country. For the last 23 years no head of state has landed in Cape Town. The President's land there is very commendable and it should go down in history as having encouraged de Klerk, who is already doing very well, to make sure that there is racial harmony in South Africa. We should not make empty speeches but should encourage him.With these remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Information and Broadcasting (Mr. Kachilla): Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ill nami nizungumze kuhusu Bajeti hii, ambayo imefanywa kwa uangalifu sana. Ningetaka kumpongeza Makamu wa Rais na Waziri wa Fedha kwa sababu alikuwa mwangalifu wakati huu, ambao umekuwa na majanga mengi hapa nchini kama vile njaa. Tungependa Bajeti hii ibake kama ilivyosomwa. Hii ni sababu mara nyingi Bajeti nzuri inaharibiwa na watu wanaopandisha bei ya bidhaa ambazo bei yake imewekwa na Bajeti. Ningetaka tuliangalie jambo hili kwa sababu ingawa ushuru wa magari umepunguzwa na watu wengi watanunua matatu nauli ya magari hazijasimamiwa. Sijui kama ingewezekana nauli hizi zikasimamiwa na Serikali ili wakati wenye magari wanapotaka kuongeza nauli wawe wakitoa sababu za kufanya hivyo kwa Ofisi ya Makamu wa Rais na Wizara ya Fedha. Kwa vile ushuru wa magari umepunguzwa hatungetaka kusikia nauli zimeongezeka baada ya wiki mbili.Pia mashirika yanatengewa pesa lakini ni lazima tuwe na utaratibu maalum wa kuhakikisha pesa zinazotengwa zinatumika kulingana na mpango uliowekwa, na kuwaadhibu wanaokosa kuufuata mpango huo. Mara nyingi tunatoa mawazo mazuri katika Bunge hili kuhusu mambo kadhaa. Ikiwa sisi ndio tunaoweza kuishauri Serikali sioni kwa nini mara nyingi tunalia kwamba watu wanaokosea mpango wa Serikali katika mashirika mbali mbali wachuliwe hatua zinazofaa. Tusipofanya hivi na ikiwa tutawahurumia wenye makosa kila mara tutadidimia katika mipango ya fedha. Kama walivyosema Wabunge wenzangu ningetaka kuwaunga mkono kwamba tungetaka watu waajiriwe kutoka kila mahali. Utaona kwamba katika mashirika mengi ikiwa mkuu wake ni Mtaita ni Wataita tu wanaoajiriwa katika shirika hilo. Huo si uzalendo; tunataka kuwe na uzalendo kamili ili kumsaidia Mtukufu Rais.Tumezungumza juu ya ukamilishaji wa viwandavya mipango yajua kali. Tungetaka kuwa na mpango wa kusambaza stima kaitka vijiji na vitongoji. Hii ni kwa sababu bila ya stima hakutakuwa na mipango mizuri yajua kali. Watu wengi walioanzisha viwanda vyao vya jua kali wanakumbwa na shida ya ukose wa stima viwanda vyao. Wengine wana mashine ndogo ndogo ambazo zingekuwa kama viwanda. Ningetaka Wizara ilichunguze jambo hili. Siju kama Wizara hii inachunguza mambo haya huko kwangu. Hii ni kwa sababu kuna laini ya stima huko tarafa ya Voi ambayo imepita moja kwa majo hadi ilikotakikana na hali huku katikati watu hawana stima. Laini hii ingetumiwa kutoa stima kwa watu wengi ili na shirika lipate peza zaidi. Madhumuni sio kupeleka stima mahali pamoja: madhumuni ni kuwapa watu wengi stima na kwa sababu wanalipia huduma wanayopewa na shirika la stima Serikali itanufaika pia.Umeme umechukuliwa kutoka huko Kati(?) na umeelekezwa upande wa Mtau, Voi Division, na hautumiki kwa umbali wa zaidi ya kilomita 12. Kwa hivyo, pesa zikitolewa, tunataka kila sehemu nchini zifikiriwe. Hata katika upande wa jua kali, ni lazima nguvu za umeme ziwepo ili sekta hii iweze kustawi.Ningependa kusema machache juu ya Rural Development Fund. Kwa kusema ukweli, pesa hizi hazifanyi kazi yoyote katika sehemu nyingine hapa nchini. Nasema hivi kwa sababu nina mfano mzuri katika mawakilisho yangu kule Divisheni ya Voi. Mahali pengine, mpango huu haufanyi kazi kabisa. Kwa mfano, utapata kwamba kuna mradi wa zahanati ambao ulianzishwa mwaka wa 1989, na hadi sasa haujakamilishwa. Je, mradi utakamilishwa lini? Jambo kama hili linaharibu jina la Serikali. Tenda inatolewa, vifaa vinapelekwa pale na hakuna mtu wa kuvipokea. Vifaa vingine uharibika kwa sababu haviwezi kuhifadhiwa na inatakikana vitumiwe mara moja. Tuna zahanati moja inayoitwa Tauka Health Centre ambayo ilianzishwa mwaka wa 1989 na haijakamilishwa mpaka leo. Tuna miradi mingi kama hiyo.Tungependa Serikali itoe jicho lake na iangalie sehemu kama hizi. Ikiwa kuna sehemu ambayo pesa hazikutumika sawa sawa, basi inafaa Serikali ichukuwe hatua ili jina lake lisiharibike. Hii ni kwa sababu kuna watu ambao wanataka kuliharibu [The Assistant Minister for Information and Broadcasting]jina la Serikali kwa njia hii.Ningependa kusema machache kuhusu barabara. Tunataka zile sehemu ambazo zina ardhi yenye rotuba zifunguliwe kwa kutengeneza barabara nzuri ili wakulima waweze kusafirisha mazao yao. Kwa wakati huu ningependa kuiomba Serikali izingatie sana kilimo kwa sababu tiimekumbwa na njaa. Sasa tunasikia kwamba Kenya imekumbwa na njaa kwa sababu wakulima hawawezi kufanya kazi yao sana sana katika sehemu zinatoa chakula kama vile Molo na kwingineko. Ni lazima sasa Serikali itilie mkazo katika upande wa kilimo katika sehemu hizi ili tuweze kupata chakula. Serikali isipofanya hivi, tutakuwa na shida zaidi. Kwa sababu watu wakiwa na njaa, hawawezi kutulizwa kwa vyovyote vile. Ingefaa .zile sehemu ambazo zina ardhi yenye rotuba, ziingiliwe sawa sawa kwa sababu tuna hatari ya kuwa na njaa hapa Kenya. Sasa tuna shida ya wakimbizi kutoka Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia na kadhalika na nina hakika kwamba tusipoingilia kilimo sawa sawa, itakuwa hatari kubwa.Kwa hivyo, inafaa barabara zitengenezwe katika sehemu za ardhi yenye rotuba na usalama uwekwe wa kutosha ili wakulima waweze kufanya kuendeleza kilimo bila shida yoyote. Nashukuru kwa sababu timu yetu ya Wabunge ambayo imeenda kuchunguza kiini cha vita vya kikabili  nina hakika mam bo haya yamekwisha itafanya kazi yake vizuri ili tufungue sehemu hizo na wakulima waweze kuendeleza kilimo zaidi. Kwa njia hii, tunawefca kuepukana na njaa.Ningependa kuiomba Serikali itengeneze barabara katika sehemu inayoitwa Rongonyi katika Divisheni ya Voi. Sehemu hii haina barabara na hali ina ardhi yenye rotuba na mimea kama vile mboga na matunda na kahawa inaweza kukuzwa. Kuna ukosefu wa barabara huko na mimea hii haiwezi kusafirishwa hadi sokoni. Jambo hili linawaua moyo wakulima. Kwa sababu ya shida hii, nauli kutoka sehemu hiyo hadi Voi sasa ni zaidi ya Kshs.100.00 na mtu hawezi kutembea na mzigo mkubwa. Kwa hivyo, shida hii imezorotesha ukulima katika eneo hili. Ingefaa Wizara itenge pesa za kutengeneza barabara hii ya Rongonyi ili vyakula kutoka sehemu hiyo viweze kusafirishwa hadi kule vinakohitajika.Ingefaa pia Serikali ifikirie juu ya kilimo cha kunyunyizia mashamba maji. Tuna maji katika Kenya na kwa wakati huu wa kiangazi, tungekuwa tunaendesha kilimo cha kunyunizia mashamba maji katika maeneo mbali mbali. Hata kama Bura imekuwa na shida, kuna sehemu nyingine ambazo zinaweza kulimika vizuri kama kungekuwa na maji ya kutosha.Naunga mkono. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Home Affairs and National Heritage (Mr. Nooru): Asante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipa nafasi hii ili nami niseme machache kuhusu Hoja hii.Jambo la muhimu sana katika makadirio yoyote ni ushuru. Hii ni kwa sababu hatuwezi kuongea juu makadirio kama hatuna pesa. Kwa hivyo, ni lazima Serikali itafute njia ya kujipatia pesa za matumizi. Lakini kama hatuwezi kujitahidi sawa sawa, tunaweza kufanya mipango ambayo itawafahidi watu wachache tu. Hakuna maana ya kuwatoza wananchi ushuru kama pesa hizo hazitaingia katika mfuko wa Serikali. Kwa mfano, wananchi wanatozwa ushuru wanaponunua Jbidhaa aina mbali mbali na kama uchunguzi unaofaa haufanywi viwandani na kwingineko, itakuwa kazi bure kama pesa hizi hazitaingia mfukoni mwa Serikali. Kwa hivyo, ni lazima tujihadhari sana na jambo kama hili.Hata katika upande wa toll stations, ni vizuri tutafute njia za kutoza ushuru ili tuweze kujiendeleza kitaifa. Lakini kama pesa hizi hazitatumiwa vizuri, itakuwa tunafanya kazi ya bure. Ni lazima maofisa wa Serikali ambao wamepewa jukumu ya kutumia pesa hizi, wafanye kazi yao kikamilifu. Kwa mfano, mtu anaweza kupokea ushuru wa Ksljs.1 milioni na anajuwekea Kshs.10,000.00 na hali anapokea mshahara kila mwisho wa mwezi. Kwa hivyo, ni lazima watumishi wa Serikali wawe wazalendo ili tuweze kuwa na maendeleo mengi katika nchi hii.Kwa wakati huu kuna recession ulimwengi na kama hatuwezi kutumia pesa zetu vilivyo, itakuwa vigumu kufanya maendeleo yoyote. fj Kwa hivyo, kuhusu matumizi ya pesa za Serikali, ni lazima watu watumie bongo zao kwa sababu hatuwezi kuwa na pesa za kutosha kuwahudumia wananchi ikiwa hatuna njia nyingine za kutuwezesha kutoa huduma hizi. Tusipofanya improvisation, kazi yetu itakuwa bure kabisa.Imesemekana katika Makadirio haya kwamba Idara ya Income Tax itachanga Sh.l milioni na kwamba idara hii ina upungufu. Tungefaa kujua upungufu huu umetokana na nini. Bila accountability katika ukusanyaji na matumizi ya pesa zetu, tutakuwa tukifanya kazi bure. Tutaendelea kuongea juu ya Bajeti, lakini baada ya miezi mi'tatu hivi, utaona kwamba tunarudi nyuma badala ya kwenda mbele. Wale ambao wamepewa jukumu fulani ni lazima walitimize kwa uangalifu mkubwa.Jambo la pili linahusu ugharamiaji wa miradi ya maendeleo. Ingefaa tuuangalie utaratibu wa priorities zetu kikamilifu. Wale ambao wanahusika na jambo hili wanafaa kujua kwamba kuna sehemu fulani katika nchi hii ambako watu hutegemea mam bo fulani. Kati ya mambo haya ni huduma za afya, maji na chakula. Tunaweza kuiendesha nchi hii kulingana na uwezo wake. Ikiwa tumetoa huduma kiasi fulani katika sehemu mbali mbali, tunafaa kuangalia njia nyingine za kuendeleza huduma hizo. Utaratibu fra kupanga order of priorities unafaa kuangaliwa kwa makini sana ili tusije tukarudi nyuma. Watu ambao [The Assistant Minister for Home Affairs and National Heritage]wana jukumu la mpango huu, wanaziangalia tu sehemu ambazo ni potential. Ikiwa sehemu fulani ya nchi ina rutuba, watu wetu huitumia kukuza mimea na kujenga nyumba zao, ambapo sehemu hiyo huendelea kwisha. Bila kufikiria ni kwa njia nyingine gani tunaweza kujiendeleza hasa kwa kutumia sehemu za nchi zilizo kame  itakuwa vigumu kujiendeleza ipasavyo.Hapo awali, tulikuwa tukiiendeleza nchi hii kwa michango ya Harambee, lakini siku hizi imekuwa vigumu kwa wananchi kuendelea kujihusishwa na michango hii. Hata hivyo, hatufai kulegea katika jambo hili kutokana na hali iliyopo ya kisiasa. Tunafaa kuendelea kuiunga mkono Serikali yetu kwa sababu bila usaidizi wa wananchi wote, ni vigumu sana kwa Serikali kuendelea kutoa huduma. Kwa hivyo, wananchi hawafai kukaa kitako tu na kuitegemea Serikali peke yake. Wale ambao wamepewa jukumu la kupanga miradi ya maendeleo wanafaa kuiangalia kila pembe ya nchi yetu. Hatuna haja ya kuwapokea wageni wanaotoa misaada katika Nairobi na miji mingine mikubwa peke yake; bali tunahitaji kuwatembeaza pia katika sehemu zilizo na taabu sana ili wao wenyewe wajionee taabu hizi. Maofisa wanaosimamia matumizi ya pesa za Serikali na mipango ya maendeleo wanafaa kuwaza vifya kuhusu jambo hili. Bila kufanya mabadiliko kama haya, halulawcza kujiendeleza vizuri.Katika miaka 30 ambapo tumekuwa huru. hatujawai kuwa na mradi wa maendeleo hata mmoja uliosaidiwa na watoa misaada katika Wilaya ya Mandcra kwa jumla. Si eti kwamba watoa misaada hawa hawaijui Mandera au hawataki kuisaidia miradi ya maendeleo huko, bali usaidizi tunahitaji kule ni tofauti na ule unaohitajika katika sehemu nyingine nchini. Ingefaa tuliangalie jambo hili kwa makini sana. Hali ya ukame imezidi katika Mkoa wa Kaskazini-M&hariki na bei za vyakula ni kama vile ambavyo tumeambiwa hapo awali. Kwa mfano, kilo moja ya sukari ni Sh.30/= katika Nairobi. Ikiwa kilo 50 za sukari ni Sh. 1,500/=, hii ni kusema kwamba kilo moja ni Sh.30/=. Gharama ya kusafirisha gunia moja mpaka Mandera ni kama Sh.400/= na, hivyo, gharama yote ya kuisafirisha sukari mpaka Mandera ni kama Sh.3,500/=. Hii inamaanisha kwamba bei ya sukari kule ni Sh.35/= kwa kilo moja.Wakati tunapokubaliana na sukari katika mpango wake wa kuwapatia wakulima motisha, ingefaa pia Serikali iziangalie sehemu kavu katika nchi hii. Bei ya mahindi ikiongezeka, wakulima walio katika sehemu zenye rutuba hufaidika, lakini wale tunaoishi ambapo mahindi hayamei na ambapo tunategemea tu bidhaa za kununua huumia sana. Serikali inafaa kuziangalia sana sehemu hizi zilizo kame. Tunaishukuru sana National Cereals and Produce Board kwa sababu imejaribu kuifikia kila wilaya. Kenya National Trading Corporation pia inafaa kupanga mipango yake kulingana na mahibyi ya wananchi ili tupate usaidizi katika sehemu zilizo kame.Jambo lingine ni kwamba wakati hali ya ukame inapoendelea kwaumiza wananchi, Wazara ya Ustawi wa Mifugo inafaa kututafutia soko la mifugo. Utakuta kwamba kuna bodi nyingi, kama vile Cotton Seed and Lint Marketing Board, Coffee Board of Kenya na kadhalika, lakini hatuna bodi ya mifugo. Tungependa kuwa na bodi ya mifugo yenye maofisa wanaoweza kutembea katika kila sehemu ulimwenguni na kututafutia soko la mifugo huko. Hivi sasa, wananchi wanaangalia mifugo yao ikifa bila usaidizi wo wote.Kwa hayo machache, Bw. Naibu wa Spika wa Muda, naunga mkono. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Regional Development (Mr. Okwara): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me time to support this Motion. This year's Budget was well balanced and meant to cater for the mwananchi. Wananchi have applauded this Budget and are happy with it. It is their hope that there will be no unnecessary mini-budgets in the course of the year. Although mini-budgets are very important and sometimes very necessary, we have to understand that the ordinary mwananchi does not understand what a mini-budget is all about. Therefore, if the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance has a way of providing the money that is required, it should do so without having to resort to mini-budgets.1 would like to say that the money that has been allocated to Ministries is enough if only it is going' to be used properly. At this time of accountability and transparency, we have to be frank and mention certain areas which bring about lack of money. As you know when we tell Back-benchers, in answer to their Questions, that there is no money, they are not happy about this. Let us examine how tenders, for example, are handled. It is high time the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance re-examined our tendering system and awarding of contracts. This is where we lose money. There is no point in pretending that the Ministry does not know this. I assure you our tendering system is one of the most difficult areas, and if we do not handle it well, people will not be happy. It is, therefore, time we reÂ¬examined, overhauled and made this system transparent.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am saying this because at one time we wanted to include a Member of Parliament in our tendering board in our district but it was a very difficult matter. Every excuse under the sun was given. The Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance should be able to tell us why we still have somebody called General Superintendent; a fellow who sits somewhere in [The Assistant Minister for Regional Development] Switzerland to lode at contracts and machinery being imported. That is the only job he does and then he earns his commission. This must be abolished. We have enough engineers and other experts. If we are importing drugs our own local experts should examine these drugs and determine whether the drugs are good. The money paid to thjs fellow must be reduced during the current Budget period.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we also have the Crown Agents. These have been operating since the colonial days. I have had the opportunity of dealing with these people years back and these fellows claims to have every commodity to supply. But what they do is very simple; they just send letters around the world and when they obtain the goods they come to tender. On top of the actual price they have got to earn commission. They must make money for their running expenses. The Ministry should cut off this one. This is because after all the Crown Agents is not a local firm; it is foreign company. If they are still earning any money in Kenya it is high time they were told enough is enough.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Butere is part and parcel of Kenya. Why is it that the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance cannot direct banks to open branches in Butere and Khwisero? You will agree with me that without banking facilities there can be no economic development. The people of Butere has been crying for these services. They have been provided with mobile banking services but this mobile banking unit goes there once in a while. They transact business in the open; you can deposit or withdraw money when everybody is watching. This has scared away traders. They cannot bank their money any more. The Kenya Commercial Bank had a branch in Butere and a mobile bank in Khwisero. Why should these people suffer after 28 years or so of Independence? Why should this be allowed to happen? I am requesting the Ministry to see to it that the people of Butere are treated like anybody else especially when it comes to banking facilities.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Butere happens to be a sugarcane growing area and we pay a lot of money in the form of cess but we have no services. Even Butere Market has no toilets. The roads are in poor conditions. The Ministry concerned should direct the Kakamega County Council to improve the roads and provide toilet facilities and other necessary amenities in that area. We have a shortage of maize and sugar in my area. Just the day before yesterday the people of Butere told me to come and ask the Ministry concerned to provide them with enough maize and enough sugar. I know that wp have a shortage of maize in the country the people of Butere must be given their own share.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, reports appearing in today's newspapers indicate that certain individuals are calling for the boycott of the registration of voters exercise. I appeal to all Kenyans and in particular Butere people to go and register in great numbers. Why should we be intimidated by these fellows who are not even organized? We are not going to listen to this nonsense. Let them hold their own party elections first. I must also say that this debate which has been going on about the Luhya and so on must be understood. When a Luhya woman gives birth to a male child has an agenda that she is giving birth to Omwana.Thank you and I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation (Mr. Obure): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute on this Motion. First of all I want to thank His Excellency the Vice- President and Minister for Finance for making very excellent proposals in this year's Budget. He has done so against a background of very difficult economic circumstances. The situation in which we are at the moment  poor economic performance  is not entirely of our own making. This is a situation which has arisen as a result of what has been going on elsewhere in the world and more particularly in Western Europe, America and other countries. As a result of economic recession and depression in those countries, we have also been made to suffer very much. But nevertheless the Vice-President and Minister for Finance has made an excellent effort in preparing a very good Budget which is intended to stimulate the economy.' It is really a common man's Budget. We want to congratulate him for his efforts.What we need is the support and co-operation of everybody in order to revive and strengthen our economy. In this regard we should be patriotic and that is why I call upon all Kenyans of good will, including members of the opposition and the clergy, to support our efforts to revive and to strengthen the economy because only in so doing can we provide employment and the expansion of the economy that we need. This will enable us to create more jobs for those in our midst who are unemployed. It is important that we get that commitment from everybody because this is a matter of national priority.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I proceed, I want to make reference to a statement recently made by one of our clergymen, Dr. Okullu, in respect of Gor Mahia Football Club. He suggested that money contributed to the football club by Kanu Youth '92 should be refunded. I am one of the founder members of GOT Mahia Football Gub and I played position number 10 for that club in the early 1960's and scored several goals.. Gor Mahia Football Club is a mighty club, indeed. It is not the Luo peoples' club; it is a national club. Dr. Okullu should not sit down and imagine that Gor Mahia is just a Luo club. I am a Kisii by tribe but I played for that club. It is absolutely wrong for him to associate Gor Mahia with politics because it is a football club which cuts across all political parties. I am a member of Kanu and will remain in Kanu, but at the same time, I am a strong supporter of GOT Mahia Football Club having been a founder member of the same. It is a strange thing that Dr. Okullu should feel that when Kanu makes a donation to Gor Mahia, it is alienating anybody. That gesture is not alienating any of us and we will continue to support that club despite the fact that Dr. Okullu thinks the way he does. What Dr. Okullu has said is unfortunate and it should have not come from a person of his calibre. I, therefore, call upon him to apologize to Gor Mahia Football Club and all of us who support the club.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, turning back to the Budget proposals. We need honesty and dedication from them the officers who implement these proposals. I am saying so because the proposals may be good but what matters most is how they are implemented. It is for this reason that I call upon all those persons who are charged with the responsibility of the implementation of the budget proposals to be honest, dedicated and to avoid the temptation of becoming corrupt. That is the only way we can implement this Budget in a meaningful way by being honest and patriotic. They should abide by the Code of Regulations. This is, therefore, very important and at this juncture, I call upon the people at the headquarters of various Ministries down the line to the divisional level to utilize whatever funds that have been allocated to them strictly so that we can implement the projects for which money has been voted undo- this Budget.The crux of the matter lies on rural development projects which call for more funds. The majority of our people live in the rural areas and our development efforts should be concentrated there. I believe that by allocating more funds to the rural areas we shall provide various amenities like reasonable road network and better medical facilities. By doing so we shall be making a great contribution towards containing more people in those areas. If we do not do so, large numbers of people are going to be tempted to travel to Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu and other urban areas in search of employment and amenities which they cannot get in the rural areas. It is for this reason that I urge the Government to continually lode for ways and means of providing the amenities and infrastructure which are required for the development of the rural areas.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will now talk on agriculture in particular because I am convinced that for a long time to come agriculture will continue to be the dominant sector for the employment of people in this country. That is an area which we should strengthen. In my constituency we are financially dependent on coffee and tea on small- scale holdings. Unfortunately, in the case of coffee, it has been a declining industry in this country largely as "a result of the declining world prices, but largely also because of mismanagement by all those who have been placed in managerial positions. There are too many middle-men at the moment who operate at the expense of the small-scale former. Time has come for the Government to review that sector. We should set up management systems and train those responsible for managing that sector and to improve the coÂ¬operative movement so that the small-scale farmer can benefit in a more meaningful way out of his sweat</Newspeech><Header>ADJOURNMENT</Header><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi): Order, hon. Obure. Hon. Members, it is now time for interruption of business. The House is, therefore, adjourned until this afternoon, at 2.30 p.m. </Newspeech>The House rose at 12.30 p.m.
