Next Question. </Newspeech><i>Question No. 247</i><HEADER>EXTENSION OF ELECTRICITY IN MWALA</HEADER>Mr. Wambua asked the Minister for Energy when electricitywill be extended to the water sources of Ndeini and Kibauni in Mwala Constituency, so that these water sources can supply adequate water to the residents.<Newspeech>The Minister for Energy (Mr. Kyalo): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Electricity supply to the two sources ol Ndeini and Kibauni will be undertaken as an extension of Masii-Makutano-Makueni Rural Electrification Project The work to supply the two water sources with electricity involved the construction of a 13-kilometre high-tension line, establishing two transformer provisions and the necessary distribution network, at an estimated cost of Sh.5.8 million. My Ministry has the plans of undertaking the work as soon as the necessary funds are available. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wambua: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sure the Minister knows this area. He knows very well that Ndeini, in Wamunyu Location, and Kibauni are very dry.How soon will the said work be done to alleviate the suffering of the people of these areas who do not have water? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kyalo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, my teams are already in the area, and they have been there for almost a year now. As I have stated, when funds become available, this work will be undertaken immediately. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wambua: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I know that it is quite a big distance from Wamunyu to Kibauni, in Athi River, but Ndeini is very near Wamunyu.The work teams the Minister has mentioned are in Wamunyu. Could he make arrangements so that these teams extend their work to Ndeini, about six kilometres from Wamunyu Market? Mr. Kyalo: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have stated that as soon as funds become available, this work would be undertaken. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister insists that this work will be undertaken as soon as funds are available. We already have the printed Estimates. Going by these Estimates, could I assume that the Minister knows that the necessary funds for this work have already been estimated and that he is just waiting for the approval of this House to spend the money? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kyalo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this project is in our programme, and the printed Estimates are available, but it is one thing to have the printed Estimates and another to have funds available. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kinyunjui: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister has not answered the question put to him. Is the money for the work hon. Wambua is talking about included in the printed Estimates or not? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kyulo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have said that this project is in our programme, and this means that funds for it are included in the printed Estimates. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wumbua. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not understand the Minister's answer. He says that the money for this work is included in his plans, but does this mean that the money has been estimated? If so, how much money is going to be spent on these two projects? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kyulo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, what we have is a block allocation of money</Newspeech><Newspeech>An hon. Member: How much money has been estimated? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kyalo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the 1992/93 financial year, about Sh.7 million has been allocated for this project. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wdmbua: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Minister tell us when this money is going to be spent on these two projects which are very important as they will serve, not individuals, but many people? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kyalo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think I have already answered that question and said that as soon as funds are available, this work will be done. </Newspeech><i>Question No. 246</i><HEADER>NUMBER OF POKOTS IN TEACHER COLLEGES</HEADER>Mr. Twurith alimuuliza Waziri wa Elimu:(a)	ni Wapokot wangapi ambao walipata nafasi ya kujiunga na vyuo vya mafunzo ya ualimu kati ya mwaka wa 1990 na 1991; na(b)	ni wangapi waliopata nafasi ya mafunzo ya "in-service" katika tarafa ya Nginyang na Tangulbei katika kipindi hiki.<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Education (Mr. Karauri): Bw. Naibu Spika, naomba kujibu.Katfka mwaka wa 1990 watu wanane walichaguliwtrkutoka tarafa za Nginyang na Tangulbei kujiunga na vyuo vya mafunzo ya ualimu. Katika mvakawa 1991 watuwapatao 10 walichaguliwakutoka tarafa hizo kujiunga na vyuo vya ualimu. "Utenzi" huo haukuambatanishwa na nadhari za kikabila. Mtu ye yote aliyehitumu vizuri kulingana na orodha stahiki na aliyekuwa na jina la Kikalenjin au Kipokot alichaguliwa.Pia watu 13 walichaguliwa kujiunga na mafunzo ya ualimu ya kujierideleza. "Utenzi" huo ulifuata kamili masharti ya ustahiki. Nadhari za kikabila hazikufikiriwa. Kwa hivyo haiwezekani kutaja idadi ya watu waliofanikiwa waliotokana na kabila la Pokot. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Twurith: Bw. Naibu Spika, namshukuru Waziri Msaidizi kwa jawabu lake. Hata hivyo ningependa kumfahamisha kwamba Swali langu halijataja ukabila. Katika Swali langu nimetaja "Mpokot" na jina hilo halimaanishi ukabila. Hawa ni watu kama Wakalenjin na lugha yao ndiyo inaitwa Kipokot. Waziri Msaidizi amesema kwamba ni watu wanane walichaguliwa kujiunga na mafunzo ya ualimu mwaka wa 1900. Lakini ukweli ni kwamba ni mtu mmoja tu wa asili ya Kipokot ambaye alichaguliwa kutoka sehemu yangu. Vile vile Waziri Msaidizi ameliambia Bunge hili kwamba mnamo mwaka wa 1991 watu 10 walichaguliwa lakini ukweli ni kwamba watu wanne ambao walichaguliwa. Hili lilikuwa jambo la kusikitisha kwa sababu wenyeji wa sehemu hiyo ambao wanaweza kufanyakazi vyema waliachwa nje. Jc, Waziri Msaidizi anaweza kulieleza Bunge hili imckuaje hata assistant education officer wa sehemu hiyo hawezi kuwatambua vijana wale ambao wamehitimu elimu kiwango cha Form IV na Form VI na fcuwachagua wajiunge na vyuo vya ualimu? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Karauri: Bw. Naibu Spika, nimesema kwamba "utenzi" huu wa kujiunga na vyuo vya ualimu hauna uhusiano na ukabila. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Naibu Spika. Nafikiri yafaa Waziri Msaidizi aongee Kiswahili sanifu. Hii ni kwa sababu amekuwa akizungumza juu ya "utenzi." Lakini maana ya utenzi ni mashahiri. Tunachozungumzia hapa ni "uteuzi" na si utenzi. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Karauri: Bw. Naibu Spika, namshauri mhe. Mwamzandi aangalie kamusi sawa sawa. Hii ni kwa sababu maana ya "utenzi" ni recruitment. </Newspeech><Newspeech>An hon. Member: Uteuzi! </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Karauri: Uteuzi, Bw. Naibu Spika. Ulimi wangu umeteleza kidogo! Hata hivyo sijui ni kwa nini mhe. Mbunge analalamika kwa sababu Swali linauliza ni wanafunzi wangapi kutoka kabila la Wapokot- Ningependa kusema kwamba majina-ya Wapokot na Wakalenjin yanafanana. Kwa hivyo ni vigumu sana kujua tofauti kati ya majina haya. Wizara ya Elimu haina haja kujua mwanafunzi anatoka kabila gani. Kwa hivyo ikiwa ni Wapokot wachache ambao waliteuliwa hayo si makosa yetu. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Lotim: Bw. Naibu Spika, Waziri Msaidizi anaweza kutuambia ni watu wangapi ambao walihudhuria mahojiano mwaka wa 1990 na 1991 katika larafa hizo mbili? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Karauri: Bw. Naibu Spika, idadi ya wale waliohudhuria mahojiano haina maana. Kile kinachowekwa maanani ni ile kwuota ya sehemu hiyo. Kwa hivyo utaona kwamba mwaka wa 1990 kwuola ya Nginyang ilikuwa watu wainno wachukuliwe kujiunga nn vyuo vya ualimu. Vile vile kwuota ya mwaka wa 1991 ilikuwa watu sita. Kwa hivyo hawa walichukuliwa. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: Bw. Naibu Spika, Wizara ya Elimu imekuwa na mtindo ambao si mwema wakali wa uteuzi wa wanafunzi kujiunga n:i vyuo vya ualimu. Utaona kwamba hawaangalii maslahi ya walu wanaoishi katika wilaya inayohusika. Ni kama vile mhc. Twarilh alivyosema, kuwa kati ya watu 10 waliochukuliwa, ni Wapokot wanne peke yake ambao walichaguliwa. Hii tabia iko hata huko kwetu Bungoma. Ulnona kwamba wakati wa uteuzi tunanmbiwa kwamba Wilaya ya Bungoma imepewa nafasi 13 lakini Wabukusu walalu peke yake ndio wanachaguliwa; wale wenginc ni Wakikuyu, Wajaluo na kadhalika ambao huko si kwao. Wao huwa wameletwa pale na watumishi wa Serikali. Kwa hivyo ningependa Waziri Msaidizi atuhakikishie kwamba kila wilaya itapewa haki yake wakati ujao. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Karauri: Bw. Naibu Spika, ikiwa mhe. Makhanu angetaka Wabukusu peke yao wachaguliwe, hiyo itakuwa shida kwetu kwa sababu miongoni mwa jamii ya Waluhya kuna watu wengine ambao si Wabukusu. Vile vile nilisema kwamba majina ya Wakalenjin na yale ya Wapokot yanafanana. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Twarith: Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Naibu Spika. Kufanana kwa majina hakupaswi kusababisha shida yo yote kwa sababu kuna ofisa wa elimu katika sehemu hiyo. Watu wole katika sehcmu hiyo wanajulikana asili yao. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Karauri: Bw. Naibu Spika, kuna wale walioajiriwa kama untrained teachers na wanataka nafasi ya kwenda kujifunza katika vyuo vya ualimu. Hawa pia hupewa nafasi; sisi ha tuna ubaguzi. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wasike-Ndombi: Jambo la nidhamu. Bw. Naibu Spika. Nimemsikia Waziri Msaidizi akisema kwamba majina ya Wapokot yanafanana na majina ya Wakalenjin. Hii ina maana ya kwamba Wizara inachagua watu kuambatana na majina tu. Jc. ni kwa nini Wizara haiwezi kujaribu kuchunguza na kujua mlu analoka sehemu gani? Hii inayonyesha kwamba mtoto wangu akitaka kuteuliwa, atakwenda kule West Pokot na kujiita arap Maina na hali yeye ni Mluhya. Ni halua gani ambazo Wizara inachukua kuhakikisha kwamba wale wanaoteuliwa wanatoka katika wilaya ambako uteuzi unafanyiwa? Majina si kitu cha kuthibitisha kwamba mtu anatoka sehemu fulani. Mtu anaweza kujibandika jina la bandia. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Karuuri: Bw. Naibu Spika, mhe. Wasike-Ndombi anaelewa kwamba watu hawawezi kujibandika majina wakati wanaenda kwa mahojiano kwa sababu ni lazima watoe vyeti vyao Ikiwa mtu alatoa jina ambalo linatofautiana na lilf itipko katika cheti chake basi hataweza kuchukullw</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wasike-Ndombi: Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Naibu Spika. Kule kwetu Kakamega kuna watu ambao wanaitwa Maina. Jina hili linatumika katika makabila kama vile Waluhya, Wakalenjin na W;ikikuyu. Kwa hivyo mtu anaweza kujiita jina hilo kusudi aweze kuteuliwa ikidhaniwa kwamba yeye ni Mkalenjin. Jambo hilo likifanyika mtu huyo atakuwa amechukun nafasi ya mtu mwingine, na hiyo si haki. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Karauri: Bw. Naibu Spika, nia ya Wizara ya Elimu ni kuhakikisha kwamba walimu wole ambao hawajapata mafunzo ya ualimu wanapelekwa katika vyuo vya walimu kufundishwa. Kila wilaya au tarafa ingestahili kufnidika ikipatiwa nafasi ya kuteua walimu ambao wulachukuliwa kuingia katika vyuo hivyo na haluwczi kuliingiza jambo la ukabila wakati wa uteuzi. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Naibu Spika. Waziri Msaidizi anaweza kutuambia ni walimu wangapi walilculiwa katika Wilaya ya Pokot? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Is that a point of order, Mr. Okondo? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: Bw. Naibu Spika, ndiyo nimesimama kuloa jambo la nidhamu. Wizara inalipolosha Bunge kwa kutupatia majibu ambayo hayawezi kuluonyesha ina walimu wangapi wakabila la Pokot au wa kabila lingine. Mhe. Twarith anataka kujua ni Wapokot wangapi walioteuliwa katika vyuo vya mafunzo ya ualimu, na Waziri Msaidizi amcshindwa kutwambia ni wangapi walioteuliwa? Kwa hivyo anaweza kutuletea hesabu hiyo kesho? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Karauri: Bw. Naibu Spika, mhe. Twarilh anajua hiyo haiwezekani. Nikileta majina kesho yutalhibilisha namna gani walimu hawa ni wa kabila la Pokot auM Kalenjin? Kabla ya mhe. Twarilh kutoa nidhamu yake alitaka kujua wale waliochaguliwa kutoka kabila la Wapokot. Nimesema kwamba majina ya Wapokot na ya Wakalejin yanafanana. Wale walimu wote walioteuliwa wanatoka katika mawakilisho yake. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Twarith: Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Naibu Spika. Mpokot hailwi "arap". Badala ya "arap" tunaitwa "kwero". Mimi sasa naitwa kwero Twarith. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Could you repeat that, Mr. Twarilh? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Twarith: Bw. Naibu Spika, mimi naitwa Katurkana kwero Twarith. Wakalenjin wanatumia "arap" So-and-so. Waziri Msaidizi alipoleta majina alitaja watu wanane, na mmoja wao alikuwa akiilwa "kwero" na ni Mpokot. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Is "kwero" Pokot? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Twarith: Ndiyo, Bw. Naibu Spika. "Kwero" huyo ndiye anafundisha katika taarofa hiyo na wale wengine walirudi kwao. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Karuri: Bw. Naibu Spika, ninatakn kumhaldkishia mhe. Twarith ya kwamba walimu hawa wote ambao walifaidika kwa uteuzi huu ni watu wakutoka Baringo ya Mashoriki, </Newspeech><i>Question No. 281</i><HEADER>REASONS FOR SACKING MR. MUDENYO</HEADER>Mr. Kirwa asked the Minister for Labour: (a)	whether he is aware that on 11th September, 1991, Haraka Hosiery Manufacturers Ltd., of P.O. Box 78045, Nairobi, terminated the services of Mr. George Mudenyo and no dues were paid to him;(b)	whether he is further aware that the said company does not remit N.S.S.F. deductions to the Fund; and(c)	what action he will take to ensure that Mr. Mudenyo is paid his dues and further that the company remits the said deductions. <Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Is anyone here from theMinistry of Labour? </Newspeech>Let us go back to Mr. Ndirnngu's Question.<i>Question No. 206</i><Header>A.F.C.

Momanyi asked theMinister for Agriculture:(n) what has delayfed the payment of Mr. Orina Rabago, Tea Grower No. TE 020316, from 1985 to April, 1992 and when will he be paid; and(b) when Mrs. Zipporra K, Mainye, TE No. 020435, will be paid her total dues for 1989/90.<Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Anyone for the Ministry of Agriculture? At this juncture I want to express a bit of dismay with the performance of the Ministry of Agriculture this morning. At least they should have been here to answer these Questions because there are three Questions relating to the Ministry. Whereas I appreciate that hon. Ndong' is not here to ask his Question, but both Mr. Waihenya Ndirangu and Otieno Momanyi were here to ask their Questions. The Questions will be deferred, but it is important that the Ministry takes the business of the House more seriously.Mr. Bujro's Question for the second time. (Question deferred) <i>Question No. 285</i><HEADER>CHARGING OF DUTY BY KENYA PORTS AUTHORITY</HEADER><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Mr. Bujra not here. Next Question, Mr. Ayub Chepkwony. </Newspeech>                                                                        (Question dropped)                                                                         <i>Question No. 136</i><HEADER>COMPLETION OF KAPSOIT SONDU ROAD</HEADER><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Mr. Ayub Chepkwony not here.

Mwamzandi give an apology? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: Yes, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Please, continue, Mr. Moturi. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Energy (Mr. Moturi): This project is due for completion by the end of this year, 1992, by which time we expect Diani/Ukunda Village to have received electric power.(b)	Rio Bakery at Gazi was not included as part of the on-going phase I project when it was planned almost four years ago. It will, therefore, not benefit from the project. However, the owners of the bakery should be advised to get in touch with the Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC), and obtain a firm commercial quotation and make payment in order to get power supplied. KPLC has indicated to the Ministry that the works would cost approximately Kshs.395,000/=. The amount involves the construction of a 1.02 km of high tension line, a 1 x 200 KVA distribution transformer and 480 metres of distribution network including a service line to the bakery.(c)	Ramisi Barabarani Village was not included as part of the on-going Msambweni Rural Electrification Project Phase I and will, therefore, not receive electric power under the on-going phase I. However, the programme to electrify the village has been planned and the project will approximately cost Kshs.552,000/=. The work involves the installation of a transformer and the construction of 1.8 km of a distribution network and ten service lines. It is the intention of the Government to include it for implementation under Phase II as soon as the 'necessary funds become available. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sic, according to the Assistant Minister's reply, electricity comes from Diani to Msambweni and Shimoni. The people at the far end are supplied with electricity. What justification is there not to supply these people with electricity while people at the far end are already suppliedwith electricity? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Moturi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, work has to start somewhere and end elsewhere. So the hon. Member should appreciate the fact that this project is already included in the plan and. will be completed by the end of the year. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from part (c) of the reply, when he says that Ramisi Barabarani Village is 1.8 kilometres away from the main supply line, will he agree that he has been misled by his officers in the field? In fact, the main supply line passes overhead Ramisi Barabarani Village which is situated along the roadside. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Moturi: As far as I am concerned, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the distance given to me is 1.8 kilometres. But since the hon. Member</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mang'oll: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is misleading the House if he insists that the distance is 1.8 kilometres as given by his officers. I am sure the hon. Member who comes from the area knows better. Is he in ordes to do that? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Moturi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member should have waited until I finished my answer. As I said, the figure I have is 1.8 kilometeres, but since the hon. Member comes from the area, he might be right. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mang'oli: Now that the hon. Assistant Minister agrees that the hon. Member might be right in fact, he is right can he confirm that supply of electricity will be done to these areas as well? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Moturi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I said, Ramisi Barabarani Village was not included in the phase one programme. So it will have to wait. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi; Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not understand what the Assistant Minister is talking about here. If he says that Ramisi Barabarani Village was not included in the phase one programme, he is misleading the House. In fact, it was included is that programme. If it is the fault of his officers, then it is not the fault of the people concerned. But since I have told him that the village is not more than 500 yards away from the main supply line, can he consider including it in the next programme? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Moturi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is unfortunate that the area was not included initially in the phase one of the programme. However, we are going to include it in the phase two of the programme, </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Okay. Shall we go back to Mr. arap Kirwn's Question for the second time? </Newspeech><i>Question No. 281</i><Header> REASONS FOR SACKING MR. MUDENYO</HEADER>Mr. arap Kirwa asked the Minister for Labour: (a)	if he is aware that on 11th September. 1991, Haraka Hosiery Manufacturers Ltd., P.O. Box 78045, Nairobi terminated the services of Mr. George Mudenyo and no dues were paid to him;(b)	if he is further aware that the said company does not remit N.S.S.F. deductions to the fund; and(c)	what action he will take to ensure that Mr. Mudenyo is paid his dues and further that the company remits the said deductions. Mr. Deputy Speaker: Anyone from theMinistry of Labour to respond? None. So the Question will be deferred for the second time.<Newspeech>Mr. arap Kirwa: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. This is the second time this Question has been asked here and the Ministry of Labour does not have the courtesy to inform the House why they do not come to answer it. Can we be told through the Chair what position we are now going to take it the Ministry does not take any interest on this matter? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think it is the duty of the Chair to inform His Excellency the President that some of the Ministers are not interested in their work. In every Ministry, we have a Minister and. at least, two Assistant Ministers. How come none of them is present to answer questions here? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mang'oli: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I quite agree and support fully hon. Mwamzandi's sentiments. Since there is also collective responsibility on the part of the Front Bench, how come none of the ministers is ready to respond to this question at the moment? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Well, I am afraid, unfortunately, this Question will have to be deferred again for the second time. But the Chair takes this opportunity to express its total displeasure with this conduct on the part of the Ministry of Labour. If it is true and indeed I believe it is that this Question has come up for the second time twice in a row and there is nobody from the Ministry of Labour to respond to it, then indeed the Ministry is found to be wanting in this respect. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Falana: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Since the Deputy Leader of Government Business "total man" fell out of grace, and that position fell vacant, it appears there is nobody to take upGovernment issues seriously. I think it is due to that vacuum and that is why hon. Members are shy to take up Government business seriously. Is that correct? </Newspeech>(Question deferred)<Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Mr. Falana, I would like to draw your attention to the provisions of Standing Order No.73 (4) regarding the conduct between Members of the House. This is what it says: "No Member shall impute improper motive to any other Member except upon a specific substantive Motion calling in question the conduct of that Member"I am referring you to this particular Standing order because I heard you using some words against the former Deputy Leader of Government Business which really is out of order. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I know we have gone through the Questions on the Paper for a second time, but I have just received a telephone call from hon. Ndong' asking me to ask Question No.253 on his behalf. Would I be allowed to ask the Question now that the Minister for Agriculture has just come in? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: No, Mr. Mwamzandi! I am sure you know as well as I do that we cannot call a Question for a third time. I am sure you cannot possibly be serious on that request. Secondly, I must say that this back-door sort of approach to asking a Question on behalf of another hon. Member cannot be permitted in any event. I am saving this because I did call out this Question twice and you did not stand up to ask it on behalf of hon. Ndong'. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: Mr, Deputy Speaker, Sir. I have indicated quite clearly that I have just received a telephone call from hon. Ndong' himself asking me to ask this Question on his behalf, and the message was delivered to me by a member of the Serjeant-at-Arms' staff. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker; Mr, Mwamzandi, while I believe what you are saying to be the truth, I must unfortunately say that the message has come in a little bit too late. </Newspeech>Can we move on to Question by PrivateNotice!QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE<Header>BANDITRY MENACE IN GARSEN</HEADER><Newspeech>Mr. Wakole: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister of State, Office of the President, the following Question by Private Notice.(a)	What type of support has the Government extended to Tawahal Village in Garsen Division since March, 1992 when armed bandits massacred 18 innocent wananchi and stole 3,800 heads of cattle?(b)	Since banditry in this area has continued to escalate, could the Minister urgently post permanent security personnel there in order to contain the situation? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Dr. B.A. Godana): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I seek the indulgence of the House to have this Question deferred until this afternoon. This is due to some unforeseen circumstances<Newspeech>Hon. Members: No! No! No! </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Dr. B.A. Godana): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Members should at least have the courtesy of listening before they can start shouting. I was merely seeking the indulgence of the House to have this Question deferred until this afternoon</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mang'oli: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it really in order fix the Assistant Minister from the Office of die President which has all the machinery to get information, to come home and seek the indulgence of this House to defer this Question? Can you protect us from</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Order Mr. Mang'oli! I do not see any necessity of coming emotional on this issue. The Assistant Minister is merely seeking the indulgence of the House to have the Question deferred until this afternoon when he would be in a position to give a satisfactory answer to it</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wasike-Ndombi: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Order Paper for this afternoon has already been drawn and I wonder how this Question is going to be incorporated in it. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Dr. BA. Godana): Mr. Deputy Sir, I do not see why there is so much hullabaloo on this issue. I was merely seeking die indulgence of the House to have die Question answered in the afternoon. This is/a very sensitive Question since it is dealing with the lives of people in Garsen. Although it is a Question by Private Notice, I must say that the notice was too short for us to have obtained the relevant information. Since we do not want to take any chance regarding the accuracy of the information, that is why I am requesting the House to give me time until this afternoon to answer the Question. If the Cleric's Department is not able to fit in die Question in this afternoon's Order Paper on die ground of administrative problems, I am sure they will be able to do so tomorrow morning so that the Question can be answered tomorrow afternoon. This is all I am asking for. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Falana: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I agree with the hon, Assistant Minister that this is a very sensitive Question in that it is dealing with the lives of our people. Nevertheless, I do not know what information the Office of the President expects to get between now and this afternoon. The Office of the President should have been able to get information regarding this Question at the tip of its fingers. Do they not have</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Order Mr. Falana! The ruling from the Chair is that this Question shall appear on the Order Paper tomorrow afternoon. </Newspeech>(Question deferred)<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Home Affairs and National Heritage (Mr. Bidu): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is hon. Falana really in order to say that Members of the Front Bench are shy? I do not think Members of the Front Bench are shy in any way and therefore, I think it is proper for the hon. Member to be asked to withdraw that remark. He should have addressed himself to the Leader of Government Business instead of saying that Members of the Front Bench are shy. In fact, the Minister may be away attending to official duties particularly with regard to the on-going registration of voters. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mang'oli: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I quite agree with what hon. Falana said about Members of the Front Bench because I think they are always unable to answer Questions. In fact, even today, they have all been looking shy and that is why they have been deferring Questions. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Falana has been questioning die absence of the Leader of Government Business in die House. Is it really in order for hon. Bidu in order to respond to hon. Falana? Is he not usurping the duties of the Leader of Government Business? Can he tell us when he was appointed the Leader of Government Business in this House? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Home Affairs and National Heritage (Mr. Bidu): Mr. Deputy Speaker, hon. Falana did not say that a particular Minister is shy to answer Questions in this House, but rather he said that Members of the Front Bench are always shy to answer Questions in the House. However, die truth of die matter is that we are not shy to answer Questions here. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: The Chair is not going to allow this kind of exchange to continue. Therefore, unless there is different point of order, we shall have to proceed on to the next Older. </Newspeech><Header>POINT OF ORDER INFLATION OF SUGAR AND MAIZEMEAL PRICES</Header><Newspeech>Mr. Kirwa: On a point of order, Mr. DeputySpeaker, Sir. I rise on a point of order in relation to the current inflation of sugar and maize prices in the country. While the official Government prices for sugar and maizemeal are well known and have been officially gazetted, it is true that traders continue to overcharge consumers on these two commodities. At the moment, one kilo of sugar in my constituency will cost you shs.35/- while maizemeal will cost you over shs. 25/- per 2 kilogram packet. The price difference is more than double, which is an increase of 100 per cent. Under such circumstances we would expect to get a Ministerial Statement as to why there is a variation from the normal price to this high price. Many consumers, including some of us, cannot afford to buy sugar. I would .wish the Ministry concerned to issue a statement on this particular anomally. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Sometime during the last Session of Parliament I asked the Minister for Planning and National Development to release figures of the population census but up to know he has not done it. </Newspeech><Newspeech>An Hon. Member: To prove that you are the second largest tribe? Bring a Question on that. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: The Ministry promised to release these figures and I have no intention of raising another Question on the matter because that will be repetition. Can I, through the Chair, request the Ministry t6 release the figures of the 1989 population census now so that we know what the next election will look like? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Hon. Members: You want to prove that you are the second largest tribe in Kenya! </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we want to prove that Luhyias are even the largest tribe in Kenya! The Assistant Minister for Planning and National Development (Mr. Ogle): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member put that request sometime last year and I promise to make a Ministerial Statement sometime next week. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mang'oli: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Why could the Assistant Minister not have come here and given us the answer as he promised? He promised to give this information last year and then disappeared. I hope now he is serious because we need this information. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Planning and National Development (Mr. Ogle): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the important thing is for a Ministerial Statement to be made. I have given this undertaking and I think it does not serve any purpose for the hon. Member to pursue the issue of why it has taken long to make the statement. The fact of the matter is that the issue will be looked into and a statement issued next week. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Health (Mr. Ogur): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Did I hear hon. Mang'oli say that hon. Ogle disappeared sometime back from the Kenyan scene? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Order, Mr. Ogur! It could have been a figment of your own imagination because you are not sure whether hon. Mang'oli said those words. But I do not think it is in order for us to continue labouring this minor point. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Since this issue has been pending for a long time, I am sure hon. Ogle can make a statement either this afternoon or on Tuesday afternoon instead of giving us a vague next week. Can he specify whether he will make the statement either this afternoon or tomorrow afternoon? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Order, Mr. Okondo! The Assistant Minister has heard and he has undertaken to do the needful. Let us give him the time he has asked for on the statement issue. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. "Sometime next week" is very vague. Can he be specific? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Planning and National Development (Mr. Ogle): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, to be specific, next week on Thursday is what I mean by "sometime next week".</Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assitant Minister for Health (Mr. Ogur): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. There is somebody speaking in this House who resembles hon. Okondo. May I be told who this man is because from the way he is speaking he is not hon. Okondo at all? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: .Hon. Ogur, I believe the man here is hon. Okondo, the Member of Parliament for Bunyala. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Hon. Ogur has been deserted by some of his friends and so he cannot distinguish between me and somebody else. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Homes Affairs and National Heritage (Mr. Lalampaa): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think we have serious business before the House and the kind of points of order we are raising here are not really very important to this nation. So, can we go to the next important business? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kubo: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. While it is true that hon. Makhanu had raised this issue and it is important for the nation to get the information, there is a hidden agenda in it because there has always been this idea of which tribe has more people in this country. It is not necessary to go on debating this matter because by asking such questions we are highlighting these tribal differences. This is because there has been a debate Mr. Deputy Speaker: Order, Mr. Kubo! I think you are taking the House backwards. Next Order, please. </Newspeech>                                    MOTION<Header>WRITE-OFF OF A.F.C. LOANS TO RAMISI SUGARCANE OUTGROWERS</Header><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the following Motion:THAT, in view of the fact thatRamisi sugarcane outgrowers are unableto repay the loans advanced by the Agicultural Finance Corporation due tothe collapse and subsequent closure ofthe Ramisi Sugar Factory; and realisingthat the interest on the loans granted continues to accrue every month; andfurther noting with dismay that the said corporation has threatened to auction thefarms which the farmers lodged as security; this , House urges the Government to write off the loans asthe closure of the company was anevent which the farmers and A.F.C. didnot expect.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we realise that sugar, as a commodity, is esential in any given country and any shortage of this commodity is taken with seriouness. That is why an hon. Member has just complained here that the price of sugar today is as high as shs35/- a kilogramme while the gazetted price is less than this amount. We have enough land in this country where we can grow sugarcane. Ramisi in my area is one of the places where sugarcane was being grown. You will realise the closure and collapse of Ramisi Sugar Factory in 1988 has created a lot of problems in that area.You will realise that when the factory collapsed a lot of sugarcane was in the field and farmers could hardly do anything to the tons of the crop that were decaying in the shambas. This, to my belief, was a calamity like drought or arson because the sugarcane in the field, worth KShs.270 million, could not be saved. Although there were some sugar factories in operation in Western Province, the sugarcane that was rotting in the Coast Province could not have yielded anything even if it was taken there for processing.[Mr. Deputy Speaker left the Chair][The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kubo) took the Chair]Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, despite the fact that a lot of sugarcane was decaying in the field, theAssociated Sugar Company, Ramisi, could not pay the outgrowers KShs.14 million owed to them. The Minister informed me that this money would be paid this month and I cannot be sure unless the money is paid. The Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC) is busy pursuing the farmers to repay the loans, in which case they are right because the Government has not come out in the open to decide what should be done with the loans. Interest on these loans continues to accrue so much so that a loanee with KShs.30,000.00 is now being asked to repay about KShs.70,000.00. There is danger in that if the Ministry does not help the farmers out of this calamity all the farms whose title deeds were launched as security are going to be auctioned. There is danger right now in that some people are colluding with the AFC so that these farms can be auctioned so that they can buy them. My people are going to become landless if these farms are going to be auctioned.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the closure of Ramisi Sugar Factory was a calamity and nobody at all anticipated it. This dangerous trend where farmers may be rendered landless should be avoided. You will agree with me that this same House has been writing off loans given to unlucky farmers in thought-stricken areas. I have been here and I have seen it being done. The upcountry people have also the advantage of the Guaranteed Minimum Return (GMR) where when crops fail they are insured. This has not been extended to the Coast people. I would like to tell the Minister for Agriculture that the Coast people have the same right as the upcountry people whose loans have been written off in cases of drought or fire. I, therefore, regard the closure of Ramisi Sugar Factory to be much more serious than even drought. In maize farming you could get a few tons to sell, but with sugarcane where you do not even have a molasses factory it becomes very difficult because you do not know where to sell your harvest.For your information, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, wild pigs have always been eating a lot of sugarcane. But this time, because the sugarcane was so much in the field, the animals could hardly finish it. If the Minister has enough wild pigs in his area he can now take them to Ramisi because we have no use for the sugarcane. After all, most of it has now rotten in the field.I must thank the Government for its intention to revive sugar processing in Ramisi. This should be a reality and not a dream because the Minister has always been saying it. We have requested the Government many times to revive the project, and, only recently we were told in Kwale that sugar processing was going to be revived. The fanners were complaining a lot about their dues from theAssociated Sugar Company, but I am now glad to have been told by the Minister that the dues were going to be paid. Let this also be a reality. We would like to see the dues paid immediately; we do not want to hear that the cheque is going to be sent Jo Kwale. This is what I am pleading with the Ministry to do, and I am glad that hon. Kones is here. Hon. Kones is a hard working Assistant Minister and, although he was late this morning during Question time, he will give us a proper reply to this Motion.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Ramisi Sugar Zone employed very many people. Since the closure of the sugar factory we are facing many difficulties. I have people from Nyanza Province, particularly Luos, who were employed in that area as sugarcane cutters, weeders and others. When the factory was closed some of them went back home. When they were earning incomes from the factory they were very fat and prosperous. Now that they have nowhere to work, you will see somebody having a burden with his neck supporting his head; they have become very weak. It is lucky we, the indigenous people, can survive under those circumstances. Those people who had come from very far away to be employed have a lot of problems. During those days when the factory was operational, anyone dying from Nyanza who dies at the Coast used to be transported home for burial but these days I have come to realise that such people are being buried at the Coast. This is against their will. The factory used to employ about 3,500 people and each person had his dependants.The dependants of this factory number over 20,000 people. This factory provided employment to the people of that and they did not have to travel to Mombasa or to Nairobi to look for employment. Now that this factory has closed down, there is unemployment in that area. Therefore, the immediate revival of this factory will create employment for the local people and others from elsewhere.I am urging the Government, through this Motion, to write off the loans since the closure of this factory was an event which the fanners and the Government did not expect. If the Government had expected this eventuality, it would not have advanced loans to these farmers. The Ministry must be sympathetic to all and not necessarily those who come from their own areas. There has been a trend whereby Government Ministers take much more interest in whatever is hanpening and divert it to their own "uncles". We are all tax-payers and we belong to this Government. Therefore, we should not try to favour some areas.Ramisi Sugar Company has been closed down and yet sugarcane does very well in that part of the country. The research which was carried out by the Indians to the effect that the area is not suitable for sugarcane growing has been proved to be untrue. The Government is opening up new factories in western Kenya and yet it cannot just revive this one factory. The Minister for Labour and the Minister for Agriculture come from western Kenya and they are only interested in creating employment for their own people. </Newspeech><Newspeech>An hon. Member: They are second largest! </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: We should, in actual fact</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mang'oli: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the hon. Mwamzandi in order to imply that Ministers and Members of Parliament collude to establish factories in our area for the purposes of creating employment? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: I did not mention Members of Parliament but I think hon. Mang'oli is a board member of one of the sugar companies in western Kenya. I think I had</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mang'oli: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The hon. Mwamzandi is misleading this House by saying that I am a board member of a sugar company. I am not a member of any board. Can he tell the House the motive behind his thinking that the Ministers concerned are establishing factories in western Kenya for their own interests? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kubo): Order! Our Standing Orders do not allow hon. Members to exchange questions between themselves; they have to do so through the Chair. The hon. Mwamzandi is giving his opinion as to what he believes to be the case. Therefore, when hon. Mang'oli catches the Speaker's eye, he will also be free to express his opinion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, my own people were telling me "Look here, we have the Ramisi Sugar Factory which has just collapsed and yet the Minister for Agriculture is establishing another factory in western Kenya." We know that the Minister comes from western Kenya and although I understand he wants to be the next President of Kenya, he should appear national. We do not mind if he so wishes but we want a President who takes care of the whole country and not only his home area. I think the hon. Members have</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mang'oli: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I am wondering what the issue of the Presidency has got to do with this Motion unless Mr. Mwamzandi wants to impute ill motives against the Minister for Agriculture. The Motion is about loans waiver by the Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC). Why is he bringing in the issue of the Presidency? Which Presidency is he talking about? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: I have no ill motives against the Minister for Agriculture but it is he himself who suggested that he would like to be the next President of this country and the hon. Makhanu supported him. I think the hon. Mang'oli is also one of his supporters. These things are</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kubo): Order! Hon. Mwamzandi, I think you are very much aware of the Standing Orders of this House. You are one of the experts on Standing Orders and you know very well that you should not mix issues. Your Motion is about the writing off of AFC loans to Ramisi sugarcane farmers. I think you should stick to that subject since you also need the support of the House. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: With those few remarks, I beg to move and ask the hon. Kirwa to support the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kirwa: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mang'oli: Why is the hon. Kinva supporting the. Motion when we want to speak on it? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kubo): Order! Hon. Mang'oli, while you are quite in order to ask that, on the other hand, there is nothing like collusion because this implies that there is something that is not proper. It is quite in order and it has been a practise in the past for hon. Members to suggest who is going to second their Motions. I think the hon. Mwamzandi was quite in order to pick on the hon. Kirwa to support his Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kirwa: Thank you, Sir, for protecting me from the outbursts of the hon. Mang'oli. I would also like to thank you for allowing me to second this very important Motion moved by the hon. Mwamzandi. First of all, I would like to thank the Mover for having thought it wise to bring this particular problem before the House. A Motion like this one needs to be taken with serious consideration because we very well know that many farmers have had their loans written off because of drought. Drought is a natural calamity which is beyond the capability of, any human being or any government to stop. It is, therefore, imperative upon the Government to consider the collapse of this sugar company more seriously than the question of droughts because in a way, the Ministry concerned must have contributed to this eventuality be it directly or otherwise. Therefore, they have a share of blame for this particular collapse. You can imagine a crop like sugarcane which cannot be consumed and which ought to go through the normal processing because the usual consumption chewing is not enough to bring enough revenue for servicing these loans. While it is clear that much of the crop went to waste, the Government should have, immediately after the collapse of this factory, tried to take into consideration all the factors that were militating against the farmers. In effect, they should have tried to look for ways of salvaging many of the farmers from the problems that they are now facing. At this stage, we cannot blame the Agricultural Finance Corporation because its business was just to advance these loans. The blame lies entirely on the door of the Ministry of Agriculture because immediately it knew that this factory had collapsed, it should have taken into consideration the interests of the farmer. The AFC is supposed to give loans and make business, whereas it is the onus of the Government to consider the interests of the farmers on the ground. Some of these things, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, also take place in other parts of the country. Nzoia Stigar Company, too, has very many problems despite the recent bringing in of expatriates, and the factory is not performing well enough. The sugarcane crushing capacity that is.projected by the factory does not tally with the practical situation on the ground. As to why this is so can be best explained by the Ministry of Agriculture. These are some of the causes that militate against proper running of sugar factories, thereby engendering their possible collapse. We ought to take care of these issues before we allow any factory collapse of the kind hon. Mwamzandi is talking about. I hope the Assistant Minister here does not expect to bring an amendment to this Motion. I am not speculating anything, but if such a Motion is rejected by the House, this will be a very bad whip against the Government. These farmers did not contribute to the mismanagement of Ramisi Sugar Factory nor did they have any part to play in salvaging it because the problem was beyond them. Imagine the thousands of landless people in hon. Mwamzandi's and hon. Bidu's constituencies. Rejecting this Motion would be a very dangerous move for Kanu. I hope that the Assistant Minister is, however, a good Kanu supporter and he is going to make sure that this Motion goes through. Apart from looking into the problems of Ramisi Sugar Factory, it is also important for the Ministry of Agriculture to take into consideration various loans given by the AFC. We do not blame the AFC for taking stern action against farmers, but what one hand of the Government does must be well understood by the other hand. The question of compensation for crops eaten by wild animals, for example, is quite wanting. The problem here is that it is not for farmers to take care of wild animals. It is important for the Ministry concerned to make sure that it is well coordinated so that when there is such a serious problem as the collapse of Ramisi Sugar Factory and compensation for crops eaten by wild animals, action is taken immediately. Although different Ministries are involved in such matters, they all belong to the same Government. When such loans as the ones mentioned in the Motion continue to attract a lot of interest, they should be immediately written off in order to relieve farmers of the burden.The other issue on which the AFC might bear the blame is the mode of collection of its debts. While the AFC might say that some farmers are adamant in repaying loans, many of our farmers are willing to repay their loans. The major problem here is that the AFC officials in the field only take stern action when it comes to impounding property. In the initial formative stages of advising farmers as to how best to repay their loans, these officials do not take interest. I, therefore, urge the Ministry of Agriculture to inform the AFC of the need to properly account for any money that is collected: from farmers.I have had several cases in my constituency in which farmers have cleared all their loans, but the AFC, AND the Kenya Grain Growers Co-operative Union continue to demand further repayment of the same loans. I remember that a Question to this effect has been raised in this House on two occasions. A fanner clears his loan, but the records are not immediately reconciled. At the end of the season, the same farmer's account indicates that he still owes the loan. This loan continues to attract interest for a number of years. At the time the farmer realises that there is still a problem, the AFC tells him that he still owes it a loan. Many of our farmers are not very good in keeping records. So, when they have no receipts to prove that they have settled their loans, the AFC usually gets the benefit of the doubt. I have had more two than cases where some of my constituents have kept proper records and the AFC has been proved wrong. What I am saying, in a nutshell, is that the AFC ought to be very particular on the ground in monitoring loan repayments. Let farmers write a statement as to how they are going to repay their loans at the end of each year even if they fail to do so. In this case, the AFC will know all that happens. Some farmers repay their loans, but these repayments get stuck somewhere between the National Cereals and Produce Board and the AFC.Another area that is of paramount importance, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, is that the Ministry of Agriculture should consider introducing some kind of insurance. Such insurance is important to farmers, particularly when it comes to drought and other calamities, such as the collapse of a factory.With those remarks, Sir, I beg to second. </Newspeech>(Question proposed)<Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kubo): Hon. Members, you will realise that I have made some minor amendments to the Motion. Firstly, after the word "advanced" in the second line of the Motion, I have added the words "to them" because it makes more sense to say, advanced to them by the Agricultural Finance "Corporation". Second, after the word "farms" in the third last line, I have added the words "titles of. These are minor technical amendments which do not make any difference to the main Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mang'oli: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to contribute to this very important Motion. This private Member's Motion is clear, but it appears as if there is a tendency for the Ministry concerned to consider its own Motions to be more important than private Members' Motions. You will find that when we are deliberating on the Ministry's Vote the permanent secretary and AFC officials seated here taking down notes. It is not understandable why we should be debating this Motion here without having these technical people here to take down notes. This means that the Assistant Minister here will have to take the information we are giving here to the Managing Director of the AFC because the latter is not here to listen to what we are saying. So, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in future, particularly when we are discussing Motions such as this one the Ministry under which the Motion falls must send its officers here so that they may take note of what we are saying. There are permanent secretaries, deputy secretaries under secretaries and senior assistant secretaries. Also we have officers in the A.F.C. and they should be here. Why are they taking Motions for granted? This Motion is asking the Government to write off the amounts of money loaned to farmers by the A.F.C. The A.F.C. is the institution which will write off this money. Since the institution is not represented here it will be difficult for the management to know what the feelings of Members are. So, I hope that as soon as this Motion is passed the A.F.C. will be informed so that action is taken immediately to write off those loans. We are asking the A.F.C. to write off these loans because the farmers are unable to repay them, not through a fault of their own. The problems facing the farmers are not of their own milking. So, I would like the Minister to approach the Treasury so that the A.F.C. may get more money to assist the farmers. This is because credit facilities which used to exist in the past are no longer there. The A.F.C. itself has no money.While considering the problems facing fanners in Ramisi the Minister should also consider giving more money to the A.F.C. so that it may lend it to other farmers as well. I have in mind also farmers in the areas which have been affected by tribal clashes. Farmers are camping at church compounds because their property has been destroyed. These farmers were loaned money by the AP.C. and I urge the Minister to consider writing off these loansbecause there is no way farmers in the clash areas will be able to repay the loans. The Minister should consider areas like Mr. Elgon where farmers have lost their animals. Their animals have been taken away. So, if these fanners had bought their animals using money loaned to them by the A.F.C., the Minister should consider requesting the A.F.C. to write off those loans. We are talking about Ramisi Sugar Company. I wonder why the Minister has taken so long to realise that the Ramisi Sugar Company needs to be rehabilitated so that it can resume buying sugarcane from farmers in Ramisi. Contrary to the views expressed by my brother hon. Mwamzandi, sugar factories have been established in western Kenya for the simple reason that sugarcane grown in those areas has a higher sugar content than the sugarcane grown in Ramisi. So, if we want to increase sugar production in this area we must go to those areas where sugarcane has a high sugar content Sugar factories in that pan of the country have been established on merit; not just to provide jobs for people in those areas. I am not blaming anybody. What I am saying is the obvious.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, directives have been given regarding the rehabilitation of Ramisi Sugar Company. I hope that the necessary steps will be taken to re-open the Sugar Factory at Ramisi for the benefit of farmers in that area We import sugar when in fact we are capable of producing enough sugar in this country. The Minister should try to raise the KShs.14 million required to pay the farmers. If there is no money, the Minister should say that there is no money. We are currently registering voters and it will be difficult for our brother to tell wananchi, when they go back home to ask for votes, why certain things have not been done. If farmers' interests are taken care of, they will remain in Kanu and they will vote for Kanu. We are not saying that farmers should be given free money. We want them to be given what is rightfully theirs so that they may be able to educate their children. This is because without money, they cannot educate their children. I am told that even the school which was there at Ramisi has been closed. What we are talking about is money belonging to farmers, which ought to have been paid to them. So, we want this money to be released to them. The Government should re-open that school for the sake of the children. It is very difficult to give mere promises to farmers who have been displaced, and something practical must be done to assist them. I am sure that the Minister will not amend this Motion because it is asking for the obvious. It was not the fault of the farmers that the Ramisi Sugar Company collapsed. We cannot even blame the A.F.C. for that. We are urging the Government to give money to the A.F.C. so that the A.F.C. can assist the farmers. The interest on these loans may have exceeded the principal five times. So, this matter should be looked into. This matter should be looked into because the problems ofthese farmers are known. No interest should be allowed to accrue on these loans because the farmers are not making any money at all. Loans advanced to farmers in Ramisi should be written off and every effort should be made to ensure that they do not lose their land. As we speak here, we do not know whether the auctioneers are on the farms. You may find that while we are debating this Motion die auctioneers may be on the farms auctioning animals and other things. I hope the Minister will restrain the A.F.C. and the auctioneers from selling farmers' property. The A.F.C. should be told to hold on until this matter is looked into.With those few remarks, I beg to support theMotion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kiilu: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir for also giving me this opportunity to join my colleagues in contributing to this Motion brought by one of our colleagues.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the people of this area appealed to their Member of Parliament so that the Government could take stem measures to ensure that their land is not auctioned. If the Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC), threatens to auction these farms and does so, it will make the farmers suffer. The Government should, therefore, look into ways and means of helping those wananchiMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that some areas have had their loans written-off. Why can the Government not write-off Ramisi sugarcane outgrowers' loans as it has done is some other areas? Since the Assistant Minister for Agriculture is here and has heard what the Mover of the Motion said, I hope that he is going to take note so that his Ministry ensures that the farmers are given back their title deeds. I also would like to request the Ministry to look into the revival of this factory after the title deeds have been returned to the owners. If this factory is not revived, the farmers will be deprived of a livelihood and will be unable to maintain themselves and families.As we are experiencing a drought in the country wananchi need to get help from our beloved Government and my request is that in case this factory is revived, the same people should be considered for employment. The Ministry should look into ways and means of reviving Ramisi Sugar Factory. These people will appreciate the Government assistance and they will also support the Government during the current multi-party era. My appeal is for the Ministry to assist the people who love this country and those who support this Government and for the people who are in Kanu. Failure to do that will result in a lot of cries within the Republic because these people will have nowhere to get their daily bread to support their families.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, perhaps the management of Ramisi Sugar Factory was very poor and that led to the collapse of this factory. At the same time, the Ministry could have not have been monitoring the state of affairs of the factory after the loans were given to the outgrowers by sending auditors there. The factory could have also collapsed due to mismanagement and lack of assistance from both the Ministry of Agriculture and AFC and I solely blame them for not monitoring the state of affairs of the factory. After assessing the state of affairs of the factory and finding out that there was need fund this factory, why did they then relax after the loan was granted to the factory? They ought to have followed lip what was going on in the factory and given the relevant advice as to how to utilize the funds. I believe that is why this company collapsed. I solely blame the field officers from the Ministry of Agriculture because they ought to have advised the farmers. The wananchi should not be blamed simply because the Ministry invested money into that factory which later collapsed. Why did the Ministry not follow up and find out how the farmers were utilizing the loan? Why did the Ministry not instruct its field officers to give the necessary advice to the farmers so that such a stage was not reached. My appeal is for the Ministry to sympathize with the owners of farms whose title deeds are being held by the AFC and who have decided to auction their farms. They should stop this auction and write off these loans like it has been done in other areas. We know of several areas where the Ministry has written-off loans. Why can the Ministry, therefore, not write off Ramisi Sugar Factory's loan as has been done in other areas? I think that might be the reason why the hon. Member referred to the western part of Kenya as an area where loans have been written-off because it is where the Minister for Agriculture hails from.	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the Minister is a national leader he ought not to favour certain areas because he comes from there. He ought to look into the interests of all wananchi. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kubo): Order! Hon. Kiilu, you are imputing an improper motive on the person of the Minister for Agriculture. It will not be in the interest of this House to be told that such loans have been written-off because if you leave your statement as it stands it will look as if there is some bias. Can you, therefore, inform the House where these loans have been written-off? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kiilu: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think you might have heard through the radio that loans in certain areas have been written-off by corporations like Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation (ICDC). </Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. Members: Which particular areas? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kiilu: Well, a former director of ICDC used to do that. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Hon. Members: Where? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kiilu: To loanees who could not afford repaying loans. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Home Affairs and National Heritage (Mr. Bidu): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Hon. Kiilu should not be left to go scot free with the statement he has made. Can he tell us an area where the AFC wrote-off loans and whose loans where these?	</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: On a point order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. For the sake of hon. Members who were not in this House in 1979 up to 1983.1 would like to draw their attention to the fact that the Government wrote-off some loans in the maize growing areas because there was drought So, the hon. Member is quite right by saying that some loans were written-off. <Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kiilu: They ought not to have followed me like that. I am sure they know this know themselves. I am very pleased with the hon. Member who saved me. In any case, we ought to monitor some of those things.According to my own views, it is quite in order to write off this loss. <Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Culture and Social Services (Mrs. Ogot): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,, Sir. It is true that some loans have already been written off. But is it in order for the hon. Member to mislead the House? We are discussing the sugar problem in the country, and particularly in Ramisi. During the 1984 drought, loans were written off to all maize fanners in the country since the crop failed. Is it in order for the hon. Member to insinuate that some areas have had their loans written off whereas Ramisi area has not? <Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kiiiu: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, that money served the people of this country, these are the same people for whom we are asking these loans to be written off today. Why should it not be done? It does not matter where those loans were written off. But the request is that the Government should write off these loans instead of trying to auction the properties of wananchi.With those few remarks, I beg to support. <Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me a chance to contribute to this Motion. I would like to inform our good Assistant Minister, hon. Kipkalia Kones, that he will have his 20 minutes at the end to respond to the Motion. So he should allow us to contribute.From the outset, Sir, I would like to correct the notion being created in the House to the effect that establishment of sugar factories in Western Kenya is a biased move and that the Ministers for Labour and Agriculture come from that area. I am not necessarily defending them, but it is obvious that this is a sugarcane-growing region. They only happen to come from there. Some time ago we had hon. Maina Wanjigi as the Minister for Agriculture, and we could not have accused him of having sent all sugar factories to the west. In any case, we have ecological zones where certain crops grow naturally. For instance, we cannot grow, say, cashew-nuts in western Kenya. So that is a preserve for Coast Province. Likewise, we cannot grow rice around Mt. Kenya area. That is a crop that grows in hon. Okondo's area and in other parts. So hon, Members should not labor too much on this issue that the Minister for Agriculture is hying to establish a sugar factory in his area just to alleviate the employment problem there. In any Calle, sugar factories are national projects and people employed there come from all over the country. For instance, the majority of workers in Nzoia Sugar Factory are not even residents of Western Province but come from other areas in Kenya.This Motion is quite valid and we request the Government to assist the farmers of Ramisi area whose capabilities to repay the loans have been hampered by the closure of Ramisi Sugar Company. Therefore, the sugarcane that was grown in the area has gone to waste. So we urge the Government to consider writing. off these loans as they have done in the past. For instance, Guaranteed Minimum Returns (G.M.R.) loans were written off some time back. Even the A.F.C. loans were also written off some two or three years ago. They were written off nationally where it was proved that some economic factors did not permit the fanners to be able to repay the loans. So it is in good spirit that the Mover brought .in this Motion and we request the Ministry to look into this problem seriously, respond positively, and also make up a follow-up of this matter. In the past we have passed various Motions here for the benefit of the people, but nothing so far has been implemented by the Government.I am particularly perturbed by the performance of the agricultural sector as a whole in the country. If we cannot take remedial measures, the agricultural sector is heading for collapse in all major crops, including food crops. If you read the Economic Survey that was released the other day, you find that everything is on the downward trend in the Ministry of Agriculture. This is not only with respect to sugarcane but in all other major crops. The fact that we have improved prices for international markets should be enough to encourage us to increase production in coffee, tea, pyrethrum, cotton and so on. But the picture painted by the Economic Survey shows that pyrethrum is collapsing, or going down. Also production of maize has dropped by 13.3 per cent; beansby 10.3 per cent; potatoes by 8.6 per cent; sugarcane by 1.7 per cent and so on. Therefore, the contribution by the Ministry of Agriculture or the agricultural sector has dropped by about 1.1 per cent. So can we have something done by the Ministry of Agriculture to rectify the situation? What is bedeviling that Ministry? Yet the economy of this country is based purely on agriculture! What is happening here? Is it the wrong policy being pursued or what? The downward trend is not related to any weather or market conditions since the market is already there for sugarcane. But why is the industry not performing?Some time back I had documents to show. That personal interest was the motive for the collapse or non-performance of that factory. So I call upon the Minister and his staff to be serious in their work. I am happy that the Minister comes from my area. He is very capable, but something is definitely wrong in his Ministry. We shall judge him by his performance and not what he has. So we would like to see some action and the right policy being pursued there.The same thing applies to the growing of tobacco in the country. They should liberalise the growing of tobacco in the country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we should encourage the farmer to produce more and more so that we can be self-sufficient in our food production.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, sugar production has gone drastically low particularly from 1998/89. In 1989, we had a fairly high rate of production, that is, 4.3 million tons. However, this has now dropped to less than 4 million tons and it is apparent that the trend of sugar production is going lower and lower down. However, I would like to thank the Government for guaranteeing a loan to revive Nzoia Sugar Company but for the sake of the sugar farmers in Kandunyi, Webuye and Sirisia area, there should not be any interference with the management. Let us leave the management alone so that they can make sure that the money we have voted here in the form of a loan guarantee from the Government is utilized for the benefit of the sugar farmers in these areas. I would like to urge the farmers to ensure that they benefit from the expansion programme by preparing their farms and growing sugar-cane in their small-scale farms. However, I have one reservation to make here</Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation (Mr: Obure): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Speaker, Sir. The hon. Member for kandunyi who was my former district commissioner in Kisii is making a very positive contribution. But he has talked about interference in the management and production of sugar in his constituency and in other areas within that region. Could he come out a bit more clearly and tell this House what kind of interference he is talking about so that we can follow his contribution. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as of the moment, we have our own African management team in Nzoia Sugar Factory, but recently the Ministry imposed on that management, some experts from abroad to come and manage the production of sugar in the factory. In fact, these experts have come to correct what they ought to have corrected much earlier. What is now going to happen is that they will cover up the mistakes which they made earlier during the initial expansion programme of the factory. This is the kind of interference I am talking about. This is why I am saying that the local African management team should be left alone to perform the management of this factory. We do not want a situation where the funds that have already been made available for the revival of this factory, are going to be siphoned through payment of very high salaries to expatriates who are doing nothing else but covering up their past mistakes. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Kones): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to respond to debate on this very important Motion. First of all, 1 would like to thank hon. Mwamzandi for bringing this Motion to the House. We do realize that there have been a lot of problems in the area of sugar production since the factory closed down. Perhaps we need to go back to some history of this factory so that we can be able to establish how we are going to deal with this case.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is important for the House to know that in 1982, a total of shs.3 million was loaned out to farmers in Ramisi sugar area and about 120 farmers benefitted from this loan. By the end of April this year, half of that money had been repaid by the farmers. It is also important to note here that some of the farmers have actually completed their loan repayment while others are still struggling to repay. At the same time, there are some bad debtors who have not repaid anything at all since 1982. This factory did not close in 1982 but much later. This means some of the farmers just thought that they were given the loan freely and therefore did not want to repay it. If some five farmers have repaid their loans in full and have been given back their title deeds, it means that somebody must have been lazy and did not pursue the repayment of these loans effectively. Perhaps there was some bit of influence around that area. These loans ought by now to have been repaid and I think it is grossly unfair to the Agricultural Finance Corporation for some of the farmers to refuse to repay their loans.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Agricultural Finance Corporation is a loaning body and if we go out of our way and start writing off loansindiscriminately, then we are going to kill it in that process. I am sure nobody wants this Corporation to be killed. So, as much as we would like to sympathize with the plight of some farmers, it is important also to ensure that the A.F.C. continues to survive. As I have already indicated, our records indicate that five farmers have fully repaid their loans and four other farmers are just about to complete their repayment. Ninety-six farmers are still continuing to repay their loans to the tune of shs.1.4 million and only 19 farmers are adamant. They do not want to repay their loans.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if we are going to be fair, we have to look at individual cases and if there is a deserving case amongst these, we shall definitely do something about it. Actually, I should go out of my way and say that a deserving case will get a write off, but it is unfair to say that we are going to write off all the loans including those where farmers have already started repaying. This would be contradictory. This is not the first time we have had a factory collapsing. In the past, we have had the collapse of the Miwani Sugar Factory which was suffering from the same problem. However, we still had farmers repaying their loans. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Culture and Social Services (Mrs. Ogot): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it really in order for hon. Makhanu to engage hon. Mwamzandi, who is the Mover of this very important Motion, when the Government responder is responding to the Motion? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kubo): I think it is quite in order for hon. Members to consult each other. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Kones): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, what I was saying before I was interrupted was that this is not the first time we have had a problem as a result of factories collapsing or getting into some bit of mess. We had the Uplands Bacon Factory, Miwani Sugar Factory, Panfoods Factory, Naivasha, Soni and Nzoia sugar factories collapsing but the farmers concerned were encouraged to repay their loans, and we are very grateful to them.For this reason, I would like to say that we are not going to treat the Ramisi sugar farmers in isolation; we would rather have the same trend to continuing. Whereas I sympathize with the Ramisi case, I would like to urge the Mover of the Motion to encourage farmers to try as much as possible to repay their loans. In the meantime. Government will be able to scrutinize individual cases which might be deserving a write-off. I would like to make a categorical statement here that the Government has stopped the auctioning of any loanee's property untilsuch time that the Government is able to say that so-and-so is able to repay his loan but is being adamant; or so-and-so is not able to repay his loans and a write off should be considered. As of now although there may have been some threat from the A.F.C. to auction farmers' property, there is not going to be any auctioning of property quoted as security. This is not to say that farmers should be lax in repaying their loans. We are going to form a small committee that is going to pursue this matter with a view to establishing who should benefit or who should not benefit from the write-offs.Mr. Temporary Speaker, Sir, I would like to inform the Mover that the shs.14 million promised to be paid, will be paid. I may not be in a position to say when, but this is a Government undertaking and the money will definitely be paid to the farmers. I do not think the Minister for Agriculture is biased in any way. I am saying this because there have been allegations being made here and there that there have been a lot of agricultural loaiis writen off in Western Province. When there is a write¬-off, or approval for one by the Government, it should cover the whole system. Of late I have not heard of any write-off in that end and I think it is unkind for anybody to try and insinuate that the Minister has divided certain loans in that area. Indeed, there has not-been any writing-off of loans. It is very difficult to write off AFC loans and everybody knows about this. It is not that the Minister just says "write off these loans". The writing off follows a long process, which should not be taken to be very easy.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Members have talked about AFC staff not updating records in good time and as a result they continue charging some monies even after a whole loan has been paid off by the farmer. I am aware of this; we have answered a Question relating to this in this House before. I would like to assure the House that stern action will be taken in future if any loans that have been paid off are found to be still accumulating some interest, which is unfair to the farmer. I am sure AFC staff have been looking into this and I think it should not continue. We expect to see improvement on this so that when a farmer completes repayment of his loan he is given back his title deed and his account closed immediately so that it does not continue attracting interest.There have also been cases in the past where a farmer takes a development loan. Guaranteed Minimum Return (GMR) loan and a long-term land purchase loan and then the three loans are put together. This has been causing confusion. But now I would like to assure the House that this has been streamlined so that if you take a development loan, a land purchase loan and a GMR loan each of them is charged to a separate account so that once you complete repaying one loan its account is closed. This will avoid confusion. Also, hon. Members who are enlightened on this should try and educate farmers toknow the specific loan they have taken so that they do not confuse issues. Sometimes hon. Members may raise Questions here only to be told that the account they are talking about is not the one whose loan repayment has been completed.Sir, I do not intend to dwell very much on this issue because it is a straightforward case. All I am trying to do is to urge the House to accept my amendment which is that, instead of actually saying that we are urging the. Government to write off the loans as the closure of the company was an event which the farmers and AFC did not expect we say that "this House urges the Government to evaluate each loan individually with a view to writing off the warranting cases". I think this one ties in very correctly with what I have been saying because if we set a precedent that we will not be able to apply to other cases it will be bad for us. We realise that everybody would like to have his loan written off if that can happen. So, if we are going to encourage this kind of thing it will be a way of killing yhe AFC. So, we will look into individual cases and we hope that we will write off the loans in some cases. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistart Minister has not told us the modalities of evaluating the cases, which is very important. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Koncs): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sure when I said this you were engaged in a political conversation with hon. Makhanu. I clearly said that we will set up a small committee to look into the process of writing off the deserving cases. It will not be left to an individual to decide because this can bring problems and even entail some corruption. I have said this and I believe the hon. Member will agree with me that a small committee should be set up to look into this matter.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, with those few remarks I beg to move the amendment Thank you. Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kubo): Mr. Kones, I think the procedure of the House is that you have to formally read the words you want to be deleted and the words you want to be inserted. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Agriculture(Mr. Kones): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sorry for not having done that. I wish to, have a all the words from "this House urges the Government" to the end of the Motion deleted and replaced with the following words "this House urges the Government to evaluate each loan individually with a view to writing off the warranting cases".</Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Culture and Social Services (Mrs. Ogot): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to second this amendment. The Ramisi Sugar Factory case has been outstanding in the minds of many Kenyans in that this factory employed very many people from all corners of Kenya. As hon. Mwamzandi has said, quite a number of people from western Kenya, Nyanza included, had been employed in this factory.I am amazed that the Ministry has not responded favourably to the plight of the Ramisi farmers. It should be noted, particularly at this very difficult time when there is scarcity of finances and food, that the matter of a factory employing 3,000 people has been discussed again and again in this House in the form of Questions but the Ministry has not responded. I hope the House will give this Motion full support and that in view of what hon. Kones has talked about the Motion will be acted upon very quickly so that the people do not continue suffering when we fully know that the Ministry ha a competent Minister and Assistant Ministers, who should not allow our people to suffer unnecessarily.I am sure that if the Minister was to look into this matter further he would find that many children in the concerned families may have forfeited their places in secondary schools this year and in the previous year because of non-payment of school fees. There is also a notion that sugar has been imported into this country. That should not happen when the Ramisi Sugar Factory can be put back into operation since it is a large one.It is good to note that most of the people have paid their loans. We hope that the Assistant Minister will keep his words to revive the factory. If only shsl4 million was needed it would have been good to learn from the Assistant Minister how much they have already put in instead of him saying they will look into the matter, when our people are truly suffering.Ramisi Sugar Factory is only one of the sugar factories which had collapsed. When the Assistant Minister is looking into the plight of Ramisi Sugar Factory he might also find out what happened in Miwani Sugar Factory because it was started but we have not heard much about it. So, we hope along with the Ramisi case the Assistant Minister will also look into the Miwani case, where quite a number of people from Kericho District, Western Province, Nyanza and other parts of the country are employed.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I there are many problems facing sugar factories in Western Province, but I do not want to talk about them since hon. Makhanu has already talked about them. But the reason why I am dragging all those sugar factories into this Motion is that I would like the Ministry to make Kenya self-sufficient in sugar. If it is a question of mismanagement, this is why you have competent people in the Ministry. How come that a factory could start quite well with a lot of Government support and, as the yearsgo by, instead of bringing in more sugar, the production dwindles to such an extent that Kenya has to import the commodity? That means a lot of problems to the workers in such sugar industries.Having said that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would now like to bring the problem newer home, and that is, the White Sugar Factory at Yala. This should be the third or fourth time that I have brought the plight of my people to the attention of this Ministry through this august House. I have seen the Minister personally about the plight of the Yala White Sugar industry, which employed nearly 500 people at its onset in mid 1980s. We are very desperate at the moment. A lot of sugarcane which was taken to the factory was never paid for and quite a number of our people have suffered greatly due to loss of job and money from the factory because payment has not been effected. I am appealing to the Ministry to assist us. In many countries, India included, it is the smaller sugarcane industries which have helped the farmers and which have also helped those who need employment. Our people should not throng the urban areas looking for white-colour jobs when the small sugar producing industries in the rural areas should be helping them get jobs. What plans does the Ministry of Agriculture have to rehabilitate the smaller sugar industries, Yala included, in order to assist our people get jobs and in order to assist our farmers get money for their sweat? I am appealing to the Minister to ensure that an answer to this question comes here, even if it is after this Motion has been passed and Ramisi Sugar Factory rehabilitated.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are loans which were given to us which were not serviced. There could also be a possibility of mismanagement as I had said earlier. After loans have been given out by the Agricultural Finance Corporation, it is up to the Ministry to check on how such loans are being serviced. If this can be done immediately the loans are given out, there should not come a time when the factory has to be closed down altogether and then the AFC threatens to sell farms and machinery. That brings a lot of suffering to the communities around the factory. In brief, I am saying that the money which is being used to import sugar from outside should be used to rehabilitate our own sugar industry for the benefit of our children.I do not want to embarrass the Assistant Minister, but there is a possibility that you, yourself, have never visited any of these ailing sugar industries. How then would you know of the plight of the farmers in our areas? I am asking you and the Minister to visit the sugar factories throughout Kenya. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kubo): Order, hon. Ogot. While you are quite in order to express your opinion, on the other hand, you [The Temporary Deputy Speaker] should address the Assistant Minister through the Chair. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Culture.and Social Services (Mrs. Ogot): I do apologise for that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. All I am asking, through the Chair, is that the Assistant Minister visits the ailing sugar industries throughout the country in order for him to assess our-plight. With those few remarks, I beg to second. </Newspeech>(Question of the first part of the amendment, that the words to be left out be left out, proposed)<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Home Affairs and National Heritage (Mr. Bidu): Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, nashukuru kwa kupata nafasi hii ili kuunga mkono Mswada huu kama vile ulivyobadilishwa.Kama inavyojulikana, mimi natoka Kwale na ninapozungumza hapa nazungumza mambo yanayohusu sehemu hiyo. Pia, ningependa kuomba kwamba ilc kamati ambayo Wizara ya Kilimo imesema itaundwa iwe na watu ambao wanatoka upande wa Kwnle ili waone kwamba haki inafanywa. Wakaaji wa Kwale wanatoka kila pembe ya Kenya; si Wadigo peke yao ambao wanamiliki mashamba ya miwa bali ni makabila yote ya Kenya ambayo yalibahatika kupata mashamba huko. Kwa sababu ya ulaghai na maarifa ya Mhindi aliyemiiifci kiwanda cha sukari cha Ramisi, taabu zilianza kuonekana katika sehemu hiyo. Mhindi huyo hakuiambia Serikali ukweli; hakusema ni nini kilichotokea mpaka akasema kwamba amefilisika. Ninavyojua ni kwamba kama desturi, mfanyabiashara wa Kihindi akijua kwamba amepata mali nyingi hutafuta sababu na kupotosha Serikali na kukimbia kwenda kuanzisha biashara mahali kwingine.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, madeni haya ambayo mhe. Mwamzandi anasema yafutiliwe mbali na Agricultural Finance Corporation yalikuwa yakilipwa wakati yule Mhindi alipokuwa akiendesha kiwanda cha Ramisi. Ilikuwa kila mwenye kupeleka miwa yake pale na ana deni la AFC anakatwa kiasi fulani na yule Mhindi ili zilipwe kwa AFC. Wakati Mhindi alipokimbia, zile pesa alizokuwa amekata kwa wakulima ili zilipwe kwa AFC hazikuwa zimelipwa. Hii ndiyo sababu hawa wakuza miwa wanapata taabu. Kwa hivyo, shida hapa ni moja tu. Ikiwa kamati iliyosemekana itaundwa, na nina 'hakika Waziri Msaidizi ametwambia ukweli kuwa itaundwa, tutajua ni nani mwenye uwezo wa kulipa na ni nani maslrini anayestahili kufikiriwa ili asaidiwe deni lake kufutiliwa mbali. Ningetaka kujua ni mpango gani Wizara itakuwa nao kuhakikisha kwamba pesa zilizokatwa kutoka wa wakulima kulipia madeni ya AFC hazipotei ili kuwe na usawa. Kuna wengine kati ya hawa ambao wataangaliliwa mambo yao ambao pesa zao zilikatwa ili zilipwe kwa AFC, na hazikufika kwa AFC ingawa zilikatwa kutoka kwa malipo yao. Ningependa Wizara iangalie, wakati tume hiyo itakapoanza kazi kama vileWaziri Msaidizi alivyosema, ni kiasi gani cha pesa wakulima hawa walikatwa ili kama mikopo hii itafutiliwa mbali, basi tuanze na wale ambao walikatwa pesa na hazikufika kwa AFC.Sisi watu wa Kwale tunaumia hasa katika mawakilisho yangu kule Kinango kwa sababu mikopo hii haitolewi huko na AFC. Kama mikopo hii inatolcwa huko, basi inaelekezwa kwa watu ambao si wakaaji wa Kinango. Kwa hivyo, ningeomba kupitia kwa Kiti, kwamba Kinango nayo iangaliwe vizuri katika utoaji wa mikopo hii. Tunajua kwamba misaada yoyote inayotolewa ni kwa manufaa ya kila mtu kutoka Kwale. Mimi kama Mbunge wa Kinango, nina hakika kwamba AFC haiangalii Kinango na ningependa kuiomba Wizara itufikirie kwa sababu kuna wakulima wengi kule Kinango. Niko tayari kumsafirisha Waziri Msaidizi hadi Kinango ili ajionee vile kilimo kinaendeshwa kule Kinango. Lakini nasikitika kwa sababu sisi watu wa Kinango hatupati manufaa ya mikopo ya AFC.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ulakumbuka kwamba mnano mwaka wa 1991 kabla sijakuwa Waziri Msaidizi, nililalamika juu ya msichana mmoja kutoka mawakilisho yangu ambaye alifutwa kazi kwa dhuluma. Niliiuliza Wizara ya Kilimo imsaidie msichana huyu. </Newspeech><Newspeech>An hon. Member: Ni rafiki wa nani? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, for Home Affairs and National Heritage (Mr. Bidu): Ni mwanamke anayeitwa Rosemary. Asante kwa kunisawazisha.Mwanamke huyu alikuwa ameajiriwa kama mpiga chapa katika ofisi ya AFC, Kwale Branch. Kwa sababu ya kutoelewana na wakubwa wake, alifutwa kazi kwa sababu ya imprest ya Kshs.500.00. Niliuliza Swali hili wakati huo. Huyu mwanamke alikuwa ameifanyia kazi AFC kwa muda wa miaka 13 halafu akafutwa kazi kwa sababu ya imprest ya Kshs.500.00. Kama Mbunge wa mwanamke huyu, nilikuwa tayari kulipa pesa hizi hili arudishwe kazini. Mwanamke huyu anasafiri kila wakati kutoka Kinango hadi makao makuu ya AFC hapa Nairobi kutatua jambo hili lakini kila wakati anaambiwa aende hapa na pale. Mimi kama Mbunge wake namlipia nauli kutoka Kinango hadi Nairobi na kurudi. Hii si haki hata kidogo. Kwa hivyo, ningependa kuiomba Wizara ya Kilimo iiamuru AFC imrejeshe mwanamke huyu kazini. Kama imprest ya Kshs.500.00 ndio ilisababisha kufutwa kwa mwanamke huyu, basi niko tayari kama Mbunge wake, kulipa pesa hizi ili arejeshwe kazini.Kuna watu ambao "wamekula" imprest za mamilioni kadhaa na hawajafutwa kazi lakini kwa sabnbu mwanamke huyu anatoka Kinango, amefutwa kazi ingawa ninajua kuna sababu nyingine kwa sababu ya imprest ya Kshs.500.00. Ningeomba Wizara iangalie mambo kama haya yasitokee tena. Kazi ya wafanyakazi wa AFC kule Kwale ni kuwahudumia wananchi na kama kuna makosa madogo madogo yametokea, ni juu AFC kuyaiatua lakini isiwc cii mtu kutoka Kinango akifanya makosa madogo madogo, anafutwa kazi. <Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kubo): Order! Mhe. Bidu, nafikiri unazielewa Standing Orders za Bunge hili. Kwa wakati huu, tunaongea juu ya kufutiliwa mbali kwa mikopo ya wakulima na sio juu ya tabia za wafanyakazi wa AFC. Kwa hivyo, ongea juu ya Hoja kama ilivyo. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Home Affairs and National Heritage (Mr. Bidu): Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, mimi nazungumzia habari ya mikopo inayotolewa na AFC na vile shirika hili linawafanyia wafanyakazi wake dhuluma. Unajuaje kwamba mikopo haitolewi ndio wapate njia ya kuwafuta watu kazi? Niko na haki mimi kama Mbunge wa Kinango xibishani na Kiti na ninajua kwamba ofisi ya AFC, Kwale, ina wajibu wa kuloa mikopo kwa watu wa Ramisi, Kinango na Kwale kwa jumla. Kuna makosa gani nikisema kwamba AFC isiwafute kazi wafanyakazi wake ovyo ovyo? Kuna makosa gani hapo?Hakuna tiaja ya nchi hii kununua sukari kutoka nchi nyingine na hali tuna uwezo wa kujitosheleza kwa bidhaa hii. Kwa hivyo, tunataka AFC ifutilie mbali mikopo hii kwa sababu watu hawa hawajiwezi sasa. Kama Wizara itaanzisha tena kiwanda hiki cha sukari, tutakuwa na sukari ya kutosha hapa nchini kwa sababu Magharibi mwa Kenya na Kwale zitakuwa zikitoa sukari na hakutakuwa na haja ya kununua sukari kutoka ng'ambo. Wakati kiwanda hiki kitaanza tena kufanya kazi, ningeomba pia kwamba ile shule ambayo ilifungwa kule pia ifunguliwe ili watoto wa sehemu hiyo nao waweze kuendelea na masomo yao. Kwa hayo machache, naunga mkono. </Newspeech>(Question of the first part of the amendment, that the words to be left out be left out, put and agreed to)(Question of the second part of the amendment, that the word to be inserted in place thereof be inserted, proposed)(Question of the second part of the amendment, that the words to be inserted in place thereof be inserted, put andagreed to)(Question of the Motion as amended proposed)<Newspeech>Mr. Mcharo: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I must commend the Ministry for the step they have taken by not auctioning this factory. The loans given tothe fanners by AFC go a long way in assisting our fanners to develop their farms in order to earnincomes to pay school fees and meet other needs.The interest rates which accrue every month are one of the things Dial have overburdened the farmers. We must keep on appealing that this high interest rate be seriously examined so that loanees do not continue to get such problems.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also accept that one problem which makes farmers fail to repay their loans is poor management of loan repayment programmes. The AFC officers who are charged with the responsibility of collecting loans from farmers should properly monitor the way this money is remitted. This loan repayment mismanagement is one reason why farmers, not only in Ramisi but also in other areas, get such a problem. I have an example of cases in my own constituency where the AFC has given out loans to ranch farmers. We have several ranches in Taita-Taveta, and quite a number of them have virtually collapsed because of non-payment of AFC loans. We have discovered that some of these farmers may be blamed in one way or another for this because they wait until interest on their loans rises to such levels that they can no longer settle either the loans or the interest thereto. This has caused some of the ranches to be auctioned. One good example is Ngeno Ranch, in Taita, whose machinery has been auctioned and even the ranch itself was almost auctioned. We stepped in and saved the situation, and we now want the AFC to examine this matter carefully. The Ministry concerned I believe it is Livestock Development should ensure that fhis ranch is not auctioned or otherwise sold. It should also ensure that the ranch management is streamlined so that wananchi do not suffer.The people of Coast Province are not very rich, and to talk of auctioning anything down there is not in their interest. This is why we meant to support this Motion even before it was amended. The amendment that has been made is not bad, and we still support the Motion as amended. We expect the Government to move in and revive Ramisi Sugar Factory. All the factories and companies that are collapsing should be properly monitored and managed. We have talked many times about the need for proper management of our economy. This relates not only to Ramisi Sugar Factory, but also to State corporations. It is poor management that makes our economic enterprises collapse. Companies that are managed by foreigners I suppose Ramisi Sugar Factory was thus being managed must be monitored all the time so that these foreigners do not reach a state where they may want to run away with wananchi's money. The managers of Ramisi Sugar Factory ran away because they were not being properly managed by the authorities concerned. This is why I think the farmers of Ramisi have found themselves in such an embarrassing situation. We, indeed, support the Government policy of encouraging investment in this country at all costs. We must, at the same time, monitor this investment and the development of whatever ventures are invested here so that this country continues to benefit from this investment by foreigners.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also want to support the idea that has been advanced to the effect that agriculture seems to be doing very well in this country at the moment. Certain commodities that are supposed to be produced locally are now being imported. I feel that it is a very sad situation for us in Kenya today to import sugar when we have a lot of very good land that is very productive as far as sugarcane is concerned. Western Kenya, leave alone Mombasa, Kwale and Ramisi, is very good in sugar production. This country could be absolutely self-sufficient in sugar production, and yet we are importing sugar at very exorbitant prices. Therefore, the Ministry of Agriculture and all those who are responsible for the production of sugar in this country should be made to produce it. We need to export sugar because we are in a position to do so. By this export, we can earn the foreign exchange that we need so badly.We must also do all that is possible to produce those other commodities that we need, such as maize. We have not explained properly why this country has reached a stage of importing such essential commodities as maize. I think maize production in the country has not been properly managed and that this is one reason why we are importing the commodity. The country should continue to import such basic commodities as maize, rice, wheat and so on. Let us do everything possible to curb this trend. We have the Ministries of Agriculture, Livestock Development and Arid, Semi-Arid and Wastelands which should come together and devise the best method to be used in order to enable the country to be self-sufficient in all that this country can produce.With those remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to support fully the idea that the committee that is going to look into the problems of individual farmers should be fair with these farmers. In my own view, those farmers in Ramisi who have failed to repay AFC loans have been forced into this situation by the closure of Ramisi Sugar Factory. It was not their fault that they failed to repay their loans. So, this committee should examine these farmers individually and ensure that their loans are written off Sir, I support the Motion. The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kubo): Hon. Members, it is now time for the Mover to be called upon to reply. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamiandi: First of all, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank all mycolleagues from the Front and the Back Benches who have supported this Motion, and even those who have not contributed to it but still support the Motion.I have heard the Assistant Minister reply and make minor amendments to the Motion, and I want to say that I accept the Motion as amended, but I want to draw his attention, using his own words, to some point he mentioned. He said, "Some farmers are struggling to repay their loans." Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the word "struggling" here means that somebody is overstretching is capacity to repay the loan. The farmer should be rescued before he drowns in debts. You may find a farmer using his daughters dowry to repay A.F.C. loans and as a result the daughter is given in marriage without anything. The farmer is also struggling to pay school fees and repay the A.F.C. loan at the same time. The fanner must repay the loan before paying school fees because if he does not do so his land will be sold; together with his house. The Minister knows that these people are incapable of paying and that is why they are struggling to repay the loans.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has said that he is going to form a committee but I am very worried. How will this committee be constituted? He has not told us who is going to be appointed to that committee. We want the committee to be composed of the local people who know the problems of that area; people who know the problems of each and every farmer in that area. That committee should not comprise of people who would like to see farmers' land being sold. The committee should comprise of local people and a few outsiders.The Ministry should take this matter seriously. This is because if the committee is going to comprise of people who are interested in the land then most of the land is going to fall into the hands of other people. We do not want the committee to comprise of officials from various Ministries because the local man will lack representation. The problems facing farmers in Ramisi could have been solved a long time ago. Although we have been speaking in this House, there have been some people in the Government who are not faithful to Kanu. I say this because if you work with people who are inclined towards the opposition then you will find that things do not always go well. Somebody has been sabotaging Government directives. This is because such a person knows that if the directive is implemented it will boost the image of the Government in the eyes of the mwananchi. That is why so many factories have collapsed. I am sure some hon. Members have witnessed such things.Do you think those men who have defected to the opposition could agree to implement Government directives when they were in theGovernment? They could not do that because they knew that once Government directives were implemented that would give the Government a good name. We must realise that we have some bad elements in the Government. Some people attack Government in different forums. We must be nationalistic; if a person is employed by the Government let him serve the Government faithfully and with dedication. It is not good to have civil servants whose minds are leaning towards the opposition parties because things will not go well. That is the reason why many hospitals have no drugs and water is not running. This is because instead of fueling the pumping machine to pump water somebody is corruptly selling diesel so that the Government can be blamed. These people are not interested in the Government that has employed them and they will not implement any Government directives.The Ministry of Agriculture should take seriously the issue of forming the Committee they have talked about. The Assistant Minister also said that there was a feeling among the farmers that those loans should not be repaid. This means that Kwale people do not like repaying their loans. But he contradicted himself when he said that some of the people were struggling to repay their loans. Nobody has refused to repay his or her lain. But you cannot repay a loan if you do not have any money. I am glad the Assistant Minister has assured us that no farm is going to be auctioned. But there is a trick being used by AP.C. staff in Ukunda. They submit to the Land Control Board transfer forms in anticipation of getting consent and eventually give the land to somebody else. This should be avoided because it is corruption. We have people who have queer minds both in the Government and in the parastatals. The committee the Assistant Minister has promised to form should be formed immediately. This is because our experience here indicates that sometimes a Motion goes through and accepted by the Ministry but it is never implemented until the next Parliament We want to have a Government that is effective. We are tired of being asked unnecessary questions by the opposition about things that have not been done and which the Ministries concerned could have done in a single day. We should avoid giving theopposition a chance to criticise us. We should not have people in our system who are leaning towards the opposition. The Government decision to reviveRamisi Sugar Company should be implemented rather than establishing new sugar factories in other areas as I said earlier.I agreed with hon. Mrs. Ogot when she said that the Government has not responded to this Motion satisfactorily. We want things done as quickly as possible. A lot of money was recovered from farmers by Ramisi Sugar Company on behalf of the A.F.C. This money should also be accounted for, otherwise, there will be problems.With these few remarks, I beg to move.(Question of the Motion as amended put and agreed to)Resolved accordingly:THAT, in view of the fact that Ramisi sugarcane outgrowers are unable to repay the loans advanced to them by the Agricultural Finance Corporation due to the collapse and subsequent closure of the Ramisi Sugar factory; and realising that the interest on the loans granted continues to accrue every month; and further noting Vvith dismay that the said corporation has threatened to auction the farms,; titles of which the farmers have lodged as security; this House urges the Government to evaluate each loan individually with a view to writing-off warranting cases. </Newspeech><Header>ADJOURNMENT</Header><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kubo): Hon. Members, as you will notice from the Order Paper, we have come to the end of this morning's business. The House is therefore adjourned until this afternoon, at 2.30 p.m. </Newspeech>The House rose at 12.00 p.m.
