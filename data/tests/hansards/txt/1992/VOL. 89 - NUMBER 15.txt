Office of the President:-							(a) what is delaying the payment of pension benefits of Mr.John J. Dhadho. P,No. 160975. formerly attached to the D.C.'s Office. Hola: and											(b) when the complainant will be paid his dues.<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Dr. Wameyo): Mr. Deputy Speaker. Sir. I beg to reply.			The delay in paying pension benefits to Mr. John Dhadho, P/No. 160975. formerly attached to the D.C.'s Office, Hola, arises from his inability to provide his bank's details which include town number. As soon as my Ministry receives the required details we shall send them to the Treasury for processing of payment.	</Newspeech>						<Newspeech>Mr. Wakole: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, all the required forms were duly filled plus account numbers and sent to the Office of the President in January for processing. What is now causing the delay in this matter? </Newspeech>					   <Newspeech>Dr. Wameyo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sorry; I am not aware that the above information had been sent to the Office of the President. I will plead with the hon. Member. If he has any information and will be kind enough to hand them over to me personally, I will definitely look into the matter. </Newspeech>                                                                      <i>Question No. 553 </i>                                                              <Header>NUMBER OF STOLEN VEHICLES</Header>								Mr. A.H.O. Momanyi asked a Minister of State, Office of the President:-					(a) how many vehicles have been reported stolen throughout the Republic between January, 1992, and September 15th, 1992;													(b)how many vehicles (refer "a") have been recovered and claimed by the owners; and				(c)what measures he is taking to curb the prevalent vehicle theft in the country.<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Dr. Wameyo): Mr. Depute Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.				A total of 2,101 vehicles have been reported stolen between January and September, 1992. Some 976 vehicles have been recovered and claimed by the owners. To curb this prevailing vehicle thefts, both mobile and foot patrols, ambushes and road blocks, have all been intensified throughout the Republic. </Newspeech>								<Newspeech>Mr.A.H.O. Momanyi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Assistant Minister for that reply, but how about the rest of the vehicles that have not been recovered? What is the Government doing to assist the owners to recover them? </Newspeech>			<Newspeech>Dr. Wameyo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I plead with the hon. Member, if he has any information relating to any vehicle that has not been recovered, let him give it to us or police and action will be taken immediately. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr.A.H.O. Momanyi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, sometimes the owners of stolen vehicles are not even compensated by the insurance companies. So, what is the Government actually doing to assist the owners of the stolen vehicles? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Wameyo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Government is still looking for the stolen vehicles. However, when a person is dead, he is dead, and there is not much anybody, including the insurance companies, can do about that. Unfortunately, we have yet to receive information as to the whereabouts of these vehicles. But, as of now, we are still looking for the vehicles. </Newspeech><i>Question No. 559</i><Header>PROMOTION OF ADMINISTRATION POLICEMEN</Header>Mr. Lotim asked a Minister of State, Office of the President:-							(a)how many Administration Police Constables (APs) have been promoted to the ranks of Corporal (Cpl) and Sergeant (Sgt) between 1985 and 1992 in West Pokot District; and								(b)how many of those promoted are from Pokot community.							<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Dr. Wameyo): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.			A total of eight APs were promoted to the rank of Cpl and some other nine to the rank of Sgt between 1985 and 1992 in West Pokot District. Among those promoted, two of them are from Pokot community.	</Newspeech>					<Newspeech>Mr. Lotim: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can he tell us to which of the two ranks (Cpl or Sgt) do the two APs from Pokot belong? </Newspeech>							<Newspeech>Dr. Wameyo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is a little bit difficult. But one such promotion is of an AP Chief Inspector, Samuel Lori, who is stationed in Kwale District and he is a Pokot. </Newspeech>			<Newspeech>Mr. Lotim: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the Assistant Minister is misleading the House. What I know is that he has names of eight people who have been promoted to the ranks of corporal and sergeant, and that is the total number of all the Pokots who are, serving as Administration Policemen who have been promoted. Lou has not worked in West Pokot from 1985 to 1992. I am interested in those who are serving in the district and not those serving outside the district. </Newspeech>				<Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: What is your question?	</Newspeech>							<Newspeech>Mr. Lotim: My question is, can the Assistant Minister tell us the total number of Administration Policemen working within the district who have been promoted to the ranks of corporal and sergeant? </Newspeech>					<Newspeech>Dr. Wameyo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, when people are promoted, they do not have to serve specifically in their home districts; they have to serve anywhere in the Republic of Kenya. </Newspeech>							<Newspeech>Mr. Lotim: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister is even drifting further from the Question. I wanted to know how many Administration Police Constables have been promoted to the ranks of corporal and sergeant between 1985 and 1992 in West Pokot District. The person he named has not worked in the district within the period I have indicated in the Question. </Newspeech>													<Newspeech>Dr. Wameyo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I have yet to be specifically told by the hon. Member that only Administration Policemen from West Pokot District will work in that district. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Question here talks about Administration Police Constables who have been promoted to the ranks of corporal and sergeant between 1985 and 1992 in West Pokot District, a space of seven years. The Assistant Minister is simply supposed to tell the hon. Member that there are so many of them and if there are none he says so and the hon. Member will be satisfied. But he is not answering the Question. </Newspeech>					<Newspeech>Dr. Wameyo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, maybe, to the hon. Member I am not answering the Question, but the truth is that it is not true that all the Administration Policemen who work in West Pokot District are of Pokot origin. Anybody who is an Administration Police officer in the Government service serves anywhere in the Republic, be it Kwale, West Pokot or Mandera. Therefore, the Question about Administration Police Constables promoted to the ranks of corporal and sergeants in West Pokot Districts does not specify the Pokots working in West Pokot District as Administration Policemen. </Newspeech>				<Newspeech>Mr. Lotim: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, to me, the Question has not been answered. What I know is that for this period of seven years the Administration Police Constables working in West Pokot, and I do not mind from whatever part of the country they come from, have not been promoted. To me, it looks as if there is some kind of discrimination against the Pokots working in the Administration Police Force. </Newspeech>										<Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: But what is the question, Mr. Lotim? </Newspeech>							<Newspeech>Mr. Lotim: I am going to ask it. Every time a promotion opportunity arises it goes to the tribe of the serving district commissioner during that particular year. I know that everybody can work in any place in Kenya, but the Assistant Minister should tell us how many of the eight promoted constables are Pokots. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Wameyo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was avoiding to read the names but I will now read them. However, the truth still remains that if you are employed in the Government service you work anywhere and not necessarily in your own district.In West Pokot District the following were promoted from the ranks of constable to corporal:-No. 204511 Elijah Odillo 1986No. 205698 Daniel Munguti 1986No. 209936 Cosmus Dunei 1990No. 209935 William Toroitich 1991No. 212144 Philip Kerich 1991 No. 207724 Hamphrey Wafula 1992No. 209420 Solomon Kiprop 1992No. 204598 Joseph Wambugu 1992Those who were promoted from the rank of corporal to sergeant are Joseph Kautich, Jackson Lokabeo, Francis Kagiri, Daniel Mwangi, Julius Simiyu, Francis Ndiema, Gideon Kemboi, Elvis Busienei and Obenga. Lihaya - 1985. Those are the names I have, and whether they are Pokot or Luhya I have no idea. </Newspeech>				          	<Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Mr. Kyonda's Question. </Newspeech><i>Question No. 560</i><Header>K.N.T.C. DEPOT AT WOTE</Header>Mr. Kyonda asked the Minister for Commerce:-(a)	what urgent measures he is taking to open a Kenya National Treading Corporation at Wote Town, the headquarters of the new Makueni District; and(b)	what the amount of sugar allocated to Makueni District by the K.N.T.C. depot in Machakos per week is.<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Commerce (Mr. Karingi): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a) I have directed the Managing Director of the Kenya National Trading Corporation (K.N.T.C) to ensure the establishment of a depot at Wote Town by March, 1993. The creation of a depot in Makueni will lead to swifter distribution of essential commodities in the area.(b) Makueni District currently receives 103.1 tons of sugar weekly from the Machakos K.N.T.C. depot. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kyonda: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while I thank the Assistant Minister for that reply, I wish to ask him why we should wait until 1993 for the establishment of the depot since, as he says, its establishment will make the distribution of essential commodities in the district swifter? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Karingi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the hon. Questioner should be grateful that we have money provided for this purpose in our Supplementary Estimates. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kyonda: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if there is money for this purpose, why should we wait until March, 1993? At the moment essential commodities do not reach us. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Karingi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I did not say that the money was readily available. I said that we are going to provide for the establishment of a K.N.T.C. depot at Wote in our Revised Estimates which will be from January to June, next year. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kiilu: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell us how much money would be required to build such a depot at Wote Town? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Karingi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am afraid I do not have the exact figure at the moment, but I am sure that the hon. Questioner will appreciate that this would also entail hiring and renovating premises, employing staff and undertaking some other basic requirements. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kyonda: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sr, would the Assistant Minister tell us how much money has been set aside for this exercise? Secondly, when he says that we receive 103 tons of sugar in Wote, Makueni District, every week, could he tell us where this sugar goes because most of the time, people in Wote have no sugar? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Karingi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, our District Trade Development Officer in Machakos has confirmed in writing that he sends 103 tons of sugar to Wote every week without fail and there is documentary evidence to that effect. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Shall we move on to Mr. Okondo's Question. </Newspeech><i>Question No.535</i><Header>TEACHING MATERIALS FOR SCHOOLS</Header>Mr. Okondo asked the Minister for Education since the Ministry does not, at the moment, supply teaching materials (e.g. books, blackboard, chalk, ink, pencils, etc.) to primary schools, whether he would tell the House what alternative arrangements the Ministry has made to avail teaching materials to such schools.<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Education (Mr. Karauri): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Due to the rapidly increasing cost of education in Kenya, coupled with the general financial constraints facing the Government, the provision of text books and other reference books has become unaffordable to the extent that the Government of Kenya cannot any longer continue on the supply of these books on regular basis to the schools.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, my Ministry, through Sessional Paper No.6 of 1988, called upon the parents to undertake the provision of teaching materials through cost sharing. Since 1990, it has been the policy of the Kenya Government that the supply of books, physical facilities and teaching materials, be the responsibility of the parents and the communities served by those schools. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant Minister's reply, is he aware that the policy he is referring to leaves a lot to be desired because the books and other teaching materials that we are being supplied with at the moment, vary from school to school in quality and quantity, something which really lowers the level of education. For this reason, would the Assistant Minister not agree that it would be much better if the Ministry collected money through some kind of fee and bought these books and teaching materials and then supply them to school instead of asking the parents to buy them? This would amount to the same cost sharing he is talking about but at least the Ministry would ensure that proper educational standards are maintained in all our primary schools, which at the present moment is not the case. </Newspeech>								<Newspeech>Mr. Karauri: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we ensure that quality textbooks are given to schools through the Kenya Institute of Education. The development of these books is done at the Kenya Institute of Education and if the hon. Member would like the Ministry to collect money and then supply the books, I would suggest that instead of the Ministry doing that, the communities surrounding the schools do that. </Newspeech>						<Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, with all due respect to the Assistant Minister, this is an area that the Ministry should not abdicate their responsibility to the community. The Community can provide physical facilities like buildings. However, it is not right to leave the supply of books and teaching materials to the community. I am saying this because I have noticed that in some schools, they do not buy the kind of books that the Ministry states, because some of the communities cannot afford them since they are too poor. This is why I am asking the Ministry to have a look at this policy again with a view to improving the system. I am saying this because our educational standards are beginning to vary from place to place due to poor supply of teaching materials. Would the Ministry, please, look at this issue again to see whether it can be better managed in a different way than at present? </Newspeech> 										<Newspeech>Mr. Karauri: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Okondo says that some communities are so poor that they cannot afford to raise money for textbooks. I wonder how the same communities would be able to pay the same money to the Ministry as he is arguing? </Newspeech>									<Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I did say that the Ministry should introduce some kind of a fee to buy the books and other teaching materials instead of the communities contributing to buy these things because it is a well known fact that in some communities, teachers are known to squander the money contributed by the parents instead of using it to buy books. So, parents find it difficult to pay the money when they know that the little they are able to contribute for buying books, is not always correctly used. This is why I am suggesting that the Ministry should have a second look at this problem to find out how they can improve on the present arrangement. </Newspeech>										<Newspeech>Mr. Karauri: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I object to that insinuation by the hon. Member that some teachers are misusing this money. I am saying this because in the case of secondary schools, for, example, we have the Board of Governors and in the case of primary schools, we have schools committees or parents and teachers associations who should be playing a more active role in the running of these schools on behalf of the Ministry. The head of a school only happens to be a secretary and, therefore, these organizations should ensure that all money collected from the parents is used for the purpose for which it is collected. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, is the Assistant Minister saying that he is not aware of any school where complaints have been received that some teachers have misused schools funds? Is he trying to say that, in fact, all the teachers in this country are honest, straightforward and do not embezzle school funds? </Newspeech>[Mr. Deputy Speaker left the Chair]									[The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi) took the Chair]						<Newspeech>Mr. Karauri: Certainly not, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. However, we would like the blame to go more to the school committees that do not take their responsibility seriously. I am saying this because they are supposed to manage funds collected by the schools and report any headmaster or headmistress who misuses that money. </Newspeech><i>Question No.548 </i><Header>CRAFT TEACHERS IN MWALA</Header>							Mr. Wambua asked the Minister for Education:-							(a) how many primary schools in Mwala Constituency had completed carpentry and home-science classrooms as at 30th August, 1992, and									(b) how many technical teachers have been posted to teach in the above classes.						The Assistant Minister for Education (Mr. Karauri): Mr. Temporary deputy Speaker, could I be allowed to collect the answer from my pigeon-hole? I had not noticed that this Question is on the Order Paper.<Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi): Let us move on to the next Question. We cannot possibly wait for him to bring the answer. </Newspeech><i>Question No.557</i><Header>PAYMENT OF THE LATE GACHERU'S DUES</Header>Mr.Mweru asked the Minister for Labour:-(a)	whether he is ware that Mr. Daniel Njenga Gicheru ID/3643431/66 (File No.1288/88 died on Busese-Iganga Road, Uganda on 8th February, 1988 while driving vehicle Reg.No.KTK 242-ZB 529 belonging to Multiple Hauliers Company of P.O. Box 41391, Nairobi, who were the employers of the late Daniel Njenga Gicheru, and were insured with Corporate Insurance Company Limited of P.O. Box 34172, Nairobi; and(b)	when the wife of the deceased, Mrs. Esther Wangui and nine other dependants, will be paid Workmen's Compensation in accordance with the Workmen's Compensation Act (Cap.236, Section 20 (2) of the Laws of Kenya.										          <Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Labour (Mr. D.M. Amin): Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a) I am aware that Mr. Daniel Njenga died on the 8th of February, 1.988 on Busese-Iganga Road in Uganda.(b) The wife of the deceased, Mrs. Esther Wangui, together with the other dependants are advised to report to the Provincial Labour Officer, Nyayo House, Nairobi, for the payment of workmen's compensation in accordance with section 20 (2) of the Workmen's Compensation Act Cap.236. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mweru: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for the good answer, could he tell the House when the wife and the other dependants of Mr. Njenga will report to Nyayo House? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. D.M. Amin:. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, they can come and collect the money even tomorrow. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ndirangu: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from the answer given by the Assistant Minister, would he tell this House how much money is going to be paid to the family of the late Daniel Njenga Gicheru in the form of workmen's compensation? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. D.M. Amin: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the amount is KShs.128,000/- and the cheque is No.474182 of 23rd September, 1992. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi): Shall we move on now to Mr. Kubo's Question? </Newspeech><i>Question No.565</i><Header>EXTENSION OF LUMI WATER PROJECT</Header>Mr. Kubo asked the Minister for Water Development when he will make extensions of the Lumi Water Supply Project to connect Timbila to Kiabo-Cha-Jipe and Luduwai, Kitoghoto to Ngutini and Marodo.<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Water Development (Mr. Mweu): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Extension of Taveta-Lumi Water Supply Project to connect Timbila to Kibao-Cha-Jipe and Luduwai, Kitoghoto to Ngutini and Marodo will be made soon, subject to availability of funds to carry out feasibility study to ascertain the viability of the connection. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr.Kubo: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant Minister's reply, would he not agree with me that it is not at all necessary to carry out any feasibility study because there is already enough water supply from the Lumi Water Project? All I am asking the Ministry is to, supply enough water pipes so that water can be extended to the areas that I have mentioned in my Question which is only two kilometres away from the main pipe. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mweu: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I know there is a lot of water in the Lumi Reservoir but we would like to establish whether by connecting water to the areas that hon. Member is talking about, we will not be interfering with the normal water supply to the areas now being served by this project. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kubo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister was present when this water project was commissioned. The water was so much that the reservoirs were not utilized fully. In view of that can he assure us that these extensions will be effected because there is enough water and that water pipes are the only items needed? At the same time, I would like to bring to his attention the fact that there are enough consumers in that area who can pay for water they consume. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mweu: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if we did that we would be doing it "the African way". We have got to do feasibility studies before we embark on the project. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Would I be in order to request the Assistant Minister to explain to us what he means when he uses the phrase "the African way"? Can he also tell us the other way that can be used? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mweu: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if we do it that way, we would be doing it without having established whether it will interfere with the normal water supply. However, we have no quarrel with the connections and we will supply the pipes. The hon. Member should, therefore, give us time to carry out the feasibility studies. </Newspeech>											<Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the Assistant Minister is an African and he knows that Africans have been tackling their matters in a scientific way, why does he degrade the African method of dealing with things? What does he have in mind by using that phrase? Is he not abusing his mother and father?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>Mr. Mweu: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am far from what the hon. Member has said. </Newspeech><i>Question No. 514</i>                                                     <Header>MATATU STOPS IN MUNICIPALITIES				</Header>		Mr. Okondo asked the Minister for Local Government when his Ministry will direct municipalities and town councils to arrange for matatu stops in their areas of jurisdiction in the same way as they arrange for bus stops, in order to reduce traffic accidents and traffic congestion.<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Local Government (Mr. Mbori): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sr, I beg to reply.Under the Traffic Act Cap. 403, Laws of Kenya, Section 72A - every county council makes its By-laws (omnibus terminus) which specify areas where buses and matatus should park or pick up passengers and the fees to be paid by each vehicle. It is, therefore, upon the council to enforce these by-laws to ensure that buses and matatus pick passengers in the designated places and prosecute, those who fail to obey the law. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: My, Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is a very standard answer which does not answer my question. We all know that regardless of that Act being there the law is disobeyed. Why can the Minister not give a directive now, to support that law so that municipalities and town councils implement that By-law? Since matatus do not have loading bays in Nairobi, the Assistant Minister should identify areas where these matatu stops will be located in town. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mbori: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while I appreciate the sentiments expressed by the hon. Member, he should realize the fact that every local authority is authorized to make its own by-laws which should not collide with the laws made by the National Assembly. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. P.G. Godana: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister is deliberately evading the Question. We have no quarrel with the councils making their own by-laws. Can he direct the local authorities in the country to allocate specific stops for matatus? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mbori: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am in no way avoiding the hon. Members supplementary question. The By-laws state the areas where matatus are supposed to stop to pick up their passengers and make up terminal stops accordingly. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister is not only evading the question, but he seems to have abdicated his responsibilities. Whereas the Ministry has delegated the functions of establishing loading areas for matatus in the council, the same Ministry is supposed to carry out supervision to ensure that what they have delegated is implemented. Can the Assistant Minister assure this House that he will instruct the local authorities to stop this matter so as to save loss of lives caused by accidents? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mbori: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, matters touching on lives of human beings are very serious and I would not, in any way, avoid answering the question as my hon. friend is trying to allege. However, I will take into account the sentiments expressed by him. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kamuyu: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I would like to seek your intervention in this matter. The Assistant Minister is circumventing this issue. He should be telling the House that he is going to get facts from the local authorities to find out whether they are not in a position to set aside areas for matatu stops. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mbori: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, these directives will be given. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ndirangu: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, matatu owners and touts complain that they are frequently harassed and picked up by traffic policemen because of alleged traffic obstructions. This is not their fault because there are no loading hays for matatus in Nairobi or in the rural towns. Can the Assistant Minister assure this House that where no loading bays are present, matatu touts and owners will not be picked up by traffic policemen? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mbori: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we go by the provisions in the By-Laws. I think this one does not fall within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Local Government and therefore, I have no answer to hat. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I Thank the Assistant Minister for accepting to give a directive to municipalities and other local authorities to provide loading bays for matatus. He is fully aware the relevant law is being flouted as it is not being enforced. So, could he tell us when exactly he is going to, give this directive? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mbori: As soon as possible, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. P.G. Godana: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, "as soon as possible" is indefinite. Could the Assistant Minister tell us when exactly he is going to give this order, which, as he himself said, concerns the lives of wananchi? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mbori: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not know what words my good friend, the hon. Member, would use. I have just said that steps will be taken as soon as possible. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: We must now get on to Mr. Ndimngu's Question. </Newspeech><i>Question No. 433</i><Header>NUMBER OF ELECTION OBSERVERS</Header>Mr. Ndirangu asked the Attorney-General how many observers, and from which international organisations, the Government intends to invite during the forthcoming multi party elections.<Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Is the Attorney General not here? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ndirangu: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, he was here a few minutes ago. <Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Somebody should quickly look around for the Attorney General? I think he is around, and we will be coming back to this Question later. <Newspeech>Next Question, Mr. Wambua.<i>Question No. 548</i><Header>CRAFTS TEACHERS IN MWALA</Header>Mr. Wambua asked the Minister for Education:-(a) how many primary schools in Mwala Constituency had completed the carpentry and home science classrooms as at 30th August, 1992; and(b) how many technical teachers have been posted to teach in the above classes.<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Education (Mr. Karauri): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a) As at 30th August, 1992, a total of 98 workshops and 20 home science rooms had been completed.(b) There is no subject specialisation during the training of primary school teachers in both pro-service and in-service programmes.(Members applauded as hon. K' Ombudo entered)All trained teachers from primary school teachers colleges are trained to teach all subjects at all levels in primary schools. We do not have technical teachers. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wambua: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think part (b) of this answer is not proper because the purpose of building workshops and home science classrooms is to have pupils taking technical subjects being taught by technical teachers because</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kubo: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. There is so much commotion in the House that we cannot hear clearly what hon. Wambua is saying. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: I think there is some sort of celebration going on in the Front Bench. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Do you think "commotion" is the right word to use here? If we let it pass like that, people outside Parliament might think that hon. Members were fighting in the House. Therefore, could hon. Kubo be asked to use another word better than this one? He is, in fact, a lawyer. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kubo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to apologise if I have used an abusive word or one that is not proper. All I was doing was to draw attention to the fact that there is a lot of movement in the Front Bench as hon. Members go to congratulate hon. K'Ombudo. This has interfered with the smooth running of business in the House. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Barngetuny: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Inaonekana kwamba mhe. Kubo hajui kwamba waheshimiwa Wabunge wanamshangilia Waziri mpya, mhe. K'Ombudo. </Newspeech>(Applause)<Newspeech>Mr. Wambua: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, technical subjects need teachers who are thoroughly trained to teach. I say this because I visited one primary school where the construction of a workshop has been completed a home science classroom had been completed, but there was not even a single teacher to teach technical subjects there, and yet trained teachers left college only last year. Technical subjects are very important because they are very marketable because pupils taking them leave primary school, they can make some chairs, tables, clothes and so on. What does the Assistant Minister mean when he says that no teachers are trained specifically to teach technical subjects? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Karauri: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mwala Constituency is over staffed with 28 teachers, and teachers who have been trained in primary school teachers colleges are qualified to teach all primary school subjects as they must have done the subjects up to 0-Level, and have been taught home science, arts and crafts and other subjects while in college. So, there should be no difficult in these teachers teaching subjects that are supposed to be taught in home science blocks and workshops. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Let us go back to Mr. arap Kirwa's Question. </Newspeech><i>Question No. 532</i><Header>MOISTURE CONTENT IN CEREALS</Header>Mr. Makhanu, on behalf of Mr. arap Kirwa, asked the Minister for Supplies and Marketing what plans he has to ensure that moisture content charges are borne by the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) instead of farmers.<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Supplies and Marketing (Mr. Mwenje): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thought the hon. Member would apologise first for not having asked this Question in the first place. Sir, I beg to reply.The NCPB accepts maize for direct storage in its warehouse and silos at a moisture content of 13.5 per cent. Grain with a moisture content above 13.5 per cent is normally dried by the NCPB using mechanical driers to avoid rotting and deterioration. Since the NCPB purchases maize at 90 kilogrammes per bag net, any weight difference resulting from drying is the responsibility of the farmer. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kamuyu: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I request you to ask the Luo Members of Parliament over there to consult quietly. We realise that they are very happy with the new Minister, whom I also congratulate, but the business of the House must go on. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Did I hear you, the Member for Dagoretti, talk about Luo Members of Parliament? Why would you want to talk about tribes every time? I would like to refer you to the comments made by the Member for Kieni, who is not here now, to the effect that we do not have a tribal Parliament, but the National Assembly. So, it is out of order for you to refer to the lady and gentlemen seated over there as Luo Members of Parliament. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Culture and Social Services (Mrs. Ogot): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for hon. Kamuyu to have Dagoretti behind news? He does not seem to have read yesterday that hon. Oluoch trounced Odongo Omamo in grassroots elections. </Newspeech>(Applause)<Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, whatwe are saying here is that when the farmer delivered maize to the NCPB and its moisture content is slightly above 13.5 per cent, the NCPB should consider the expenses of drying that maize to the required standard, instead of passing the cost of doing so to the farmer. The farmer is already very burdened. This is the essence of the Question at hand. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwenje: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is not the essence of the Question. We accept maize with a moisture content of even up to 18 per cent. The Question is asking whether we could pay for the difference of 13.5 per cent and 18 per cent. We cannot accept this because we cannot pay for water: When the maize is dried up the water evaporates and its weight is reduced. Therefore, we only pay for maize with a moisture content of 13.5 per cent and dry it ourselves; but we do not charge for the drying of the maize. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Malebe: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, what is the mandatory moisture content involved in, say, a 90-kilogramme bag of maize? </	Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwenje: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the magnitude of the moisture depends on the maize delivered. If the farmer dries the maize for some time then its moisture content at the time of its delivery to the board normally ranges between 14 and 18 per cent. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister has told the House if the moisture content of a 90-kilogramme bag of maize is above 13.5 per cent it is dried up and then the farmer is paid. The Assistant Minister should have told the House how much is lost by the farmer for the loss of one per cent of moisture. This is because the farmer believes that he is being charged for drying when, in fact, the price of his maize is reduced by the amount of the moisture content. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwenje: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the farmer knows very well that he is not charged for drying. Soon after he delivers his maize it is weighed and he is informed of its moisture content. After that its weight after drying is determined and he is paid for the determined weight. If a farmer wants to dry his maize himself he is allowed to do that. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I come from a maize growing zone and we have had a lot frustrations from the board. Situations arise where if on delivery of maize its moisture content is found to be above 13.5 per cent you are told go away with it. As a result, some farmers have been selling maize in the black market, thereby depriving the board of this essential commodity. Will the Assistant Minister agree with me that they consider accepting maize whose the moisture is not very high so that it can act as an incentive to the farmer? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwenje: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon.    Makhanu is not telling the truth because nobody is sent away with maize. All maize is accepted immediately on delivery. All that happens is that the farmer is informed of the moisture content of his maize</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kipkorir: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Why is the Assistant Minister saying that maize is paid for on delivery when I know that in my area farmers deliver their maize to the board but they are not paid on the spot? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwenje: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the first place that is not a point of order and I will continue with what I was say.I have said that nobody is sent away with his maize. We receive all the maize, determine its moisture content and inform the farmer immediately. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: We must get on now. Mr. Ndirangu's Question for the second time. </Newspeech><i>Question No. 433</i><Header>NUMBER OF ELECTION OBSERVERS</Header>Mr. Ndirangu asked the Attorney General how many observers, and from which international organisations, the Government intends to invite during the forthcoming multi party elections.<Newspeech>The Attorney General (Mr. Wako): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the House is entitled to an apology from the Attorney-General, who was not here to answer the Question when it was called for the first time. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Yes, Mr. Wako, we are calling this Question for the second time. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Attorney-General (Mr. Wako): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was here on time. But I had gone to make an urgent call when this came up. My estimation was that Question No. 523 would take about five minutes. But, as it was, I think the hon. Member who was to ask that Question was not available and so the Chair came straight to Question No. 433. However, I apologise for not having been here when the Question was first called. </Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.As the hon. House is well aware, the Government is committed to free, fair and transparent elections -elections which are seen by both Kenyans and outsiders to be fair, free, and transparent. Therefore, the Government has accepted that we should have observers during the forthcoming elections. This hon. House has also accepted the principle that we must have observers during the forthcoming elections. The elections regulations were only recently passed by this House. I refer to Regulations 16(3), 23(1) and 35(5) of thoseRegulations which state that the Electoral Commission would permit duly approved and accredited observers at the nomination stage, the polling stage, the polling stations and also at the counting stage. Therefore, the commitment of the Government and this hon. House in having observers cannot be questioned.As to how many observers will be there, it is difficult to say because various institutions have applied to the Electoral Commission to be permitted to observe the elections. These are institutions and not individuals and when they pass the criteria for laid down by the Electoral Commission it will be up to them to have as many observers as they can to be able to monitor the elections effectively.If I may add, I will go further and say that if a particular institution is permitted to observe the elections it will then submit the names of people who will actually be observing the elections in various parts of the country. The Electoral Commission will examine each of those people and ensure that each one of them is completely no-partisan, is a person of integrity and is neutral in the election that is due to take place. When that criteria is satisfied, then the person will be permitted to observe an election in a particular area on behalf of the institution which has been recognized by the Electoral Commission. As far as local institutions are concerned, a number have applied and they are being processed.With regards to international organisations, as the House is aware, the Government has already invited observers from the Commonwealth. It has also invited observers from the European Parliament. It will now be up to the Commonwealth and the European Parliament, both of whom have accepted to send observer teams, to have enough people .within their teams to ensure that they monitor the elections effectively. As far as the Commonwealth observers are concerned, we have already had a planning mission which came here in June this year and a technical team which came in July this year. They have been all over the country and I am quite sure they are trying to lay down a base which will enable them to monitor the elections effectively.As far as observers from the European Parliament are concerned, I anticipate that we shall very soon have a technical team which will again come and go round and then the observers will come during the election time. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kubo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while I thank the Attorney-General for his elaborate answer, I would like to say that on the other hand, we may have some observers who have some improper motives and who may be just there to destabilize our country. What machinery does the Government have to make sure that we do not have such observers in the country whose aim is not to help the country but to merely come here and make things worse? I say this because most of them have expressed the opinion that they doubt the credibility of our Government. We would not like to see such people come here to destabilize our country. What assurance can the Attorney-General give us that these observers are not going to interfere with the smooth running of the elections? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wako: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I have explained, the Electoral Commission will only permit institutions and observers who are completely non-partisan in any given situation. Each application will be examined and decided upon on its own merit. If the Electoral Commission has information that a particular observer or institution is not non-partisan, then they will not be accredited: </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Attorney General for giving us a very clear answer. It is only recently that some US Congressmen complained against this country that they were unable to get approval to observe the forthcoming general elections. Should observers campaign forcefully to be accepted in any particular country and for what purpose? That is not their business! </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wako: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are a sovereign State and we shall not be intimidated by anybody to accept' any person or institution to be accredited as observers. If any of them is partisan and uses any methods to try to force the Government to accept him as an observer, then that will be rejected outright. We are committed to having observers who, as I have said, are non-partisan and transparent. Any such observer will be welcomed in Kenya.With regards to the US Congressmen, I would like to say that that will have to go through the normal procedures. I would like to mention here that not everybody in the United States of America (USA) is biased or partisan. I am quite sure that there could be people in the USA who are neutral and who are just out to see that Kenya holds free and fair elections. I am sure that if the people of the USA apply to be accepted as observers and if they meet that criteria of being non-partisan, they will be permitted to come and observe our elections because we have nothing to hide. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ndirangu: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the Attorney-General for expounding on the policy of the Government with respect to the election observers. Now that Kenya is a multi-party State and we are soon going to have multi-party elections, I would like to know from the Attorney General whether the Electoral Commission is obliged to attend to any representation made by the opposition parties. For example, we have heard them saying that elections are going to be rigged and that they want the Kennedy Foundation to come and so on. Is the Electoral Commission obliged to attend to such representation? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wako: M far as this Question is concerned, the Electoral Commission can only be obliged to attend to any application before it seeking observer status in the forthcoming elections. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Malebe: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Attorney-General has just said that the European Parliament is left at its own discretion to send observers here. What role would the Electoral Commission play to vet the group which is sent here by the European Parliament to ensure that it is non-partisan? For example, David Steel, British Member of Parliament, has been coming here to criticise the system. How will the Electoral Commission vet these people? Will the Commission have the powers to say "We do not require this particular fellow in this group of observers?" </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wako: I think I have made the position very clear. There is the question of institutions which will be allowed to bring observers. Apart from that and in accordance with our own regulations, each and every observer representing an institution or an organisation, have to be duly accredited by the Electoral Commission. In that process of accreditation, the Commission will ensure that that observer is neutral. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Let us move on to Questions by Private Notice. </Newspeech><Header>QUESTIONS BY PRIVATE NOTICE PENSIONS PAYMENTS BY BANK</Header><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: Bw.

Hii ni balaa kubwa! <Newspeech>(Question deferred)<Header>ARREST OF PEOPLE AT BANGALE</Header><Newspeech>Mr. Galgallo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask a Minister of State, Office of the President the following Question by Private Notice: (a) Is the Minister aware that on 4th August, 1992, fifteen (15) people from Bangale trading centre in Bangale Division, Tana River District, were arrested by officers of the Armed Forces accompanied by civilians from Garissa District and that the arrests were reported to Hola Police Station?(b) Is he further aware that these individuals were severely beaten prior to the arrest in front of the District Officer, Bangale, and the Officer in Charge, Bangale Police Post?(c)What is the fate of these people and what charges, if any, have been preferred against them? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Dr. Wameyo): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I now beg to reply.I am aware of an incident which took place in Bangale on 4th August, 1992, where some eight persons were arrested in connection with a criminal case but were later released after interrogation. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Galgallo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not know whether the Assistant Minister is actually answering my Question. I am asking him to tell me the fate of those people who have been arrrested. What is the position? What charges were preferred against them? Can he answer this Question properly? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Wameyo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thought that I have answered the Question by saying that eight persons were arrested in connection with a criminal case but were later released after interrogation, for lack of evidence. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Malebe: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister is not answering this Question. But at the smile time, since he confirms that eight people were arrested and later released, could he give us the names of those eight persons and why they were arrested? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Wameyo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I said that there was an incident that took place in Bangale on 4th August and some eight people were arrested in connection with a criminal case but were later released because of lack of evidence. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. P.G. Godana: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the security forces have their areas of jurisdiction and if I know my geography well, Bangale is in Tana River District. Why were these people arrested by security personnel from Garissa District? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Galgallo: They were members of the armed forces and not the police</Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Wameyo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not aware that it is specifically stated that if you work in Nairobi you cannot arrest anybody in Mombasa. I am not aware of that. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: What is your definition of armed forces, Mr. Galgallo? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Galgallo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the incident the Assistant Minister is talking about involved members of the Kenya Army who went to Bangale and collected those people. For what crime were they arrested and since when did members of the Kenya Army start arresting people? What crime did they commit? Can he give us the criminal case number? That is a clear question? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Wameyo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is the hon. Member who is now talking about the armed forces. In my answer I am not aware of the armed forces getting involved in the arrest of these people. In that same Question, there is an allegation that the people who were arrested were severely beaten. Being severely beaten, in law, and although I arr. not a lawyer In medical practice, when you are examining a person, you come to the conclusion that grievous harm has been done on the person so beaten and under those circumstances the person is brought before a doctor who fills P3 forms and certifies that the person was severely beaten and injured and specifies the areas of injury. May I know from the hon. Member if there are any P3 forms that were issued to the people so said to have been severely beaten? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Malebe: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I do not think that the Assistant Minister is being sincere in answering this Question. Although the Questioner has talked about the Kenya Army, I would like to inform him that armed forces could also include the police. Could the Assistant Minister, if he is sincere about these arrests, give us the names of those eight persons and what they were suspected to have done? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>Dr. Wameyo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not know whether that is a question or a point of order. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the Chair agrees with me that the Assistant Minister has no reply. He only knows of eight people who were arrested and he has no other information whatsoever. Can we defer this Question to enable the Assistant Minister to go back and look for a proper reply? He only knows that these people were arrested because of possessing a gun. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Dr. Wameyo, it is important that you specify the possible criminal charge which was preferred against these people. Although you have told the House that they were later n set free, but were any charges actually preferred against them?</Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Wameyo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, no charges were preferred against them and that is why they were released for lack of evidence. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Jaldessa: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The hon. Member for Moyale raised a very important point here; that these security men who are alleged to have arrested these people came from Garissa. But the truth of the matter is that Tana River is a district by itself and it is in a different province. It is not the first time that we have witnessed this kind of thing in those operation areas, whereby members of the Kenya Army are sent from anywhere to go and interfere with the operations of other people who are already in the field. Could the Assistant Minister go and come back here with a clear statement as to why army men from Garissa had to come and arrest people in Tana River District? Could he assure this House that this kind of thing will not be repeated again? This is because there have been a lot of conflicts. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Wameyo: Mr. Deputy Speaker. Sir, if a specific Question is put about officers from Clarissa coming to arrest people in Tana River, we will answer. This is because as far as I am aware there is no law that forbids This is because I have seen police officers coining from Nairobi to Mombasa and picking up people from there. There is no law preventing police officers from arresting people anywhere in the Republic of Kenya. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Galgallo: Oh a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I am seeking your guidance. I think the Assistant Minister is either willing to reply to this Question or not. I am sure he is fully aware that on 4th August, 1992, at 2.00 p.m. at Pangani Trading Centre, Tana River District, two tonic's of Kenya Army Reg. Nos. 12 KA 28 and 44 KA 95 took away the following people:- Hassan Amul Hassan, Hussein Ndupo, Maalim Ogle (Kanu official), Fishah Hussein Ndipo) (Kanu official), Isaac Abdi Farar, Hussein Hassan Abdi, Osman Abdi Ogle and Mohamed Maalim Salat.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, these people were taken and detained unlawfully for ten days at Garissa Police Station. So, I think the Assistant Minister should now reply to the Question in light of that information.Furthermore, these people were looted and lost property worth KSh.10,720.00 and KSh.46,900.00 in cash to the Kenya Army personnel. So, can the Assistant Minister reply to the Question? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Yes, indeed. I am sure hon. Dr. Wameyo, you can do better than that! II' the citizens were deprived of their freedom up to ten days on suspicion of having committed some felony, the House is entitled to know that. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Wameyo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you very much. Now that I have been given specific information on the Question, I will go and investigate the matter further and inform the House accordingly. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kubo: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. While the Assistant Minister has agreed to carry out further investigations into the matter, on the other hand, he should also do further investigations to find out as to whether the Kenya Army personnel and civilians from another district have a right to go and arrest civilians from another district, as it is in this case. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Planning and National Development (Mr. Ogle): On a point of information, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The House should appreciate the fact that this is an operational area since there have been incidents of banditry. It is just common knowledge that the Kenya Army personnel has been deployed to operate in that area. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Jaldessa: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Kenya Army belongs to Kenya and it is supposed to serve the Republic of Kenya impartially. But what has been happening in my area. Kula Mawe, where we have a unit of Kenya Army personnel, a Kenya Army Captain was sent from Nairobi to take over the command of the unit so that he could harass the local people. So, can hon. Dr. Wameyo incorporate that into his reply? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. P.C. Godana: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the Assistant Minister is setting up a very dangerous precedence if he says that it is okay for the Kenya Army personnel to move into an area. harass and arrest people and then detain them for ten days. Why is he condoning such acts? Is he not setting up a very dangerous precedence? Instead of wiping out banditry, he is inciting people against one another. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwanizandi: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Mark the words "with a warrant". Otherwise, without that, no arrest can be made. Again, is hon. Ogle telling the House that the people were "legally" or "illegally" arrested and detained by the Kenya Army personnel for ten days? Is he endorsing the fact that they should have been arrested? Is he happy with that act? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Planning and National Development (Mr. Ogle): On a point of information, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I was not specifically referring to this particular incident. But it is common knowledge that after this House passed a Motion for security to be intensified in those areas, the Kenya Army personnel has been operating in the area since then. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kipkorir: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I would like to know from the Assistant Minister whether it is lawful to detain wananchi for ten days against their will? Why were they not taken to court immediately? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Well, the Assistant Minister has said that he will carry out further investigations and report back to the House. Next Question, Mr. Makhanu. </Newspeech><Header>REGISTRATION OF CANDIDATE OKOTH</Header><Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Education the following Question by Private Notice.What action has the Minister taken to ensure that Master Martin Okoth, a Form IV student at Friends Secondary School, Kamusinga, Bungoma District, sits for this year's K.C.S.E. Examination since his original registration was refused by the Headmaster of the said school? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Education (Mr. Karauri):  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.My Ministry, through the Kenya National Examinations Council,(K.N.E.C.), did not register Master Martin Okoth, a Form IV student at Friends Secondary School, Kamusinga, Bungoma District, to enable him sit for the K.C.S.E. Examination in 1992 because he had not paid the required examination fee of KSh.1,350.00. Due to this fact, his name was not included in the K.C.S.E. entry along with the others by the Headmaster of Friends Secondary School, Kamusinga. However, my Ministry, through the school and the K.N.E.C., has made arrangements to register the pupil for 1992 examination and he will sit for it. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for that positive reply, could he tell the House what arrangements have been made? Have they finalised? Has he been registered or not, and has he paid the money? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Karauri: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the initial problem was that he owes the school a lot of money. So, when he thought he had paid for the examination, the money was used to off-set the balance he owed the school. However, the Ministry has ordered the Headmaster to bring that money so that the student can be registered. I have already been assured that he will sit for the examination this year. </Newspeech><Header>MEDICAL TESTS FOR WORKERS</Header><Newspeech>Mr. Kiilu: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Health the following Question by Private Notice.(a)Is the Minister aware that the staff who work in hotels and restaurants in Masinga Division are being referred for medical examination to Machakos General Hospital?(b)Since this exercise used to be carried out at the divisional headquarters, what reasons have necessitated this exercise to- be conducted at the district headquarters? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Health (Mr. Ogur): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a)No, Sir. (?) (inaudible) but for such services all residents of Yalta, Masinga included, are referred to the hospitals with the necessary facilities for the required medical examinations. These are in Machakos, Kitui, Thika and Embu districts.(b)Information available to the Minister is thatthese services were never carried out at the divisional headquarters, that is, from Kathiani and Kangundo, which have now attained the status of sub-district hospitals. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kiilu: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sure that the answer the Assistant Minister has given is not right because this exercise used to be done within Yalta Divisional headquarters. What has changed the situation recently such that people are being referred to Machakos District headquarters which is very far from Masinga and Yalta? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is nothing like referring people. Not people who form the whole population. Here, the word "people" is specific to those few who happen to be employed in food institutions like hotels. The word "people" here is limited; we are not referring everybody to such areas as the hon. Member is implying. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kiilu: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister has .a tendency of trying to drift from the point. He knows the main idea of the question. Why should he keep on referring to the "people?". Why can he not answer the question properly. I am talking about the people who work in hotels and restaurants. Why should he move from here to there? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the Ion. Member allowed me to explain he would have understood. Every year every time we happen to discover some serious diseases we need proper examination and, therefore, we need proper equipment and, if possible, more qualified staff such as medical doctors. There is nothing wrong in referring a patient, or a person employed to deal with food, to a more qualified medical doctor in a place like Kangundo or Machakos for that matter. There is nothing wrong at all in trying to get a thorough examination done so that we can feel all right and secure. It is for their own good that we are doing that. Thorough medical examination is carried out in a Government medical institution or by a medical officer of health on all employees prior to their employment and at a regular interval of not more than 12 months. We have certificates and health records of each employee showing the dates and the results of health examination. This is why we may occasionally refer someone for a thorough examination in a bigger institution so that we are sure that thorough examination is carried out. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. P.G. Godana: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister is talking of the workers in hotels and restaurants being occasionally referred to a medical officer of health, but the hon. Questioner is talking about a routine practice Which used to be carried out by the clinical officer at the Yalta Health Centre, which is now being referred to the district hospital. Is he convinced that the clinical officer at Yalta Health Centre is no longer able to examine employees of hotels and restaurants for the purposes of issuing food handlers certificates? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is nothing here like being able or unable. Thoroughness is involved. We may be understanding one aspect that whenever a thorough examination is involved we may need certain equipment, sometimes clinical, laboratory or ex-rays, which may not be available in all health centres. This may call for occasional referrals for such issues. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mang'oli: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to try to evade the Question and become irrelevant. The question was very simple: why is this routine check-up not being done? Can he tell us whether he is convinced that it is because of there being more work than before and, therefore, the referrals to Machakos? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thought we were merely trying to take precautions. Every person who owns, operates or is in charge of a food plant should take all reasonable measures and precautions to ensure that all these things are done. If we are sure that certain health centres may not facilitate those measures, then we may refer the people concerned to more competent institutions. We are not saying that we have stopped what he is saying used to happen. If we have probably come across certain cases requiring referral. That is why we are saying that it is occasional that we may send these kind of examinations to be performed by a medical officer of health rather than a clinical officer. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister .has talked a lot about thorough medical examination, and most of us wonder what thorough medical examination means. Could he elucidate the thoroughness which is required in particular hospitals? Does it include ex-rays, scanning, blood or urine tests? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, you know. it is the owner of the hotel who may need this and that, and we will, therefore, need to refer, according to the owner of that hotel or restaurant. This is what we mean. If we have a medical officer of health somewhere and the owner of the hotel wants his employees examined and have the certificate, we may refer the employees to the medical officer of health. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kubo: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is always talking about "may", but the question very specifically asks as to why it happens that employees from that division only are taken to the headquarters. That is specific. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is not the only constituency where hotel workers are being referred to a medical officer of health. If any owner of a hotel requires that we examine his workers, we may refer them to a medical officer of health or deal with the examination at the divisional level. But there is nothing wrong when we refer the workers to a medical officer of health. </Newspeech>POINTS OF ORDER<Header>MISUSE OF OFFICE BY MERU DISTRICT CO-OPERATIVE OFFICER</Header><Newspeech>Mr. Malebe: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. My point of order is directed to the Minister for Co-operative Development and his staff, from the Permanent Secretary to the Commissioner of Co-operatives.The issue at hand here is about the misuse of office by his Co-operative Officer, Mr. Stephen Muturi, of Meru District and his staff. The societies in Meru District have been destabilised the District Co-operatives Officer because he has interfered with their management. He receives goats and money. The counter signing of cheques which is going on in Meru District, orders and any other documents, though a good control of the societies money, has been terribly abused by the District Co-operative Officer. The Ministry officers collude with employees of the societies and some society committee members to sanction payments and orders which are not proper. They normally say that a little "chai" will make a cheque or an order be passed quickly, but how is this "chai" going to be accounted for in the books of the society? This is an issue that I would like the Minister concerned to respond to.Another example of misuse of office which has surprised everybody in Meru District, particularly in Tharaka and Nithi, is that when the District Co-operative Officer went overseas for a course organized by the Ministry of Co-operative Development in June, 1992, the Society provided vehicles and other amenities and many society employees and committee members proceeded to Jomo Kenyatta Airport to see this co-operative officer off. The vehicles belonging to the Ministry of Co-operative Development were also fuelled with the society's money. The same thing was repeated a month later when the same officer returned from the overseas course. We would like to know how all this expense was accounted for in the books of the society. I am asking this because the members of the society are complaining. They are saying that committee in charge of these society give co-operative officer money belonging to the members, when they want him to sign a cheque.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this particular officer has remained in that division for a very long time although he has continued to misuse the societies funds and has now become a bottle neck in the development of the societies themselves. In this era of the multi party, we know there are some civil servants who are sympathising with the opposition and this co-operative officer is one of these civil servants. He is known to be a sympathizer of the Democratic Party and I do not see why he should be kept in the Government service to continue undermining the Government as well as the welfare of the co-operative societies in the division. I would like the Minister for Co-operative Development to take</Newspeech> <Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Order Mr. Malebe! You are now making a speech. Would you please try to wind up your point of order. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Malebe: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister for Co-operative Development to take a specific action immediately to rid Meru of this corrupt co-operative officer. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mutua: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: What is it that you want to say, Mr. Mutua. Can you use the microphone please. We would like to hear you loud and clear. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mutua: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, eeh I am not eeh</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: I cannot hear a single word from you, Mr. Mutua! </Newspeech>MISREPORTING BY THE PRESS: MR. BIWOTT<Newspeech>Mr. Biwott: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I would like to appeal to the newspapers through you, to report the proceedings of this House correctly because they seem to have drifted away from that commitment. It was reported yesterday that during my contribution to debate on the Kiliku Report, I talked about Kibaki's obsession. It is true that in my speech, I talked about Kibaki's obsession in dragging my name in everything bad that happens in this country. On the previous day, Mr. Kibaki was quoted by the newspapers as having said that he will hold me and others in this House responsible for any chaos that may arise in the country in the future. I reacted to that statement here yesterday, but in the report of the newspapers, it is only The Standard that reported what I said, namely that, my quarrel with Kibaki was due to his obsession in dragging my name into all bad things that are done in this country. However, The Daily Nation, quoted me as having said, "Kibaki Obsession with Power", but that is not what I said. After all, I have no quarrel with him becoming the President of this country. If he is obsession with becoming the President of this country, then let him continue being obsessed. However, this is not what I said and the newspapers should not put words into my mouth.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, although I started by complimenting The Standard for reporting what I saidhere correctly, in another paragraph, they reported wrongly by saying that I am the one hon. Kiliku referred to in his Report as the witness who wanted to be interviewed at his own convenience. They went ahead and said that I wanted the Committee to interview me over a cup of tea in the lounge here in Parliament. That is not true and I think it was just malice intended to provoke me. The truth of the matter is that I was interview by the Committee in Committee Rom No.9 and nobody should drag my name into things that not true. It is important therefore for the newspapers to strive to report correctly the facts regarding statements that are made in this House. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: I think they have heard. </Newspeech>THANKS TO THE PRESIDENT: MINISTERIAL APPOINTMENT<Newspeech>The Minister for Regional Development (Mr. K'Ombudo): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to record my very sincere thanks to His Excellency the President, Daniel Toroitich arap Moi for appointing me the Minister for Regional Development. I regard this as an honour to the people of Nyakach and to a less extent an honour to me personally. I toured parts of my constituency yesterday and the people of Nyakach were thrilled by my appointment as a Minister because since this world was created, they have never seen a Nyakach man flying a flag. So, they said they are very thankful to the President for appointing me as the Minister for Regional Development. I would also like to take this opportunity to appeal to the people of Kenya to unit together so that we can pull together for the future development of this country. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Co-operative Development (Mr. Cheruiyot): Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Malebe has made a very serious allegation against my officers that they have been obtaining "chai". While I feel not obliged to respond to that statement, I would suggest that he puts in a Question to the Ministry so that we can investigate into these matters seriously to find out whether really there is any truth in that allegation. I am saying so because if it is found to be true that this officer has been obtaining "chai" and obstructing the development of the co-operative societies in Meru, action would be taken immediately. </Newspeech><Header>SECRETARIAT'S ROLE IN THE CLASHES</Header><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Livestock Development (Mr. Chesire): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Thank you for giving me these very few seconds to rise on a point of order regarding a note that I received this afternoon, which, unfortunately, tends to refer to one of our officers, a Mr. Werunga, from the Clerk's Office who, unfortunately, accosted one of the members of the Press accusing him of having been biased in covering some of us in the on-going Kiliku Select Committee Report on clashes. This is most unfortunate because we know Mr. Werunga as one of the Senior Clerks who was involved in recording and reporting the clashes evidence. We also know that Mr. Werunga comes from the border of Trans-Nzoia and Bungoma Districts which were among the affected areas. It looks sad and unfortunate that Mr. Werunga has brought the problems of his own home area into this House. One would have expected him, and other Clerks reporting on this particular matter, to have been fair and impartial. But from what has now come to light, it is obvious that the Secretariat was biased against some Members of this House. In fact, that strengthens my appeal to this House that the Report be rejected in tow. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Well, Mr. Chesire, I think the better cause of action would be to refer the matter to the Clerk of the National Assembly, for his attention. So, let us not have the conduct of officersâ of the House being subject to debate on the Floor of the House. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ndirangu: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. My point of order is similar to yours. I wanted to say that we should not drag names of officers' of the National Assembly into the House.	</Newspeech>					<Header>MISREPORTING BY K.B.C. AND K.N.A</Header><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Culture and Social Services (Mrs. Ogot): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I want to appeal to members of the Press, particulary the Kenya News Agency (KNA) and the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC), to give proper reports. Yesterday, a Harambee was conducted in Butere Constituency by the Ministry of Culture and Social Services and was presided over by His Excellency the President. The Minister for Culture and Social Services did not attend that Harambee, but I took a Ministerial cheque of Kshs.30,000/= including my own contribution to be presented at the Harambee. However, it does not matter if the amount I contributed was not mentioned, but it is saddening to note that the KBC ignored my Ministry's cheque by not reporting the Ministry's contribution. This morning I received a rude shock when I was asked what I did with the cheque. I am very embarrassed about the whole thing. However, I do realize the fact that it was an oversight because the Press does give service to all of us. All the same, I wanted to draw the attention of the Press to the embarrassment caused to me.	</Newspeech>									<Header>BANDITRY MENANCE IN MARSABIT</Header><Newspeech>Mr. P.G. Godana: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I would like to draw the attention of this House to what is happening in my constituency as far as security is concerned. My people are so scared that they do not know what to do next. We have been invaded from all corners, across our borders and from within our own borders. We are living in fear of death every minute. Last week, in this very House, I listed a litany of banditry activities in Marsabit and incidence that have taken place including loss of lives. This week, the notorious Walda Refugee Camp was invaded once again. Bandits came over night and killed people, burnt houses and walked away scot free when we have a police station a few metres away. Under such circumstances people keep on asking whether our security personnel have abdicated their responsibility of safeguarding our people's lives or not.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I once again appeal to the Government and to the Minister in charge of Internal Security to specifically address this issue and take it up as a matter of urgency. If this is done, this will save us loss of more lives. I would also like the Ministry concerned to issue a Ministerial Statement to this House by Tuesday, next week because we have so many bandits and arms floating around my area and my people do not know what to do next. If action is not taken immediately by the Government, people will have no choice, but maybe to run away across the border to acquire arms illegally in order to protect themselves. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mang'oli: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Mr. Mang'oli, we have to get on because we cannot dwell on points of order the whole afternoon. </Newspeech>Next Order!											MOTION											<Header>ADOPTION OF SELECT COMMITTEE REPORT ON ETHNIC CLASHES				</Header>	(Mr. Kiliku on 24.9.92) (Resumption of Debate interrupted on 7.10.92)<Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Can you continue with your contribution Dr. Misoi as you were on the Floor when the House adjourned yesterday? </Newspeech>[Mr. Deputy Speaker left the Chair][The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi) took the Chair]<Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to continue with my contribution on the Kiliku Report.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, at the rise of the House last evening I said that we are grateful to the President of this Republic, His Excellency President, Daniel Toroitich arap Moi, for his personal intervention and visits to the areas where the clashes occurred. He did so after all the other efforts had failed. He travelled to those areas and met the people and also consoled them. He told them- to maintain peace, love and unity and live as brothers and sisters. Notwithstanding what the President is doing the critics keep on shouting abusive words against the Government, Kanu, the President and everybody else. The critics made no efforts to bring peace back in those areas, but they instead continue inciting people to cause more unrest. If they realty loved Kenya, they should have been the first people to go there and tell wananchi to stop the clashes. They should have told wananchi that they would not benefit from quarrelling, fighting or even from occassioning damages and losses.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the debate in this House today is the outcome of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Ethnic Clashes. The role of the Parliamentary Select Committee was for them to come out with reasons and factors that created this situation. They were to investigate whether the fighting in parts of the country were ethnic clashes, land clashes or political clashes. They were also to find out whether they were internationally inspired clashes or whether they were a combination of all. We would have preferred to have a definition of the major factor in these clashes. We would also have liked to know what caused these clashes because the Committee has given several' findings on the causes of the clashes. Their Report states that multi partism was part of the root cause of the clashes. In its unnatural to state that multi party politics, cannot be considered to be a reason for fights of that kind.The Members of this Committee have gone further and mentioned federalism, but, in its natural sense and definition as a system of government at a lower level, it could not be a real reason for fighting. Unless evidence from witnesses suggested that people were fighting for multi partyism or majimboism, there is nothing of that kind in the Report. It is only alleged here that it was probably because of this and that that fighting took place. Therefore, to blame this political system for pluralism and federalism without sufficient evidence obtained direct from people is misleading and superficial.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there also the factor of the clergy who had to preach in our temples and churches, through their pastoral letters.The Committee would have been wise to get copies of these pastoral letters and determine whether the content and substance of those letters was enhancing the unity of our people or endangering national unity. You will be surprised to note that the call in those letters was either for the removal of this Government, Kanu, Moi or another dirty statement. Would such a call have enhanced unity and understanding among the people? The clergy are supposed to take care of their flock by bringing all people to church if they really preach the word of God as preached by Christ. They are not supposed to cause hatred, division, conflict or tribalism. The Committee should have looked into that. When I read through this Report, I find only one reference to a Catholic father in Molo. What about the others?There are those who fought for pluralism, but one doubts whether they were really serious or whether they understood what democracy means. In pluralism, you have parties competing for responsibility in the management of national affairs. This issues was so personalised, and nobody took time to think of the effect and impact of this personalisation and attacks against individuals. Instead of such personalisation, there should have been talk about policies, issues and programmes.We have our press media playing a major role as tools of information. Did they really play a neutral, independent and responsible role or did they merely become partisan and channels of propaganda, rumour mongering, exaggerated information and often unfounded news items? I may mention here that I protested in this House last June about a Daily Nation report that there were people in Burnt Forest, in my constituency, who were being fought with arrows and having their houses burnt down right and left, resulting in the death of many people. I objected to this story because it was false. The writer of that false piece of information was not able to justify and substantiate it. There was no fighting, burning of houses or people dying like grasshoppers in my constituency on 2nd May, and yet that was the information that was broadcast throughout this nation and went out to international newspapers. Instead of responding to my challenge, the newspaper concerned went round beating about the bush and talking nonsense. Were they really</Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi): Order, Dr. Misoi! That word is unparliamentary. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for that correction.These people went round and round trying to evade the issue. Were they promoting peace and national unity, or division and tribalism? The incident at Burnt Forest was between the Kalenjin and the Kikuyu, who had lived together for years, building schools, going to church and using all other common facilities together, and yet a newspaper concerned arrogated itself the responsibility of spreading such useless pieces of information.When we talk about clashes, these are the points we are supposed to take into account so that we are able to apportion blame to the right areas. We have the international media, non-governmental organisations, which may have acted on false premises and propaganda supplied by irresponsible personalities in this country, whose aim was to discredit the good of this nation and the development we have achieved.Nobody in this country can tell us that many countries in Africa have done far better than Kenya. whether politically, socially, economically, industrially or otherwise. If there are a few countries ahead of us, they cannot be more than three or four. Therefore, to be reprimanded by the international community to the degree of freezing all our aid is unfair and an abuse of human rights. Our people are suffering from the impact of this freeze. This suffering does not arise from international negligence, but from Kenyans themselves, who have been blinded and are power hungry and ambitious to go to the top. They want to go to the top, walking on the corpses of people who have died because of hunger, lack of drugs and famine. These are the same people who are going round saying, "Give us votes. We want to rule." Whom are they going to rule over when they have killed so many people? That did not enhance the unity of this country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Committee has talked about many parties being formed in this country, but when you look at the majority of these parties, you find that they are conglomerations of personalities from one area. They are so localised that they are sometimes not even tribal, but village based. They are geographically set, and they cannot be national, A national party is supposed to have support from all over the Republic. That is when we can say that the leaders of such a party are nationalistic. When you look at these parties, you find that what they have done is to identify people who may not have been elected in the recent past, say in 1988 or 1983, and pick them to be their leaders in the areas concerned.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, you wonder whether those leaders can sell these new parties. Multi partism means that the registered parties should be vehicles for national integration and not disintegration. As we debate this Report we cannot even what will happen with the process of disintegration and political parties. Political parties are supposed to be able to manage conflicts and find solutions to people's problems. They have not been able to do that. Instead they are spliting into small units. What would happen if they took over power in this country? Will they be able to manage the country and solve the problems facing its people? They cannot claim to have the capacity to rule as well as Kanu has done so far.The Report refers to administrative problems that may have caused fights and conflicts in this country. But there are no valid grounds to confirm that the whole system of Provincial Administration and security promoted and facilitated these clashes. Even land disputes have been cited as a cause of the clashes. But land disputes did not start recently. People migrated to the Rift Valley as far back as in 1940s and they have been living there. So, since land disputes have always been there why should it now be claimed that these disputes were the cause of the clashes. I do not believe this reason.There is also this very important factor of multi-ethnicity. When we talk of a nation we are talking of people who have agreed to live together; we are talking of cohesive and harmonious community. Here lies the danger of destabilisation, either internally or externally engineered. This is the danger which results when we do not prepare our people for changes, or when we want to use our tribal affiliation to acquire power. It is very dangerous because the degree of our cohesiveness is not yet able to withstand pressures and tremors of changes of this kind. It is wrong for any leader to believe that what takes place in the United Kingdom or the United States. Doing this is ignoring our social strata and level of development. I would have been wise for the committee to have looked at this particular factor and identified, for example, the primary factors which led to this scenario, the secondary factors which came into play and what opportunistic agent which may have been incorporated. The Committee has only listed factors. But did these contribute to the same extent? Could there have been more aggravating factors leading to the clashes? The Committee ought to have found this out by weighing and balancing all the pieces of evidences.This Report is based on hearsay, heresy and rumours. There is no corroboration of evidence and yet the same has been used to victimise people. How can you pass judgement from a one sided story? Is that really fair and just? Some of this evidence is just biased opinions of people with political and tribal overtones. Was it not the role of the Committee to know that this type of evidence was concocted for a purpose?The Committee has talked about introduction of multi parties and culture. But did they scrutinise for example, the way and manner in which this particular concept was introduced into this country, the personalities who introduced and the preparedness of Kenyans to adapt to it? Did they look into the reaction of the communities and the perception of the people in view of these changes? Did the Committee identify all the attacks on the President, Kanu, Ministers and state corporations and so on? Did they look into these attacks to determine whether they may have catalysed the clashes? Of course, the aim was to cause disaffection against the Government.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, did the Committee scrutinise the external interferences which were directed to this country by ambassadors and intelligence agencies? Did they look at the contribution of these bodies and how they exploited the situation in this country to a new political system? Did they try to find out what could have taken place in muddled and complex political situation? Did they try find out whether some of the foreigners could have come here as political mercenaries as they have done in other places? Who does not know what has happened in Angola? Was it not the so called super powers who were promoting parties to fight one another? The same thing happened in Mozambique and Lebanon.Was it not wise for the Committee to look into this aspect. The Committee ought to have done this, otherwise they have identified only symptoms and not the real causes, which may be hidden. The should have identified genuine activators, promoters, propagators, perpetrators and even catalysers those who move in to make the reaction very fast and the destruction immense. The Report must be respectable and should not have many gaps if we are to adopt it. As I said before, the problem is not pluralism, neither the question of Kanu as a monolithic single party. The problem lies elsewhere. Perhaps, it is the mode of introduction of the changes, their presentation, content, the timing and so on.I have not seen in the Report any mention of the five attempted coups d' tat in the Nyayo Era starting from 1982. This is relevant. That is the time when people wanted pluralism in the country. Is it not a fact that some parties were to be registered at that time? That was not a peaceful change of Government. It was an attempt to take over the Government by force. What is the difference now between people who were fighting there and those who fought here in Nairobi where there were these coup attempts? Who were the people who were behind it? Are they still playing the game? The Committee even never bothered to look into that. If we are to arrive at conclusive evidence, we have to look at the Saba Saba situation which was here. There chaos in Nairobi, Eldoret, Mombasa, Kisumu and elsewhere. There was stoning of vehicles and buildings. These are the developments of a culture of violence. Those who are aware of revolutions and so on, do that to ensure that the system which is in power is hit at so that everything can fall apart. When everything falls apart, you invite another "FORD" to take over.Therefore, Saba Saba was the second phase to destabilize the country and to introduce new unconstitutional steps. These are the factors which have to be taken into account. Defiance of the law is the best and surest route to tyranny. Who does not know about that? Once you defy the rule of law, little by little, you are preparing yourself for tyranny and mob justice in which deaths will occur. Are we not doing this? The Committee ought to have known that.  They should have looked into all such disobedience and everything that is illegal. That was preparing for tyranny. It is a very sad commentary for all the Kenyans who may have witnessed this.This is a very important Report and our parties should try to united Kenyans and not to divide them. Every tribe should not say that they should produce a President because their tribe is big. They should not say "our tribe is the largest, we must rule this country for 100 years; we are the second, third and forth largest tribes." We shall go on until we come to the end of the 43 tribes. Of course, those tribes with less population will fight to rule this country. What is that? They have been talking about marginal tribes; small tribes and even Red Indians. Since when did we have Red Indians in Kenya who cannot be presidents? People talk of individual human tribes but when it comes to their tribe, they forget that they are made of individuals. We must, therefore, accord rights to every individual because they are Kenyans. Nobody should use any measure to discriminate against others tribes be they large or small. This is immaterial; they are also made of individuals and they are Kenyans. They have a right to all that is provided in this country and to all the resources that we have. If you are a politician and you go around boasting that you are this and that, then that is a shame.We should avoid tribalising our political system. Kadu and Kanu merged in 1963/64 with the aim of having a national outlook. We cannot now go back and dig into tribal affiliation. This is not correct. Anybody singing tribal tunes is making a grave mistake.												Another thing that the Kiliku Report did mention is the full Government explanation and assessment of the causes and the progress in stamping out these clashes in Western Kenya and Rift Valley. I do not see any mention of this in the Report and yet before the Committee started its work, a Government Report was issued. The people would want to see what that Report contained. It is not enough to interview the Permanent Secretary in charge of Internal Security, Office of the President. The Committee went to the grassroot where they could have interviewed the CID in-charge, District Special Branch Officers and all the other agents there. Democracy operates at the grassroots and not here.During the Moi Era, we have had the Kiliku Report which we are now discussing. It is a public document. We had the Ouko Commission Report on which action is being taken. I hope we are not forgetting that even in the past, we have had other Reports like the J.M. Report but nobody knows what happened to it. The same leaders are still here. Queries were put up but all is silent. Nobody knows who did what. There are others; we do not want to go into history. For instance, nobody knows what happened with regard to the deaths of Tom Mboya, Pinto Gama and others. But at least during the Moi Era, welave managed to institute some Committees to unearth whatever has been committed by certain people.To me, that may be a final development or a kind of improvement. We have even been told that people like Biwott, Chesire and Barng'etuny are alleged to have financed Kalenjin Warriors. What evidence is there to show that these people financed the warriors? Through who and who received that money? Did the Committee try to get the man who received the money to tell them "Look, I got Kshs.1,000.00 to kill and burn houses"? How do you justify such an allegation? This is serious because it is spoiling people's names. If there is prove that they committed this, then well and good. But where there is no prove or where there is flimsy ground, then surely, is a Committee of that kind respectable enough to submit a Report of this kind to this House which is a supreme body of the land and which should be discussing serious matters affecting the people of this Country? We are the protectors of Kenyans. How can we have allegations of this kind to the effect that Biwott was financing a private army in the Maasai Mara?Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there have even been allegations that Mr. Biwott has a private army. But you will find that the Committee summoned Mr. Oginga Odinga and said "Oh, we do not swear him in; let him tell us how he got the story." They had invited him in writing telling him "Please come and tell us what you said at Chester House." But when he arrived here he was too big for the Committee. He told the Committee "This is the man here who is going to tell you what I said." If somebody says "I said this because So-and-so told me this" was it not proper for the Committee to tell him "Now tell us what you were told?" Was that not right? What was this Committee doing? What were they doing? They simply accepted what Odinga said. They put it in their Minutes. I would like to quote Minute No.171 which reads as follows:-"The Committee received and held discussion with Mr. Jaramogi Oditiga, the interim chairman of the Forum for Restoration of Democracy, FORD, who was accompanied by his lawyer, James Orengo. Mr. Odinga who was not sworn in informed the Committee that his utterances touching on the recent ethnic clashes emanated from information availed to him by a Mr. Valentinus Uhuru Kodipo. Mr. Oginga described Mr. Kodipo as one who had participated in that thing."Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is the greatest thing you can ever read. If the Committee accepted that information what was the rationale for not swearing in Mr. Oginga and give the same information? </Newspeech><Newspeech>An hon. Member: Shame to them! </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: What calibre of Committee Members are they? That is an omission which makes this Committee, and the allegations, not respectable.											Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if hon. Biwott and hon. Bamgetuny financed the "Kalenjin Warriors" who financed the Luo Warriors, Chinkorom, Luhya Warriors and the Kikuyu Warriors? Who funded them? Why did the Committee not identify, and if they failed to identify. Why did they say there were warriors from other tribes? What grounds did they have? </Newspeech><Newspeech>An Hon. Member: What were they doing at Sirikwa Hotel? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: Maybe they were having a nice time using public funds! This is serious indeed! There are many loose ends in this Report. Many utterances have been made. Some have even alleged that there is an army to assassinate President Moi. Some have even said that if Kanu wins they are going to the bush. I wonder whether they have a forest into which they can go, where other  people cannot go. Others have said that if Kanu wins there will be violence and the Government will collapse within three years. Who needs those predictions? Who wants violence in this country where we are singing about peace, love and unity every day? Why can they not preach the same? What are the rewards of wars and violence? Whenever chaos erupts, the innocent become victims. The perpetrators of such evils flee the country and observe things from a safe distance. When chaos breaks out those who have looted will flee this country to and enjoy their loot. The victims are the innocent small people who are being used and exploited. We need to be careful. The Committee ought not to have called witnesses selectively; calling some and leaving others out. They have put other people's names in the Report, like Chesire's name and so on. They called him for interview here and then at around 12.30 p.m. they came out saying they were hungry and that they could not interview him because they were going out for lunch. But they have put his name in this Report and the man has not even defended himself. What kid of a Committee was it? I was there; they called me. Of course they never mentioned me; I was not one of the perpetrators and I had nothing to tell them. But the fact that they called us means that at least they wanted to hear something from us. But they came out and said "we are tired, we want to go and eat" yet what they were eating was bought with taxpayers money. But they ended up spoiling other people's names. That is the wrong thing to do.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me now touch on what they have referred to as Majimbo Debates. They have said that those debates constitute one of the factors that led to the clashes. I want to thank some hon. Members who have spoken. I did not start Majimbo: they do not remember their history; they do not read. Even before I had talked about Majimbo an hon. Member had already talked about Majimbo in this House. Hon. Ogle talked about Majimbo before I did. Even hon. Mang'oli talked about Majimbo in Webuye before I did. These people do not even know where I addressed that Press conference and this is a disturbing factor. On page eight of the Report they say:-"The rallies were preceded by a statement by hon. Dr. Misoi, at a Pressconference in Eldoret."Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I gave that Press conference at Parliament Buildings here. Do the Committee Members ever read? Why did they not check to ascertain the facts about what I had said? This is very serious. Even what I had said was simply distorted to mean something else by those who thought they knew; those who think they have a right to talk and exercise the freedom of expression. They did that for other reasons; because they were frightened. They have never understood one thing; that this thing called federalism is a simple mechanism in managing the affairs of the land. It does not mean that people should be evicted from where they live. It does not mean that tribes have to move back to where they came from; their ancestral lands. It means that it is a government where you decentralise some functions to the lower level and the central government remains the guarantor of all rights of the people. That is what it means. I believe that those people are ignorant of what federalism is supposed to be. The statement I made in this House, and not in Eldoret, and I hope that they will correct it, was that in highly developed countries of the world they have plularistic governments. They have many political parties and they have federalism. So, federalism is not against pluralism: it complements pluralism. It does not conflict with pluralism. It is non-tribal and it is not discriminative; it respects constitutional rights and freedoms of the people. It was unfair for people to misinterpret what is obvious to mean something else. Were they frightened? I never uttered a word against any person or any tribe or any community in my Press statement. So, people went around talking all sorts of nonsense all over the place. Some of the people who fought against it said "They are going to create tribalism; they are going erode democracy in this country if we allow this kind of thing." Why did they do that. Look at the United States of America, the best democracy in the world.Look at the U.S., the best democracy economically, financially, industrially, technologically and in all other ways. It has a federal system of government. Why do we run there all the time to seek for their financial assistance or political support, if their system is bad? There are many others. In fact, I could talk of many more. For instance, Nigeria, Switzerland, India, Canada, Australia and even Great Britain! They have this type of system of government and it was there. So, when somebody says let us have it, people panic. And even the most enlightened people who have educated in some of those countries professors and lecturers - come here to deceive people with rubbish and nonsense. I beg pardon, if that is not Parliamentary. It is nonsense. When people choose not to be realistic, they mislead others to believe and think otherwise.Of course, their intention was to cause havoc and chaos in the country. We understand that. Nobody can tell me that in a federal system, there is no transparency, accountability and so on. I am sure the federal institutions below there act as breaks and balances at that level. They operate democratically at the lower level and to the satisfaction of the people. Nobody is running around there trying to sell what is not saleable.Sir, we need to be realistic; we need to nature and develop plural politics properly in this country for the benefit of all. We should ensure that people participate fully in the development of this country. The other day I was reading Kenya Times of 5th October, 1992, titled: "Elect me, Odinga pleads with his voters". Mr. Odinga says and quote:-"Local Government was modified and needed streamlining so that it could serve its purpose effectively Once this was done, there would be no need for Provincial Administration since the Local Authorities would be running their own Government whose authority will be directly derived from the people".Mr. Odinga is talking about "micro majimboism", and this is in the FORD Manifesto. The functioning of the Local Authorities would be strengthened and would have more powers. So, they are only varying the sort of "majimboism people" I have been talking about and take them at a higher level. So, the question here is that when So-and-So says this, it is smeared with something; if another person says this, the media gives its meaning the way it wants it. The Committee has made its conclusions about what they found and the conclusion is very interesting. First of all, when the Chairman moved the Motion, he exonerated the Government that it was not a party. That was very good. But what is on record here to the effect that the Provincial Administration was contributing, is that not implicating the Government? This is what is on record. What was said by hon. Kiliku and hon. Mureithi, the Seconder, is something else. It is not in the Report. So, the accusation on the part of the Provincial Administration does implicate the Government. So, is it not a contradiction for us to be told that the Government is not involved or implicated unless you have not read the Report?The security, likewise, is also incriminated in the Report. All these are Kanu organs. Is that not implicating the system? This is pretty serious and hope hon. Members will take note of that. If you also look at the names of the people who have been named, in the Report, they are mainly Kalenjins, Luhya, Kisii and Maasai. One wonders. If there is a conflict between one community and another, what happens? Do you not have somebody from the other side reacting? Why are their names not mentioned? This is a one sided story. It means the other party was asleep. That is why I said that the causative agents of the clashes has not been identified since the story is one sided. I would also have wished that the religious organisations already mentioned in the Report as promoters in fanning the clashes should have been included in the recommendation so that we have something to go by. What did the Committee think they were doing? If they had no time, they should have asked the Clerk Assistants to go through the papers and unearth information as to who did what. If they were able to go through the list of people who spoke in Kapkatet and Kapsabet about majimboism, what made it so difficult to list these other people by name? Why put them under one blanket as "all religious organisations and the clergy"? Do they not have names? Even churches have names. For instance, C.P.K., A.I.C., Catholic and so on. We also have people running them. The Committee also gave the promoters of multi partism a blanket name. What was the problem here? Did they not know the leaders of those parties? Yet the Committee went ahead to dissect the others to the lowest level, assistant chiefs, and leaving out important people who can mobilise the whole world and move mountains. I am sorry to say that the Committee did not do its work.The clashes were not only confined to Western Kenya. There were a few along Nairobi Naivasha road at the time when a few Kalenjins were removed from buses and killed. Even another one was also killed here in Nairobi; he was axed! I wonder whether the Committee conducted any interview here or not to find out what was happening. There was even the rumour that Kalenjin warriors were seen in a forest in Murang'a of all the places. Did the Kalenjins go there and say, "We are in the forest" or somebody created a rumour there to make sure that the Kalenjins are hated? How mobile were these Kalenjins to go there? Did the Chairman of the Committee ask those questions? Because there was fear that there were warriors there, people moved away. How can you make the people of Murang'a move away from their homes because of a rumour? These Kalenjins were everywhere. That is not believable. That is not a reason for excuse, yet the Committee did not go to find out who had created this fear in Kinale Forest and a few other forests. Was it because of hatred against that community? And what was to be the benefit when you mislead school children that "All this forest is full of these warriors?" This is not believable. This was to break this country into pieces; this was to make the youth of this country fight so that when you see a Kalenjin you hit him with a rungu or slash him with a knife and when others see a Kikuyu or a Luo they do the same. And this was done by people who claim to be leaders, and they have been leaders, and they want to lead this country I do not know to where. Maybe, to darkness. After 30 years of Independence we should have matured and known the pitfalls of certain public stands and issues so that we can avoid them.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are told that these warriors were organised. I am saying that because in Kalenjin tradition and culture we have always had warriors of some kind but they are not war-like. They were there many years ago even when Wazungu came. They were also called warriors but the Committee did not go out to find out the origin of this group in that community. I happen to come from the Kalenjin community. Because of their traditional way of life, living outside with wild animals, being exposed to hazards of different kinds and attacks from other communities, they developed a sense of a defensive system. Maybe, the Committee is not aware that in Kalenjin community there is what we call initiation. Young people are circumcised into adulthood and told, "Now you are a man; you can defend yourself and your people". This is what happens. On the face of adversity or danger, those people who have passed through to adulthood do not need organisation; they do not need promotion or rewards. They need absolutely nothing. What they need to know is that there is danger there and they will go to defend themselves. So, what people think of warriors are the same. Nobody organised them. There was an alarm there and the people went there to protect themselves automatically. So, the Committee should forget this notion of "Oooh! They looked like organised people" because they do not know the culture of these people yet they are Kenyans who ought to know it. I show them this book called Nandi Customary Law, which shows how the Kalenjins have been for a long time. When they write a Report like this to say that they appeared organised and that they were standing like military people and so on, and then they had smeared themselves with red ochre, that is traditional. Nobody organised them, so they should forget about organisation because it is absolutely irrelevant. And the Committee tried to render itself even irrelevant by not looking at the socio-cultural issues of the people. There were no such organised groups to fight others.In conclusion, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, I would like to say that the Committee, to my understanding and according to the information I have here, did not come out with a convincing, plausible and serious report, which makes it doubtful, taken on the basis of that alibi of Kodipo. It means that the Committee was manipulated by those politicians to take into account obvious falsehoods from one man. It made the Committee show lack of competence to mastermind and interpret complex political issues facing the nation. The Report, therefore, fails to pass the test because this House is not a rubber stamp; this is a serious House and the Committee should have taken note of that. I submit that the Report should not be adopted as it is dangerous. If we have to adopt this Report, it means the adoption of other reports placed in the newspapers either by the National Council of Churches of Kenya or the Law Society of Kenya and so on. That is the strategy that these people have made to cover... And we will have their reports incorporated with that of a Parliamentary Select Committee, such that when we are adopting them we expose ourselves to dangers and ridicule. The Report should be rejected forthwith.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to say only one last thing, that in my constituency there were no clashes except in one farm bordering Kipkelion where the clashes were spill overs from other areas. The people of that constituency are people who endear themselves to peaceful co-existence. They are Kalenjins, Kikuyus, Luos, Luhyas and even Turkanas. I have everybody there and the language we speak is that of love; that of one Kenyan people. They belong to that area and not to Tiuicana land because they are not living there and there is no Turkana land; they do not belong to Kikuyu land because there is no Kikuyu land. Wherever you are you are on Kenyan land. That is the language we speak. I want to ask the leader of the Democratic Party (DP) to come to Uasin Gishu District. I am inviting him there because it would be interesting to note that the people he has consulted, are the people from Othaya who happens to be rich businessmen people. This is why we are questioning</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ndirangu: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if I heard hon. Dr. Misoi correctly, he said that there are no people who were killed during the clashes in his constituency. However, when I turn to page 85 of this Report, I notice that a total of 159 people died in Uasin Gishu District. Is he in order to mislead this House? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: Mt. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member should know that I come from Eldoret South and not Uasin Gishu. However, what I was saying is that the DP leader has only consulted the people from his area. So, how national can a party like D.P be? How can it claim to have support from the majority of the people in this country? When he complains about people causing trouble to him wherever he goes, he must realize it is because they do not want him. Why should he go to a place where people do not want you? If the people do not want to listen to you, why should you force them to listen to you? After all, people are free to say yes or no and therefore, if Kibaki knows that his party is not popular in a particular area, why should he go there? What he does is that he goes to such areas where the people do not even want to see him, and when he "get stones", he then starts blaming President Moi and Kanu. Moi was not in Murang'a or Gatundu. Moi cannot be everywhere at the same time. My advise to Mr. Kibaki is that where he knows he is not popular, he should forget going there. When he passed through Mois Bridge on his way to Kitale, nobody chased him. The People came out of their homes and looked at him seriously and he just came back Nairobi to say that he had seen warriors in the forest. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Barngetuny: He is a coward! </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: This was not true! Our people are not wild nor are they war-mongers and, therefore, my advise to the opposition is that where they are welcome, they should try their luck there, but where they are not, they should keep away.With those few remarks, I oppose the adoption of this Report. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Barngetuny: Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipatia nafasi hii ambayo nimeingojea kwa muda mrefu. Ningetaka kusema kwamba Ripoti hii imelichafua jina langu sana na ningetaka. kuanzia kwa upande wa Meteitei. Ripoti yenyewe inasema kwamba fujo hizi za ukabila zilianzishwa kule Meteitei ambapo ninakaa. Ajabu ni kwamba watu wengine wanasema kwamba mimi nilianzisha vita vya ukabila katika sehemu hii. ya Meteitei lalcini jambo hilo si la kweli kabisa. Ninakumbuka kwamba siku tatu baada ya vita hivi kutokea, hats waandishi wa gazeti la Daily. Nation walifika kule nyumbani kwangu na wakafika kule saa mmoja asubuhi. Kwa bahati mbaya, mimi nilikuwa hapa Nairobi kwa sababu bibi yangu alikuwa mgonjwa na akalala katika hosptiali ya M.P Shar.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, wakati vita hii ya ukabila ilipoanza katika upande Meteitei, ni kweli nyumba za watu zilichomwa na wakati Kamati hii ilipokuwa ikiketi hapa Nairobi, mimi niliweza kutoa ushahidi wangu kuhusu jambo hili kwa kinaganaga. Ajabu ni kwamba Kamati hii iliandika maneno machache to na kusema kwamba Bw. Barngetuny aliwaunga mkono watu 310 ambao walitaka wengine wafukuzwe kutoka Shamba la Meteitei. Ningetaka kulifahamisha Bunge hili kwamba mambo ya Meteitei yalianza mwaka wa 1976 wakati nilipokuwa diwani katika sehemu hiyo. Mimi mwenyewe nilipigania wale waliokuwa maskwota katika shamba hilo na ni kasema kwamba ni lazima wapewe mashamba. Nilimchagua mwenyikiti wa shamba hili aliyekuwa Mkikuyu aitwaye Njenga. Pia nilimweka Mluhya aitwaye Chelal awe mwandishi na nikamchagua Mkisii aitwaye Thomas awe mweka hazina. Pia niliwachagua Wakalenjin watatu wawe manaibu wa kuwasaidia hawa watu katika mambo ya Meteitei. Nilifanya hivyo kwa sababu sikutaka mambo ya ukabila yaendeshwe katika shamba hili. Wanachama wa shamba hill walikuwa tayari wamekwishalinunua lakini nilisema kwamba wale maskwota wa makabila mengine ni lazima wapatiwe mashamba. Nilisema kwamba wasiwalete watu kutoka Kiambu, Kisii, Kakamega, au Nandi North or South. Nilitaka watu waliokuwa pale Meteitei, wapatiwe nafasi ya kwanza katika shamba hill.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, tulinunua shamba hilo na tukamaliza na aliyekuwa Director of Settlement, alikuwa Bw. Gachanja ambaye alimchagua Bw. Kibe kama settlement officer. Walionunua shamba hili walikuwa watu 310 peke yao na baada ya kazi ya kununua shamba hilo ilikwisha, mimi niliwaachia wenyewe waendelee. Mimi sikutamani kupata hata hisa moja katika shamba hilo na ninashangaa sana kuona kwamba mwenyekiti wa Kamati hii aliendelea kuwauliza watu kila wati kama mimi nilihusiana na uongozi wa shamba hill la Meteitei. Wengi waliotoa ushahidi wao mbele ya Kamati hii, walikuwa ndugu zangu na nikajua kwamba alikuwa na lengo la kuchafua jina langu. Mimi sikuhusiana hata kidogo na shamba hili na wale wakurugenzi ambao niliwachagua, nilifanya hivyo ill kuwezakuwasaidia wale wasiokuwa na mashamba. Lakini ajabu ni kwamba yule Mkisii aitwaye Thomas alikwenda kule Tinderet ambapo kuna shamba la majani chai, akawakusanya Wakisii wengine na kuwaleta kule Meteitei. Pia mwingine alikwenda kale Mkoa wa Magharibi, na kuwaleta wenzake kule Meteitei akawapatia mashamba. Basi, waliendelea kukusanya pesa kutoka kwa hawa watu na kuzitumia pesa hizo. Hawa wakurugenzi ndio waliharibu mambo mpaka wale watu 310 waliokuwa wamelinunua shamba hili, wakaanza kulalamika.Baada ya hapo, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, tulipeleka ripoti kuhusu jambo hili kwa mkuu wa wilaya ambaye aliwaleta askari na kuwashika hawa watu. Lakini hawa watu walikuwa na akili. Walikwenda mpaka Kericho na Kitale na kumtafuta wakili. Pengine hawa watu walitoa hongo ill waachiliwe. Watu waliendelea kulalamika. Aliyekuwa mkuu wa wilaya wakati huo alikuwa Bw. Chang'ole na alifanya bidii sana kujaribu kutatua shida iliyokuweko -katika shamba hili. Ajabu ni kwamba alihamishwa kabla ya kumaliza kazi hiyo. Badala yake, tuliletewa Mkisii kama mkuu wa wilaya, lakini yeye hakuweza kufanya chochote kuhusu taabu hii. Ninavyokumbulca ni kwamba tulikwenda mpaka kwa mkuu wa mkoa na jambo hili lilikuwa limejulikana na viongozi wote katika sehemu hii ya Meteitei. Kuna mkuu wa tarafa ambaye ametajwa katika Ripoti hii aitwaye Bw. Mwangi. Huhu ndiye alitugonganisha na ikawa ni lazima tufanye mkutano wa viongozi wote katika sehemu hii chini ya mkuu wa wilaya.Tulimwambia DC, Bw. Mativo asimkubali huyo DO huyo kwenda katika hilo shamba kwa sababu wanachama walikuwa hawamutaki. Huyo DO alirudi huko mara ya pill. Tarehe 28 wakati nilikuwa hospitalini huyo DO alirudi huko tena baada ya kuhamishwa hadi Eldoret. DC alikwenda huko na wananchama wa hilo shamba wakamuambia huyo DO kwamba wanantaka wale watu ambao hawakukushanya pesa kununua hilo shamba waondoke katika hilo shamba au wachange pesa. Nilieleza Kamati haya meneno yote lakini lengo la Kamati lilikuwa kwamba halikutaka kusikia ukweli wangu. Nilihojiwa kwa muda wa saa mzima hapa Bungeni na hii Kamati.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, badaye wanachama wa hilo shamba walisema kwamba ingekuwa makosa kwa Serikali kuwaondoa hawa watu kutoka shamba lao. Waliamua kuchoma nyumba kufatana na haya maneno. DO ndiye aliwaambia hawa watu wachome hizo nyumba na akawatenganisha Wakalenjin na makabila mengine katika shamba hilo. Idadi ya wanachama wote ilikuwa 680 badala ya 310. Mhe. Naibu Spika wa Muda swali ni hili: Ikiwa ni wewe, utakubalia mtu kudai ardhi yako? Jambo la shamba hilo halikuhusiana na vita au ukabila. Ilionekana wazi wazi kwamba pesa za wanachama fulani zilikuwa simetumiwa kwa njia isio halali. Mlcuu wa Mkoa wa Mkoa wa Rift Valley alitembelea hiyo sehemu na tukamueleza vile mambo ya shamba hilo yalikuwa mwaka uliyopita. Isitoshe, Repoti ya Kiliku ina "urongo" kwa sababu imesema kwamba asiku wa tarehe 29 askari wa polisi walichoma nyumba katika shamba hilo. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi): Order! Bw. Barg'entuny. Ingefaa utimie neno lingine badala ya neno "urongoâ. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Barngetuny: Asante sana Bw. Naibu Spika. Maybe my Kiswahili is broken, forgive me because I am trying very hard to speak proper Kiswahili.									(Laughter)Although, I do not know Kiswhali well, I withdraw that word and beg to continue.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda ilisemekana kwamba wakatai "Kalenjin Warriors", walishambulia watu tena, askari polisi walipiga mtu mmoja risasi ambaye walifikiria kuwa Bw. Atiedo. Wakati polisi walipiga mtu huyo risasi wale watu walikuira wametoroka na huyu mtu alikuwa ndani ya hiyo nyumba. Tarehe 30, Mwenye Kiti wa Kanu tawi la Nandi, Bw. Kosgey alinipigia simu nikiwa hospitalini na nikapewa ruhusa hospitalini na nikaenda katika shamba Nilikuwa ninafikiria kwamba watu wa sehemu yangu walikuwa wamevamiwa. Wakati matipota wa gazeti la Daily Nation walikwenda huko waliniambia kwamba mtu mmoja na mama mmoja walikuwa wamepelekwa hospitalini na wanaweza kutoa ushahidi huo. Mtu aliyepigwa risasi hakuhusikana na matata hayo. Alikuwa dereva wa matatu ambayo alikuwa akitoka huko Songhor akienda kuwapasha watu wake habari ya hivi vita. Wakati alikuwa akikimbia polisi walimpiga risasi na akafa. Kwa nini Mwenye Kiti wa hii Kamiti anasema kwamba alipata repoti kutoka Provnicial Police Officer Nataka kusema kwamba hiyo habari alipewa si ukweli. Mwenye Kiti wa Kanu, tawi la Nandi, Bw. Kosgey alidanganywa na polisi ambao walimuambia kwamba hawakumua yule mtu. Walisema kwamba walimpiga risasi mguu. Jamii ya mtu huyo ilikwenda mpaka huko hospitalini Kapsabet wakitaka kumuona. Walipofika kule, dakitari aliwaambia kwamba huyo mtu aliletwa akiwa maiti na yuko katika chumba cha kuhifadhia maiti. Walipopashwa habari hiyo matata yalianza katika shamba la Owiro. Katika Repoti ya Mwenye Kiti wa Kamati hii anasema kwamba matata ya "warriors" ndio yalienea mpaka shamba la Owiro. Wakati wale watu walitoka hospitalini walikuwa na hasira kwa sababu waliambia kwamba mtu aliyompiga huyu ndugu yao risasi alikuwa askari polisi ambaye anaishi katika shamba la Owiro. Siku hiyo nilimpigia Mkuu wa Police wa Mkoa wa Rift Valley simu nikamuambia aje na maofisa wake kwa sababu viongozi wote wa sehemu yetu walikuwa wamekata kauli kufanya mkutano katika shamba la Meteitei.Wakati wale watu walitoka hospitali, sisi tulikuwa tukingojea mkutano uanze. Lalcini hatukujua kwamba numba katika shamba la Owiro zililikuwa zikichomwa. DC, Msaidizi wa Mkuu wa Police na watu wengine walikuwako wakati nyumba katika shamba zilikuwa zikichomeka. Katika hii Repoti imechapishwa kwainba matata yalianza usiku. Nataka kusma kwamba haya matata yalianza mchana wakati tulikuwa tukingojea viongozi wengine waje kwa mkutano, lakini tulishangaakwa sababu hawakukuja wakati ule tulikuwa tunataka mkutano uanze. Tulipokwenda huko tulikuta nyumba katika shamba la Owiro zimechomeka. Mhe. Cheruiyot alikuwa kwa njia akija kuhudhuria mkutano mkutano huo pia. Tuliliingilia jambo hili sana, tukakuta watu wakichoma nyumba mchana, na tukawauliza ni kwa nini walikuwa wakifanya hivyo. Tuliwashika watu wengine na kuwaweka korokoroni. Polisi walifanya kazi yao. Kwa bahati nzuri, hapana ye yote aliyeuawa katika shamba hilo, ball watu walichoma nyumba tu, huku wakisema, "Mtu wetu ameuawa."Matata yaliendelea mpaka Wajaluo wengi wakaja mpaka kule Daraja Mbili na kujenga kizuizi barabarani. Mwenyekiti alipoulizwa jambo hili, alisema, "It was just like that." Alitwambia ukweli wa jambo hili? Kama singekuwa kule mimi mwenyewe, ningefikiri kwamba maneno anayosema hapa ni ya kweli. Ilikuwa mtu akionekana kutoka Nandi au Kericho anapigwa, na matata yakaehea. Si eti kwamba matata yalitokea mahali pameja peke yake. Wakati matata yalipotokea, Wajaluo waliweka kizuizi barabarani kule Muhoroni na matatu zikija kutoka Kisumu, watu hawa walikuwa wakiwatoa nje abiria wake na kuangalia lcama kulikuwa na Walcalenjin. Ikiwa kulikuwa na Mkalenjin, alikuwa akipigwa na motakaa hiyo inachomwa. Watu waliokuwa wakitoka Koru na Kericho walikwenda zao na kusema, "Watu wetu wamepigwa bure." Matata yalieneza mpaka kule Londiani, nasi tukafanya kazi pamoja na polisi wa Nandi bila kulala usiku wala mchana, huku tukijaribu kuyasimamisha matata hayo. Badala ya kutupa pongezi, Kamati hii inasema kwamba Barngetuny alitoa magari yatumiwe katika kueneza vita. Mwenyekiti huyu na Kamati yake wakisoma akili yangu, kweli wataona kwamba ninaweza kutoa magari yangu saa sits mchana ili kueneza mapigano? Nimekwishafanya kazi na watu wa makabila yote, na nina marafiki katika makabila yote na hata katika waheshimiwa Wabunge. Kamati hii ikifikiri vizuri, itaona kwamba umri wangu hauwezi kuniruhusu kuchochea vita.Nimekwishahudhuria mchango wa Harambee kule kwa Mwenyekiti, na akaona kwamba kweli mimi ni Mkristu kwa sababu nilikwenda kuyasaidia mawakilisho yake. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kiliku: Hiyo ni sawa, na ninakubali hivyo. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Barngetuny: Ninawezaje kushika Biblia mkononi. huu, huku nikishika mshale mkononi mwingine, nivigoganishe vitu hivi na kumwaga damu ya watu? Hata ukiambiwa na mtu kwamba mtu fulani analala na bibi yako, huwezi kwenda kwake na kumpiga rungu. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kiliku: Is that parliamentary language? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Barngetuny: Mwenyekiti anasema tu kwamba alikutana na watu na akakutana tena na watu wengine. Hata ingawa yeye ni Mbunge aliyechaguliwa na tulimteua hapa awe Mwenyekiti wa Kamati hii, ninafikiri hajawahi kuwa mwenyekiti siku nyingine. Mimi nimekwishakuwa mwenyekiti mara nne. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kiliku: Mwenyekiti wa nini? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Barngetuny: Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, nimewahi kuwa Mwenyekiti wa Chama cha Wafanyakazi wa Serikali za Wilaya, Mwenyekiti wa Konseli ya Sio, mwenyekiti wa Kanu kwa miaka 15, rnkurugenzi wa Coffee Board of Kenya kwa miaka zaidi ya 10 na Welfare Officer wa Kenya Breweries kwa miaka sita. Nimefanya kazi na watu wa makabila yote, na ninajua kwamba huwezi kuchukua kijuujuu kila kitu unachoambiwa na watu bila kuchunguza kama mtu huyo anasema kweli, uwongo au anaongea kwa hasira. Pia, huwezi kuandika kila kitu unachoambiwa. Nilishangaa kujua kwamba kulikuwa na mwanasheria katika Kamati hii.Wakati wa wito wa kubadilisha Katiba, mhe. Mahihu alikuwa Mkuu wa Mkoa wa Pwani. Tulikwenda kwake siku moja tukiwa na hasira, naye alikuwa na silaha na uwezo wa kuzituniia. Lakini alitukaribisha na kutuuliza, "Mnataka mkutano wa aina gani?" Kamati hii yetu ingekuwa na moyo kama huo. Mhe. Kiliku ameyatoa maneno yake hapa kuhusu vile Odinga alivyosema kule Machakos. Alimtaja Njenga Mungai.Tuliwatuma Wanakamati hawa kule kuleta amani na, ingawa wakati Mwenyekiti alipozungumza hapa alisema kwamba Ripoti hii ni sawa sawa na ild ya mhe. Saitoti na ile ya mhe. Mwangale, tulipoisoma tulikuta kwamba Ripoti hii ni ya kuchochea. Isitoshe, ilisemekana kwamba magari ya Barngetuny yaliyotumiwa vitani ni namba hizi na hizi. Lakini Lori moja langu, namba KPT 048, ambalo limetajwa hapa lilikuwa limepeleka maziwa kule Chemelil na wakati huo lilikuwa limeharibika na kuwekwa katika garage ya Omondi kwa muds wa miezi minane. Lori unglue halikuwa langu. Tulikuwa na Mwenyekiti huyu hapa, na hata angeniuliza habari hii yeye mwenyewe au Ratibu wa Bunge akaenda kule Nyayo House na kuchunguza kama Lori hilo lilikuwa la Bamgetuny kweli. Badala yake, Ripoti iliandikwa to kwamba lori hilo lilikuwa la Barngetuny Transporters, na kwamba Barngetuny alikuwa akiwanunulia "warriors" kurunzi zenye nguvu. Kurunzi hizi zilikuwa na nguvu aina gani kiasi kwamba zilikuwa na akili ya kuzitambua nyumba za"Walcalenjin ndipo zichomwe? Kurunzi zina akili kweli?Ripoti hii inasema kwamba mimi na mhe. Biwott tulikuwa tukitoa pesa za kuwalipa wale "warriors" Sh.1,000/= kwa kila mtu aliyeuawa. Ningejuaji mtu ambaye ameuawa ndipo nilipe pesa? Walikuwa wakinilitea mkono au mguu wa mtu halafu ninawalipa? Nilikuwa katika jeshi na najua tulipowaua maadui zetu tulikata mikono ya kushoto na kumtumia kamanda wa adui zetu ill ajue watu wake walikuwa wamekufa. Miminilimuuliza DC na alcaniambia watu 11 walikuwa wamekufa katika Wilaya ya Nandi lakini Kamati hii inasema watu 25 walikufa katika Nandi? Hii nikusema nililipa pesa kwa vifo vya watu hawa 25? Magazeti ya Daily Nation na The Standard yalipoandika juu ya vita hivi tulisema yalikuwa yametunga visa vyake. Ikiwa Kamati ya Bunge hill, ambayo tuliichagua tukiamini itasema ukweli, imetoa Ripoti kunilaumu mimi na Bw. Biwott wananchi watakubaliana nayo? Hata Kamati ya Saitoti iliambiwa mambo mengi lakini mengine haikuyakubali.Ninayasema mambo ninayoyajua kuhusu watu wa Miteitei na watu wa Muhoroni. Nyumba zilipochomwa huko Nyando Wakalenjin watatu walienda kuiba ng'ombe 35 za Wajaluo. Wajaluo wenye kuibiwa ng'ombe waliwaambia askari tawala, ambao waliwafuata na kuwarudisha wale ng'ombe. Baada ya ng'ombe hao kurudishwa Wajaluo walisema ni lazima wawafundishe Wakalenjin jinsi ya kuiba ng'ombe. Walienda na kuiba ng'ombe 82 za Wakalenjin na kwa sababu hii Wajaluo wawili walipigwa mishale na kuuawa. Wakalenjin walienda polisi na kupiga ripoti kuhusu kuibiwa kwa ng'ombe wao. Ninawashukuru maofisa wa Serikali kwa sababu walichukua hatua. Baadaye Wanandi waliokuwa wameibiwa ng'ombe walipiga nduru na watu karibu 5,000 wakakusanyika na kusema wangeenda hadi kwa Wajaluo iii kurudisha ng'ombe wo. Polisi wa Kisumu na Kisii waliyazima matata hayo. Lakini mhe Midika alisema kwa sababu kuna ng'ombe 500 wao ambao walikuwa wameibiwa zamani na Wakalenjin wangepigana ill kuwapata. Mimi na mhe Cheruiyot tulifanya kazi mpaka tukayazuia matata yote.Sasa, Kamati hii inaongea kuhusu "warriors" na inaonekana kama Kamati hii ilienda kuwawekelea Wakalenjin makosa bila ya kujali ukweli ulikuwa wapi. Hawa Kalenjin "warriors" walikuwa wakipigana na nani? Mbona hawakusema walikuwa wakipigana na nani? Badala ya kuandika maneno mengi afadhali kama Kamati hii ingesema mimi na Biwott tutafutwe na kuuawa. Kwa nini ilinilaumu mimi na Bw. Biwott au ni kwa sababu Biwott ni rafiki yangu?Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, Kamati hii ilikuwa ikiwaapisha mashahidi waliofika mbele yake na baada ya kupokea ushahidi wao ilikuwa ikiwaambia mashahidi hao wasiuseme ushahidi wao mahali pengine. Kama hii ni kamati nzuri, kwa nini hakuuliza chanzo hasa cha matata katika shamba la Miteitei? Kwa nini haikutafuta ukweli kuhusu shamba hilo kutoka kwa maofisa wa polisi? Mashahidi wengine waliiambia Kamati hii maofisa wa utawala walikuwa wamewazuia maofisa wa usorovea kuligawanya shamba la Miteitei iii makundi yake mawili yapate taabu. Kwa hivyo, inaonekana kwamba hii ICamati ya Kiliku haikufanya kazi yake vizuri kwa sababu walikuwa wakiongozwa na uvumi. Ripoti hii inasema kwamba Bamgetuny alikuwa akisimamia warriors huko Maasai Mara. Ningependa kusema kwamba hii miguu yangu bado haijakanyaga Maasai Mara na sijui vile sehemu hiyo inaonekana. Mimi si mtalil anayekwenda Maasai Mara kumwona simba na wanyama wengine. Nilikwenda huko tarehe gani? Mimi nilikuwa katika kikosi cha army lakini nilistaafu. Nilikuwa na watu kama Mulinge ambaye amestaafu na Mohamed ambaye alikuwa bado kijana lakini naye . pia atastaafu hivi karibuni. Sasa inawezekanaje kwamba baada ya kustaafu ninakwenda kujiunga na private army huko Maasai Mara na Olenguruone badala ya kwenda kupumzika? Je, huyu Mwenyekiti na Kamati yake wana akili ya kutosha kwa kusema kwamba nilikuwa nikakaa nje na kusimamia private army? Mtu anayesimamia private army ni wa cheo cha colonel. Mimi sikufikia cheo cha colonel au general. Nilistaafu nikiwa katika cheo cha second lieutenant. Sijui hii ni private army ya aina gani. Miaka yangu haiwezi kuniruhusu kukaa nje mpaka asubuhi nikiliwa na mbu. Hata nikiwa nimelala kitandani mwangu na nikifilciria kwamba nitaamka saa 12 kwenda kazi pahali fulani, ninaona uchungu sana kuondoa blanketi kutoka mwili wangu. Je, nawezaje kulala nje </Newspeech><Newspeech>Hon. Members: Una,miaka mingapi sasa? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Barngetuny: Umri wangu sasa ni miaka 67. Nina watoto wakubwa na ninamshukuru Mungu kwa kunipa uhai kwa miaka hii yote na kwa kuniwezesha kuwaona wajukuu na vijukuu. Watoto wangu wanafanya kazi huko Mombasa, Thika na Nairobi. Kulingana na mila za Wakalenjin, kama mtu amepita umri wa miaka 50, hauruhusiwi kutembea na mkuki au kumuua mtu hata akiwa adui. Kazi yako ni kumsaidia mtu kama huyu. Inawezekanaje eti mimi naweza kuchukuwa silaha na kuwaua watu na hall nimepita umri wa miaka 50? Nilishangaa niliposikia bishop mmoja akisema kwamba Ripoti ya Kiliku ilikuwa na maongozi ya Mungu. Je, walionyeshwa uwongo na Mungu? </Newspeech><Newspeech>An Hon. Member: Bishop gani huyo? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Barngetuny: Huyu alikuwa Bishop kutoka dhehebu la Anglican. Alikuwa akiongea juu ya Timotheo II, Mango wa Tatu, kwanzia kifungu cha kwanza hadi cha 18. Kitabu hid kinasema kwamba huu ni wakati ambapo watu wameacha kusema ukweli na kusema uwongo. Aliendelea kusema kwamba huu ndio wakati ambapo watu wanapenda pesa kuliko ukweli. Nawaomba waheshimiwa Wabunge waende wasome kitabu hicho wenyewe. Inafaa huyu Bishop afikirie tens juu ya mambo haya. Kama mtu ataniva aldfikiria kwamba nimewaua watu, na hall sijafanya hivyo, damu yangu na mafupa yangu "itakula" yeye. Hii ni kwa sababu sijafanya kitendo chochote kibaya. Hata nikimwona. mbwa ameuawa na gari, ninaona uchungu sana. Nikipata watuwameumia barabarani, ninaona uchungu sana na hali watu wengine wanasema kwamba ninafurahi nikiona watu wakivawa.Gazeti la Kenya Times lilichapisha habari kwamba kuna watu ambao walikuwa wanataka kumuua Mtukufu Rais. Tuliposoma hivyo, tulisema kwamba hata Mungu atawalaani watu hawa maishani mwao. Ni lazima tuwe viongozi wa kusema mambo ya ukweli. Sitaki kuzungumza mambo ya Eldoret, Moto na kwingineko kwa sababu sijui kite kilichofanyika huko. Ninaweza kuzungumza juu ya Meteitei kwa sababu huko ndiko ninakotoka. Ningependa kusema kwamba Ripoti hii imesema uwongo kuhusu vile mambo yalivyokuwa huko Meteitei. Tangu zamani tulikuwa tukipigana na Wajaluo na kulikuwa pia wizi wa ng'ombe baina yetu na wazee walikuwa wakiamua mambo. Wazee walikuwa wanakwenda kurudisha wale wang'ombe ambao walikuwa wameibwa kutoka pande zote mbili. Vita hivi vilikuwa baina ya vijana na si wazee kama mimi. Je, Bw. Omino, ninasema uwongo au ukweli? Hata Bw. Omino alikuwa akifanya mchezo hapa eti Barngetuny ana mshale hapa na anataka kumpiga nao. Ninajua kwamba huu ulikuwa mchezo tu kwa sababu anajua wajee hawabebi silihaha na kuzitumia kwa kuwaua wazee wengine au mtoto.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda uchomaji wa nyumba kati ya Wakalenjin na Waluhya haukuanza juzi. Mambo ya Waluhya ni kama yale ya bibi na bwana; usiingilie sana kwa sababu wanaweza kugombana leo na halafu kesho wapatane. Utaona kwamba badala ya kuamua mambo haya Kamati iliongeza chumvi, moto na- lcadhalika. Baada ya kupokea ushahidi kutoka kwa mashaltdi waliojitokeza mbele ya Kamati, Kamati ingewaalika wazee wa sehemu zilizohusika ili kuwapata ushauri zaidi kutoka kwao. Mwenyekiti angeshauriana na wazee katika sehemu hizo kabla ya yeye kuketi chini na kuitayarisha Ripoti yake. Katika Ripoti yake, Kamati imesema kwamba mimi nilikuwa nikiwasaidia wapiganaji wa Kikalenjin. Hate wamesema kwamba kuna "Orrior" mmoja ambaye alikamatwa, akapigwa na kupelekwa hospitali kule Kakamega. </Newspeech><Newspeech>An Hon. Member: Si "Orrior". Ni Warrior! </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Barngetuny: Ni kwa nini Kamati haikujisumbua kutafuta jina la huyo warrior na nambari ya kitanda alichalazwa pale hospitalini? Je, mtu huyu alitoroka kwa njia gani kutoka hospitalini? Je, mtu huyo alikuwa amepata majeraha ya aina gani? Alikuwa amevunjwa mguu au alikuwa na majeraha kichwani? Mbona hatuambiwi ldlote kuhusu mtu huyo? Nafikiri Kamati ilikuwa ikitataka kuongea juu ya "Kalenjin Warriors" tu. Hata hivyo ningependa kusema kwamba jina "Kalenjin Warriors" lilibuniwa na Wazungu walcati tulikuwa tunapigana na wao. Wakati huo tulikuwa tukipigana iii kujilinda na Wazungu walianza kutuita "Kalenjin Warriors." Mambo hayo yalitokea mnamo mwaka wa 1900; wakati tulikuwa tunapigana na wakoloni. Wakati huo wale "Kalenjin Warriors" walikuwa wakiwaua Wazungu. Wazungu walirudi kwao baadaye na sasa hatuna haja ya kuwa na "Kalenjin Warriors."Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda kuna watu fulani ambao wakati uliopita waliwapa Wakalenjin wanaoishi hapa Nairobi ilani ya kuondoka na kurudi kwa nyumbani. Sijui kama watu hao walikuwa wamesahau kwamba kuna Wakikuyu wenzao wanaofanya biashara kule Eldoret, Kapsabet na kadhali au vipi. Wakati wa ghasia za kikabila watu hao hawakusumbuliwa na mtu ye yote. Je, wakati Wakikuyu walikuwa wakiwatoa watu ndani ya magari barabarani na kuwapiga na kuwaua walikuwa wakijua kwamba ndugu zao wanaishi katika sehemu nyingine za nchi hii? Je, walifikiri kwamba sisi ni waoga? Je, hawakujua kwamba hata sisi tungewaamuru Wakikuyu wanaoishi kule kwetu warudi hapa kwao ili tukutane nawo pale Naivasha; wao wakija na sisi tukirudi kwetu? Je, huo ndio ungozi ambao wao wanataka? Je, kama Wakalenjin wangeamka siku moja wasikie kwamba mhe. Barngetuny ameuawa unafikiri ni mambo gani ambayo yangefanyika? Je, kama wangeamka na kusikia kwamba Rais Moi ameuawa unafikiri ni mambo gani ambayo yangetokea siku hiyo? Je, watu hawa hawezi kuwaza juu ya mambo haya? Je, kungetokea hasara ya aina gani siku hiyo? Hasara ambayo ingetokea ingekuwa kubwa sana na sisi Wakenya tungeudhihirishia ulimwengu mzima kwamba sisi bado hatujakomaa kisiasa. Ni lazima tuthibitishe kwamba tumekomaa kisiasa kama taifa. Sisi si wachochezi kwa sababu tunajua uchochezi unaweza kuleta mateso mengi.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, hata watu wengine walidai kwamba mimi, mhe. Barngetuny, niko na kiwanda cha kutengeneza mishale na kwamba mishale hiyo ilikuwa na maandishi "E.B." yakimaanisha Ezekiel Bamgetuny! Huo ulikuwa uchochezi mtupu! Ninawezaje kuwa na kiwanda cha kutengeneza mishale? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kiliku: Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda. Mambo yanayotajwa na Mzee Barngetuny hayako katika Ripoti yetu. Nafikiri mambo hayo yametoka mahali pengine; hayamo ndani ya Ripoti ya Kamati Teule .yetu. Nafikiri anatupatia habari zaidi. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Barngetuny: Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ukisoma Ripoti ya Kiliku na uilinganishe na mambo ambayo yamechapishwa kwenye jarida la Finance na vile vile yale yaliyomo ndani ya ile ripoti ya NCCK, utaona kwamba hakuna tofauti yo yote. Kamati ya Kiliku haikuwa na haja ya kuzuru sehemu ambako ghasia zilitokea; badala yake wangeingia katika maktaba na kutoa ripoti kwenye magazeti na majarida mbali mbali. Hata watu wa NCCK walidai kwamba Mungu alimfunulia mhe. Kiliku mambo haya yote. Wao walisema kwamba Ripoti ya mhe. Kiliku inalingana vyema na ile yao walikuwa wametoa. Nakala za majarida ya Finance, Society na ambayo yamejaa matusi ya kila aina na habari za uwongo kuhusu "Kalenjin Warriors" zinaweza kupatikana katika maktaba. </Newspeech><Newspeech>An Hon. Member: Saa mbaya! </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Barngetuny: Ripoti ya Kiliku imeongea juu ya "Kalenjin Warriors" lakini nafikiri hayo ni maneno ya Njenga Mungai ambaye alikuwa kichochea mapigano. Kwa hivyo mhe. Kiliku alikuwa ana habari na-</Newspeech>-<Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi): Order! Utaendelea wiki ijayo, mhe. Bamgetuny. </Newspeech><Header>ADJOURNMENT</Header><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi): Hon.
