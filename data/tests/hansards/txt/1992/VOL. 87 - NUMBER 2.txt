We will leave his Question until the end. </Newspeech><i>Question No. 233</i><HEADER>KILLING OF MR. MOHAMMUD ABDI SHAKUL</HEADER>Mr. Nuno asked the Minister of State, Office of the President:-(a)	whether he is aware that a Mr. Mohammud Abdi Shakul was shot dead on 2nd April, 1992 at 1.30 a.m. in Garissa Town and that the matter was reported to Garissa Police Station; and(b)	if the answer to the above question is in the affirmative, what steps he has taken to ensure that the culprits are apprehended.<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, Office of the President(Mr. Kikwai): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a)	Yes, I am aware of the incident(b)	An inquest file, No. 1/92, was opened and submitted to the Director of the Criminal Investigation Department for advice on the course of action to be taken on the matter in question. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Nuno: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the incident which I have reported here occurred in Garissa Town, 50 metres away from Garissa Police Station. The killers of this man were policemen in uniform. Could the Assistant Minister tell us why the culprits have not been apprehended up to this day? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kikwai: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the late Abdi Shakul was shot dead on 2nd April, 1992 in Garissa Town at 1.30 p.m. He had been arrested earlier by the Manager of Locust Night Club, in Garissa Town, after stealing Sh.200/= and three bottles of Tusker. The Manager called the police. The police went there and arrested the culprit. While he was being taken to the police station, Mr. Shakul jumped from a moving vehicle as a result of which he was shot. He was taken to hospital while still alive. A police constable, Stanley Salama, No. 6142 (?), was pursuing the offender, but the latter did not stop and that is why he was shot.The deceased was taken to Garissa Hospital, where he died while undergoing treatment.An inquiry file, No. 1/92, was immediately opened and the police constable concerned placed undo interdiction to await the outcome of the inquiry. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Arte: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell the House how many officers were in the vehicle carrying the late Mr. Abdi Shakul? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kikwai: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would not know how many police officers were in that vehicle, but we can find this out. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Arte: On a point of 6rder, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. It is very important to get this information because the late Abdi Shakul was carried from a bar to a police station and killed SO metres from the police station. The Assistant Minister is telling us that he does not know how many people were in the vehicle transporting Mr. Shakul to the police station, but it was full of policemen. Even if this gentleman tried to run away, these policemen were able to ran after him and re-arrest him. The Assistant Minister also says that he has opened an inquest whereas he knows the person who killed Mr. Shakul. Why does he not arrest that person? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: That is a supplementary question, Mr. Arte. What is your point of order? Mr. Arte: My point of order, Mr. Deputy [Mr. Arte] Speaker, Sir, is that it is important for the Assistant Minister to tell us how many people were in the vehicle transporting Mr. Shakul to the police station. These policemen were able to re-arrest Mr. Shakul rather than to shoot him. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kikwai: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have said that this person jumped out of a moving vehicle and that Constable Salama, No. 61502, has been interdicted pending the outcome of the inquiry which will be carried out in court. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Falana: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, here is a suspect who was arrested, placed under police custody and jumped out of a moving vehicle. One would imagine that if you jump out of a moving vehicle, you will certainly hurt yourself, in which case, there will be time for the policemen with you to stop their vehicle, get to you and arrest you. In this case, why did the policemen accompanying Mr. Shakul not jump out of the vehicle and run after Mr. Shakul? Why was it easier to shoot him rather than to stop their vehicle and re-arrest Mr. Shakul? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kikwai: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I quite accept that it is not proper for & policeman to shoot somebody on sight unless it is absolutely necessary to do so. If it is found during the inquest I mentioned that there was negligence in this case, stiff measures will be taken against the constable concerned. </Newspeech><I>Question No. 116 </I><HEADER>JUTE GROWING IN YALA DELTA</HEADER>Mr. Okondo asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he could tell the House the date when the pilot project to grow the jute plant in Bulwani and Osieko areas of the Yala Delta will begin.<Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Is no one here from the Ministry of Agriculture? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. We are not being told why this Question is not being answered. Could we know why the Question is not being answered? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: It is because the relevant Minister does not seem to be in the Chamber nor does he seem to have given instructions to any other Minister to answer it on his behalf. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Answers to such Questions as this one are sometimes supposed to come in writing, but I have so far not received any written answer to my Question, and the Minister concerned is even not here. This is irregular. What do you suggest we do? Do we wait until this Question comes back since I cannot afford to have lost just like that?<Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: How did it find its way to the Order Paper? </Newspeech>(Laughter)<Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it was just put on the Order Paper. Could I have it back  on the Order Paper? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Let us see what happens in the next few minutes. </Newspeech>(Question deferred)<i>Question No.187 <i><HEADER>TELEPHONE FOR HULUGHO AND BURA</HEADER>Mr. Arte, on behalf of Mr. Salat, asked the Minister for Transport and Communications when telephone services will be provided at Hulugho and Bura divisional headquarters.<Newspeech> Mr. Deputy Speaker: Anybody here from the Ministry of Transport and Communications? Dr. Misoi's Question. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Arte: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I have a written answer here but I cannot see the Minister and his Assistant Ministers. Who has brought this answer? If they have brought this written answer why are they not here? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Very well Dr. Misoi's Question. </Newspeech><i>Question No.163</i> <HEADER>ISSUANCE OF GAZETTE NOTICE NO.864</HEADER>Dr. Misoi asked the Minister for Labour:-(a)	why he issued Gazette Notice No.864 dated 6th March, 1992, contrary to the Tailors and Textiles Workers Union's constitution rule No.8 (a),(d) and (e) effecting trade union levy of upto 100 per cent; and(b)	what is the Ministry's position on the resolutions Nos. 2,4,6 and 11 of the meeting of Tailors and Textiles Workers Union dated 23rd March, 1992:<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Labour (Mr. Maina): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Rule No.8 (a), (d) and (e) is concerned with the holding union conference, the appointment and attendance by the delegates to the conference and the conduct of the business by the said conference including the election of national officers respectively. This rule has nothing to do with trade union levy.attendance by the delegates to the conference and the conduct of the business by the said conference including the election of national officers respectively. This rule has nothing to do with trade union levy. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am wondering whether I followed the answer by the Assistant Minister. I do not think he has answered part (b) of my Question. I am not sure I followed him. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Do you have a copy of the written reply to this Question, Dr. Misoi? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have no written reply. In fact I am at a loss to understand what the Assistant Minister is saying. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Maina: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was answering part (a) of the Question. To answer part (b) of the Question, I would like to say that the Minister for Labour is not aware of the meeting supposedly held on 23rd March, 1992, by the Union. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I should have been provided with a written reply. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Maina: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have only one copy of the written reply. Maybe we can adjourn so that I can go and get a copy of the reply for the hon. Questioner. This is because I have only one copy of the written reply. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Wait a minute, Mr. Maina! Are you suggesting adjournment of the House? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Maina: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think we should defer this Question so as to enable me to get a copy of the written reply for the hon. Questioner. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have heard the Assistant Minister's reply to part (b) of this Question. Does it mean that the Ministry has never received any information relating to the Union's meeting held on 23rd March, 1992? Is the Ministry dormant? Are they really working? Why are they not aware of this meeting? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Maina: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the meeting was not informed about this meeting. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, sometime in March this year the Tailors and Textiles Workers Union in Eldoret, comprising all the workers. The workers almost went on strike because the Minister for Labour approved the raising of the union levy by such a margin. The workers were disappointed. They have written to the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry telling him that that was not in order. It was not proper to raise this levy by that margin. The workers have raised an objection which the Ministry has failed to respond to. This is why this Question is in this House and it has not been answered.Mr. Deputy Speaker: What is your supplementary question? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: Is the Assistant Minister in order not to answer this Question properly? Is he in order to mislead the House by saying that they have no information on this matter? What are they doing? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Maina: As I have stated, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the rule the hon. Member has referred to deals with conferences. The meeting that was supposed to be held on 23rd March, 1992 If any meeting took place on that day then it must been convened and attended by unauthorised persons, purporting to be acting on behalf of the Union. If such a meeting was held then it was unconstitutional and therefore it had no official effect. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister implying that the meeting was unauthorised and illegal and unconstitutional? Could he substantiate that claim? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Maina: I am quite in order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. This is because the Ministry was not aware that there was a meeting to be held on 23rd March. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister has said openly here that a meeting was held but it was attended by unauthorised persons. Could he tell us the names of those unauthorised persons? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Maina: What I am saying, Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir, is that if the meeting was held maybe it was attended by unauthorised persons because the Ministry is noj aware of that meeting. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister tells us that if the meeting was held it was attended by unauthorised persons but that is not a reply to this Question. Is that in order? Does he know what he is telling the House? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Maina: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I know what I am telling the House because the meeting was not there. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we ask Questions here so that we can get information. The Assistant Minister has not replied to this Question. He has not given any reply. Would I be in order to request the Chair to ask the Assistant Minister to go back and come up with a proper reply? It appears that he did not take any trouble to get further information from the ground. Could the Chair direct the Assistant Minister to go back and bring us proper information? We ask Questions here for die benefit of our people. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Dr. Misoi, can' you provide better particulars about this meeting? Where was it convened and when? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I can provide all the information and equally the Assistant Minister should do his part to search for the right answer. This is because when we ask Questions here the Ministers are supposed to get the necessary information from those concerned. What is the problem? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Dr. Misoi, the Assistant Minister has flatly denied that the meeting which came up with these resolutions ever took place. So, it would appear that the onus of proof is back to you, Dr. Misoi; to be able to establish that indeed a meeting took place. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: The meeting took place and I have evidence to that effect The Assistant Minister must accept that he has misled the House by saying that no meeting took place. He has to produce evidence that there was no meeting. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. We have complained that we have not been given a proper reply.I do not know whether the Chair agrees with us that the Assistant Minister should go back and bring a correct reply. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: The Chair made a ruling; that the Member for Eldoret South provides details for further and better particulars about that meeting so that based on that the Assistant Minister comes back to the House and gives his reply. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Aden: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for my colleague hon. Katurkana to be on his feet when you are on your feet? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: He has instead chosen to wear a big smile. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Whereas I have concurred with your ruling, it appears as if the Assistant Minister has been left to go scot free after doing something which is out of order. He should be able to do his homework which, in this case, he has not done.He has no evidence to show that he communicated with the people down there or eyen the labour office. He has not done any investigations to that effect but has just brought a written reply to the House. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Dr. Misoi, it would have been very easy if you were armed with the facts and figures and at this time say: "At such and such a place the meeting took place on such and such a date". The Assistant Minister would now be on his feet to answer. Dr. Misoi,  I find it a little interesting that you do not know when this meeting took place.For you to be effective with your supplementary questions you should have straightaway put it to the Assistant Minister that the meeting indeed took place.It appears, therefore, that you have found a little knowledge on the facts as they relate to the meeting that you refer to because the Assistant Minister has categorically denied that there was such a meeting. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would not have quoted the date of the meeting as 23rd of March, 1992 if I was not sure. However, when I came to the. House I found out that the Question had already been put  on the Order Paper. So, I have the facts and I will bring them to the House, but the Ministry should not </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: I beg your pardon, Dr. Misoi. I notice that you have said that the date of the meeting was on the 23rd of March, 1992. Where exactly was this meeting held because it appears as if everything is centred on that meeting? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I have already promised to bring the papers here, my argument is that the Assistant Minister seems to have been left to go scot-free not to carry out any investigations which is not really satisfactory. He has not done anything. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Mr. Onyancha): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for the hon. Member to continue insisting on details when he himself is totally unsure and is continuing to show ignorance of the facts of the meeting? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kiilu: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Would it be possible for the Assistant Minister to go back and get the better information from his officers while the hon. Questioner brings the relevant documents to this House because it looks as if he has not done any homework? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Very well, I think matters have unfortunately been proved that the law lies where it is. It does appear that the Chair's hands are unfortunately tied because the Assistant Minister said if and when the meeting took place because it was not authorized.So, since he insists in that denial the position of the Chair would have been different if, indeed, you are able to supply as I said further and better particulars about the meeting that you allege took place.Until that happens, it would be a little difficult to insist on asking the Assistant Minister to do a better job. </Newspeech><I>Question No. 137</I><HEADER>BUMPS FOR KAPSOIT/AINAPKOI ROAD</HEADER><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Mr. Chepkwony not here? We will leave his Question until the end then. Next Question. </Newspeech><i>Question No. 227 </i><HEADER>GRAVELLING OF KEMERA/KIENDEGE ROAD</HEADER>Mr. A.O.H. Momanyi asked the Minister for Public Works when the rural access road from Kemera- Enamba to Kiendege will be gravelled.<Newspeech>The Minister for Public Works (Mr. Mibei): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Ministry will murrain 5.6 kilometers being the section of Kemera- Enamba to Kiendege minor road E 1142 under the minor roads programme in the 1992/93 Financial Year. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. A.H.O. Momanyi: Mr., Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is very unusual because this road was completed in 1988 and up to now it has not be murramed. Since this is a tea growing area, when it rains the road becomes impassable for tractors and fanners experience difficulties in transporting their tea to the buying centres. Will the Minister assure this House whether the gravelling of this road is included in this year’s budget? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mibei: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the road in question is 16 kilometres long of which 10.4 kilometres is an all weather murrain road. So, it is the remaining 5.6 kilometres which is an earth road and we have planned to murram it this coming financial year and we expect to use about Ksh.700,000/=</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Let us go back to Mr. Ndirangu's Question. </Newspeech><I>Question No. 201</I><HEADER>MEMBERS OF NYERI DISTRICT TENDER BOARD</HEADER><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Mr. Ndirangu is still not here? </Newspeech>(Question dropped)<Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Let us go back to Mr. Jaldessa's Question. </Newspeech><I>Question No. 232</I><HEADER>DISTRIBUTION OF RURAL ENTERPRISE FUND<HEADER><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Mr. Jaldessa is still nothere? </Newspeech>(Question dropped)<Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Let us go back to Mr. Okondo's Question. </Newspeech><I>Question No. 116</I><HEADER>JUTE GROWING IN YALA DELTA</HEADER><Newspeech>Mr. Okondo asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he could tell the House the date when the pilot project to grow the Jute Plant  in Bulwani and Osieko areas of Yala Delta will begin. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Agriculture(Mr. Kones): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I apologize for coming late-</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Just before you give a reply to that, Mr. Kones, I would like to draw the attention of the Chair to hon. Members of the Front- bench in particular to the provisions of Standing Order No. 36 (6) which reads as follows:"Upon receiving a Question for oral reply, the Minister shall within the period specified in paragraph (S) submit to the Clerk fifteen copies of the reply".The Chair did notice this morning that this has not been complied with. Indeed, this is a mandatory requirement on the part of all the Ministries because the clerks can only supply answers which they receive from the Ministries. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. When I came in here this morning I found that my Question was included in the Order Paper and I have already promised that I will bring the relevant documents concerning Question No. 163. I have just rushed out and collected the evidence required and I have it here with me. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Very well. Please give us a few more moments and we will be coming over to that</Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Kones): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I was saying, I apologize for coming late. However, I beg to reply.I am not able to state in this House when the pilot project to grow the jute plant in Bulwani and Osieko areas of the Yala Delta will begin since trials carried out in the plant were found to be unsuccessful. KARI, however, is carrying out the research on an alternative plant "Kenneth"(?) whose results so far are encouraging. Once these trials are completed it will then be possible to know when the pilot project can commence. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I note the Assistant Minister's reply, but his Ministry did confirm that the plant which is growing wild in Bulwani is indeed jute. What has happened? Has this plant changed its genes and become a different plant because it is growing wild there and indeed it is jute? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kones: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it could be growing wild there but it is not producing enough soft fibres.We are looking for a crop that will grow economically and be used for marketing. Therefore, KARI has carried out this research and found that Kenneth will do better as a cash crop. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, is the Assistant Minister certain that the plant found in Bulwani in Yala Delta is not jute? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kones: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I confirm it is jute. But all I am saying is that it can go wild so long as we do not use it as a cash crop. However, the Ministry has gone into it and found that it is not encouraging to have it as a cash crop to farmers. But they are substituting it with cotton which is doing better and will produce better results as a cash crop. Otherwise, jute is already being grown there, but it is not economical to go into it as a cash crop to farmers. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is very strange. If a plant grows naturally by God's grace in a place, how come it cannot be grown economically? What are the obstacles? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kones: It is very simple, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The crop has a very short fibre which is not economical at all to farmers. If it had long fibres, that would be okay. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I must thank the Assistant Minister for that clarification. However, can he tell us when they are going to begin growing cotton in the area since the land is already available? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kones: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, plans are already going on and as soon as we are satisfied, then work will start immediately. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Okay. Shall we go to Mr. arap Chepkwony's Question for the second time? </Newspeech><I>Question No. 137</I><HEADER>BUMPS FOR KAPSOIT/AINAPKOI ROAD</HEADER><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Mr. arap Chepkwony is still not here again? </Newspeech>(Question dropped)Now, for the benefit of the hon. Member for Eldoret South, I think, the Chair recommends that you take a little bit more time, put all your papers in good order, and put in another question so that you can achieve better results that way.Next Order.<Newspeech>Mr. Arte: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I am sorry you did not call Mr. Salat's Question for the second time. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Oh, you are quite right, Mr. Ate. Shall we go back to Mr. Salat's Question for the second time. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Salat: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I ask my Question, I apologise for coming late. </Newspeech>                            <i>Question No. 187</i><HEADER>TELEPHONE FOR HULUGHO AND BURA </HEADER>Mr. Salat asked the Minister for Transport and Communications when telephone services will be provided at Hulugho and Bura divisional headquarters.<Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. This Question was first asked by hon. Arte on behalf of Mr. Salat, but the Assistant Minister was not in to respond. Then here conies an Assistant Minister who thinks is very innocent. He is late and does not apologise to the House for coming late. Is that in order? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr. Mutwol): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, indeed, I am very innocent. In fact, when I heard the Questioner apologise for coming late, I took it that the Question was being asked for the first time. However, I sincerely now apologise for coming late, and beg to reply.Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (K.P.T.C.) plans to provide telephone services at Bura Divisional Headquarter in Garissa District by the end of July, this year. With regards to the second centre, Hulugho, we have a bit of a problem. Due to heavy financial expenditure required to construct a major radio tower to provide radio repeaters before a telephone exchange can be installed at Hulugho, it will not be possible to provide telephone services to this centre until 1993/94 financial year. </Newspeech>	/<Newspeech>Mr. Salat: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I appreciate the answer by the Assistant Minister. But I wonder why it is the same promise he has been giving to this House since 1988. I put this Question in 1989 and was told that Bura would have telephone services by the end of June, 1989. But to date, there is no telephone service in that area. Could he assure the House that what he is saying now is nothing but the truth, and that Bura will have telephone service by the end of July, 1992? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr.Mutwol: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure the hon. Member that that will be done. What is happening at the moment is that the team which doing similar work at Ijara will be moved by the end of this month to Bura Headquarters. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Arte: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has talked of a heavy expenditure involved in installing telephone service at Hulugho Divisional Headquarters. Can he tell us how much money is involved here? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mutwol: Mr. Speaker, Sir, technical Investigations were carried out and established that a major typographical problem exist in that town. Hulugho town is situated in a basin which makes it even impossible to connect the centre with international telephone network without the need to construct expensive intermediate radio repeater station with all the associated radio tower. The investigations confirmed that two high radio towers are required; one with 8 meters and the other 23 meters high, costing KSh.3.5 million and the other KSh.0.2 million respectively. Hulugho itself will be over and above the standard cost of providing installation of two sets of radio equipment that will be necessary at the two points. This makes the cost of providing the telephone services to these small centres prohibitive under the present engineering practices which rely heavily on overland radio links. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Salat: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I appreciate the reply by the Assistant Minister. He has said that Hulugho will be provided with telephone service during 1993/94 financial year. But it is only a day before we go to 1993/94 financial year. Could he assure the House that enough financial provision will be made by his Ministry so that we do not have a repeat of the same? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mutwol: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure the hon. Member and the House that we shall do everything possible to cater for that in the budget. However, since the demand for telephone service in this area is also very low and we are providing it at a very high cost, I would urge the hon. Member to educate his people about the need for the service. </Newspeech>	(End D.)<Newspeech>Mr. Salat: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the hon. Assistant Minister really in order to pre-empt the demand while there is not telephone service in these places?His first responsibility is to install the service and then later he can determine whether or not the people there are using the telephone. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mutwol: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we do assess the demand by sending teams of engineers to the area. The population of the areas in question has also got to be taken into consideration. After careful assessment, we are always in a position to know how many people in one given area need a telephone service. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Salat: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister is talking of the demand for telephone services, but the situation in Garissa and the whole of North¬-Eastern Province, differs very greatly from the situation in Kakamega or Nairobi where you have very many people. In North-Eastern Province, the demand for telephone services should not be based on population but on the existing insecurity in the area. At the moment, there is a lot of banditry activity going on in this area and it is this situation that warrants the Ministry to consider installing a telephone service in the entire area. He should not come here and tell us that there is an assessment process to  determine how many people want telephone service because this cannot apply in the Northern Kenya. He should instead consider the rather delicate situation existing in this area and make arrangements to provide a telephone service to the various centres in this area. Today, wananchi in this area have lost their relatives not to mention cows and camels through banditry activity. It is for this reason that I strongly feel that a telephone service must be installed at once in this area. Could the Assistant Minister, as a matter of priority ensure that Hulugho and Bura Divisional Headquarters have a telephone service? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mutwol: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I did not say that my Ministry was not going to install a telephone service in Hulugho and Bura divisional headquarters, nor should it be taken for granted that there is no telephone service in Garissa. What I have said is that the tender for the installation of a telephone service in Hulugho and Bura, has had some natural problems which will take a bit of time to solve. However, despite these problems, we shall endeavour to provide a telephone service in these two places. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Arte: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to put the records very clear. The Assistant Minister has said that Hulugho is a small centre but the truth of the matter is that Hulugho is a divisional headquarters for Hulugho Division. It is also a border town on the Kenya/Somalia border. Therefore, can the Assistant Minister consider installing a telephone service there bearing this in mind. Even the district officer at Hulugho has no telephone and this is very serious. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mutwol: Mr. Deputy Speaker, as I have said, a tender for the installation of a telephone service for Hulugho has already been awarded but due to several natural problems, this is taking us a bit of time. However, we are going ahead to provide the service despite the fact that it is going to be very expensive to do so. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Next Order! </Newspeech>POINT OF ORDER<HEADER>HON. MEMBERS ABSENT TO ASK QUESTIONS</HEADER><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Mr. Onyancha): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I rise to register a complaint on behalf of my Ministry against hon. Members who put Questions to the Ministry but fail to turn up to ask them in the House. We spend a lot of time and money to try and get answers to these Questions and when hon. Members fail to turn up to ask them, we feel that this is very unfair to us. In addition, hon. Members of the Back Bench are quick to attack the members of the Front Bench when a Minister may fail to turn up or gets late to reply to a Question. So, I beg to register our complaint regarding this matter. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Next Order! </Newspeech>MOTION<HEADER>TARMACKING OF CHEMOSIT /KISII ROAD</HEADER><Newspeech>Mr. A.H.O. Momanyi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move:-THAT, in view of the fact that road transport is an important form of communication countrywide, and considering that the tarmacking of Chemosi/ Kisii Road which serves the agricultural, rich areas of Kericho, Kisii, Kisumu and South Nyanza Districts, which commenced in 1986 has not been completed; this House urges the Government to look for ways and means of financing completion of the project.This road was surveyed in 1968 and was to be constructed in 1986, but up to now it has never been completed. This road affects very many farmers who grow tea, pyrethrum, coffee and so on. In May 1986, a tender for the tarmacking of this road was awarded to Solel Boneh who tarmacked the first ten kilometres of the road and then pulled out of the contract. Up to date, this road is a thorn in the flesh as far as the people of the district are concerned. Today, farmers have a lot of problems in exporting their produce to the factories and to the market. The construction of this road was revived in 1988 by Zakhem Ltd. who tarmacked about three kilometres of the road. The unfortunate thing is that the company has gone underground and no one seems to know what happened to them.This road passed right in the middle of Kisii District and it is the only road that serves the people of Nyamira, Kisii, South Nyanza and Migori. Today, the people of Nyamira are anxious to see this road being completed and we are asking the Government to look for ways and means of completing it. The road passes through a very densely populated area and something should be done about it once and for all. Today, about two kilometres from Kisii Town, you will find this road is completely impassable. It has big holes which are full of w?ter during the rainy seasons. Even the matatus cannot pass on this road now and they have to look for an alternative route through Keroka which is 20 kilometres away from Nyamira. It is for this reason that I appeal to the Minister for Public Works to ensure that this road is tarmacked.Recently, the Government gave an undertaking that this road would be completed as soon as possible, but it is surprising to find the contractors disappeared and left behind their equipment which is now being stolen. I appeal to the Minister to look for ways and means of commencing the tarmacking of this road. The Minister is also affected by this road which passes right through the heart of his constituency. We are having a lot of problems particularly now when it is raining and I believe that the Minister will come to the aid of the people of Nyamira, South Nyanza and Migori.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the officer in charge of roads in Nyamira district is an arctechict and he has done more harm than good. So, we need a road engineer. The man does not even stay in Nyamira because he is always moving between Nyamira and Nairobi. He spends Shs.15,000/- every two weeks on his trips and so you can imagine how much money he has used. I am appealing to the Minister for Public Works to remove that man from Nyamira immediately because he has done a lot of harm to the people of Nyamira. Since Nyamira became a district no road has been done although we pay cess on tea. We are strongly appealing to Public Works to ensure that this road is completed and at the same time remove that man from Nyamira. We want to have a road engineer and not an architect, whose work is quite different from that of a roads engineer.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we thank the Government through the Ministry of Public Works because the two tippers and three graders we asked for when the President came to Nyamira have been provided. Nyamira is a very small district and has three graders and two tippers. So, this man should work day and night to improve the roads. But the Government has employed very bad people; people who are not interested in developing a new district like Nyamira. This district has very few roads and by now we should not be talking about road maintenance because they are very few. If we had a competent person who was very keen on assisting the people we would not be having any problem with road maintenance in Nyamira. But now people who go to Kisii to do business have to run when they see signs of rain because if it rains when they are in Kisii they will not reach Nyamira. Since we do not have banks in Nyamira people go to bank their money in Kisii. However, because of the bad roads buses get stuck on the way and somebody can easily spend a whole day on the way and run the risk of being robbed of his money. So, this road should be done immediately so that people can move easily.As I have said Nyamira is a rich agricultural area; we grow tea, pyrethrum, passion fruits, maize, and many other cash crops. However, when it rains getting tea from the buying centres to the factory is a big problem. If this road is completed and a few other minor roads taken care of people will not get these problems. The road from Keroka via Gesima, Mosobeti to Nyamira has one of the heaviest traffics. It serves people from Borabu Division who go to district headquarters in Nyamira. But when it rains nobody from this division uses it to go to Nyamira because it is impassable; it forces people to go to Nyamira through Kisii. If this road is done our people will be very happy.As I said earlier on the 1986 survey of this road passed in a new place and avoided some markets which are now dying off. I am also appealing to the Ministry to tarmac the Mote Mwamu-Manga Road so that the Manga District Officer can reach his office easily. When construction of this new road was suggested there was a big tug of war over diverting it from the old site and people were annoyed when its course was changed. But people are more unhappy now because work on the road has not been completed. It is not only in Nyamira where we are complaining about roads. Even the Kericho-Sotik Road is bad and it should be carpeted so that people can move easily. Buses from Homa Bay, Migori and Oyugis use this road, but vehicles are being spoiled on this road because of big potholes.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are thus asking the Government to look for finances and complete this project It is a very important project which started in 1986. There are many projects which started two years ago and have been completed. Some of us wonder why it has taken about seven years and this road has not been completed. Since the Minister, who is here, is also affected he should find ways and means of assisting the Kericho and Kisii people. The portion of this road from Chemosit to Kisii is about 20 kilometres, but if you go through Kereko the distance is about 70 kilometres. So, tarmacking the Chemosit-Kisii portion of the road will save fuel and time. This road can also be used to go to Kisumu through Nyamira. The cost of fuel is rising every day and tarmacking of this road can save transporters a lot of fuel. This is because the Kericho-Sotik Road is so bad that you cannot drive on it for 20 kilometres without spoiling your vehicle. Since 1986 only 26 kilometres of this road have been done. However, we do not know how much has been spent on it Solel Boneh Company did 20 kilometres of the road but we do n6t how much they were - paid and how much remained unpaid. A few years later these people went away, as I mentioned earlier, and the new people came and did 16 kilometres. . Again, they have gone away but we do not know how much money they were paid and how much is their balance.With those few remarks, I beg to move and ask my friend, hon. Falana, to second the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Falana: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to second this important Motion. It is important because it is concerns communication. Road communication is the basis of all aspects of development This particular road is in a very important zone of this Republic because is serves an agricultural area. Since agriculture is the backbone of the economy of this country, this road then needs the real attention of the Government.At times I do not understand why the Government starts a project and does not complete it It leaves it half-way done. This road was surveyed in 1968 and funds were made available in 1986 for its construction. I do not know whether, in the initial stages, the Government had only voted for 26 kilometres of this road. If the initial contract was made for the whole length of the road, that is, 80 kilometres, then I do not know where the rest of the money went There was no point of starting this road and doing only 26 kilometres within a period of seven years and then stop work altogether. There are some projects which are started and when they are not completed, the people lose confidence in the Government. If the people of that area had been given the hope that this road would be completed and then work stops doing only 26 kilometres, they get disheartened. I would like to appeal to the Minister that the creation of Nyamira District itself is enough to tell the Government that there is need for the completion of this road. This is an agricultural area and that is why a new district was created. Therefore, an agricultural area like the hon. Mover had put it like this one which produces tea, cotton, coffee and so on, qualifies for a good road that farmers can market their produce easily. It seems that this road was not well planned in the first instance. It could be that money was voted for doing 80 kilometres but due to poor foresight, only 26 kilometres were done. This is really disheartening to the people of the area. I am sure there are some other roads which were thought of later on but have now been completed while this one has remained at a standstill. This is bad. I would like to call upon the Government to take upon itself and ensure that this road is completed and not to do it in bits and pieces and then leave it to "die". I would like to say that Kenyan roads are not well maintained throughout the Republic. Let us not cheat ourselves. Let us not be cheated with this re-carpeting which is being in Eastleigh in Nairobi. It was reported in the newspapers recently that the Minister had promised to do roads in the country using funds collected from toll stations. This was a beautiful layout but I wished it were that convincing. You could see how money from toll station is being used on City roads here. This was reported in the newspapers. This money is supposed to do roads in the rural areas and not herein town.[Mr. Deputy Speaker left the Chair][The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi) took the Chair]I think there is a problem with the Ministry of Public Works in respect of planning on the money that they have. There is no doubt that the money is there. We know that millions of shillings are being collected from the numerous toll stations that we have in the country but the way it is utilized leaves a lot to be desired. This business of neglecting roads until they are completed wrecked before they can be repaired, should be done away with. There is this Kiswahili saying which says "Usipoziba ufa, utajenga ukuta." If we could repair roads as soon as we notice minor damages, it would not cost so much. I do not know why the Ministry of Public Works feels comfortable to wait until the roads are no more before they can embark on repairs. Volunteers have now decided to fill potholes and do other repairs at a fee. For instance, we see written boards everywhere on Nairobi streets reading "Please donate something to the volunteers to fill potholes." This is embarrassing. What is the Government doing? Why can the Ministry not repair roads in good time? Why wait until a road is completely out of use before they can think of repairing it? Individuals or good Kenyans who care and who, out of their own initiative want to create jobs for themselves, have now embarked on repairing roads with murram at a small fee. This is very embarrassing. The Ministry should have the foresight to save us out of this embarrassmentThe other point is on road signs on rural roads. If the Ministry does not have funds to repair roads, they should, at least, erect road signs to warn motorists that the road is impassable or that there are potholes, bridges and other dangers ahead. That would be a very good service. For instance, in my home area, from Isiolo to Moyale is about 600 kilometres of rough road. This road does not have any road signs and it is surrounded by bushes and yet it is supposed to be an international highway - Nairobi to Addis Ababa. That is what it is. We have been given promises every now and then to the effect that funds have been set aside for it, it has been surveyed and that tarmacking will start soon. These hopeless hopes have been there for a long time. The money that had already been spent on that road has now gone to waste. Bushes have now outgrown onto the road. Motorists are now being forced to divert and look for passage simply because the Ministry of Public Works has neglected this road totally. If these bushes were cleared, this highway would at least be in use.I know that the hon. Mibei is a good and capable Minister but I do not know where the failure is perhaps, it is it could be from the ground level to the top or due to poor communication and management Of course, lack of finance has always been the story but generally, Kenyan roads are greatly neglected. The Ministry of Public Works has made it a habit to wait until the roads are beyond repair and they then come up and say "Well, this road cannot be repaired now. We will take the undertaking to do it when funds are available." But if they could be repairing the roads as and when damage is detected, the cost would very minimal. For instance, if road signs were erected this is what I am calling for - and bushes cleared, traffic accidents could be limited. As of now, motorists driving on the Isiolo/Moyale Road risk bumping into wild beasts since they cannot be detected on a bushy road. The road is not there; it has been sealed off by bushes.I appeal to the Ministry of Public Works not to wait until things are beyond their control in terms of finances before they can embark on corrective measures. They should attend to roads countrywide particularly this Chemosit/ Kisii Road which had been allocated funds way back in 1968 and has not been completed to-date. I know that we shall be faced with that common language "When funds become available we shall look for funds". Funds were available and that is why this road had been planned and approved but somebody somewhere</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi): Your time is up, Mr. Falana. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Falana: With those few remarks, I beg to second. </Newspeech>(Question proposed)<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Mr. Onyancha): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to support this Motion. The history of this road is a sad one. The information we have is that this road was intended to be the first one to be tarmacked in the then Kisii District, which has now been divided into Kisii and Nyamira districts. We have information that the plan to tarmack this road was mooted way back in 1968. We do not know what happened such that there was this delay from 1968 to 1986 when Government finally started working on the road.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are many serious allegations. For example, it has been alleged that although this was the major road connecting Kisii, Kericho and Nairobi and was intended to be the first one to be tarmacked, when funds were availed they were diverted to another road in Kisii. This is said to have been done by a politician who' was then a Minister from Kisii District So, we in Nyamira failed to get this road tarmacked then. The plans were shelved. After 1983 a lot of pressure came up and then finally and I thank the Government for this Government responded positively to the cry of the people from Nyamira and Kisii who were affected and the road was started in 1986.As it has been stressed, the road is a short one but it has taken all these years to be done. Our people have been asking us questions almost in every meeting we convene, wanting to know the cause of the delay. Each time we have been assuring them that the road would be completed very soon. We gave those assurances during the last Parliament But by the time we went for the 1988 general elections only a very small bit of the road had been done. All the same, we continued to promise the people that the road would be completed. Up to now, when we are facing another general election, the road has not been completed. Our people, who have a lot of confidence in our Government, have been believing us but they do not believe us anymore. All Members of Parliament from Kisii and Nyamira districts are supposed to tell their representatives why we have not been telling them the truth, yet we did not lie to them; we told them what we believed was going to happen. So, we have a problem.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is unfortunate because it is not only Members of Parliament from Kisii and Nyamira districts who are affected; the Minister for Public Wtorks himself is affected. In fact the road passes through his constituency. The most unfortunate thing about it I know it is unfair is that the tarmacked bit is in the Minister's constituency. It is not because he designed that but because the contractor started form his area downwards to Kisii. The common people in Kisii think that the Minister did that himself. I want to exonerate the Minister from that one, but the problem still stands. We have to do something about it. We have raised the issue at different venues of the Government and each time we have received a strong promise. We do not know what to tell the people, whose confidence in this issue is being eroded. Something has to be done.This raises another very serious issue touching on the Government and the manner in which it asks for aid from outside. We have to change our system of asking for aid. Where we know that the Government is not capable of raising even a small percentage of the money required for a certain project we should be straightforward enough to ask for full aid</Newspeech>.<Newspeech>Mr. arap Soi: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. With due respect to the Assistant Minister, he said that the Minister for Public Works is exonerated and that a certain person, either within the Ministry or outside, was responsible for diverting the funds which would have been used for this road. Now, whose responsibility is it? Even if somebody else diverted the money, was the Minister not responsible constitutionally? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Mr. Onyancha): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member is at liberty to make his personal conclusions. I made my own conclusions and if he does not agree with me he will make his own comments when he stands up to contribute. All I am saying is that the matter in which we ask for aid today needs to be looked into afresh. If we need money to do a certain project and we know, as a Government, that we are not capable of raising any percentage towards that project, we should be straightforward and ask for the whole amount we need for the project. We should ask for the whole amount so that we are not caught up later on. What usually happens is that when we have put firm to the effect that we, as a Government have to raise</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kamuyu: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister, who is in the Office of the President, is misleading this House. When he says that we should ask for 100 per cent project loan or assistance is he insinuating that the Government has been dishonest in asking for money in projects which it cannot undertake? No one asks for a loan 100 per cent anywhere in the world, even from commercial banks. </Newspeech>(Mr. Onyancha stood up)I have not finished what I am saying, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Mr. Onyancha): You are wasting my time! </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi): But what is your point of order, Mr. Kamuyu? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kamuyu: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have been interrupted when making my point. I would like a clarification from the Assistant Minister, in his tongue or in the Government's tongue, that there will be no more donations to be asked for unless it is 100 per cent</Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Mr. Onyancha): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have expressed my personal opinion, and it still stands. It is my view that in future, we had better reconsider the way we ask for loans. It is possible for us to consider asking for full loans. We find that where we have stipulated that we produce a certain percentage of what is needed in a project we end up being unable to attract a full loan because we have not been able to raise our percentage. It is not that we do this deliberately; it is that we are not able to raise the balance, and this makes the project get stuck. So, maybe time has come for us to reconsider going straightforward and saying, "If you want to give us a loan, please give us a full one to ensure that our project is completed." I stand by this. The Government has been very straight in asking for loans even in those terms and all I am saying is that I think it is now time we considered this approach, but if you do not agree to this, hiyo ni shauri yako. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kamuyu: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I know that the Assistant Minister comes from the Office of the President. Is what he is telling us the Government policy or a personal statement? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Mr. Onyancha): Do not waste my time. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kamuyu: Hon. Onyancha, I have not yet finished making my point of order. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi): Order, Mr. Onyancha! This is the second time you have used the words "waste of time". We actually do not waste time here.Mr. Kamuyu, what is your point of order? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kamuyu: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. It is good to educate some of these people.All I want to know is whether the Government cannot implement a project unless it has a 100 per cent loan. It is not possible to get such a loan because we must appear to have contributed something towards the project first, whether this-</Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Mr. Onyancha): That is a point of argument. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker' (Mr. Mwamzandi): Order! Mr. Onyancha's time is over. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Mr. Onyancha): That is very unfair. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Home Affairs and National Heritage (Mr. Bidu): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to support this Motion. I support the Motion because Nyamira District is new and should be given an opportunity to have its roads tarmacked. Communication is very important, and everything moves smoothly when we have good roads. When we have good means of communication, even our people's health is taken care of without problems. Nyamira has its own history in that it produces many things, including bananas. It would be very important for the Minister here to consider having the roads in Nyamira tarmacked. I know that the Minister is a man of action and that he has proved to be capable. So, I am sure there will be no opposition to this Motion and that it will just sail through, The only thing we ask for in respect of the Motion is its implementation. I know that many tenders are awarded and that the officials of the Ministry of Public Works have all the necessary plans. The only thing I would urge the Ministry to take care of is supervision of work. Many times, you find that a contract is awarded to be  implemented in one month, but this takes more than one month. If we want our roads to be properly maintained, the Ministry should adopt a system of supervising the people who carry out this maintenance.Leaving Nyamira aside, you will find that many places countrywide have many potholes. While I appreciate the services rendered by the Ministry in road maintenance, I would still urge it to double its efforts. There are many potholes in the road from Mombasa to Nairobi, for example. Road maintenance people are there, and we see them on the road every time we use it. Before we come to the next general elections, we would like to have this road completely repaired.In Kinango Constituency, where I come from, we also have a similar problem. We passed a Motion here in 1988 requesting that the Kwale-Kinango- Lunga Lunga Road be tarmacked. I know that the Ministry concerned may be looking for funds, but my people would like to see, at least, this work being started. So, I would like the Minister to touch on this matter when he is replying to this Motion. He should tell us that there is now a road maintenance camp somewhere and that people are beginning to tarmack this road.There are also many other roads in my constituency which are in a very bad state, and I thank the Minister for the fact that his people are now taking action on them. However, I would like this action to be speeded up. There are many maintenance camps, but some parts of these roads are still impassable. Road maintenance teams are very slow. So, I request the Minister to order his people to visit these parts before my people become alarmed.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, another . thing that I would like to emphasise here relates to tenders. Something very fishy is happening when awarding tenders. Some tenders are awarded through brotherhood. Some of the people who are awarded tenders are very incapable of carrying out the work assigned to them. You will find that the Mombasa- Nairobi Road was repaired only recently, but when the rains came, the road developed many potholes. The Ministry should be very careful in awarding tenders. I would even request that, if possible, Members of Parliament be involved in awarding tenders because this is the only thing that will stop awarding tenders to cheap people. I call them "cheap" because when they are awarded a contract to repair a road, they do so, but, within no time, the road becomes even worse than it was before. We must be very careful in awarding such tenders.I would also request the Ministry to look into the question of toll charges. As you know, hon. Members do a lot of work for wananchi. We are the  people's "advocates", and it is unfair to charge a Member of Parliament when he passes by a toll station. So, I request the Minister to waive this charge and allow Members of Parliament to travel freely on our roads without paying toll charges because the duties we perform in this House are even more important than the Sh. 10/= we pay at toll stations.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would therefore request die Minister to use his office to ensure that we are allowed, as Members of Parliament, to pass through road toll stations without paying anything. We agree that the Kanu Government is doing a lot for wananchi. We are not like these new opposition political parties which are not giving us anything. They are not telling us what they are going to do for the people of this country. They are very fond calling for boycotts and so on. Even one FORD member has suggested that wananchi should boycott the forthcoming Presidential and Parliamentary elections. I would like to tell those opposition parties that the time has come for them to advocate for the development of this country. The time has come for them to preach peace for the good of this country. When we are talking about development in this House somebody somewhere is calling on wananchi to boycott elections. Those political parties must first of all hold their elections so that their officials do not continue to hold office on interim basis. An interim official is a temporary officer and he cannot speak on behalf of anybody. We scrapped Section 2(A) of our Constitution to allow, multi-partyism. These political parties must be ready for elections. They should go to the wananchi to get full mandate to speak on behalf of wananchi.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, you do not have to be in Kanu in order to help the Government. These opposition leaders can also help the Government This is because when you help the Government you are helping wananchi. If you help mwananchi you help the country; the Republic of Kenya. All of us must advocate for peace.With those few remarks, I beg to support the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Public Works (Mr. Mibei): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to respond to the Motion. The Motion is well worded and the Government accepts it as it is. As hon. Members have said, the Kanu Government recognises the importance of the provision of infrastructure especially roads, to serve our farmers so that they can take their goods and produce to market centres. It is only that at times the Government is hampered by shortage of funds. The Chemosit-Kisii Road Project is an on-going project We are seriously looking for funds so that this project is completed. I know this area myself and I wish to congratulate the people of Kisii, Nyamira and Kericho districts where the farmers are producing tea, coffee, pyrethrum, bananas and pineapples. The Government would have completed this project had it not been for the fact that the costs escalated due to certain factors in the world and as a result we have not been able to complete this project. But as the Mover of the Motion has urged the Government, we will try our best to- The funds that we have in the Ministry come from the Treasury and also from donors. We also get money from the toll funds. This particular project was fully funded by the Government. There were no donor funds for this project. But we are going to loolf for an alternative source of funding if the present source is not able to complete the project as required by the people.At this juncture, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank all those donors who have assisted in funding quite a number of road projects in our country. As I speak now there is a very big seminar going on at the moment. I am talking about the Road Maintenance Policy Seminar which is currently taking place here in Nairobi. That seminar is also attended by donors and senior engineers from the Ministry and also engineers from neighbouring countries. The; seminar is tackling all the issues involved in road maintenance.Members of Parliament have complained about a number of things relating to road maintenance. These issues are being tackled and at the end of it all we shall come up with renewed efforts in carrying out road maintenance works throughout the country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, issues like tenders cannot be blamed on my Ministry. This is because my Ministry does not award tenders as such. The tenders are awarded by the Central Tender Board. Tenders for minor works are awarded by District Development Committees. This is because there is a District Tender Board, in every district for minor works. So, we only facilitate the tendering system but it is not us who award tenders.With regard to road toll funds, I would like to say that these funds are ploughed back into the roads from which the funds were collected. If you go to Mombasa now you will find that roads in Mombasa Town have been rehabilitated using the toll funds. Although we have not been announcing this, we have used toll funds to improve and rehabilitate quite a number of tarmack roads. We have now started erecting some sign posts to show that that road you are using has been rehabilitated by us using toll funds. These toll charges supplement what we get from the Treasury. Every year we get an average amount of Kshs.300 million which has improved the maintenance of quite a number of our roads. I would like to thank motorists who pay toll charges and I think it is not fair for the hon. Member to suggest that we waive toll charges because we need that money to improve roads throughout the country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to appeal to wananchi who live along the borders of Kisii and Kipsigis to continue living in peace as they have been doing since time immemorial. I also appeal to them to help in tracking down stock thieves who steal cattle from the other side of the border because these are the people who cause the fights that we have been hearing about. If the Kisiis could return any stolen cattle and arrest the thieves and the Kipsigis do the same then peace would prevail along those borders. Along the Sondu River, the people of Nyakach and Belgut have been living in peace all along. I think after the meetings of elders were held, it has now been resolved by both sides that peace is the only thing that would bring progress in that area. There is peace now and the normal trade is now continuing as usual.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have been looking for funds from donor countries, but it is surprising that some members of the opposition have been touring Europe asking the donors not to give Kenya any aid. It is shame on them. I wonder if they ever get into power what they will do because it appears as if they will ruin this country. The other day, the DP Interim Chairman was urging wananchi not to participate in national celebrations. Shame on him because wananchi turned up in large numbers in all the stadiums and meetings places to celebrate Madaraka Day. I think wananchi are wiser than leaders of these opposition parties.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think wananchi have now learnt that KANU leadership is more supreme than that of the opposition parties. During the coming general elections, wananchi will support KAJHJ in full in order to give lessons to the opposition because KANU Government has the experience of running this country for the past years. We do not want to hand over our Government to opposition members who do not know how to run a country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to appeal to civil servants to be loyal to the Government and to put more efforts in their work so that wananchi can enjoy fruits from the Government and their sons. Any civil servant in my Ministry who does not meet the standards required of him will have to face disciplinary action. I wish to inform one hon. Member from Nyamira that I am going to investigate the allegations he made against one of our staff. A district works officer is only an administrator. There are qualified people who do the actual work and so if we post somebody who is not an engineer to head a district you should not worry because he is only an administrator. If he messes up in the administration, we step in and take the appropriate action.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to take any more time on this Motion. My appeal is for us to cement our unity especially among leaders by holding meetings together in different constituencies. There is somebody in Nyeri who has been zero grazing his politics for the past 10 years and has now come up and wants to rush to Kisii, this or that place. What has he been doing for all those years?I think we are better off because we have gone to different parts of the country and shown wananchi that Kenya is a united country. In doing so wananchi can also feel the same so that they leave out tribalism because it is a deadly disease. Tribalism has destroyed religion. For example, a bishop of one tribe speaks to his tribesmen in his language thus leaving his religion aside. We have good examples which I do need not mention.We have been warned all along by the President - hon. Daniel arap Moi, that tribalism will ruin Africa. When you consider all the areas having problems in this continent you will find out that tribalism is the major factor which is sticking its neck out. When shall we learn from the ills of tribalism? At the moment, in this Republic we have about half a million refugees who are victims of tribalism in their countries. As a result of the coming of refugees into our country we are now being faced with shortages of milk and other commodities. These people would form a country of their own and nobody knows when they will go back to their countries. As Kenyans, if we cannot learn from the difficulties that our neighbours are facing, we shall never learn anything. We should not put our country in a situation of chaos because that will be to the detriment of our children and grandchildren.I am happy to note that hon. Members of this House have shown solidarity in supporting the "Government all along and that we have all been dealing with issues on developmentMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, while we are in this House improving on democracy, the opposition parties are doing exactly the opposite, as we have already been told. I think let us continue being a shining example to them since wananchi will know who are true leaders.With those few remarks, I beg to support</Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Transport and Communications (Dr. Momanyi): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to the Motion on Kisii/Chemosit road.It is now a custom in Kenya precedented by other examples that district and provincial headquarters are connected by major tarmacked roads. It seems very unfortunate that the Kisii/Chemosit road which started as far back as 1968, the original alignment was Kisii/Kebirigo, and it was completed. The second alignment which started in 1986, was Kebirigo/Chemosit. It was done and the alignment completed. But tarmacking fell short at a place called Nyaramba, leaving only about 30 km to complete.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am an engineer by profession and have worked on the roads and other projects in Kenya for 20 years. It is my experience that each year that passes costs escalate. I was used to KSh.l million per kilometre of tarmacked road. Now the Minister for Public Works will tell us the figure. But I think it is more than KSh.10 million a kilometre of well tarmacked road.I intend to suggest that each year that passes without completing that road, it is extra expense that the country will find very difficult to meet. At the moment, the Kisii/Chemosit road has reached Nyaramba which is a 66 kilometre road. It were better if there were any internal borrowing to complete the road and then look for funds to repay the loan.In May 1986, when I joined the. company that was constructing this road, the tender was only KSh.150 million. The following tenderer was KSh.200 million and I am sure the next tenderer to finish this road will be around KSh.300 or KSh.400 million. So it is better to borrow money, finish the road, and look for funds to pay back even if it is at an exorbitant interest. It is much better.Costs of construction are escalating every day, and those who are not in the building industry are wondering why even a simple house is costing much more. I remember buying a house for KSh.100,000,00 which is now going for KSh.5 million. So you can see how things go.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, many of my colleagues have elaborated the importance of roads as infrastructure in the country. Even before the Europeans came we had our own footpaths through forests, thickets and so on showing that even the early man needed an infrastructure which he made either by his feet or his implements. It is very important for the Ministry of Public Woks - I am sorry I am not pre-emptying the seminar going on - to look at roads and maintain them. Even when you build a house, after a year or two, you repaint it.But I am sorry  and I am sure my colleagues here will bear me witness that a road begins with a small defect which continues to grow, and after a month or two, it is a massive pothole. If somebody had taken care, it would have cost very little to repair and the road would continue for a long time being serviceable.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I now come back to Kisii District. It is one of the most productive west of the Rift Valley. Our roads are very pathetic. I am sure some of my colleagues will say that I am a road constructor and yet they are pathetic. But it is the means that we lack.It is very bad that an area that is very highly agricultural has no roads. A year or two ago, tea cess money disappeared without sufficient proof of how it was used and the roads for which that money was meant were not made. Nyamira District is richer agriculturally than Kisii, South Nyanza and other parts of Nyanza. I would recommend that besides the Kisii/Chemosit road we get the Konate/Kabondo road which starts in Nyamira so that Nyamira can be connected with the provincial headquarters in Kisumu. I would also recommend that Nyamira be connected to Keroka through an orphan road since people have to go to Nyamira for the administration. I also recommend that even if it is not tarmacked but a highway or an all-weather road through Gesima/Magombo and Kisii be constructed.With all that, Sir, I hope that the Minister for Public Works will consider these suggestions and consider borrowing money to complete the Kisii/Chemosit road.Thank you. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Technical Training and Applied Technology (Mr. Thuo): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this very important Motion. I think we all know as Members of this House that road communications is the key to development. I do not want to go into the issue which area deserves better road communication than the other. What is important to the whole country is all weather roads particularly the major roads. These major roads should be well maintained throughout the year. It is true that if you do not repair a crack in a house, you may end up by building the whole house. The same case applies to our roads. The maintenance of our roads has not been to anybody's satisfaction. I know that there is lack of money but nevertheless, if a job is started, it must be completed. Wananchi should be encouraged if the engineers in charge of our roads in the district do their work properly. I know wananchi are ready to help the Government to repair small patches of road which become impassable during the rainy seasons. Where the Ministry can provide the transport, wananchi can look for hardcore to patch up holes existing on some of our roads.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am saying this realizing thane are roads in certain areas of this country which are very hilly, for example, my constituency of Kigumo. However, before coming to that, I would like to stick to the Motion. We have been told that the Chemosit/Kisii Road has taken a long time to be tarmacked. I do agree with the Mover of this Motion when he says that if this road was  completed in 1986, it would have saved the Government a lot of money. Where there are such roads, I think it is time that the Minister looked for ways and means of getting funds to complete these roads. I know the present Minister for Public Works, hon. Mibei is a sincere person and although he has no money at the moment, he should explore for ways of getting funds to improve the situation on these roads.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the Government could, through the normal budgetary provision, allocate the Ministry of Public Works more money, roads in areas where our people are growing tea, coffee, and producing milk and so on, could be improved. This would enable farmers to transport their produce to the market and this would improve the economy of this country. It would also improve our foreign exchange earnings because things like coffee and tea would be easily transported to the markets. Therefore we as national leaders we should address ourselves to the question of improving road communication particularly in areas where wananchi are growing cash crops which bring foreign exchange to this country. If we do not consider improving road communication in these areas which are earning us foreign exchange, how shall we be able to develop the less productive areas? I am saying this because we must first of all get money to develop those other less productive areas. In other words, I am saying that we should not kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. We have areas that are clearly understood to be high productive areas, for example, in Central Province. It is from this area that a lot of milk, tea, coffee, pyrethrum and so on are produce. We also have areas like Kisii, Kericho and Oyugis which are highly productive and these are the areas where roads should be given the first priority.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, having said that, I have a few requests to make to the Minister for Public Works. My constituency has a population of 220,000. One of the drawbacks is that Kigumo is a very hilly place and although it has about 80 primary schools, 30 secondary schools and about 300 churches, its road communication is very poor. Given this situation, you can see how it can be difficult to reach the institutions I have mentioned. In Kigumo, we grow tea, coffee, bananas, maize and beans. Today, we have started growing French Beans and the Government should come in to assist us looking for a suitable market for it. On the side of roads, I only appeal to the Minister to gravel them; to put marrum on them I am saying this because we have marrum on the lower side of my constituency. I am happy to note the Minister is present and I have no doubt he will consider what I am saying very seriously. After all, I have already talked to him about these problems. There is the Maragwa/Gathera/Gacoco road leading on to Kamukabi/Mununga Road which then goes on to the Kigumo water treatment works. This road passes through a highly agricultural potential area where farmers are producing coffee, tea, milk, beef and so on. There is also ainother road known as Gakoigwo/Kaharo/Keiriangoro which then leads on to Kangondu. This road also passes through a highly agricultural area but unfortunately, it is impassable during the rainy season. We also have another road known as Mbombo/Maragwa Ridge leading on to Kambirwa which is as equally bad. There is another road called Kamahuha Market Road which goes on to Sabasaba township. All these roads pass through areas where our people are doing a lot of farming and therefore must be properly maintained. There is the Sabasaba/Gakuyu/Githembe Road which goes on to Mareira/Karega and Gacoco across the Maragwa River to Kiharu. We also have other roads in this constituency, for example, the Ichagaki/Njora Road which leads to Gikomora to Ngamburi. We also have the the Gakaraku/Mumbu/Mbogoine/Kagurumo to Munguini Road is in the same bad situation. There is also Karing/Mununga Road which leads to Gikigie.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I have said, all these roads are completely impassable during the rainy season and I have been receiving a lot of whipping from my constituents because they think I do not speak about these roads in Parliament This is why I am speaking here without fear and without any intention of challenging the Government and saying that these roads must be repaired. What else am I supposed to do for the Kigumo people? I am saying that even if it is a question of putting marrum on these roads, fair enough! As I speak here, eight bridges have collapsed and none of them has been repaired. I have made these complaints here time and again, but nothing seems to be done. I appeal to the Minister to address himself to these problems because my people are really suffering. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. arap Soi: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this Motion. I am also thankful to the Mover of the Motion, Mr. Momanyi for bringing the Motion to this House. I would like to say straightaway that I support the Motion whole¬heartedly because this road also affects our people since it goes through Kericho to Sotik. To hear that money was diverted in 1968 by a politician is really dismaying. When that same person was a Minister the road from Sotik to Kericho was being tarmacked. I remember the road was tarmacked from Sotik up to Kasuse and the other part right up to the town was left undone. Now, this road from Kericho to Sotik is full of potholes and to drive on it is actually ruining your own car. So, I do not see why the Minister does not use toll levy being collected at Kipkellion to cover  the potholes on this road. We are suffering a great deal because the road is almost cut. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Public Works (Mr. Mibei): On a point of information, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I want to inform the hon. Member that a contractor is already on site to rehabilitate the Kericho- Sotik Road. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. arap Soi: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, even if the contractor is on site we have seen him there for more than one year but he has not started work on the road. If somebody is appointed to do work on a road he should start work immediately. That contractor is not covering the potholes although he is being paid. The Ministry should instruct the contractor to start repairing this road and ensure that it is passable. I agree that he is already on the site is but he is doing nothing there. He should be told to take care of these potholes immediately even before he starts the main works.I think the Chemosit-Kisii Road should be done immediately. There is no quesiton of requesting the Ministry to do so because it is something that has taken a long time. Again, when we had the tribal clashes and stock theft cases in the area the President visited the area and suggested that a security road should be constructed all along the Kisii-Kipsigis border. That was an emergency suggestion, which I think the Minister should take seriously. But up to now the border road-</Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi): Order, Mr. Soi Our Standing Orders do not actually allow the use of the name of the President, particularly by Back-benchers, as a basis of an argument.Mr. Mang'oli: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Speaker, Sir. You have said that back¬benchers should not refer to the President's directives. Is that true and if so</Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi): Mr. Mang'oli, will you read your Standing Orders? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mang'oli: If that is the case then what will we be doing here? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi): Go on, Mr. Soi. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Soi: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think my referring to the President's directive was not actually meant to be a point of argument I was mentioning it as being necessary because the first sentence of the Motion refers to "communication". I just wanted to remind the Minister what the President said about that particular border road.This Motion is actually complaining about diversion of money from the purpose for which it was granted to another purpose. Presently there is an on-going gravelling of the road from Daraja Sita to Chembule and from.Chembule to Labotiet. The contractor is on site but whenever I visit him he says that he has been instructed  to reduce the distance and gravel eight kilometres from Daraja Sita to Chembule which is the worst section of that road. This is a very serious thing because the Ministry directed that the whole road be gravelled. It is a bad thing to allow civil servants within the Ministry to reduce the money allocated to a project without the knowledge of the Minister. The money for works on the other road from Chembule to Labote is also being reduced. So, I request the Minister to look into that issue with immediate effect before the contractor moves away from the road. It would be expensive to move him away and then bring him back, just as we are doing in the case of the Chemosit-Kisii Road. The Ministry should stop this practice of removing contractors or diverting money meant for a particular road to another one.Diversion of money of from one project to another is the failure of the Ministry. You can remember a road from Tablong to Narok was supposed to be tarmacked in 1975 and millions of shillings had been indicated as having spent on that road, although this road was only tarmacked in 1990. I think the Ministry has finance officers and engineers. The Chief Engineer should only control construction of roads and not money. I think there should be tight control of this money so that anybody does not come and divert money to the district he comes from. We would like the contractor at Mitei to start work immediately. I am saying so because the condition of this road is deteriorating and that is why we are suffering. I am sure the Minister suffers when he uses that road to go to his home. The road is full of potholes and I think it should even be closed. We are breaking our vehicles windscreens on it every now and then. The other day I lost car nuts on it when I was coming to Nairobi. I, therefore, strongly support this Motion and request the Minister to implement it immediately once it is passed by this House. Sir, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Ministjer for Energy (Mr. Moturi): Bw Naibu Spika wa Muda, nasimama kuiunga mkono Hoja hii-</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi): Order, Mr. Moturi  Before you Speak I want to clarify something. Hon. Mang'oli was not sure of my ruling on the use of the President's name, but Standing Order 72 states:-"No Member, other than a Minister, shall use the name of the President as authority for anything that he says."That is exactly what I meant Continue, Mr. Moturi. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Energy (Mr. Moturi): Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, nasimama kuunga Hoja hii mkono. Hii barabara ni ya muhimu sana kwa sababu inapitia katikati ya Wilaya yaNyamira. Inapitia katika mawakilisho ya mhe. Onyancha, hon. Momanyi na yangu pia kuelekea Kisii kutoka Kericho. Kwa kusema ukweli, barabara hii, ilianza kufikiriwa mnamo mwaka wa 1968 na ilianza kujengwa baada ya miaka 18 mnamo mwaka wa 1986. Tangu barabara hii ianzishwe mnamo mwaka wa 1986, imechukuwa miaka saba na hadi sasa, bado haijakamilishwa.Kwa mfano, barabara hii inatumika na wasafiri kutoka Tanzania kuelekea Nairobi. Watu wengi wanaotaka kusafiri hadi Nariobi kutoka Kuria, Migori na South Nyanza, hupitia Kisii, Keroka, Sotik na Kericho. Kama barabara hii ingekuwa imekamilishwa, watu hawa hawangepitia njia hii ndefu ya Keroka na Sotik. Wangekuwa wakipita Nyamira kwa sababu ni fupi sana. Wilaya ya Nyamira ina mazao mengi sana kushinda Wilaya za Kisii, South Nyanza, Migori na hata Bomet ambayo iko karibu. Haya mazao yote hayawezi kusafirishwa hadi kwenye masoko kama vile Kisumu, Kericho na kwingineko kwa sababu ya ukosefu wa barabara. Kwa mfano, mazao kutoka Kuria na Migori kama vile tumbaku, sukari na mengine, hayawezi kusafirishwa kwa urahisi. Kama hii barabara ingekuwa imekamilishwa, mazao haya yangekuwa yakipitia huko hadi sokoni. Pia, kuna soap stone ambayo inapatikana kule South Mugirango na ambayo ina soko kubwa hapa Nairobi lakini inasafirishwa kwa shida kwa sababu ya ukosefu wa barabara nzuri. Kwa sasa, kazi katika barabara hii imekwama na hata wale watu ambao waliokuwa wakitengeneza daraja kule Sondu, walihama juzi. Ajabu ni kwamba ile barabara kutoka Kaplong' kuelekea Bomet ambayo ilianzishwa juzi, pengine imekamilishwa. Hii barabara iko karibu na ile Nyamira na wananchi wanatuuliza " Wanasiasa wetu, hii barabara ilianzishwa juzi tu hapa Bomet na imekamilishwa na hali hii yetu ambayo ilianzishwa mwaka wa 1968 bado ijakamilishwa. Ni kwa sababu gani?" Je, Kenya imekuwa mbili? Sisi wanasiasa wa sehemu hiyo tunapatwa na shida kubwa tunapoulizwa na wananchi kile kinachozuia ukamilishaji wa barabara hii. Tunashindwa kuwaeleza wananchi kile kinachoendelea.Lami imewekwa katika barabara hii kufikia sehemu inayoitwa Ekerenyo na kutoka hapo hadi Kisii, hakuna kitu ambacho kimefanywa huko. Kwa hivyo, ningependa kumuuliza Waziri atafute pesa za kukamilisha ujenzi katika barabara hii. Hii barabara imewatia wananchi watukufu wa Nyamira aibu kubwa wanapofikiria muda ambao barabara hii imechukuwa tangu ujenzi uanzishwe. Tumepitisha ujenzi wa barabara nyingi katika mikutano ya kamati ya wilaya ili nazo ziwekwe lami, lakini hakuna kitu ambacho kimefanywa huko. Kwa mfano, barabara kutoka Chepilat kuelekea Ikonge na Sondu ilipitishwa ili iwekwe lami lakini kwa sababu ujenzi katika barabara ya Chemosit/Kisii haujakamilishwa, kazi haiwezi kuanzishwa katika barabara hii. Pia tulipitisha nyingine kutoka Mokomoni hadi Gesusu lakini nayo pia haiwezi kutengenezwa kwa sababu hii barabara haijakamilishwa. Barabara hii imezuia maendeleo sana katika sehemu ya Nyamira. Kitu kingine ni kwamba tunataka barabara nzuri kutoka makao makuu ya wilaya ya Nyamira kuelekea makao makuu ya mkoa kule Kisumu. Tunataka barabara hii na ile inayotoka Borabu karibu na mpaka wa Bomet kuelekea makau makuu ya wilaya ya Nyamira ziwekwe lami.Sasa ningependa kusema machache juu ya security roads. Kulikuwa na matata katika upande wa Chepilat na Gelegele. Sisi tunapakana na wilaya ya Bomet. Hii barabara inayopitia Chepilat/Isoge/Gelegele/Masimba ni ya maana sana. Jumapili iliyopita, karibu ng'ombe 60 waliibwa kutoka mawakilisho yangu, Borabu, na wakaelekezwa Chepalungu na hatukuweza kuwafuata kwa sababu barabara hii haipitiki. Ni ng'ombe 10 tu ambao walirudishwa; wengine walipotea kabisa. </Newspeech><Newspeech>An hon. Member: Uliza mhe. Soi. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Energy (Mr. Moturi): Nikizungumzia juu ya wizi wa ng'ombe, ningependa kusema kwamba juzi juzi Mtukufu Rais alipitia huko na tukafanya mkutano kati ya wazee kutoka wilaya za Bomet na Nyamira wakakubaliana kwamba wi?i wa ng'ombe ukomeshwe. Nasikitika kusema kwamba kila wiki ng'ombe wanaibwa kutoka Nyamira na kuelekezwa upande wa Bomet na sana sana Chepalungu. </Newspeech><Newspeech>An hon. Member: Si umuulize mhe. Soi? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Energy (Mr. Moturi): Je, huu ndio ujirani mwema? Kwa kusema ukweli hii ni one way traffic! Hata nikimuuliza mwenzangu, ataniambia kwamba hajasikia kwamba ng'ombe wameibwa kutoka Chepalungu na kuelekezwa upande wa Kisii au Nyamira. Hakuna. It is a one way affair. Watu wangu kule Nyamira wamechokeshwa na wizi kama huu. Ningependa kuchukuwa nafasi hii niwaulize Wabunge wenzangu kutoka upande wa Bomet na sana sana Chepalungu, wakae na wazee ili waone kwamba wizi huu umekomeshwa. Kuna msemo ambao wanasema, kwamba ng'ombe wa Kisii au wa Nyamira ni kitoweo chao kwa sababu hatukuwa na ng'ombe. Je, ni kwa miaka mingapi ambapo watakuwa wakija kuchukua kitoweo kutoka Kisii? Ni lazima wizi wa ng'ombe ukome na tukae kwa usalama. Kitu tunachohitaji katika mpaka wa Chebilat ni usalama kwa sababu wizi ndio chanzo cha mambo maovu kama vile vita. Kwa hivyo, ningewaomba Whe. Wabunge kutoka pande hizo wazungumze na wananchi wa sehemu zao ili tuhakikishe kwamba mambo haya yamemalizika.Kwa hayo machache, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, naunga mkono. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Home Affairs and National Heritage (Mr. Lalampaa): Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipatia nafasi hii. Hii ni barabara muhimu kwa sababu itawasaidia sana wananchi wa Chemosit kutoka Kericho, wananchi wa Kisii, Nyamira, Nyanza Kusini na pia wananchi wa Kisumu. Hizi ni sehemu ambazo zinakuza mazao ya kilimo kwa wingi hapa nchini.Bw. Naibu Spika, mawasiliano ya barabara ni muhimu sana katika kustawisha uchumi wa nchi hii. Wakulima wanahitaji barabara bora ili kuweza kufikisha mazao yao katika masoko.Ningependa kumkumbusha Waziri wa Ujenzi kwamba kuna haja ya kutengeneza barabara inayotoka Isiolo hadi Moyale. Wananchi wa Wilaya ya Samburu wa' '^ndekeza kwamba lami iwekwe kutoka Archer's Post kupitia Wamba, Maralal hadi Lake Baringo. Barabara hiyo ni muhimu sana kwa sababu ya shughuli za utalii. Kama tunavyoelewa, utalii ndio unaotuletea pesa nyingi zaidi za kigeni kuliko mazao ya kilimo kama vile kahawa au majani chai. Kwa hivyo, wakati umewadia ambako Waziri anastahili kuzungumza na Banki ya Maendeleo katika Afrika (ADB), kwa sababu hao ndio wanaohusika na mradi huu. Barabara hiyo ikitengenezwa, watalii watakuwa wakitoka Nairobi kupitia Nyeri, Nanyuki, Samburu Lodge, Maralal Safari Lodge, Lake Baringo hadi Lake Turkana. Hiyo ndiyo inayojulikana kama northern circuit ya watalii wanapaingia katika nchi hii. Watalii huiletea nchi hii pesa za kigeni na wanapenda kutembea kwenye barabara nzuri. Ikiwa hivyo, wakirudi makwao wanawaambia wenzao waje hapa na tunapata pesa zaidi za kigeni.Pia, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ningependa kumkumbusha Waziri kwamba ilikuwa ahadi ya Wizara yake na pia amri ya Serikali, kwamba barabara kutoka Rumuruti hadi Maralal iwekwe lami. Mradi huu umechukua muda mrefu sana ile hali tunajua kwamba sehemu ya Maralal ni mojawapo ya sehemu zinazokuza ngano ya hali yajuu sana. Kunahitajika kuwa na barabara bora katika sehemu hiyo ili kusaidia kusafirisha ngano hadi mahali inapohitajika. Kwa hivyo, ninamwomba Waziri ahakikishe kwamba mpango huo unaanzishwa kwa msaada wa ADB. Barabara hii ni muhimu pia kwa sababu hutumiwa na watalii wakienda sehemu nilizotaja hapo awali.Kwa jumla, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ninaipongeza Wizara sana kwa sababu imefanya kazi bora. Lakini mambo haya yote yanaweza kufanyika tu kama kukiwa na amani. Ni aibu kwa viongozi wa upinzani kujaribu kutatiza uchumi na maendeleo katika nchi hii. Nataka kuichukua nafasi hii kuwapongeza wananchi wote wa Kenya kwa kupuuza mwito wa Kibaki, Makau na wale wengine wote, na kuhudhuria sherehe za Madaraka Dei kwa Wingi. Nilikuwa Samburu na umati wa wananchi uliohudhuria sherehe hizo haujaonekana tangu tunyakue Uhuru. Nawapongeza sana kwa uzalendo wao. Kwa hayo machache, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, naiunga Hoja hii mkono. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi): Order, hon. Members. It is now time for the Mover to reply. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. A.H.O. Momanyi: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I reply, I wish to give my hon. friend here about three minutes to say something. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kyonda: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to thank my hon. friend here for slicing a bit of time to offer me this chance to also join my hon. colleagues in support of this Motion. A lot has been said about this Motion. Improving communication is very important, and what I find very important about this Motion is that it does not talk about one constituency. It does not only talk about Nyamira District alone; it touches on Kericho, Kisii, Kisumu and South Nyanza. The spirit of the Motion is what I find very important, and I would like to thank the Mover to that.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it has been said here that money which was supposed to complete this project a long time ago was diverted to other projects. Time and again we have heard of cases where civil servants or politicians have diverted money earmarked for given project to other projects of their own choice. I believe that with the onset of multipartysm, accountability and transparency this trend cannot, and should not, continue. I would urge that anybody seen to be doing this kind of thing should be punished to an extent that other people will never think of doing it. Why should money be diverted from one project to another, particularly when people have sat down and decided which project should be undertaken?Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, being a new district, Nyamira is just the same as Makueni district. In Makueni we have no tarmacked linkage to the outside world, and when it rains we have terrible problems in terms of transport. I would urge the Minister for Public Works, while considering what to do about this particular road in Nyamira District, to also look for money and give us a tarmacked road linking Makueni and Machakos district. We will also need a tarmacked road from the main Nairobi- Mombasa road through Makueni, Kibwezi, Emali via Tawa. This is very important and urgent because the rains have been rather heavy there and vehicles had even stopped from using this road for about two days. With things like this happening in such a new district, you can imagine the amount of damage that is being occasioned. I appeal to the Minister to look for money for the repair of not only this road in Nyamira, but also for other roads in the country.With those few remarks, I beg to thank my friend and support the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. A.H.O. Momanyi: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chance to thank all those who have contributed to the Motion, especially the Minister for Public Works. As other speakers have already said, this road is one of those which are giving hell to the people of Nyamira and other Abagusii. The "killer" of this road was once the Minister for Public Works, and he has now joined hands with another man who was once in charge of the Ministry of Finance in order to "kill" more roads in the country if they take over the running of the Government. The road in question is very potential, and since it was started many years back, it has not really taken off the ground.Let me take this occasion to thank the people of Nyamira for turning up at Nyamira Playground on the big occasion hosted on 1st June, 1992. Very many people turned up for the occasion. There were many people who went at Manga Ekerenyo and Nyamira because they did not listen to the call to boycott these celebrations. Madaraka Day is not meant for Kanu or any individual; it is a national day just like other similar days, such as Labour Day, Moi Day, Kenyatta Day and even Christmas Day. Our detractors may even call for a boycott of Christmas Day!As I have said, the road in question is the "heart" of the people of Nyamira, but most of these people are not transporting their goods from factories or carrying out any other transport business especially during the rains. If, as he has said, the Minister is going to work on this road, we very much thank him in advance. We would like to see work on this road completed. This road will assist many people, not only in Kisii, but even others who use it. There can be no improvement in a district without good roads. The only tarmac in Nyamira is on the parking bay outside the District Officer's office. There is no tarmac road in the whole of Nyamira. Road maintenance is very important, and if the Ministry maintains the road from Sotik to Kisii, my people will be very happy.There is a road maintenance camp at Magombo, but the people there are idle. There are also many other similar camps, but the people there are also idle. So, I urge the Minister to look into this matter and ensure that road maintenance teams really maintain our roads. If this happens, there will be no more potholes to talk about.There is a hole the size of a dam that has developed on the Jogoo Road, as you leave Kisii Town, which has given hell to motorists travelling to Nyamira. If the Minister asks his people to go and fill that hole up with murram, people can resume using the road. Jogoo Road is really pathetic due to a lot of stagnant water that has collected there. The Minister should assist us by getting his people to repair the road. Funny enough, graders were used to repair the road up to Ekerenyo, at the boundary of Kitutu Masaba and West Mugirango, and the work stopped there. From Sing'a to Kisii, the road is impassable. If the Minister tells the people who were awarded the tender to repair this road to carry out their work before more money is found to complete the project that would be very good. Fanners will be able to move their produce easily from one place to another, and passengers vehicles will also find it easy to carry out their transportation business.Let me take this chance to thank the Minister and my other colleagues sincerely for supporting this Motion and requesting that it be passed without amendment. We would like the Motion, once passed, to be implemented possibly starting this July. At the moment, the road in question is not in a good state. You will find that instead of people from Kisii coming to Keroka, they go to Oyugis, Kisumu and other places in those directions. This costs more money in terms of bus fare and fuel. The Minister says that this road passes through his constituency, and this means that he, too, is affected by the bad state of the road. The first part of the road, from Chemosit down to Nyamira, is not very good, because only one layer of tarmac is being laid, and this cannot last long. The part of the road from Chemosit down to the nearby river is different If this quality is maintained all the way to Nyamira, this will be good.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. </Newspeech>(Question put and agreed to)ADJOURNMENT<Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi): Hon.
