THAT, the proposal relating to:-(a)	Customs Tariff (b)	Excise Duties (c)	Value Added Tax (d)	Income Tax(e)	Insurance Premium Tax,contained in the Financial Statement for the year of account 1992/93 be approved. </Newspeech><Header>Vote on Account</Header><Newspeech>The Vice-President and Minister for Finance (Mr. Keah): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to give notice of the following Motion.THAT, in accordance with Section 101 of the Constitution of Kenya the withdrawal from the Consolidated Fund of the sum of K£1,170,260,200 made up in the manner set out in the Vote on Account laid in the House be authorised for the purpose of meeting expenditure (His Excellency the President has signified his consent to this Motion)ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS<i>Question No. 282</i><Header>Payment of Mr. Mumbi's Salary</Header>Mr. Falana, on behalf of Mr. Wakole, asked the Minister for Labour:(a)	why Mr. Nathaniel Gwiyo Mumbi, P/No. 506388, currently stationed at Ngao Hospital in Tana River District not been paid his resultant arrears from 12th August, 1986 after the adjustment of his salary from J/G. "A" to "C" vide the Ministry's Pay Change Advice No. 631/89/R dated 17th January, 1989; and(b)	whether the Ministry could pay Mr. Mumbi his resultant house allowance arrears from 20th November, 1988 to 30th November, 1989 as per the Ministry's Pay Change Advice No. CP/439/89.<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Health (Mr. Ogur): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a)	The Minister regrets that there has been a delay in paying Mr. Nathaniel Gwiyo Mumbi his salary arrears. However, the Ministry is taking the necessary steps to have these arrears paid along with this year's June salary.(b)	I am afraid to state that the delay in paying Mr. Mumbi his resultant house allowance arrears was due to two conflicting Pay Change Advices (P.C.As) to the same effect from Coast Province. However, arrears amounting to Kshs.4,680.00 have now been paid along with Mr. Mumbi's May salary. All is well that ends well, Mr. Speaker, Sir.May I state that in the month of June every year, we usually pay people earlier compared to other months. He will be paid his salary very soon and he will not have to wait until the end of June. We normally do that for everybody. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Falana: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Assistant Minister has said that they pay these arrears every month of June. I wonder how many "Junes" have passed since 1986 because the claimant has not been paid his dues? Since he confesses that the delay has been there and that they are going to pay in June, could he go further and tell the House what has caused this delay? Let him count using his fingers and tell us how many "Junes" have passed without the Ministry taking any action. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Speaker, Sir, what language can I use now? I said that we regret about the whole thing because from 1986 to date, is actually a long period. Conflicting P.C.As at the provincial level caused the delay and we regret about it. We have already paid him - during the month of May - the whole of his arrears and the other monies will be paid at the end of June. The end of June is not actually 30th June, but much earlier than the dead end of it. </Newspeech><i>Question No. 172 </i><Header>Support for Dispensaries in Uasin-Gishu</Header>Mr. A.H.O. Momanyi, on behalf of Dr. Misoi, asked the Minister for Health:(a)	whether he is aware that people of Simat, Chepyagwai and Chagaiya have initiated the establishment of dispensaries to serve the outlying areas; and(b)	since the Uasin-Gishu DDC has limited resources, what financial support the Ministry is providing these important health facilities.<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Health (MR. OGUR): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I BEG TO REPLY.(a)	Yes, the Minister has been made aware that the people of Simat, Chepyagwai and Chagaiya have initiated the establishment of dispensaries to serve their areas.(b)	Harambee efforts such as the ones displayed above by the communities mentioned will be supported financially as long as they are in line with the Ministry's and DDC's priorities and subject to the availability of funds. Funds are normally made available to the Ministry through the normal budgetary cycle.I am, therefore, very pleased to inform the hon. Member that in the financial year 1991/92 Kshs.97,000.00 has been set aside to aid Chagaiya Dispensary which appears in the list of DDC's priority. I am afraid that Chepyagwai and Simat Dispensaries, which do not seem to appear in the list of the Eldoret DDC priority, will have to wait for another year. I would, however, advise the community concerned that if it wants to run the two dispensaries, the Ministry of Health would be quite pleased to find other ways of co-operating with it. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kubo: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think that when the Assistant Minister was giving his main answer, he forgot that the 1991/92 financial year is just ending. Could he tell the House whether that money has actually been spent? He says that some money has been spent on one of those dispensaries. Has this really happened or does it just appear on paper? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we allocate money for a project, we normally engage and commit that money. So, the money I am talking about is already committed in many ways to be spent on various dispensaries, such as Seme, Korogate, Dayana, Risa, Dosi and others. These projects are going on. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kubo: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. This money was allocated, and this is not guesswork. We now want the Assistant Minister to tell the House whether the money that was allocated to one of these dispensaries was actually allocated and utilised. We have seen many cases in the past where money is allocated on paper, but is never released to the intended projects. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did not get the exact amount of money already spent, the remaining balance, and where this balance is kept. In any case, we allocated funds in the 1991/92 financial year, the tendering level has been passed and work has already started. This is an on-going project and if there is any shortage realised in the course of construction or otherwise, we will keep on looking for more funds to ensure that the whole project is completed. If there is any shortage of money in future, perhaps due to building materials being more costly than planned, we will not abandon the project. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. arap Soi: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if this project has already been started, this means that some money must have been received. Could the Assistant Minister tell the House how much money has been paid to the project contractor and how much the balance is? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I gave this information in the reply I gave just a little bit earlier on, but let me go back and say that total amount of Sh.97,000/= was allocated in the 1991/92 financial year. However, it is not possible to complete the construction of a dispensary or a health centre within one calendar year. The tendering process, for example, takes a bit of time as do a few other things. Once money is allocated for projects, I do not necessarily keep the exact figures in my mind. We pay contractors in bits according to the work completed. We pay them some money when they finish building the foundation; pay another bit after roofing is completed, and another bit before a certificate of completion is issued. However, I do not now have these figures being asked for. All I want to tell this House is that Sh.97,000/= was allocated for this project and work will go on until the project is completed. If the hon. Member wants the figures relating to what was spent on the foundation, the walls, the windows and the roof, I can provide them later, but this was not requested for in the original Question to my Ministry. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Soi: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I once visited a project in Kakamega and found that although the project had not yet been started, money had already been paid out. Could the Assistant Minister tell us whether in this case, the foundation has been built? If so, has this work been paid for, and if so, how much money has been spent so far? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Speaker, Sir, talking specifically about Chepyagwai Dispensary, the building to be used is already there, but is not yet equipped. I do not know how much money has been spent so far. In addition, there is no water available in the dispensary yet, and I do not know how much money is still remaining for supplying water to the institution. There are also no staff houses, and I can give the sum of money to be spent in the construction of these houses when this is asked as a Question. Although it is a little related to the present Question, it is still not part of it. The local district development committee does not have this dispensary in its list of priority projects, but we have already taken it up as a project. </Newspeech><i>Question No. 243 </i><Header>Release of Teachers Results</Header>Mr. Falana, on behalf of Mr. Lotim, asked the Minister for Education what has delayed the release of the . results of the teachers who undertook in-service training course at Chewoyet Secondary School between 1987 and1990.<Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Is anyone here from the Ministry of Education? We will leave this Question until the end. </Newspeech><i>Question No. 281 </i><Header>Reasons for Sacking Mr. Mudenyo</Header>Mr. arap Kirwa asked the Minister for Labour: -(a)	whether he is aware that on 11th September, 1991, Haraka Hosiery Manufacturers Ltd., of P. O. Box 78045, Nairobi, terminated the services of Mr. George Mudenyo and no dues were paid to him;(b)	whether he is further aware that the said company does not remit N.S.S.F. deductions to the Fund; and(c)	what action he will take to ensure that Mr. Mudenyo is paid his dues and further that the company remits the said deductions.<Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Is anyone here from the Ministry of Labour? We will leave this Question until the end. </Newspeech><i>Question No. 203 </i><Header>Concrete Floors for Sokomjinga Market</Header>Mr. arap Kirwa, on behalf of Mr. Ndirangu, asked the Minister for Local Government what plans there are to put permanent concrete floors in the open air and Sokomjinga markets in Nyeri Town.<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Local Government (Mr. Wagura): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Nyeri Municipality has no immediate plan to put concrete floors in the said markets because it does not have money for this. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. arap Kirwa: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the Assistant Minister is making a very big mistake because it does not necessarily mean that money for this work has to be there now. What plans, either short-term or long-term, does the Ministry have regarding these markets? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wagura: Mr. Speaker, Sir, due to unavailability of money, the municipality has no intention of doing that job, but the Ministry and themunicipality are looking for funds for establishment of wholesale and retail markets in Nyeri Town. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kubo: Surely, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Nyeri Municipal Council collects revenue from wananchi who are doing their business in these markets. Could the Assistant Minister tell the House what benefits these wananchi get in return for the taxes they pay to the Council? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wagura: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the money the municipality has collected has already been committed to more highly-prioritised projects in the area. However, as I have said before, the Ministry and the municipality are looking for funds. The market I have mentioned will cost Sh.5.8 million to build. The World Bank had agreed to give us this money but, all of a sudden, they declined to go ahead and do so. We are now looking for other donors because this is a big project and the money collected by Nyeri Municipality is not adequate. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. arap Kirwa: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the Minister tell the House where the revenue collected by the municipality goes? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wagura: Mr. Speaker, Sir, you will agree with me that this is quite a different question. The hon. Questioner wants to know whether we are going to put concrete floors in the markets in question, and I have just given an answer in this regard. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kubo: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think the Assistant Minister is evading the question. The point here is that the people are paying a service charge. For what services are they paying if there is no improvement? That is the question being asked by hon. Kirwa and I am repeating the same question. What services are they providing? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wagura: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have just told the House what we are trying to do to have that market moved. Hon. Members are asking irrelevant supplementary questions and I think I have answered the main Question adequately. </Newspeech></Newspeech>Mr. Falana: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the hon. Assistant Minister really in order to say that hon. Members are raising irrelevant questions? I think hon. Members who are asking these questions are very much in order. We know that there is no money. The Front Bench is always telling us things will be done "when money becomes available." I do not think it will cost a lot of money to put a permanent concrete floor in an open air market. What hope have these Nyeri people left With? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wagura: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are looking for donors so that we can construct a wholesale and a retail market in Nyeri Town. Although the World Bank declined to give the money immediately we are prepared to go further and look for funds. But currently, we do not have that kind of money. </Newspeech>                                        <i>Question No. 243 </i><Header>Release of Teachers’ Results</Header>Mr. Falana, on behalf of Mr. Lotim, asked the Minister for Education what has delayed the release of the results of the teachers who undertook in-service training course at Chewoyet Secondary School between the year 1987-1990. <Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Health (Mr. Ogur): Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Minister for Education, I beg to reply.The results of teachers who undertake the in- service course are based on three sets of grades and those grades are as follows:The final written examination, continuous assessment grade from teacher colleges and correspondence course grades from the College of Education and External Studies.The 202 untrained teachers who undertook the in-service course between 1987 and 1990 at Chewoyet Secondary School delayed in submitting their correspondence course assignments to the College of Education and External Studies. This is why the Ministry of Education has delayed releasing their results. The correspondence grades of the same were received by the Kenya National Examinations Council on 14th April, 1992. The processing has commenced and the results will be released as soon as they are ready. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Falana: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in his answer, the hon. Assistant Minister says that the 202 untrained teachers delayed in submitting their assignments to the College of Education and External Studies. I think someone has got to be held responsible for that delay. We are talking about a large number of teachers and it is not convincing at all to tell us that they all delayed in submitting their assignments. Could the Assistant Minister elaborate further and tell us who was responsible for this delay? I am sure it is not the teachers who caused the delay. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we do not know exactly who caused the delay. But the whole process of delay starts when a file goes missing. It is a known fact that when a file goes missing for even a day, the result is a delay. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wambua: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is not telling us the truth. When teachers go for in-service training they submit whatever they are supposed to submit to the examiners and the examiners start processing their results immediately. Four years is a very long delay. Either the Ministry of Education or the Kenya National Examinations Council caused the delay. Could the Assistant Minister tell us how the delay occurred? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already stated that it is the whole sequence of events. I have not identified one individual. It is not possible to process papers from 202 teachers in one hour; it takes time and this may cause delay. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: From 1987 to 1990 is about four years and there was a delay somewhere. Could the Assistant Minister tell us where this delay occurred? <Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was a delay between the original place up to the end at the headquarters of the finalising of the whole exercise. There is no individual to be blamed for the delay. <Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Falana: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. This "is the danger of the so called collective responsibility, where hon. Members just stand up to read answers without any background information to help them answer supplementary questions. Is the hon. Ogur, even in order to attempt to answer this Question? Definitely the teachers were not responsible for the delay. The hon. Questioner brought this Question here as a result of complaints from the affected teachers. This shows that the teachers themselves were not responsible for the delay. If hon. Ogur does not have the answer let him say so and we will wait for the Minister for Education to come and answer the Question. Could he tell us who has been punishing these teachers all these years? Mhe. Ogur kama huna jawabu tafadhali sema hivyo! <Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sentiments expressed ,by the hon. Member may form one of the reasons for the delay. The argument here is over who was responsible for the delay. We have not been able to identify the person responsible for the delay because we are dealing with a sequence of events, starting from the teachers up to the headquarters of the Ministry. Processing of examinations takes time; computers may break down and cause delays. Delay is acceptable. <Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kyonda: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister says that delay is acceptable. To who? To you or to the teachers?Such a large number of teachers cannot be responsible for this delay. If the Assistant Minister has no answer, he should say so. Who is responsible for the deay? <Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Speaker, Sir, hon. Members must agree that the answer does not necessarily have to be a "yes." In this particular case the answer is "no". We have no particular individual whom we can pin down in connection with this delay. The delay is acceptable. <Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Falana: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the hon. Assistant Minister in order to glorify failures in the Government system? I ask this because delay is a failure if it is not justified. Is he in order to glorify failures in the Government system? <Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: The Ministry of Education has no syllabus for delays and delay cannot be referred to as failure. <Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kubo: Mr. Speaker, Sir, by April this year the Ministry had received all the papers. Could the Assistant Minister tell the House when they are going to give the final results to the teachers? When are these teachers actually going to get their results? What is the position as of now? <Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have pooled all our resources and efforts together and more hands have been engaged in this exercise. I therefore hope the hon. Member will be more patient so that he can see the results. <Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Soi: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I may not be in order, but with your guidance, I want to know who answers points of order. Is it the responsibility of Ministers or the Speaker? On several occasions I have noticed that Ministers answer points of order, whereas I thought it is indeed, the Speaker, who should answer points of order. <Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Hon. Members, when an hon. Member stands on a point of order, he draws the attention of the Chair to something that has been done, which should have not be done. Sometimes the Chair may allow the Minister who was contributing to elaborate and hopefully clarify the matter at hand. If a point of order is directed clearly to the Chair, for instance, "Mr. Speaker, can you give us a ruling on this?", that is when the Chair must give a ruling. Otherwise, hon. Members have been. standing on points of order which call upon further clarification by the hon. Member of the Front Bench. There is no harm done when hon. Ogur tries to deal with the point of order raised by the hon. Member. <Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Soi: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. My understanding, as per the Standing Orders, is that points of order are raised directly to the Speaker who answers them. Of late, I have noticed that hon. Members stand on points of order only to ask supplementary questions, which are answered by Ministers. That is not actually a point of order. Points of order are directed to you, Mr. Speaker, and you give the answers to them, and not the Ministers. <Newspeech>(Noise)<Newspeech>Mr. Falana: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. <Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Soi: I am on a point of order, Mr. Falana Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is my understanding according to our Standing Orders. <Newspeech><Newspeech> Mr. Speaker: Order! Hon. Soi, your understanding is all right, but you will appreciate the fact that the Chair has 6n several occasions said that a lot of points of order are really raised as supplementary questions, which you have' pinpointed. When an hon. Member stands up on a point of order and then puts a supplementary question, the Chair allows the hon. Members of the Front Bench to deal with it. If the Chair were, every now and then, to stand up and correct hon. Members, the work of the House would be bogged down. I, therefore, do appreciate and understand the difficulties that some of you may have when an hon. Member rises on a point of order and then he continues to put a supplementary question. I have urged hon. Members now and then to study the Standing Orders. If all hon. Members were good students of the Standing Orders, then we would be able to avoid some of these difficulties. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wambua: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It seems as if the Assistant Minister has given no answer to this Question. Even if the assessments were to be done abroad, it would be history in the Ministry of Education for teachers' results to be delayed for a period of four years. If the delay was caused by the Ministry of Education, can we be assured that these teachers will get their salaries in arrears including the years that have been wasted. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member knows very well that before the papers are marked, there are definitely those teachers who will either fail or pass and this is determined by a student's performance. Nobody would give them a grade if they do not satisy examiners. We usually give salaries to the individual based on whether they have passed or failed the examination. We cannot, therefore, say that they would have passed four years ago before their examination papers have been marked. So, that is not acceptable. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wambua: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the Assistant Minister is in a better position to answer Questions related to "the Ministry of Health rather than those of the Ministry of Education. He is, therefore, misleading the House by answering Questions related to the Ministry of Education because he is not giving the proper answer as to why there was a delay in releasing these teachers' results. This Question has, therefore, not been answered and we demand a proper answer from the Ministry of Education. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the answer has been given to this House satisfactorily that there was a delay and that papers are now being marked. I have also said that the results will be out very soon which will determine those who will have passed and failed. After that the salaries will be determined by the grade one attains in the examination. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Soi: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I was pursuing my point of order when you stood up and answered. If I heard your words clearly, you said that: "You have pointed out that some points of order are types of questions". I, therefore, request you to tell us whichStanding Order differentiates between a point of order and a supplementary question? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Hon. Members, and hon. Soi in particular, I have given a ruling on that and said that sometimes an hon. Member stands on a point of order and then continues to ask a supplementary question which is wrong. When an hon. Member stands up on a point of order, he should strictly raise a point of order and not a supplementary question. It so happens that sometimes hon. Members, instead of dwelling wholly on points of order, divert to supplementary questions. The Chair cannot do much about this but simply draw the hon. Member's attention that he is not raising a point of order. The Chair can also keep quiet to allow an hon. Member in the Front Bench to answer the supplementary question. Hon. Members should study more keenly the meaning of points of order. We must stop there because we have to continue. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Falana: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am shocked by the exchanges that are going on between the Chair and my hon. colleague. You have repeatedly clarified the point in question and every hon. Member here has a copy of the Standing Orders. When hon. Soi repeatedly challenges the ruling that the Speaker gives, it appears as if he has a "hidden agenda" or "some other interests". So, could he declare those interests? </Newspeech>(Noise)<Newspeech>Mr. Kirwa: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. While I share the same sentiments expressed by hon. Falana, I think it is out of order for hon. Falana to say that hon. Soi has got some hidden agenda because that is imputing an improper motive on the part of hon. Soi. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Soi: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker,Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Order! Order, Mr. Soi. Sit down! Next Question, Mr. Twarith. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Twarith: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to apologize for coming late. </Newspeech><I>Question No. 246</I><Header> NUMBER OF POKOTS IN TEACHER COLLEGES<HEADER>Bw.

We will defer that question.(Question deferred)Those Questions which have been asked but could not be answered because the relevant Ministers are not in will all be deferred. </Newspeech><Header>COMMITTEE OF WAYS AND MEANS</Header>(Order for Committee read)MOTION<HEADER>APPROVAL OF TAXATION MEASURES</HEADER><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, Officer of the Vice- President and Minister for Finance (Mr. Keah): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the following Motion:-THAT, the proposals relating to:-(a)	Customs Tariff(b)	Excise Duties(c)	Value Added Tax (VAT)(d)	Income.Tax; and(e)	Insurance Premium Taxcontained in the Financial Statement for the year of Account 1992/93 be approved.(The President's consent to this Motion has been signified)Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year's Budget theme was "Enhanced Economic Reform for Renewed Growth", which means increasing or accelerating the speed of our economic reform in order to obtain higher economic growth. This is a continuation of Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1986 which we have debated so many times and talked about in this House.The Budget theme was formulated in the background of the fact that 1991 was indeed a very difficult year; a year which showed that our growth had, in fact, reduced from 4.4 per cent to 2.2 per cent. Also in that year, the Budget deficits were high; the growth in monetary supply were also high, and there were also high inflation rates.To correct these imbalances, this year's Budget had targeted that the Budget deficit be reduced from 3.5 per cent to 2 per cent. If we were to achieve this control in deficits, we will require to control the growth in money supply as well as lower the rate of inflation. If, in fact, we were to reduce the Budget deficit, it means the demand for funding the deficit will be reduced and hence this will help bring down the pressures on interest rates as well as the inflation itself.To reduce the Budget deficit, therefore, the Budget targeted to reduce the growth of Government expenditure, both Recurrent and Development, and also by increasing or raising taxation. This calls for appropriate physical and monetary policies which were detailed in the Budget speech.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Motion before us seeks approval of this House to give due authority to the taxation measures contained in the Budget speech. Indeed, we want to approve ways and means of raising incomes or Government revenue in order to finance our expenditures. The details, as I have said, are contained in the Budget speech which we have debated here elaborately since the Budget Statement was read.But in summary, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were five taxation measures for which today's Motion seeks approval. On the customs tariff, basically, the measures will lower the cost of raw materials, narrow the disparity in duty rates reduce excessive high rates of protection and make exports competitive. In a nutshell, the customs tariff measures are aimed at giving the Exchequer additional revenue amounting to KSh.95.3 million. The details of exact measures, as I have said, were contained in the Budget speech, and I am sure hon. Members have already read them.In so far as excise duties are concerned, the measures proposed are 5 per cent point increase on alcoholic beverages and 5 per cent point reduction in soft drinks. This measure, in fact, will give the Exchequer an additional revenue of KSh.3 million.The third measure is the changes in the Value Added Tax (VAT). Here the measures incorporate the restructuring of the tax rates so that the number of VAT rates is reduced from eight to six, and this should help in the administration of that tax. It will also increase the revenue. The highest rate is lowered from 100 per cent to 75 per cent, and 35 and 25 per cent rates are discounted and introduced in a new rate of 30 per cent. The details of these measures are contained in the Budget speech and should help raise a total of KSh.46.4 million to the Exchequer.The fourth item is in the Income Tax measure, Mr. Speaker, Sir. There has been an adjustment for inflation and to enhance growth of output and investment. We need investment from individuals in order to make funds available for purposes of industrial expansion. They relate or include single family reliefs which have been increased by about 10 per cent, as well as the as the tax brackets by about 15 per cent. The top marginal tax rate for individuals has been lowered from 45 to 40 per cent. This proposal in income tax will, in fact, reduce revenue, and this is a cost to the Exchequer of KSh.30.8 million.The fifth one is a miscellaneous aspect incorporating insurance premiums tax as well as vehicle registration and licence fees,and tax on all insurance premiums with (Jistribution limits of up to 30 per cent of the surplus statutory licence insurance fund. This measure is intended or aimed at giving the Exchequer a total of K£2.1 million. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these five measures, the details of which I have explained are contained in the Budget Statement, are aimed at giving a combined total revenue to the Exchequer of K£116 million.I want to take this opportunity to urge hon. Members to support and pass this Motion. In doing so, I take this opportunity to invite the august House and hon. Members to debate openly, constructively and come out with any extra suggestions which can be considered by the Treasury in formulating future policies. This is an opportunity to either criticise or encourage, or come up with extra or additional measures they consider fit. After all, the exercise of revenue collection, in other words, the ways and means through which we raise revenue, primarily is the responsibility of the Treasury. This exercise is indeed open to every citizen, including hon. Members of this House and they can make suggestions the way they consider it fit. On our part, we have done the best we could and we believe that when this Motion is passed, the Budget will balance with these revenue measures.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to take this opportunity to commend the revenue commissioners for the manner in which they have continued to assist the economy of this Republic by collecting revenue timely and fairly. I know that there is room for improvement and it is in this aspect that I call upon all the officers of the Government to ensure that every cent is collected timely, correctly and fairly.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to take this opportunity to urge individual taxpayers as well as companies to ensure that they pay what is due to be paid by them. Indeed, I want to go back to the biblical quotation of, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's". This saying is quite appropriate at this moment and I am therefore asking every taxpayer to pay to the Government, the revenue that is due to Government. I am therefore calling upon companies to ensure that they maintain and keep proper books of accounts. I want also to urge firms of auditors to ensure that they carry their duties in auditing the books of accounts correctly and ethically. We have had cases where companies have kept two sets of accounts books, one set for the income tax and the other for the shareholders. I would like to ask these companies to desist from this practice. I would like to take this opportunity to urge all the professionals, both in the accounting profession and in the legal profession, and indeed everybody, to assist the Treasury as much as it is practicable in collecting revenue through measures which we havehereby introduced through this Motion.With those few remarks, I beg to move.The Assistant Minister for Local Government (Mr. Wagura): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to second this Motion. In this Motion, the Government is introducing ways and means of collecting revenue for the development of our nation. Towards this objective, we need a lot of co-operation on the part of those who are charged with the responsibility of collecting tax. I am saying this because we have seen quite a number of cases where the revenue collection has not been done efficiently. It is for this reason that we are calling upon the officers who are trained professionals in the areas of revenue collection to use their skills to ensure that they carry out their duties efficiently. I am saying this because there have been cases where revenue has not been collected. In fact, there have been cases where wananchi have been denied services just because revenue has not been collected.Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we are collecting revenue, we tell wananchi that we are collecting this money render them services. It is for this reason that we should ensure that once the money is collected, it is used for the purposes it is intended. There should not be any case of deviation of funds to services or projects that have not been given priority by Government. If a project has been started and given priority, this money should be used on that project and not on any other project. If we do not do this, we shall be discouraging our people.Having said that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Government for reducing the rate of income tax. This being the case, we do not want to hear after a short time, that the rate of income tax has shot up. Once we have said that we are going to reduce tax in this area, we should stick to that. We have seen cases in the past where after the Budget, mini-budgets have been brought in. We hope that this is not going to be the case after this Budget because it encourages wananchi to start evading tax.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to have stability in the country to be able to collect the necessary revenue. I am saying this because when there is no peace in the country, no money can be collected, and even if it were collected, it would be used haphazardly. It is for this reason I call upon leaders in this country to appreciate the fact that they are leaders today, but tomorrow, there will be other leaders. We have had the unfortunate incidents of tribal clashes in this country. Today, nobody would expect to collect any revenue from the affected areas. It is for this reason that we are calling upon the Government to ensure that the affected people are given time to settle down and gain some momentum in their businesses before we can start thinking of taxing them in any way. This is very important.Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important for the people of this country to be educated on the importance of paying tax. They must be told that if they want to receive any services, they must pay taxes. However, this can only be done under a peaceful atmosphere. Therefore, it is the responsibility of leaders to ensure that there is peace and stability in the country. In this connection, I must say that leaders must take care of their public utterances. I am saying this because we have already seen the sort of damage that has been caused by careless utterances of some leaders in this country. Kenya is one nation and each individual citizen of this country is free to live anywhere he chooses. At the moment, we are carrying out the exercise of registration of voters and it is important that every mwananchi should be allowed to register him or herself. In my constituency, for example, I have many different tribes and I would like to call upon them to register themselves in big numbers because that is where they belong. Whether they are Kalenjins, Kambas, Luhyas, and so on, I have no right to say that they should not register in that area unless I have a hidden agenda.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have seen areas where project implementation has been dragging on for years. I would like to call upon those responsible to implement these projects as soon as possible. I am saying this because when there is a delay in implementing a project, there is a total loss when trying to revive the project. The project may cost twice or thrice the original estimated amount. Why should we allow this to happen?Mr. Speaker, Sir, why should we do that when we have professionals who are doing these jobs? We have planners in this country, but you will find that a project which can be of assistance to this country is not taken seriously. If such a project is implemented it will create jobs. We should not go for non-viable projects in non-viable areas. We have that problem and I hope our planners will come out openly and give priority to those areas which have more potential than others. We are saying that we should start from where we can earn more and from this, promote the semi-arid areas. But if we start with the semi-arid areas when we have potentially good areas then we are not good planners. So, I am calling upon our planners to ensure that the available funds are utilised properly.When answering Questions here we say projects would be implemented when funds become available; it is true that if we do not have funds we cannot implement projects. But, as I said before, we are asking our officers, even those in the local authorities, to be aggressive and collect revenue where it is due. We know we can collect much more if our people were patriotic. Patriotism has lost meaning in  this country, but we are calling upon our people to be more patriotic so that we can develop this country together. I know a few of our people are doing a good job and we commend them. But I still feel that much more can be done, and we are calling upon our people to love their country and do their best for it.With those few remarks, I beg to second. </Newspeech>(Question proposed)<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Home Affairs and National Heritage (Mr. Lalampaa): Ahsantc sana, Bw. Spika. Ninasimama kuiunga Hoja hii mkono. Ni kawaida kwa Bunge hili kuhalalisha kodi zote ambazo zimependekezwa katika Bajeti. Wakenya wanamshukuru Makamu wa Rais na Waziri wa Fedha kwa kuhukikisha kwamba bidhaa muhimu hazikuongezwa bei. Kodi ambayo tunahaldlisha haiwezi kumdhuru inwananchi wa kawaida yule mama na mzee ambao wako mashainbani. Kodi hii italipwa na watu ambao wana mapato ambayo yanawawezesha kuilipa kodi hii.Tunaweza kujadili mambo mengi ya kimaendeleo ambayo yanaweza kutimizwa kutokana na kodi hii. Lakini hatuwezi kuzungumza juu ya maendeleo katika nchi hii, au katika nchi nyingine yoyote, kama hakuna amani. Kile tunachotaka ni wananchi wa nchi hii kuendeleakuishi kwa amani ili tywcze kuendelea kutimiza miradi ya maendeleo. Inasikitisha kuona kwainba viongozi wa upinzani wanataka kuleta inchafuko katika nchi hii. Viongozi hawa wamesahau kwamba ikiwa fujo, matata, taabu na balaa vitatokea katika nchi hii wao pia hawatabaki. Viongozi hawa, ambao wanataka kuleta fujo katika nchi hii na hali wanataka kuongoza, ni sawa na mtu anayepanda mti, kulikalia tawi lake na kuanza kulikata tawi hilo hilo kwa panga. Bila shaka tawi lile litaanguka pamoja na mtu huyo na kumuuiniza. Kwa hivyo, taabu wanayotaka kuiletea Kenya haitawadhuru watu fulani na kuwaacha watu wengine; ni taabu ambayo itamwadhiri kila Mkenya.Mimi namshukuru Rais kwa kujitoa mhanga kuiongoza nchi hii. Hii ni kwa sababu bara zima la Afrika limekabiliwa na shida za watu kuzozana kwa sababu ya uongozi. Jirani zetu hapa Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan na kwingineko walipata uhuru sawa na Kenya lakini ikawa kila mtu anataka ukubwa. Ukweli utabaki kwamba haiwezekani kila mtu kuwa Rais katika nchi hii. Kwa hivyo, wale wanaoongoza wakati huu wanastahili kupewa nafasi ili waendelee kufanya hivyo.Bw. Spika, nchi hii inakabiliwa na ukosefu wa vyakula na vitu vingine. Ukosefu huu unatokana na ukweli kwamba wakimbizi wengi wameingia Kenya kwa sababu nchi zao zina matatizo. Nchi hii ina wakimbizi zaidi ya nusu milioni waliotorokea hapa kwa sababu tuna amani. Itakuaje kwa wageni kukimbilia nchi yetu kwa sababu kuna amani hapa na hali sisi tunataka kuiharibuamani hiyo?Kwa hivyo, itakuwa ni jambo la busara ikiwa viongozi wa dini na wale wa upinzani wataelewa. Bunge hili ndilo lililobadilisha kifungu cha 2(a) ili kuruhusu nchi hii iwe na vyama zaidi ya kimoja. Sasa tuko katika kiwango cha vyama vingi vya kisiasa katika nchi hii, na kitu kinachohitajika si kutafuta uongozi kwa fujo au kuwasingizia watu wengine mambo yasiyo ya haki. Kwa kawaida, ikiwa unaenda kupigania uchaguzi, huendi kutusi watu wengine au kuwafanyia watu wengine fujo. Ni lazima uwe na lugha ya kuwabembeleza wananchi ili uweze kuchaguliwa. Hawa viongozi wa upinzani wana nafasi ya kupigania uchaguzi na tikiti za chama chao bila kuchochea matata katika nchi hii kwa sababu hiyo hailasaidia chochote.Bw. Spika, ni jambo la kushangaza kwamba hawa viongozi wa vyama vya upinzani hawajafanya uchaguzi mpaka leo. Hata ukiangalia, wamekuwa wakisumbua chama cha Kanu wakitaka tushirikiane. Je, tutashirikiana nao namna gani ikiwa tumefanya uchaguzi wetu katika kila tawi na wao hawana kibali cha wananchi kuwawakilisha? Mtu anasimama tu na kusema yeye ndiye mwenyekiti wa mahali fulani wa chama cha FORD, DP, KENDA, SDP na hata chama cha mtu mmoja anayeitwa Gakonya. Hata kuna wengine kama Anyona ambaye ameshindwa kutaja mtu wa pili katika chama chake. Hata hivyo, tunawaomba wafanye uchaguzi ili wapate kibali cha wananchi ili waweze kushirikiana na kupingana na Kanu ambayo ina kibali cha wananchi. Viongozi wa Kanu wanajulikana ni nani mwenyekiti wa tawi fulani, katibu, mweka hazina na kadhalika. Kwa hivyo, yafaa viongozi wa upinzani wafanye uchaguzi na ikiwa wanaogopa kufanya hivyo wakae na wawaambie wananchi kwamba wameogopa. Ni mpaka lini wataendelea kushikilia viti kama maofisa wa muda? Je, wataenda katika uchaguzi namna gani ikiwa hawajachaguana katika vyama vyao? Kwa hivyo, wakati umewadia wafanye uchaguzi ili waweze kushirikiana na kushindana na Kanu wakiwa na kibali cha wananchi.Zaidi ya hayo, Bw. Spika, tunahitaji amani katika nchi hii, na amani inaweza tu kudumu ikiwa viongozi katika nchi hii, wawe kiongozi wa Kanu au wa Vyama vya upinzani, watashirikiana. Ni jambo la kushangaza kwamba ile kamati ya uchunguzi ya NCCK iliandika mambo yasiyo ya kweli na kuyatangaza hata kabla ya Kamati Teule ya Bunge haijamaliza kazi yake. Tunaamini Kamati Teule ya Bunge italeta ripoti yao ili tujue ni kitu gani kimeharibika na wapi. Hatutakubali ripoti ya NCCK ambayo nia yake ni kuharibu majina ya watu. Watu ni lazima wawaheshimu wale wengine hata kama ni wa vyama vya upinzani. Hata katika mikutano ya vyama vya upinzani hawana la kuwaambia wananchi ila kutukana Kanu, Serikali na Rais wa nchi hii. Inaonekana kwamba wameishiwa kisiasa; hawana tena la kuwaambia watu wa nchi hii. They have no better economic and political policies for their own parties.Kwa hayo machache, Bw. Spika, naunga mkono. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Malebe: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute on this Motion. First of all, I would like to thank President Moi for having attended the Earth Summit in Brazil because the attendance of Kenya to that conference was an indication that we have to look after the future health and welfare of this country. If we allow our atmosphere to be polluted, particularly now that we have a hole in the ozone layer somewhere in the Antarctica, then we will allow sun rays to come direct to the earth. When that happens, we shall all perish together with our forests, animals and everything else and there will be no more world. So, I think the attendance by the Kenya delegation to the Earth Summit was an indication that we have to look after the welfare of our country. We should always be ahead of other countries in Africa, and this is a step forward in improving our environment.Mr. Speaker, Sir, looking at the way the opposition is treating the affairs of this country they are doing so as if they do not know what Kenya is. They are making utterances anyhow as if they have never been in the Government of Kenya while they are actually defectors from the Government. They know thfc policies of Kenya. I was surprised two weeks ago when they said that they would take this House to court. I think they are dreaming because this is the supreme House in this country; it is above them. So, I do not even understand what they mean by taking the House to court. I would still go with what hon. Lalampaa has said, that these people have nothing to say. They are just uttering words here and there because they have no material to give to this country. Instead of talking about the development of the rural people, they are just looking for power. While they are looking for power, the rural people continue to suffer. The opposition is taking the opportunity of convincing the mral people with lies, particularly in this report on ethnic clashes which was announced by them the other day. I would like the opposition to wait; they should join us in developing our country and in improving the welfare of our people instead of just insulting and, at the same time, ridiculing this Government. We know that this Government is being run properly. We depend and live on it. You cannot be like a colobus monkey which, when it is fed, urinates on the remnants so that another one cannot eat them. So, the time has come when the opposition should work within the constitutional framework.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we know very well that the Electoral Commission is properly constituted. Now, do they have another constitution of their own to claim that (he Electoral Commission should be disbanded? It was constituted through the proper procedure and the commissioners should be" allowed to complete their term.There have been some instances in Tigania, where mhe. Karauri comes from, where some members of the opposition have gone as far as stealing voting cards to go and write whatever nonsense they can on them and then take them to the newspaper people to prove that entries are being made on the cards wrongly. The Electoral Commission should be able to arrest some of these bad elements because this is one way of trying to create chaos. There has been an arrest in Meru and the Government should look into these culprits who want to ruin the system. The wananchi are registering properly but since the opposition wants to ridicule this Government, they had to spoil an election card and take it to the Press to prove that the cards are being tampered with.On the 10th of this month, there was a shooting by the administration police in my constituency. These policemen shot seven helpless women in a chief's baraza and they have not been arrested up to now. The Government simply transferred them to another chiefs camp. Anybody who uses his gun wrongly should be arrested by the police. I understand, through my own investigation, that the administration policemen who shot at these women did so under the influence of bhang smoking. Since the same policemen had a rape case pending in court, they had vowed to go and shoot around. This incident took place in the presence of a sub-chief. The Commissioner of Police should order that those policemen be put in cells while investigations are going on. I know that investigations are being carried out by the C.I.D. in Meru. The culprits are walking around and if they are not arrested, they will go on shooting people.I will now touch on projects in my constituency. For instance, we have a bridge called Majera on Road E813, that is, from Maua to Kadthini. This bridge has been left uncompleted for the last two years because funds allocated to it have always been squandered. More money was allocated during the financial year but the bridge has still not been completed. Possibly some more money will be allocated to this bridge during the next financial year - 1992/93. I urge the Minister for Public Works to see to it that that bridge is completed immediately before the allocated funds are squandered by the Ministry.I would also like to thank the Government for having established Nyambene Sub-district We would now like the Treasury to open an office IB Maua so that the wananchi do not have to travel long distances to Meru Town for services. I would also urge the Electoral Commission to look into the boundaries of Maua Town Council so that polling stations can be located in areas where there are no controversies. We have two voter registration centres which are right on the boundary, and wananchi have not been told exactly where they will be voting. For instance, will they vote in the Maua Town Council area or in the Meru Town Council area?Since I came to this Parliament, I have been requesting that Maua Town be served by an automatic telephone exchange. The Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation have installed a telephone exchange and a generator, but the machine in question has not been installed. Since Maua Town is the headquaters of a sub-district, an automatic telephone exchange should be installed immediately. I urge the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation to install this facility urgently to enable the district officer I (DO) and possibly the district commissioner (DC) - in future - to communicate with Nairobi and the outside world.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Tourism and Wildlife (Mr. AwoH): Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is necessary, of course, that we must give authority to the Exchequer to celled funds in order to give services to the wananchi. Our economy is in very serious problems at the moment and it is hardly possible for it to grow when interest rates are so high. At present the situation is very difficult for everybody. Apart from the interest rates being very high, there is already a very tight credit squeeze coupled by the fact that there are reduced foreign exchange earnings, the result of which is a very high cost of living for everybody, but more so for the small man. The small person's interest is to have enough to eat, shelter and to be able to afford medicine when he falls sick, and to pay school fees for the children. This is very difficult at present.When you take the small indigenous entrepreneur, where restricted credits from the banks are concerned and where debtors are now taking 90 to 120 days to pay, these makes it impossible for him to continue with his business. When this happens, it means that those few entrepreneurs that have been employing our people will start laying off workers. When they do this, they increase unemployment. When there is unemployment, there will be inability by the Exchequer to collect the taxes that are required to give services to wananchi. I had hoped to see the easing of bureaucracy in the Finance .Bill. Licensing is very cumbersome, Mr. Speaker, Sir. When you make things which should be a right of the citizen difficult, then you bring temptation to people to bring about corruption. Excessive control is the real temptation of corruption. Our economy is in a real serious problem. At times of economic difficulties, with a very large force of people being unemployed, many countries throughout history have utilised their major resources to undertake public works.It is a long time since our railway was built 90 years back but we still have one railway line. This is the time when we should marshal our major resources to put the many unemployed people in work to build a second and third railway lines. The same thing applies to highways and dams. History tells us that at a time when Italy was in difficulties, Italians built hydro-electric power sources and highways. Germany did the same. Even after the great crash of the stock exchange in the United States of America during the recession, Americans utilised their major resources to marshal and mobilise many unemployed people to do public works.At a time like this, we also should weigh whether it is sensible to put a lot of money in a building such as the one for the N.S.S.F., with Shs.2 billion, rather than utilise this money to pay the unemployed to build infrastructure. Similarly, there are many other buildings where public funds have been utilised, such as Bima House, in Kisumu, and the one for the Kerio Valley Development Authority, in Eldoret. This is the time when such money should be utilised to pay the unemployed to do public works. We can use our misfortune to build up infrastructure so that when our economy improves, we shall already have strong infrastructure.Once again, I would like to touch on a section of our community that tends to be neglected from time to time, and that is the disabled. It is only His Excellency the President who tends to give serious consideration to this issue. Many times, we have to import technical aids for the disabled because they are not available locally. Why should there be duly on such things? Why should it be that every time we have to import technical aids for the disabled, we have to go seeking for duty exemption? It is about time a permanent legal notice was published to show that whenever the disabled require to buy either special vehicles, wheel-chairs, and so on, they automatically get them duty-free. As it stands now, we have to go to the Treasury to seek for exemption of duly on such imports. This process is so slow that by the time we clear it, demurrage exceeds even the value of the duty-exemption that is given. It is time that the disabled were placed in policy-making positions because it is only they who understand their own difficulties.Imagine, for instance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we have the National Trust for the Disabled which was set up by His Excellency the President, and not a single disabled person sits on this Trust. This is incredible. All trustees are able-bodied people who have no idea at all of the difficulties of the disabled, and it is high time these things were changed.[Mr. Speaker left the Chair][The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi) took the Chair]If they are not changed, the disabled will always be dissatisfied and feel that they are cheated. At the moment, they do not feel that the Fund that was established is being utilised totally for their benefit. Instead, they feel that there is some use of funds in areas that do not help them.In fact, I would go further and state that I can only hope that one day a disabled person will be nominated a Member of Parliament so that the disabled may be represented in the House and express their feelings through that representative. In this way, they will have a national voice. The number of letters those of us who are involved in the rehabilitation of the disabled receive from the disabled all round makes us feel that they would like to go into business, and yet they cannot raise sufficient funds to do so. This is incredible.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, with those few remarks, I be to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Home Affairs and National Heritage (Mr. Bidu): Mr. Temporary, Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to support this Motion. Before I give my points, I would like to thank the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for having come out with a reasonable Budget for the mwananchi.In supporting this Motion, I would like to touch on value added tax (VAT). I would request the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance to remember that we have five-bed or 10-bed hotels in rural areas where VAT should not be charged. There are wananchi who are unable to foot the normal bills charged by these hotels. If VAT is put on top of the normal hotel bills, the resultant charges will be such that the common mwananchi cannot afford to pay them.I have observed that retired officers have income tax deducted from their monthly pensions. What is surprising is that such officers pay income tax when they are still working and yet when they get their lump sum pension on retirement, more income tax is deducted. This is repetitive. So, we request the Office of the Vice- President and Ministry of Finance to look into this matter. A pensioner will already have paid a lot of income tax during his working life. So, the pension he gets on retirement should be tax-free because tax will have already been charged on the same money.Let me touch on non-governmental organisations (NGOs) too. We have NGO's in the country which are helping the country in running many projects. You may find that an NGO has been given a car from abroad, but when this car arrives at Kilindini Harbour, the NGO concerned is asked to pay a certain tax on it I think this is unfair because this car is given by donors to help our Republic. So, I kindly request that the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance thinks about this issue and allows NGOs to bring in such things free of charge. You will find that many NGOs have many such cars stored at Kilindini, and, in the end, they are sold at very cheap prices.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the non¬governmental organizations are doing a good job and they should be given the assistance they need. Muslims are doing a very good job at the Coast. We get donations from Islamic countries. Sometimes we get generators, cars and even dates, but we are told to pay some duty on these donations or gifts at the port So, you will find that Muslims sometimes face problems because they do not have the money with which they could clear the goods with the Customs. I request the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance to help Muslims.On the current exercise of registration of voters, I would like to say that although the exercise kicked off well, it is very slow. I would like to request our able Government to instruct the district officers to convene barazas and educate the wananchi on the importance of registering as voters. Some people in the rural areas do not know that registration of voters is currently being undertaken in this country. So, village elders, chiefs, assistant chiefs and district officers should hold regular barazas and enlighten the rural folks on the importance of registering as voters.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I request the Government to be very vigilant. This is because some of the aspiring candidates in the next general election are transporting people from one area to another so that they may register as voters. This is a very shameful act. A person who wants to be elected Member of Parliament should not engage in such a shameful act as transporting people from one area to another. The Government should be more vigilant so that we may get properly elected representatives. We do not want bogus people to be elected as Members of Parliament by using people from other areas to vote for them. Registration of voters is very important. I would like to suggest that Kanu people should start selling party cards at the registration centres so that people can get thetn easily. In this way we will be able to recruit many people into the party.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, registration officials should not stay in one particular place all the time. Some registration centres arc very nearer market places. Since we need more people to register as voters, we should request those registration officials to go near the people. If they know that it is a market day, they should not be ashamed of going to the market and registering more people as voters.On health, I would like to say that we have a lot of problems. There are no drugs in our hospitals and especially at the Coast General Hospital. People are not attended to properly and the hospital is filthy. I request the Ministry to do everything within its power to make sure that this hospital, which is a provincial hospital, is kept as clean as possible. The situation in the mortuary is horrible. The mortuary at the Coast General Hospital is filthy and it stinks a lot.Finally, I would like to thank His Excellency the President for the good speech which he has delivered just now at the Airport upon his arrival from Brazil. 1 would advise the opposition to heed the President's words.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Information and Broadcasting (Mr. Nassir): Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipa nafasi hii ili nisemc machache kuhusu Hoja hii. Kazi kubwa ya Ofisi ya Makamu wa Rais na Wizara ya Fedha ni kujaribu kukusanya pesa ili kutuwezesha kuyaendesha mambo ya nchi yetu na hasa kuwasaidia wale ambao hawajiwezi. Wakati Serikali Inapoyapanga makadirio na matumizi ya pesa ni lazima mambo ya afya na elimu ya watu welu yapewe nafasi ya kwanza. Kuna sehemu ambazo hazina nguvu za umeme na yafaa sehemu kama hizo zilikiriwe. Vile vile kuna shida ya ukosefu wa kazi ambayo ni lazima iangaliwe vizuri.Tumefanya maendeleo mengi katika nchi hii. Tumejenga barabara nzuri na pia tuna madaraja mengi ambayo ni mazuri sana. Lakini ukweli ni kwamba mwananchi wa kawaida anazidi kutaabika kutokana na ukosefu wa dawa katika.hospitali zetu. Watu wakienda hospitali wanapewa vibarua ili waende kununua dawa. Watu huhudhuria hospitali za Serikali kwa sababu wao ni maskini na hawana pesa. Hospitali nyingine hazina mashine kama vile X-Ray na kadhalika. Hospitali kuu ya Mkoa wa Pwani haina vifaa vya kufanyia upasuaji. Kwa hivyo ni, lazima afya ya watu wetu ifikiriwe kwanza badala ya kujenga majumba m;ikubwa, barabara na madaraja. Mamilioni ya pesa yanalumiwa katika ujenzi wa barabara katika nchi hii. Sisemi kwamba hilo ni jambo baya. Ninachosema ni kwamba ni lazima kwanza tuzitatue shida zinazomkabili mwananchi wa kawaida.Siku hizi tunatoa pesa nyingi kuwaelimisha watoto wetu, kuanzia shule ya msingi hadi chuo kikuu. Tumekubali kutoa kodi za kila aina ili watoto wetu waweze kusoma. Mambo ya kuchanga pesa kwa njia ya Harambee yanaweza kufanyika katika sehemu ambazo . zina mazao ya pesa kama vile kahawa na majani chai. Lakini utaona kwamba jambo kama hilo haliwezekani katika sehemu kame hapa nchini. Kwa hivyo watu katika sehemu hizi wana taabu nyingi. Ingcfaa Serikali itafute njia ya kuwasaidia watu katika sehemu kame hapa nchini ili kuwawezesha watoto wote kupata elimu sawa. Utamwona mwanamke maskini akija kwenye ofisi ya Kanu akiwa na karatasi akisema kwamba anataka vitabu vya shule. Tunafanya Harambee kuwasaidia watu wetu lakini Harambee haziwezi kufanywa katika Kenya nzima kwa sababu kwengine ni kukavu sana, na hakuna cho chote ambacho kinaweza kuwafanya watu wawe matajiri. Kwa hivyo ni, lazima Ofisi ya Makamu wa Rais na Wizara ya Fedha itafute njia ya kuweza kuwasaidia watu wetu wanaoishi katika sehemu kame.Kuhusu ukosefu wa kazi, ningepeflOa kusema kwamba wale wanaostaafu kutoka mashirika ya Serikali wanaacha nafasi za kazi lakini nafasi hizo hazijazwi. Utaona kwamba watu 2,000 au 3,000 wakistaafu kutoka Shirika la Reli la Kenya au Halmashauri ya Bandari nafasi wanazoziacha hazijazwi. Hata nafasi zinazoachwa na wale wanaoaga dunia hazijazwi. Hiki ni kitu ambacho kinahitaji kuangaliwa kwa makini, ikiwa wanapata mkopo wakati watu wengi hawana kazi mjini kwa sababu jambo hili linaweza kusababisha hatari kubwa sana. Tukichukua mkopo, wasiwakataze watu kuajiri watoto kazi kwa sababu mkopo huo utakuwa hauna faida ikiwa nchi yetu ina fujo. Kila mtu akishastaafu, ni wajibu wa Serikali kuajiri mtu mwingine kazi hiyo kujaza nafasi ilioachwa.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ninasikitika kuona kwamba Wizara ya Maji haitusaidii vilivyo kwetu Mombasa. Ofisi ya Makamu wa Rais na Wizara ya Fedha inaloa pesa kidogo lakini wananchi kule Mombasa walichimba visima kujisaidia wapate maji. Walipofanya hivyo ilikuwa ni kama walifanya dhambi ya kukojoa ndani ya kanisa au mskiti. Walifanya hivyo ili watu wasife kwa kiu, wasafishe nguo zao na kwa matumizi mengine. Kama maji yalikuwa machafu, ilikuwa haina haja, kutoka mwanzo, kuwakuhalia kuchimba visima. Kama yale maji yalikuwa mabaya, ni wajibu wa wizara kuyatia dawa ili yawe mazuri. Haifai kuzoea kutoa amri kama vile Amirijeshi Mkuu anavyofanya na kusema kwamba maji hayo hayafai. Yetu si Serikali ya Kiimla. Ni Serikali ya kisikilizana, kuketi pamoja na kuelezana namna ya kutatua shida. Haifai Waziri kusema "I will do that". Waziri siye Serikali kwa sababu Serikali yetu ni ya Wakenya. Ikiwa unataka kumfanyia mwenzio neno, mpaka mketi pamoja na kushauriana. Haifai kutoa amri. Mambo kama haya lazima yatazamwe vizuri na Wizara hii.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda tukiendelea na uandikisaji wa wapiga kura yasikitisha kusikia kwamba wale ambao walisema tuweke mpira uwanjani hawataki kuendelea na mchezo. Je, mchagua jembe ni mkulima? Ninaona haya kusema maneno fulani ya Kiswahili lakini wakati mwingine ni lazima yasemwe. Watu wengi wameshajiandikisha kama wapiga kura na hakuna sababu ycyotc ya kutulanya turudi nyuma. Vyama vya upinzani ambavyo havijapawa idhini na wananchi ni lazima viwahimize wafuasi wao kuchukua kura. Kwetii Mombasa watu 35,000 wameshajiandikisha kama wapiga kura lakini wengine wanascma ni lazima tuwache kujiandikisha kama wapiga kura. Tabia hii ya kuogofya ni lazima ikome katika Kenya. Ndugu zetu wapinzani ambao hawana idhini ya wananchi ni lazima wajifundishe kama Wakenya wenzao kwa sababu hawatofautiani na Wakenya wenzao. Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda tunaeneza amani kwa sababu ya watoto wetu. Mlu akiamka asubuhi asifikiric kufanya maovu. Jc, unafikiri nchi hii ikiharibika itamwangukia Rais Moi, Bw. Spika, ama Shariff Nassir? Itatuangukia sotc. Ikiwa Mungu hajakupa usitake ukubwa kwa nguvu. Ikiwa ulakuwa ukubwa wa tongo ama wa kufura matende hiyo ni shauri yako. Usitake ukubwa sana kwa maana Mungu anampalia kila mtu kipawa chake. Kwa vile tumckubaliana kuwa na demokrasia katika Kenya ni heri niwaambie watu wangu wa Mombasa na ndugu zangu kalika Kenya, wacnde wachukuwe kura badala ya kutisha watu na kuwaambia kwamba tutapiga kelele halafu wageni watakapokuja watamwambia Rais Moi uandikishaji wa kura usimamishwe. Hakuna jambo kama hilo ambalo litatendeka. Uandikishaji wa wapiga kura unaoncndclca ukivunjwa hatutaandikisha wapiga kura mara ya pili na tutabakiana Rais Moi. Yule amlvayc hataki kujiandikisha kama mpiga kura ni shauri yake. Hakuna haja yoyoic ya kufanya uandishaji urudiwe.Kwa hayo machache, ahsantc. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ndirangu: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me this opportunity to support the proposals presented by the Exchequer.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for this country to be economically stable we need to charge taxes so that the necessary services are rendered to wananchi. However, I have one worry with regard to the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance. If you visit our national libraries you will be surprised to note that most of which have not been issued with books for a very long time. Nyeri National Library has not been issued with books for the last four years. This is not the fault of the library management not sending its proposals to the Treasury. When they send their proposals to the Treasury, they are not included in the Forward Budget and therefore, no money is allocated to various national libraries, something which makes them lack books.With the current 8-4-4 education system we wonder how libraries operate when they are not equipped with books to cover the 8-4-4 syllabuses. The libraries are no longer relevant to our 8-4-4 education system. I invite you to come to Nyeri branch of the Kenya NationalLibrary Service and witness that there are no books. There are only a few books in the shelves most which have been presented by donors from abroad. Most of these books arc reference books and do not concur with our current system of education. I appeal to the Treasury to ensure that they remember our libraries when allocating funds so that our children, especially those from the poor rural families have access to books in our libraries especially now that the prices of books have escalated.Allow me to comment on the shortage of water in Nyeri Town which is my constituency. We travel daily in search of water. For instance, I have complained about Gachika and Nyarimbo since I came to Parliament. Although we have many rivers, people on the upper parts of the country have no water to drink. The Ministry of Local Government has promised to provide pumps to supply water to the people. We have already recommended this in the D.D.C. but the Treasury has not provided any money at all to this effect. We, therefore, appeal to the Ministry of Finance to provide money to some of these water projects in Gachika, Nyarimbo and other areas.When we talk of money, we cannot forget the services charge which is charged every month to all workers, businessmen and other private individuals. The Nyeri Municipality, just like any other Municipality, has been charging services charge. But they have done very little with that money. They have not put into effective use the money collected for over 10 years. We have not seen even a single kilometre of tarmacked road in Nyeri. The Nyeri Municipality has not done a single kilometre of tarmacked road. Yet they are collecting services charge all the time.When we talk about economy, we cannot forget about our brothers and sisters who are still suffering. They do not have food. Their stores were burnt during the inter-tribal clashes in the country. I raised a question here in Parliament about two weeks ago and I would like to repeat it. The Ministiy of Lands and Housing promised to issue title deeds to victims of the tribal clashes. But if this exercise is not carried out with immediate effect we are going to have confusion. We are going to have a lot of problems. The Ministry might have to manipulate title deeds belonging to either dead or displaced people. But we have to protect those victims.We thank the donors who are supplying food to our people in the North-Eastern Province and other areas. We thank them a lot. Allow me also to thank the residents of Nyeri District for leading in the voter registration exercise. They have disregarded the call by the opposition to boycott the exercise. But even if the exercise is going on smoothly, we are saddened by the incidents of killings of voters in Narok District. For how long are we going to be treated to this kind of thing? It is a small incident. These people have been killed. But such an incident can render the whole exercise not worthy anything. Those leaders who have been inciting their constituents against the rest of Kenyans, the Attorney- General should take disciplinary action against them. Kanu is not bad. But chances of some of us becoming honest people  like me and many others are being frustrated by a few individuals who are inciting their tribesmen. When somebody has been appointed a Minister, he has to assume national outlook; for instance, the Minister for Local Government. He has shown his apparent hate for the Kikuyu and other communities. How do you expect such a Minister to render equal services to other communities in other areas? That is why we do not need such Ministers. We have many Back¬benchers who are capable of serving this country very well. Such a Minister is not worth his salt. It is high time Kanu re-organised itself. The five years we are approaching are capable of destabilising this country if we are not going to entrust the leadership of this country to an experienced person like President Moi. He has served this country well and we love him a lot. However, his efforts are being frustrated by leaders not only in Kanu but also in the opposition. We appeal to leaders not to masquerade as leaders who are legitimately elected. They should seek mandate from people so that they can ask for dialogue with Kanu. Why do they not go to the grass root elections without rigging so that we can face them in the ballot?With those few remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech>[The Temporary Deputy Speaker(Mr. Mwamzancli) left the Chair][The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mureithi) took the Chair]<Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: Thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to contribute to this Motion. In my view, this Motion is calling upon the Government to approve the proposals contained in the Financial Statement by the Vice-President and Minister for Finance in terms of taxation as enumerated on the Order Paper so that these taxes can start being collected from 1st July, 1992, to be able to finance various programmes during the next financial year.It is only fitting that we accept the Motion since development has to go on and the recurrent aspect of the budget has also to go on. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Livestock Development (Mr. Chesire): On a point of order, Sir. I tend to feel that the hon. Member is misleading the House when he says that the tax proposals brought forward by the Vice-President and Minister for Finance are for implementation from 1st July, 1992. From what we know, collection of taxes will start immediately like the one on beer and so on. Is he in order to suggest that everything will start from 1st July, 1992? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the hon. Member cared to read the Financial Statement, he would find that most of these taxes will take effect from 1st July. I know there are certain taxes measures that have been effected but those now covered by this Motion will take effect from 1st July this year.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, with regard to the Income Tax proposals, it has been indicated in the Budget Speech that the Treasury will incur a net loss of £30.8 million. However, it has not indicated how much how much the Government will raise under Income Tax. Other tax proposals are quite clear, for example, Customs Tariff will realize £95.3 million, while Excise Duties will realize £3 million, Value Added Tax £46.4 million and Insurance Premium Tax, £2.1 million. I have gone through the whole Budget Speech and noticed that the various deductions in the rate of Income Tax proposals are in the form of percentages. However, I did not come across a figure indicating as to how much these deductions are.However, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to congratulate the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for having done commendably well in trying to indicate to us how he is going to finance the deficit in the Budget. It is now for the tax officers who have been charged with the responsibility of collecting revenue under these taxes, to ensure that they collect all the revenue due to be collected. Although we have proposals on internal borrowing, that is from banks and non-banking institutions, including Treasury bonds, we should not experience another deficit budget in future.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I notice that in 1992/93 Budget proposals, the actual recurrent expenditure will be in the tune of £1.76 billion while the development expenditure will be £0.58 billion making a total of £2.34 billion and therefore, there is a deficit when you compare the expenditure with the actual revenue collection under the proposed taxes. I have been quoting these figures to show that the Ministry of Finance has a duty of ensuring that the economic development of this country is enhanced.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is true that the implementation of these tax measures cannot be realized in a situation of anarchy. We have in recent months experienced very unfortunate incidents of tribal clashes in various parts of this country. The effect of these tribal clashes is a threat to the implementation of these taxation measures. If we are going to continue in a state of anarchy where there is no peace, it will be very difficult to raise money through taxes. Therefore, I would like to appeal to the Kanu Government to stop once and for all, these tribal clashes which are still going on in some parts of this country. As I speak here now, we still have a problem in Bungoma. It was only yesterday that I witnessed three bodies being brought to the mortuary. These people were victims of tribal clashes that are still going on in this area. Our people have been displaced as a result of which it will be difficult for the Government to implement any form of taxation measures.We are therefore appealing to the Government to restore order in this country. In fact, with the exercise of registration of voters going on, it is going to be very unfair for Kenyans to be asked to register in the affected areas. I am saying this because most of them have been displaced and it will be important to extend the registration period. There are areas in this country where the process if extremely slow. This is because the people there are apprehensive while others have been displaced and are no longer living in their original areas of registration. Therefore, the sooner the Government restored order and made it possible for these people to return to their home areas, the better for this registration exercise.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the Government is not careful in the way it is conducting the registration exercise, we shall end up being condemned internationally.We are pleased to note that the foreign observers on registration and voting in Kenya have just arrived. However, the truth of the matter is that there are very many mistakes going on in the registration centres. When I was touring some of the registration centres in my constituency, I found in one of the centres, namely Namatotoa, the registration clerks who have been sent there do not seem to know how to fill in the voter's card. They are putting the stamp at the back of the card. Having been a former returning officer, I know any card stamped at the back is already spoilt. Something must be done to ensure that this registration exercise is done correctly, otherwise, we are going to end in trouble.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Jalang'o: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to join my colleagues in discussing this very important financial statement for 1992/93 Financial Year. This statement comes at a time when the country is going through a major political change, which has proved to be a very difficult time for this country.In fact, as you are aware, wananchi are wondering where these basic commodities are.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to firstly comment briefly on the Financial Statement and then make one or two very spefic comments. Firstly I would like to congratulate the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for looking at certain sectors of the economy and lowering duty in specific areas. The most welcome bit is on the agricultural sector, where he started by increasing the allowance to small-scale entrepreneurs for the purchase of industrial machines from Shs.40 million to Shs.50 million. This is very welcome because ours is an agricutural country. I have always felt that with proper planning and identification of the country's priorities we should be self-sufficient in maize, wheat flour, rice and milk.I am happy to note that the Vice-President and Minister for Finance has seen it fit for one more time to lower import duty on raw materials required in the manufacturing sector. He has introduced what is called a "variable duty rate" on maize, wheat, rice, sugar and milk powder. These reductions are specifically geared towards the improvement of the intake to the domestic producer. One aspect which I think is most welcome is that the import duty will only be imposed on these products when the import prices are lower than domestic prices. I think this is very timely and it should go a long way in encouraging the domestic producer to produce more so that whatever he produces may not be subject to duty.But the concern here is, with all these incentives to the domestic prodcer, to the farmer and to the small-scale entrepreneur the country is still asking where all sugar and maize have gone. All the Kenya National Trading Corporation (KNTC) depots in the country do not have a single kilogramme of sugar and yet some other businessmen have sugar in their stores. The official price of sugar in Nairobi is Shs. 17/- a kilogramme. But today the minimum price of sugar in any shop in Nairobi is Shs.35/- a kilogramme, if you can get it. This is so despite the fact that we have sugar factories scatered all over the country, right from Ramisi in Coast Province to Nzoia in Bungoma. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, Office of the Vice- President and Ministry of Finance (Mr. Keah): They have all been closed! </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Jalang'o: Why are they closed? Why should maintenance be done at the same time for ail sugar factories in the country? Is it not poor planning to decide to close all sugar factories in the country at the same time? This is poor planning unless, of course, somebody knows why they all closed at the same time. Why should these other private businessmen be given licences to import sugar and then charge ordinary Kenyans Shs.35/- a kilogramme instead charging Shs.17/- a kilogrammes? Where is maize in this country today? All National Cereals and Produce Board stores throughout the country have nounga. Why is there no unga? Why do we have to import maize when this country is blessed with fertile soils and good climatic conditions? Obiously, there has been some drought, but how come certain businessmen have maize and maize flour in their stores and instead of charging Shs.472/- per 90-kilogramme bag of unga they are charging Shs.600/-? I think something has gone wrong and we have to look at what has gone wrong.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, currently our foreign exchange reserves are extremely low. I believe that at this time we have reached the lowest level of foreign exchange reserves. Oviously there has been international recession, which is hitting everybody, including Kenya. But at a time like this when there is global recession; when our tourism earnings have gone down because of international recession and insecurity in some of our national parks, we should start to conserve the little foreign exchange reserves we have and use it only on very essential commodities. This is time when we have to decide as to whether what we are importing is really necessary to import. Two days ago we read in the newspapers that an oil tanker could not dock in Kilindini Harbour, Mombasa, to discharge its very essential cargo of crude oil until yesterday when the Central Bank of Kenya paid the importer. We have to look critically at areas where we can improve on our import spending and spend less on imports, unless they are extremely and absolutely necessary.While talking about VAT it is also encouraging that the Treasury has introduced zero-rating on certain areas of advantages to the farmer, especially in packaging raw materials for seedlings. But there is one area where VAT is being charged and where consumers are complaining; there is VAT on telephone services. 18 per cent VAT on telephone charges is exorbitant. Looking at telephone services today one really wonders what has happened to them. It is my personal reccomendation to this House that VAT on telephone services should be reduced and should be commensurate with the services given to the subscribers. "The Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation last printed the telephone directory in 1988! Now we are in 1992 and the corporation keeps on charging VAT on telephone services. Where is that money going? Why should we allow the corporation to charge 18 per cent VAT on telephone services when those services are below the required standard; when subscribers cannot get a telephone directory between 1988 to 1992 and yet every month every subscriber pays money for the production of this directory?In conclusion, I would like to appeal to the Vice- President and Minister for finance to remove altogether income tax for single mothers because they are in a unique situation in our community.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary DeputySpeaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Lands and Housing (Mr. Bomett): Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kuniruhusu niseme machache juu ya Hoja hii. Ningetaka kuongea kama mhe. Mbunge ambaye anatoka katika sehemu ambako kilimo ndicho kazi kubwa, hasa ukuzaji wa mahindi na ngano.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, tumesema kwamba hakuna mahindi katika nchi hii, na hili si jambo jipya. Hakuna yikulima ambaye hajui ni kwa nini kuna shida hii. Vile Hoja ilivyotolewa na Makamu wa Rais ambaye pia ni Waziri wa Fedha, nilisikiliza kwa makini na ningetaka kusema kwamba ingawa imcscmekana kwamba mkulima amesaidiwa, mkulima hajasaidiwa hata kidogo. Mkulima wa Kenya anatakiwa akuze mahindi kwa kupanda, kununua mbegu, kuweka mbolea, kupiga dawa aina mbali mbali. kuvuna na kuweka katika ghala, na mam bo hayo yote yanahitaji pesa. Kwa kawaida, mkulima anatakiwa kuchukua mkopo kutoka kwa Agricultural Finance Corporation, atumie pesa zake mwenyewe au akope katika banki. Pesa zinazohitajika kulima mahindi katika shamba la ekari moja hadi ck;ui 10 ni chungu nzima. Ikiwa mkulima huyu amelima na kupanda wakati ufaao lakini kwa bahati mbaya, kama mwaka jana na mwaka huu kwa mfano, iwe hakuna mvua, basi hajui atafanya nini. Kwa mfano, katika Mawakilisho yangu ya Rongai mahindi yamckauka na hata maharagwe yamenyauka na hatuoni kama tutapata chakula cha kutosha. Je, yule mkulima ambaye ana ekari mbili au tatu na ambaye alitumia pesa zake au alitumia mkopo kutoka Agricultural Finance Corporation, atalipa mkopo huo namna gani? Hakuna mtu ambaye amejibu swali hilo hata kidogo.Mwaka baada ya mwaka tangu 1990 tumezungumza hapa na kuiuliza Serikali iangalie kitu iiiachoweza kulanya ili tuwe na ugawaji wa gharama. Tuniclanikiwa katika upande wa matibabu lakini kwa upandc wa kilimo tulikuwa na Guaranteed Minimum Returns (GMR) ambayo ilitolewa. Si kwamba tulitaka pesa za Serikali; tulikuwa tunataka Serikali ifanye mpango wa kutoa bima kusema kwamba kila ekari moja inayolimwa na mkulima italipishwa Ksh4.00 na Serikali kupitia Agricultural Finance Corporation. Hicho ndicho kiasi kilichotozwa kwa ekari moja hadi mwaka wa 1972, na kilikuwa kiasi kidogo sana. Sasa tukiuliza kila mkulima alipe KShs.10.00 kwa ekari moja, k'ila mkulima atatoa kiasi hicho kuwekwa katika banki ya Agricultural Finance Corporation. Ikiwa kutakuwa na shida ya chakula kutoiva, basi haitakuwa kwamba mkulima hakufanya kazi yake, bali ni kwa sababu ya hali ambayo mkulima hangeweza kuepuka na psa hizo zitaweza kumsaidia mtu ambaye hakupata mavuno. Mkulima ambaye amepata mavuno, kwa mfano upandc wa Kitale au Molo, hatadai pesa hizo na atakuwa anamsaidia yule aliyepoteza chakula katika shamba lake.Bw. Naibu Spika, ni kilu gani kinachozuia mpango wa GMR? Pcngine hala Makamu wa Rais na Waziri wa Fedha hajui kwa sababu hajalima shamba katika maisha yake. Nina haki hajalima na kama amelima amelima juzi tu. Pia, sidhani Waziri wa Kilimo amelima shamba na kujua ni taabu gani mkulima anapata. Kwa niaba ya wakulima, hasa wale wadogo, naomba mpango wa GMR urudishwe mara moja. Tunauliza ni kwa nini tunaagiza chakula kutoka ng'ambo, lakini tutazidi kuagi/.a chakula kutoka Ulaya kama bado tutazidi kukataa kurudisha mpango wa GMR ili kuwcka bima kwa mazao ya mahindi na ngano. Tukirudisha mpango huo tutapata chakula cha kutosha. Na hakuna sababu mpango wa GMR usitumike hata katika kilimo cha iniwa. Ni kwa nini mkulima anaachwa peke yake kuchukua mzigo wa kulisha nchi? Ni lazima Serikali iwe mshiriki katika mambo yar kilimo. Mpango wa GMR ukirudishwa tutakuza chakula cha kutosha.Nikishasema hayo, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, nataka kuongea juu ya mpango wa artificial insemination (AI). Huu ni mpango ambao umetusaidia katika nchi hii tangu tunyakue Uhuru hadi hivi majuzi tu ambapo ulianza kuchezewa. Tunachezea mpango huu na tukizidi kuuchezea tutakosa maziwa hata ikiwa kuna dcmokrasia. Mtakula demokrasia na mlane wenyewe. TunaUika mpango wa AI urudishwe na uwe wa hali ya juu zaidi. Tulikuwa tunalipa KSh.1.00 na sasa tunalipa KShs.40.00. Ninapozungumza hapa sasa, ingawa wakul ima wako tayari kulipa kiasi hiki, hakuna magari yanayozunguka kutoa huduma hii. Wanasema wanangojca pesa zitolewe. Ng'ombe ambaye analaka mimba hawei kungojea pesa zetu. Tunaharibu mbegu za ng'ombe, kitu ambacho Kenya inacho kwa wingi na ambacho hatuwezi kulaka kupoteza.Mambo ya kilimo ni muhimu sana. Nataka kusema kwamba maji ni kitu inuhimu sana, na ni lazima tuone ni vipi tunavyoweza kuzuia maji wakati wa mvua na kuyahifadhi katika kila sehemu. Ukienda kila mahali katika makao makuu ya wilaya na katika makao makuu ya mabaraza ya wilaya unaona mashine za kuchimba maji zinakaa bure na tunaambiwa zimeharibika, ile hali kuzirekebisha ni kazi rahisi sana. Tukizitumia mashine hizo tutaweza kupata maji kila sehemu ya nchi hii. Pia, katika upande wa Subukia na upandc wa Solai, kuna visima vya maji ambavyo vilikuwa vikitumiwa na Wazungu na ambavyo vina maji mengi sana. Vitu ambavyo vimeharibika ni vidogo ambavyo vinaweza kurekebishwa kwa urahisi.Ningependa Makamu wa Rais na Waziri wa Fedha afanye mpango kuona kwamba pesa hizi zinatumika kwa kusaidia wakulima.Kwa hayo machache, naunga mkono. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. J. N. Mungai: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to support this Motion. Customs tariff, excise duties, value added tax and insurance premium tax appeared in our Budget Statement this year and wc are going to approve it as it is, Sir. What is most worrying is the fact that every year, we approve such taxes and it appears that corruption is rampant when taking into account the method of collecting these taxes. Corruption has now hit everything. If you look at customs tax, for instance, you will realise that tax is levied on all goods. The Government expect to raise some revenue from these taxes but due to corrupt officers, we end up making nothing at the end of the day.Although the Ministry has done whatever it can so that the country can earn revenue, they must also make sure that they put committed officers to man these offices. We have spoken many times in this House about corruption and some of us have been branded anti-system, anti-Government and anti-party and yet we have been talking about evils that can wreck our country. It has been said that there is a lot of corruption at the Treasury such that nothing can be done for someone without giving a kick-back. Even though the Vice-President and Minister for Finance comes to this House and sounds as eloquent as possible in Budget Speeches, at the end of the day, the whole thing becomes dirty because nobody is committed.On Value Added Tax (VAT), I think that 18 per cent is a little bit too high. Things are very extreme in the business atmosphere. For instance, the producer is not "breathing" as far as buying of implements is concerned. If he has to sell his products at a price inclusive of 18 per cent VAT, it bccomcs extremely difficult for the consumer to be consistent in purchases. This is because most of what he would like to use is spent on taxes and this is very discouraging. This is why I am saying that our taxes must also be governed by the environment around us in as far as our economy is concerned. We should not just impose taxes for the sake of it. We should do so Ibr the sake of earning revenue and for the sake of helping the producer and the consumer.I will keep on saying that VAT must be reviewed from time to time so that our people do not suffer so much. This country is very rich in human resources. The people of this nation value whatever they do. The Government itself has invested a lot in developing manpower in this country. If you look at all sectors. Sir, we appear to be getting nowhere.When something is said in this country, it is sometimes termed a "rumour" but this is not always the case; it is the truth at times. But because of fear, people simply talk about it as a rumour. If you look  at the foreign exchange in this country, Sir, I would say that it is being used for the upkeep of the big ones in their luxurious lives. We have often been told that we have no foreign reserves and we cannot do this and that because we do not have sufficient foreign exchange. But if you look at our senior Government officers and Ministers, you will see that they are driving Mercedes Benzes that are not worth being driven in this country at this time. If you look at these senior officers, you will see that officials cars are treated as their own. Who has allowed them lo import such luxurious cars at the expense of the wananchi? This is why I am saying that most of our foreign exchange has been diminished through luxurious spending by the so called big men. It is important that we re-examine ourselves in all activities because the mwananch is looking at us. This is the mwananchi on whom the Government has spent so much money educating and he is now enlightened.

Kwa hivyo, ningependa kumuuliza atwambie kama ni ukweli au ni uwongo eti watu wakubwa ndio wanatumia vibaya pesa za kigeni. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. J. N. Mungai: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, could be he is a beneficiary. All I am doing is condemning this act be it a rumour or not.On the agricultural sector, I would like to say that the time has come for us to stop importing agricultural produce. If it were not for the sake of the wananchi, I would say that we should not even import maize, wheat, sugar and so on. We can import agricultural machinery but not commodities like maize, wheat and sugar. Why is this country importing these commodities? The time has come has come for all officers of the Ministry of Agriculture to be sacked and replaced with others. These new officers should be people who are committed. We know that this is supposed to be the backbone of our economy, but it has actually become the backbone of our destruction. We are destorying our nation using a sector that is very capable. The environment in this country is such that whether there is a world economic depression, recession or other financial problems, our agricultural sector is naturally favoured. Consider the sugar belt of Nyanza Province. It has been said that cleaning of sugar factories has become a tradition but to me, this is a pure lie intended to cover up big men who want to carry out their corruption in importing sugar and other commodities at cheap prices in order to exploit our people at home.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Header>QUORUM</Header><Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: On a point of order, Mr: Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.

Naibu Spika wa Muda. Ninaiunga mkono Hoja hii ambayo ilitolewa na Makamu wa Rais na Wazari wa Fedha. Hii ni Hoja ya maana sana kwa mwananchi. Wananchi huhitaji usaidizi kidogo mara kwa mara. Nilisikiliza kwa makini wakati Hoja hii ilipopendekezwa hapa na, kuhusu hasa bei ya vyakula, Hotuba hii ni safi. Baada ya Bajeti kusomwa, wananchi wamekuwa wakilia kuhusu bei ya sukari ambayo imepanda juu sana. Sijui kama bei hii ilikuwa imeongezwa kabla au baada ya kusomwa kwa Bajeti. Bei ya sukari sasa hivi nr zaidi ya Sh.32/= kwa kilo moja, hasa katika Wilaya ya Baringo. Wakati Bajeti inaposomwa, ingefaa tuwe na orodha ya bei za aina zote za vyakula ili wananchi waweze kutosheka kwamba Serikali imeamua sukari, mafuta ya Kimbo na vitu vingine viwe vikiuzwa kwa bei fulani.Wananchi walifurahi waliposomewa Bajeti, lakini baada ya muda kidogo tu, bei za vyakula zikaongezwa. Tutamfanyia nini mtu wa kawaida? Si alalia na kusema, "Ooo! Sina pesa za kutosha, na hali bei ya sukari na vitu vingine imepanda." Ningeiomba Wizara iliangalie jambo hili kwa makini ndipo iweze kuwafurahisha wananchi na Bajeti ya nchi yao. Bajeti ikisomwa, wananchi wanafaa kujua kabisa kwamba bei ya bidhaa fulani imeongezwa kidogo na ya bidhaa nyingine fulani ikataremshwa. Bei lie ambayo itakuwa imeteremshwa haifai kuongezwa baada ya muda mfupi tu, bali idumu mpaka mwaka huo huishe. Bajeti ya mwaka huu ilikuwa nzuri, lakini hata kabla hatujamaliza wiki moja, bei ya bidhaa fulani iliongezwa. Hii ni kwa sababu wananchi hawana orodha ya bei za bidhaa ambazo zimesimamiwa na Serikali. Ningeiomba Wizara  ihakikishe kwamba bei za bidhaa zinazotumiwa na wananchi wa kawaida zimepangwa vizuri.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ni lazima mambo haya yaangaliwe ili wananchi waweze kupata chakula cha kutosha bila kusumbuka.

Utaona kwamba mwananchi wa kawaida anashindwa kununua sukari kwa bei ya KShs.30/- kwa kilo moja. Akinunua nusu kilo hiyo haitoshi kamwe. Ninasema kiasi hicho chasukari hakitoshi kwa sababu mwananchi ana watolo na	vile vile marafiki ambao huja kumtembelea. Ni lazima	tuyaangalie maslahi ya walu wetu kwa njia zinazofaa.	Yafaa bei za vyakula- ziangaliwe vyema.	Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, katika kila wilaya	tuna kamati ya maendeleo ya wilaya na kamati ndogo ya	maendeleo. Kuna kamati za maendeleo katika kata na	kata ndogo. Masikitiko yangu ni kwamba mapendekezo	yanayopelekwa kwa D.D.C. hayatekelezwi. Mambo	mengine hayatimizwi na tunalazimika kuuliza Maswali	katika Bunge hili. Ningeiomba Ofisi ya Makamu wa Rais	na Wizara ya Fedha ihakikishe kwamba kila D.D.C.	inatumia pesa zake kwa njia zinazofaa. Ninasema hivi	kwa sababu ukienda kule Baringo utakuta kwamba kuna	mas i mengi ya Serikali ambayo hayafanyi kazi. Utaona	kwamba magari yakikosa vipuri vidogo vidogo	yanawekwa kando. Magari haya yakiacha kuturtiika	yanaharibika upesi. Ni lazima kutolewe pesa za kununua	vipuri vinavyohitajika. Wakati mwingine maofisa	wanasenyi kwamba hawana mafuta ya kutosha. Baada ya	Bajeti kusomwa, kujadiliwa na kupitishwa kila wilaya	inagawiwa pesa zake. Je, hizi pesa zikifika kwenye	wilaya hupelekwa wapi? Wale maofisa walioko katika	wilaya wanafanya kazi gani? Kuna haja gani kuacha	kutumia gari kwa sababu ya kifaa kidogo ambacho bei	yake ni kama KShs.5,000/-? Utaona kwamba gari la	kubebea wagonjwa katika kituo cha afya cha Nginyang	imekaa karibu miezi sita bila kutumika. Watu wanazidi	kuugua lakini hakuna usaidizi ambao wanapata. Ni	umbali wa kilomita 75 kutoka Nginyang hadi makao	makuu ya tarafa na ningeiomba Ofisi ya Rais na Wizara	ya Fedha ijaribu kutusaidia kwa pesa. Haifai kwetu sisi	kupiga makofi hapa tukisema kwamb Bajeti ni nzuri na	ile hali pesa zikipelekwa katika wilaya kazi ambayo pesa	hizo zinatumiwa kufanya haionekani. ' Yafaa Wizara	ihakikishe kwamba pesa zinatumika vizuri katika kila	wilaya. Ninasema hivi kwa sababu sisi Wabunge ni	wanachama wa D.D.C. katika wilaya zetu na (unapitisha	mambo mengi lakini wananchi hawapati huduma	wanazohitaji. Ni lazima Wizara itupatie tarakimu	kuonyesha vile pesa zimetumika katika kila wilaya.	Jambo lingine, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda-</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>An Hon. Member: Wakati wako umekwisha!	</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Twarith: Alas! Kwa hayo machache	naomba kuunga mkono</Newspeech>.	<Newspeech>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. ole	Ntimama): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to	support this Motion on ways and means of raising revenuefor Government expenditure. I support this Motion fully.It is unfortunate that I was unable to speak on the Motionon the Budget Speech. However, I support this one.	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have beenaway for a few days. This afternoon I was at the Airport	to meet His Excellency the President. I am going to	mention the names of some hon. Members particularly hon. Njenga Mungai and the hon. Member of	Parliament for Nyeri Town. I do not want to mentionthe names of other people. Some people have reallygone out of their way to attack me on various thingsthai have happened in Narok and on certain statementsthey said I am purported to have made. Before Icontinue I want to say that there are thousands uponthousands of people from different ethnic groups whohave been living in Narok happily and doing theirbusiness happily for many years. I want to say thatthere many Kikuyus living there and doing businesswithout any problems at all. I have been targetted forattack by these people. They have blamed me for theskirmishes and deaths that have taken place at theborder of Narok and Naivasha. Even before I gothere, I want to say here that these things were said ina meeting that I held in Narok; a big Kanu rally thatI held in Narok on the 6th-- I said very clearly that-Probably the newspapers were interested in theirheadlines. I do not mind that one. But what I said isthat anybody who is ineligible and you know whatI mean by ineligible I said that all those peoplewho eligible can vote in Narok without any fearindeed. That is what I said and the Special Branchcan bear me out. What happened on the border ofNarok and Naivasha is very unfortunate. In that sub-location there were three registration centres whichwere established in 1987 and they were also used aspolling stations in 1988. Two of them were droppedfor reasons that I do not know and only one was left,That is the one right on the border. This one at theborder happened to have had a lot of people from theKikuyu community living around it and those twoothers happened to have people from* the Maasaicommunity living around them. A man known as Mr.,ole Lempaka a Ford member slept at Olesupukia onthe night of the 7th and found in the morning of the8th. He told the people "This is a Ford station; it isfor Kikuyu's; we have closed the other two Maasai'sstations; and you can go on voting but we want toremove President Moi". The statement that he madewas what caused the trouble. At that time, I was inNairobi and in this House and I do not know whathappened. I was particularly responsible for makingsure that I quelled the skirmishes so that they did notcontinue. The Electoral Commission have put twoother stations there and registration of voters is goingon even at Olesupukia and we have not more troubleat all.	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if thiskind of things continue and that is the only side thatis reported by the newspapers and if an hon. Memberlike hon. Mungai is going to continue saying that oleNtimama should be arrested the I cannot understand,He is a man who has got "vein full of rivers of blood"flowing in his fingers; he is a man who has got“pools of blood” in his hands; and he is the man who never refused the allegation that he killed captain Belsoi, a man who. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. J.N. Mungai: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. It is useless standing up here to raise the issue of Captain Belsoi which I dealt with in this House. If my educated friend and a senior Minister knows that there is a Parliamentary Probe Committee which is investigating the root causes of the ethnic clashes that are currently going on and by saying so, is he not trying to raise a matter that is sub jutlice? Although hon. ole Ntimama goes to River Jordan, he has been known to talk about things like evils and lying low like envelopes against the Kikuyu community. With regard to whatever is happening to them at the moment, he should be held responsible. He should therefore, not think that he can smear my name because he may never succeed in doing so. Go to River Jordan and wash yourself! </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. ole Ntimama): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I refer to the Daily Nation newspaper of 10th June, 1992 on Page 5 where hon. Mungai was quoted as saying: "The Kikuyu's should vote as a block so that they can protect their political interests". He went on to say: "We must support--"</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. J.N. Mungai: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Hon. ole Ntimama is an ignorant Minister. He should be aware of the fact that I withdrew that statement the following morning. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mureithi): Order! Mr. Mungai, I think there is a tetter language to use instead of saying that somebody is "ignorant". Could you please withdraw that word? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. J.N. Mungai: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I withdraw the'word ignorant. Yes, I was misquoted by the newspapers as having said that the Kikuyus should unite and vote together as a block. The following morning I telephoned the Daily Nation newspaper who corrected that .statement. 1 do not allege things just like hon. Ntimama docs. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mureithi): Order! Older, hon. Mungai. Please allow hon. Ntimama to continue contributing. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. ole Ntimama): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, he continued to say that he will tell his people in Molo to arm themselves against a certain army. The whole issue is tribal and if that is not inciting people, what is it? If it is not tribal, what is it? Hon. Njenga Mungai wants the Kikuyus to protect their political interest and he wants us to surrender our political interests. I think Ihis is one person who has really had his way all. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. J.N. Mungai: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Let me make it clear thai hon. ole Ntimama has been known for telling the Maasai's to unite and vote in only Kanu members. What is wrong in me telling the Kikuyu's to unite and vote in their favourites candidates? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. ole Ntimama): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, he is saying so now, but whatever, he organizes, I think is futile. This is a man that should be sent down to (he depth of the world because he is a kind of guy whom I think—(Noise)Hon. Mungai has got rivers of blood flowing in his hands. The whole of Molo is in a mess and he is supposed lo really-</Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mureilhi): Order! Hon. ole Ntimama you should discuss the Moi ion before this House. The Chair is not going lo allow exchanges of words between you and hon. Mungai to be the debate in this House. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. ole Ntimama): Mr. Temporary Speaker, Sir, most of Ihese arc wrong allegations and we have been very slraighl forward and living peacefully with our people. IT these people go on inciting our people and anything happens, lliey will be held responsible. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kitele: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Depuly Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chance to air my views on this Motion which I stand to support.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like to thank His Excellency the President for allending the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This showed that Kenya is interested in conserving the global environment.Coming to the Motion, I would also like to thank His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for the good Budget he presented this year. I think this is the best Budget we have ever had because it did nol affect the essential commodities that the common mwananchi consumes.With regard to taxes, I would like to say that he also did a good thing because he increased allowances on taxes for married and single people.The other point is on VAT. I would like the Government lo look into VAT because hotels are now becoming expensive and wananchi who would like to venture into the tourist industry cannot afford. We would like all hon. Members in this House to go to Mombasa, Narok, Nyeri and other parts of Kenya as tourists. While visiting those areas they will stay in hotels and VAT will be included in their bills. So, the Government should look into and consider this issue bearing in mind the intrest of mwananchi.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for having said that any items manufactured in Kenya should not be imported. This is important because quite a lot of products that we manufacture locally end up being imported into Kenya. We would like to utilize our locally manufactured goods and import whatever we cannot manufacture locally. We should, therefore, stop the importation of goods that are locally manufactured. That is why we want the Customs Department to play their part properly. Anything imported should be charged duty since we would like to encourage our manufacturers here so that our sons and daughters can be employed.All iff all, I think, it was a good budget. The insurance is a big burden in this country and the Government ought to look into it seriously. The money that does into the insurance industry daily is colossal. So the Ministry ought to look into it properly. The insurance companies should also be told what to do since many people are ignorant about their services. Some people arc involved in accidents and they do not get compensated. They even lose their cars altogether after insuring them.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is high time we killed "tribalism" in Kenya. If we do not do so, then we are going to face a big problem in the country. We are all Kenyans. We do not have to count people as Kikuyu, Mkamba, Masai and so on. We are all Kenyans and we belong to this country. You do not have to say where you come from. So we have to talk with one voice. We all came into this House on a Kanu ticket. Therefore, we should be sincere to the President, and the ruling party Kanu. This enemy called "tribalism" ought to be killed since we do not want any problems.We have had peace in this country for the last 30 years since Independence, and we would like to continue that way. Even if other parties think they are going to take over the leadership of this country, I am sure they would like to lead in peace and not in chaos. We are surrounded by other countries with a lot of problems and they should not bring their problems into our country. We pray that we have peace in the country. The religious leaders should preach to us so that we become good Christians. They should not involve themselves in politics.I would like to say something in connection with the Ministry of Health. In Kathinni Constituency there was a dispensary called Thinu which had an ambulance. This vehicle was taken for repair but it has never come back. For how long is it going to remain in the garage? This dispensary is in a remote area, right in the rural area. If somebody gets sick, it becomes a problem to lake him to Machakos General Hospital. Therefore, we would like that ambulance to be returned to the area. We also have a health centre in Mitaboni Location. Can we also be provided with an ambulance there as well?	The other point concerns the Ministry of Water Development. We have an acute shortage of water in my area. For instance, there is no water in Komarock. So I urge the Ministry of Water Development to see what they can do to alleviate the problem of water in that area. Also in Kathiani Location, we need water. Even if it is a dam, it will help quite a lot.We have peace in the country and we would like it to continue. We have been led by the Kanu Government so far. At the moment, we have many refugees in the country. Kenya is the only country in Africa with peace. So if there is no peace in Kenya, where are we going to hide? So we need peace.The registration of voters exercise has just started and all Kenyans should register as voters. When the elections come, wananchi will have a chance of voting in the right leaders in Parliament according to their choice. So I urge everybody to register now as a voter.With those few remarks, I support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Livestock Development (Mr. Kabingu-Muregi): Thank you. Sir, for giving me a chance to say something on this Motion concerning the Financial Statement by the Vice-President and Minister for Finance.The budget has given consideration to farmers and also to tax-payers. It is a big relief to everybody. I was particularly impressed by the removal of the tax that had been imposed on the farmers since they incur a lot of expenses while looking after their livestock. However, another tax element value added tax (VAT) of 10 per cent was left intact. I would like it also to be removed since it is a burden to the consumers. In fact, it is quite unfair to impose such a tax on a commodity like milk which is perishable. Also with the removal of price control, consumers are likely to be affected by milk products and so on. So the Government ought to remove this tax in order to relief or ease the price of milk to consumers.Again, I wish also to join other hon. Members who have commented on the registration of voters. I also appeal to everybody in Kenya to register as a voter. The call by the opposition to boycott or refuse registration of voters is uncalled for, unfair and lacks sense. The only way to decide who should rule this country is by the ballot. It is not through lies as witnessed in Nyandarua on 18th of last month. The lies were meant to create fear accuse Kanu Government and the President of malpractice and unfair deals to the public. Why make an allegation that SO school children and seven teachers had been killed when it was false? What does it benefit a Member like myself to organise the killing of school children? It is now quite clear that the aim of the opposition parties is to create fear. They have failed to convince members of the public that they are worth being there. They laek material to present to the publie and that is why they have engaged themselves in ereating fear through unfounded lies. Are these the expeeled leaders of tomorrow? I think the opposition should look for other leaders other than the ones they have now.Having said that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that the registration of voters is the only way that a eountry ean demonstrate its maturity. It is therefore the right of every Kenyan to register himself or herself as a voter without any interference. All leaders, both in Government and in opposition should eneourage wananehi to register themselves as voters. There have been lies being spread that the registration exereise is being messed up with. We have even heard some people saying that the three tieks appearing on the voters eard should not appear and that any voter's card bearing the three tieks is useless. This is being said just to seare off people from registering and it is not true. All a voter should ensure is that his identity card number and his name is properly indicated in the card. I have notieed that even the registration elerks are innocent loeal people who have been employed by the Electoral Commission. Some of them are even school leavers who have no eause to ereate fear by messing up with registration eards.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is my sincere feeling that the Kanu Government has done its work properly. The level of development that has been achieved since Independence under the good leadership of the late Mzee Jomo Kenyatta and the present dynamie leader, President Daniel arap Moi is eommcndable. It is for this reason that I wish him suecess and good health to continue leading this nation. We are confident that the Kanu Government will win the eoming elections and form the Government onee again. I am delighted to note that wananchi still have eonfidenee with the Kanu Party. This is because of what Kanu has achieved up to now despite the lies that have been pouring from the opposition.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say something about the National Christian Couneil of Kenya (NCCK). I would particularly like to refer to the General Symposium that was going on last week in Limuru. It is most unfair for any church organization to call for civil disobedienee. This was done sometimes ago in Machakos by one of the opposition leaders, namely John Keen. What these people want to do is to eause chaos in this country. We have seen a bit of this ehaos where cars have been stoned, burnt and even people killed. Who aetually does (his benefit? We know that the NCCK is a church organization whose responsibility is to lead christians in worship of God and in earrying out good works sueh as helping the poor and the siek. However, they seem to have diverted from that role and joined politics. If they eannot do the job they are appointed by God to do, then the best thing for them to do is to resign from the ehureh and join politics. They should leave the Christians alone so that they ean worship in peaee. Chureh leaders should engage themselves in bringing about peaee and stability to the community. Therefore, it is quite evident that the NCCK has lost direction and I call upon them to ehange their attitude and earry out the duties for whieh they were appointed by God to do.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we would like assistance from our ehurches who are affiliated to this organization. What is clear is that some of the ehureh leaders do not like some of the leaders in Government and I think this is very unfair and unpatriotie.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Industry (Mr. Chepkok): Ahsante sana Bw.

Nal'ikiri kwamba wananehi wanofuga ng'ombe watazidi kuongeza ng'ombe wao wa maziwa ili wawcze kutoa maziwa mengi zaidi.Baada ya kusema hivyo, ningetaka kumwaomba Makamu-Rais afikirie kuondoa kodi inayotozwa wakulima wa mahindi na ngano ili waweze kupanda mahindi na ngano nyingi zaidi. Wakulima wa ngombe wa maziwa wameondolewa kodi na vile vile, ni lazima wakulima wa mahindi na ngano pia wafanyiwe hivyo hivyo. Najua kwamba wakulima wa ngano na mahindi wanauliza ni kwa nini wao wanaendelea kutozwa kodi wakati wakulima wengine hawatozwi kodi? Kwa wakati huu bei ya mbolea imepanda juu zaidi na wakulima hawawezi kupata faida ikiwa kodi hii haitaondolewa. Hata kama kodi hii ni shs.l/- kwa kila gunia la mahindi, kodi hii ikiondolewa, itakuwa faida kwa mkulima. Tungetaka Serikali iondoe kodi hii ili wakulima wapatiwe moyo wa kufanya kazi. Hiki ni kitu ambacho ningetaka kuona Serikali ikiondoa na kutafuta mbolea ya bei nafuu. Hii ni kwa sababu ehakula ni kitu muhimu zaidi kwa sababu kama mtu hajakula hawezi kufanya kitu kingine choehote.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, najua kwamba kila mtu anafurahia Bajeti hii, isipokuwa swala la sukari ambayo bei yake imeongezeka hivi kwamba watu hawawezi kuinunua. Tena kuna watu wengine ambao wanawatia watu woga kwa kuwaambia kwamba sukuari inayoagizwa kutoka nje inaleta ugonjwa. Kwa hivyo, watu hawainunui kwa sababu wanasema wakiitumia wanaumwa na kichwa. Lakini nimewaambia sukari hiyo haina makosa yoyote kwa sababu tumeitumia na hatujaona ubaya wowote. Kwa hivyo, nimewaambia wainunue.Ningependa kumuunga mkono Waziri Msaidizi waUstawi wa Mifugo kwamba National Council of the Churches of Kenya (NCCK) wamewaharibia viongozi wengine majina kwa kusema kwamba viongozi hao wana vikosi vya askari, ingawa hawajaenda katika sehemu zinazohusika kujionea. Yote waliyopitisha huko Limuru ni ya uwongo. Tena, mbali na Makamu wa Rais na Waziri wa Fedha, Prof. Saitoti, viongozi wengine wote waliotajwa ni Wakalenjin. Sasa, njirani ya Prof. Saitoti ni Bw. Rono, ambaye ni mwanariadha, na watu fulani walienda katika nyumba yake, wakamfunga bibi yake na mtoto na wakawachoma. Hawa walikuwa Wakalenjin? Inawezekana Mkalenjin kumuua Mkalcnjin mwinginc? Kwa hivyo, hawa watu wa NCCK, ambao tunafikiria ni wanakanisa wa kweli, wamewah;uibia watu wengine majina. Wao ni mashetani tu na si kitu kingine. Wametufanya wengine tusiwe na iamani na kanisa. Hata mimi sasa nitatoka katika kanisa Katolcki; nitaanza kuomba peke yangu kwa sababu naamini Mungu yuko. Hata maaskofu wenyewe wamekuwa watu wa uongo. Si ajabu basi kuona kasisi akifungwa kortini kwa ajili ya kuiba. </Newspeech><Newspeech>An. Hon. Member: Kasisi gani huyo? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Industry (Mr. arap Chepkok): Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, mwenzangu anasoma magazeti kila siku na kaona visa kama hivi. Pengine sehemu yake haina mambo kama haya, lakini kuna mmoja katika sehemu yake ambaye alifungwa wakati fulani.Hiki ndicho kitu ambacho hatuwezi kuamini. Wamemtaja mhe Bomett ambaye kwake ni Rongai na hana shamba huko Molo. Hata kama akiweka kikosi cha askari hapo kwake Rongai watafikaji huko Molo?Pia nitigependa kuwaonya watu wa Ford ambao wanawapeleka watu kujiandikisha kama wapiga kura katika wilaya sizizo zao. Huwezi kufanya hivi kwa sababu vita vitatokea. Hata mimi siwezi kulikubali jambo hili; mtu akilijaribu kutakuwa na vita. Nawaambia wauache mtindo huu kabisa; tunataka wakazi wa kila wilaya wajiandikishe katika wilaya yao ili uchaguzi utapokuja wamchague mtu wanayemtaka.Pia nilisoma majuzi katika magazeti kwamba tuna wakimbizi huko Uganda, lakini sijamsikia balozi wetu huko Uganda akisema tuna wakimbizi huko Uganda. Hao ni wale waliopelekwa mafunzoni huko na vyama vya upinzani ili waje kuanzisha matata katika nchi hii. Kama wangekuwa wakimbizi wangepelekwa huko magharibi mwa Uganda na si hapa Tororo. Tena, kwa nini balozi wetu hajatuambia kwamba kuna wakimbizi. Badala ya watu hao kwenda Libya sasa wamebaki Uganda. Tunaambiwa hao ni wakimbizi ili tuwapelekee chakula wakale huko.kwa hayo machache, naunga mkono. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kipkorir: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to support the Motion. This was a very encouraging Budget where the ordinary mwananchi has benefited from all tax reductions. I would like the Government to reduce the price of certified seeds. The common man has a problem because the price of seeds has gone up. The Government should reduce this price to enable the common mwananchi to buy the seeds and produce more food for both consumption and the market.I would alsp like to ask the Government to reduce the price of medicines, particularly the price of the meningitis drug. Many people have suffered from this disease but when they go to hospital they are told that there is no medicine, even though this disease has occurred all over the country. It would be of great importance if the price could be reduced so that mcdicine could be available all over the country. There are some particular areas where when there is an outbreak of a disease the doctors are able to tteat only a few people. Efforts should be made to ensure that there is total control of any outbreak of disease.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this time the Government has considered to reduce some taxes so as to make the mwananchi happy. This is in line with the Government policy of minding the welfare of others. It is the policy of the Kanu Government to give services to all Kenyans. When we are in this House we speak for the whole country. Therefore, it is very necessary that we talk of development issues and consider constructing modern things, particularly in the rural areas. It is also very important to remember that the Kanu Government lias considered it fit to create the district development committees and to give them money to develop the rural areas. This House has given the money and we expect the Treasury and the various Ministries to consider the ongoing projects, particularly roads. Our people need to travel in their small cars to various parts of the country, and the time has now come for the Government to make sure that all money given to lite various Ministries is used properly.Mr. Temporary Deputy Spekaer, Sir, Kenya needs obedient people. If you are appointed to run a particular Ministry, you should make sure that all projects are implemented and proper records are kept Government officers must be very honest. It was the decision of Kenyans at Independence that people must live together. My surprise is that when multi-partysm was introduced in the country people started fighting all over. This has proved to Kenyans that multi- partysm has created chaos. If you talk of the Democratic Party of Kenya (DP), it is a party of a particular group. We would like to remain in Kanu because the Kanu Government is for everybody including the opposition. We would like Kenyans to register in Kanu, and I am appealing to the Registrar of Persons to ensure that no Kenyan is left out without an identity card. I was shocked at the beginning of this year when I realised that there were thousands of eligible wananchi in my constituency who have not been registered. I am appealing to Mr. Kihara, who is in charge of the registration, to ensure that more people are issued with identity cards, particularly in my constituency, where my people have not been registered and, therefore, cannot vote. All Kenyans should be registered for the next general elections. Kenyans all over the country are complaining that they have not been issued with identity cards, and I am appealing to the Office of the President to release the money for registration purposes immediately before the registration exercise is closed.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the period given by the Electoral Commission for registration is very short and, therefore, many people may not be able to register themselves. Identity cards should be issued free of charge so that all eligible Kenyans are registered. I am appealing to district commissioners to assist in this exercise because. </Newspeech><Newspeech>AR boa. Member: Identity cards are free! </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kipkorir: I know that they are free because the President directed that they should be issued free of charge, but they are not being given out. Chiefs and assistant chiefs should assist in ensuring that identity cards are issued to all eligible Kenyans.Mr. Temporary' Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is up to the Christians if they are paid to tell lies. On our part, we shall continue looking after the welfare of Kenyans and asking them to unite and forget about foreigners who come here and tell them to be Christians, which turns out to be complete lies. I am appealing to elders in this country to realise that God is there. If Christians have turned to lying, then they should realise that the end of the world will come for everybody and judgment will be there for everybody. Whoever is going to lie will also face the same judgment even if they are bishops. I hope that Kenyans have learned the interests of multi-partysm and that they will unite under the Kanu Government. It is also my hope that Kenyans will continue to be committed to love, peace and unity, a philosophy which was founded by the father of this country. We shall not deviate from what the late Kenyatta told us, that we should unite under Kanu.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir, I beg to support the Motion. </Newspeech><Header>ADJOURNMENT</Header><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mureithi): Hon. Members, it is now time for the intermption of Business and the House is, therefore, adjourned until tomorrow, Wednesday 17th, at Nine o'clock. </Newspeech>The House rose at 6.30 p.m.
