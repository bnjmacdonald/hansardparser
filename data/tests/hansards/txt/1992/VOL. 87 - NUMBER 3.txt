Jalang'o)NOTICE OF MOTION<HEADER>ADOPTION OF 1989/90 PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE REPORT</HEADER><Newspeech>Mr. Jalang'o: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to give Notice of the following Motion:-THAT, the House adopts the Report of the Public Accounts Committee on the Accounts of the Government of Kenya for the year 1989/90 laid on the Table of the House on 3rd June, 1992. </Newspeech>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS<i>Question No.228</i><HEADER>BANKS' BRANCHES IN NYAMIRA DISTRICT</HEADER>Mr. A.H.O. Momanyi asked the Vice-President and Minister for Finance when the Kenya Commercial Bank and the National Bank of Kenya will open branches in Nyamira District in order to serve the residents of this district.<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance (Mr. Kariuki): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Kenya Commercial Bank has been operating a mobile bank service in Nyamira since 1987. I am very happy to announce that as a result of the very encouraging business prospects in the district the Bank has alreadymade arrangements to upgrade the mobile bank unit into a full-time branch in order to serve the residents of the district more effectively. The Bank and this is where we would request the help of the hon. Member is in the process of acquiring suitable premises in Nyamira for this purpose.Similarly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National Bank of Kenya proposes to open a branch in Nyamira sometime next year. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. A.H.O. Momanyi: Mr. Speaker, Sir, next year is very far away. We have a branch of Kenya National Trading Coiporation there and these people collect about KShs.l million every day. It is a risk to transport KShs.l million from Nyamira to Kisii about 40 kilometres away is a great risk. It is also very inconvenient for businessmen to transfer their from Nyamira to Kisii. Shopkeepers in Nyamira have no customers because when people like teachers go to withdraw their money from banks in Kisii District do their shopping their. So, I urge the Assistant Minister to make sure that we have a permanent branch there instead of the mobile bank unit that we have at the moment. This should be done this month or next month. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kariuki: If I may repeat myself, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said that Nyamira is not going to get a mobile branch. It is going to get a full branch; in concrete. We are looking for suitable premises and the hon. Member can assist us to locate suitable premises. We will do that as soon as we get the premises. </Newspeech>                 <i>Question No.188</i>                     <HEADER>ASSISTANT CHIEFS FOR FAFI</HEADER>Mr. Salat asked the Minister of State, Office of the President:-(a)	whether he is aware that Bulagolol and Gubis Sub- locations in Hulugho Division do no thave assistant chiefs; and(b)	when he will advertise and recruit the assistant chiefs. <Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Mr. Onyancha): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.I am aware that Bulagolol and Gubis sub-locations in Hulugho Division do not have assistant chiefs. I have already advertised the posts and recruitment will be done as soon as the interviews are over. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Salat: Thank you. </Newspeech><i>Question No.235 </i><HEADER>PENSION PAYMENT FOR MR. GUTU</HEADER>Mr. Wakole alimuuliza Waziri wa Nchi, Ofisi ya Rais ni kwa nini Askaji wa Utawala, Bw. Omar Gutu, wa huko Hola, Wilaya ya Tana-River, hajalipwa haki yake ya uzeeni ya kila mwezi tangu alipostaafu mwaka juzi, 1990, na ataanza kulipwa lini. <Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Mr. Kikwai): Bw. Spika, naomba kujibu.Bw. Omar Gutu ambaye alikuwa Askari wa Utawala Nambari ya kazi 160827 alilipwa haki yake ya uzeeni kwa jumla ya Kshs.43,200/- na anaendelea kulipwa Kshs.360/- kila m^ezi kama malipo yake ya uzeeni. Atapokea malipo mengine kuhusiana na Workmen's Compensation Scheme wakati atakapowasilisha Fomu LD1041 ikiwa imejazwa kamili na kutiwa sahihi na Mkuu wa Wilaya yake. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wakole: Bw. Spika, namshukuru Waziri Msaidizi kwa jawabu lake. Ni kweli kwamba Bw. Omar Gutu alipokea kiasi cha kwanza cha Kshs.43,200/- lakini si kweli kwamba mtu huyo anaendelea kupokea Kshs.360/- kila mwezi. Yeye halipwi cho chote kila mwezi. Kwa hivyo ingefaa Waziri Msaidizi alifafanue jambo hili. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kikwai: Bw. Spika, Bw. Omar Gutu alipokea malipo ya kwanza kupitia hundi nambari 249411 ya tarehe 28.8.91. Alilipwa Shs.43,200/-. Nimearifiwa kwamba anaendelea kupokea kiasi cha Kshs.360/- kila mwezi. Lakini ikiwa Bw. Omar hapati cho chote basi nitalichunguza jambo hilo tena. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wakole: Bw. Spika, Waziri Msaidizi amelipotosha Bunge. Hapo awali alisema kwamba Bw. Omari anaendelea kupokea haki yake kila mwezi baada ya kulipwa kiasi cha kwanza cha Kshs.43,200/-. Mimi ninajua kwamba mwaka jana mwezi wa Novemba na Desemba alikuwa hapa Nairobi akijaribu kulifuatilia jambo hilo. Alikwenda katika Ofisi ya Rais na vile katika Ofisi ya Makamu wa Rais na Wizara ya Fedha lakini hakufanikiwa. Watoto wake leo wako katika hali mbaya. Yeye hawezi kuwalipia karo watoto wake. Kwa hivyo ningetaka Waziri Msaidizi alieleze Bunge hili ni hatuagani za dharura ambazo atachukua kuona kwamba Bw. Omar Gutu amelipwa pesa zake. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kikwai: Bw. Spika nitafanya uchunguzi na kama hajalipwa malipo yake ya KSh.360/= kila mwezi Wizara itamulipa mara moja. </Newspeech><i>Question No. 245</i><Header> EMPLOYMENT OF FOOD HANDLERS</HEADER>Mr. Makhanu asked the Minister for Health:-(a)	whether he is aware that there are foreigners in this country who are employed by various institutions as food handlers; and(b)	if the reply to (a) is in affirmative, could he order that these personnel be examined and given medical certificates without the requirements of a Kenyan identity card.<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Health (Mr. Ogur): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to give the following reply.Sir, the Minister is not aware, however, he wishes to take this opportunity to inform Kenyans that all personnel engaged in food handling at any institutions whatsoever are required by law to undergo periodic medical check ups and examinations to determine their state of health. If they are found to be healthy, then they should be issued with a valid medical certificate irrespective of whether or not they have Kenyan identity cards. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for that reply, I would like to inform him that hon. Members of Parliament who come from border districts have witnessed this experience. For example, in Bungoma District, we have a lot of Ugandan ladies working in bars and hotels, whether against the law or not, they are there. When they go for medical check up the health personnel ask them for their identity cards and if they do not have it they are send away. In most cases they fear going to public health hospitals because they fear being arrested. Will the Minister assure us that these personnel will be identified and examined because from the layman's point of view they are responsible for the spreading of certain diseases in those areas? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are certain cases which are localized in a way that if someone is becoming naughty in his job and does not want to feel comfortably with the community he is working with, I hope the hon. Member would inform our officers to get these persons to do what is correct. We would feel very happy about somebody handlingfood for this nation especially where food involves our guests, that the food ought to be clean including its handling. Whoever is handling the food ought to be a person who has good characters. If he is a doubted character we request the hon. Member to assist us in identify these particular persons who does not have identity cards because we do not want to deal with people whom we did not know their background and so on and also the type of food he/she is supposed to handle. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I mentioned about food handling which also includes beverages because most of the bar waitresses who sell sodas and beers in border districts infiltrate from across the border. In Bungoma, we have quite a number of Ugandan ladies who do not have a medical certificate. I am therefore, asking the Ministry to ensure that his clinical personnel go out of their way notwithstanding the ownership of identity cards to examine these ladies because this is a general complaint in the border districts? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member is quite correct and I do agree with his idea that we ought to handle all foods stuffs with care because anyone coming whatever direction of our border should be giving us food that we are sure is fit for human consumption. By that I do not mean that food coming from across the border is bad, but we ought to know who the source and handler of such food is. In this case therefore, the hon. Member will assist this Government and my Ministry in particular that such persons be known by our health officers at that particular point so that they know the type of food our people and visitors are going to eat. I totally agree with the interest and concern that hon. Makhanu has shown and will try to pass his message. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Under the food and drugs regulations there is a rule which requires all food handlers working in various institutions or food processing plants and so forth to be examined as medically fit and healthy to handle food. Is it in order for the Assistant Minister to request hon. Makhanu to identify people of that kind when there is a law to that effect? Is it the Ministry's failure to implement the law, or is it due to their ignorance? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did not want to be in contraction with what the hon. Member had expressed in this House. In as far as drinks are concerned, somebody running a wholesale shop might sale up to 10 crates of soda for a sports day occasion which will later on be sold. This can be impromptu and an oversight which we may not be able to cope up with that kind of need at a particular situation in a given day. I therefore, request assistance from the hon. Member not because we are unable to do all that is required. We are able, but we want to include all citizens of this country.Anybody handling butchers or other foods stuffs are supposed to be clean to a certain standard, but theremay be a mistake somewhere. This is why we allow for assistance from citizens of this country so that we guard against any problems of such kind. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Will I be in order to refuse the responsibility the Assistant Minister is giving me to identify these women because that is not my role?(Applause)As a hon. Member of Parliament, I have played my role by bringing this matter to his attention. Can he therefore, direct his personnel in the field to carry out this exercise because the situation is still on the ground that these ladies do not have medical certificates to confirm that they are fit to handle food? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no specific incidence regarding, an area or case that is before discussion of this House today. We are talking in general in order for this nation to be careful in handling of food and beverages. I was therefore, being generous by welcoming the hon. Member to assist. Otherwise, as you know the Ministry of Health is very careful about the food given to this nation. In this case therefore, I will pass a word specifically to the area which the hon. Makhanu represents to be more careful because there are some people who may not be up to the standards required by this nation in handling food and beverages. This message is going to be immediately passed over to my Ministry down to the level that can look after this nation. Thank you. </Newspeech><i>Question No. 164</i><Header> EXTENSION OFFICERS IN UASIN GISHU</HEADER>Dr. Misoi asked the Minister for Agriculture: -(a)	how many agricultural extension officers have been posted during the last three years (1989¬1991) to Kasses and Ainabkoi Divisions in Uasin Gishu District; and(b)	what their daily itinerary is and what indicators does the Ministry have to confirm that they are working.<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Agriculture(Mr. Kones): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a) During the last three years, 1989-1991, two assistants agricultural officers have been posted to Ainabkoi while two other assistant agricultural officers have been posted to Kasses in addition to those already in the area. Ainabkoi Division currently has25 personnel while Kasses has 22 personnel.(b) These front-line extension officers have daily route maps which they follow while performing their duties. This makes it easier to check whether these personnel are performing their duties. There are also weekly supervision and visits to the locations by the divisional personnel as well as by district personnel to the divisions. Since the beginning of 1991/92 financial year, there have been 109 such supervision visits to-date. Other indicators include timely learned, operations, use of certified seeds and other recommended inputs by the farmers. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: I thank the Assistant Minister for that answer. But I am not sure whether it is practical. It was only last week that one of the officers visited my small shamba, and I wondered whether he did it due to this Question. Can the Assistant Minister present us with the daily or weekly route map? How does it look like? Does it depend on the officer concerned to make it, or is there a format to be followed? Which is which? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kones: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a format to be followed. It is in the office and I do not have a copy of it here. But if he insists, I can make a copy available to him. </Newspeech><i>Question No. 142</i><Header> NUMBER OF PLANNED TEACHERS COLLEGES</HEADER>Mr. Okondo asked the Minister for Education how many teacher training colleges are planned for the next five years, and:-(a)	how many of them are for technical teachers' training; and(b)	where each one will be located and chronologically.<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Education (Mr. Omido): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a)	Four teacher training colleges are planned for the next five years.(b)	The four primary teacher training colleges will be located in the following areas:-Garissa  2; Kitui  3; Voi (Taita Taveta District)  4; and Kibabii in Bungoma District  4. All the four colleges will be for primary school teacher training. The Garissa College will be intended to </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ekidor: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, "Sir. Kitui Teachers College has already been built. Is the Assistant Minister, therefore, not misleading the House? Are we building another college there? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Omido: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member does not come from Kitui. In fact, Kitui Teachers College has not yet been built. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ekidor: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker,Sir. This Question is a property of this House. Is the Assistant Minister in order to tell me that I do not come from Kitui? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Omido: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Garissa Teachers College will be ready to take in students during 1993/94 financial year. Kitui Teachers College will also be ready for students during 1994/95 financial year. The construction of both colleges is already in progress. However, plans are already under-way for the construction of Voi Teachers College. But the construction of Kibabii Teachers College in Bungoma District has not yet started. The Government is currently negotiating with the African Development Bank (A.D.B.) for funds for the construction of this college. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mcharo: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was announced very authoritatively at one time that the construction of Taita Taveta Teachers College would start some time in November, last year. But up to now, it has not yet started. Yet the Assistant Minister says that plans are under-way. Why has it not started? How far are these plans to actually start the construction work? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Omido: Mr. Speaker, Sir, owing to financial constraints it was not possible to start the construction work of the college earlier. However, construction work of this college should begin at any time now. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: Arising out of the Assistant Minister's reply, can he agree that plans for technical teachers colleges represent very low level, or too few colleges in the country. So he should increase their number as soon as possible to meet the demand. When is he going to do that? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Omido: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the construction of technical training institutions and colleges is not the responsibility of my Ministry; it falls under the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. If that is the case, then why did the Ministry undertake to answer the Question? They should have referred it to the relevant Ministry. Is that in order? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Omido: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Question also relates to the number of teacher training colleges which concerns my Ministry, and I have given the number. Therefore, the other part of the Question should be forwarded to the relevant Ministry. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kubo: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think the Assistant Minister is misleading the House. The idea behind this Question is whether the Minister has taken into account the fact that most of these teachers are not well paid to teach technical subjects. Therefore, what action is the Ministry taking to make sure that teachers are trainedto teach technical subjects which are also taught in primary schools? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Omido: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am afraid that is a totally different question and for another Ministry. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have plans for building four teacher training colleges and these are very few. The demand is much higher than that. What is he doing about that? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Omido: The Ministry runs about 20 teacher training colleges in the country. Four are already ready and it will bring the number to 24. We are operating within a financial budget and, therefore, we have financial constraints. In fact, 20 colleges is not a small number. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Anaswa: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant Minister's reply, could he tell us how many students per intake, will these four colleges take? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Omido: Mr. Speaker, Sir, each college is supposed to take 480 students per intake. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr.Okondo: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 1984, we were promised a teachers training college in Busia District, but I do not see it listed here. Since, 1984, it is now eight years and I would like the Assistant Minister to indicate when this is going to be done. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Omido: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Education would like to establish a college in every district and Busia wiH definitely be considered when we have sufficient funds. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr.Okondo: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant Minster's reply that the Ministry of Education will establish teachers training colleges when they have funds, would he specifically address himself to the promise that his Ministry made to us in 1984 that they would establish a teacher training college in Busia. Why has the Ministry so far not made any arrangements to build this college? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Omido: Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is aware of the needs of Busia District regarding the establishment of a teacher training college there. This will be taken into consideration as sobn as we are in a position to do so. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kubo: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant Minister's earlier reply that the reason why they could not build a teacher training college in Taita Taveta District by November this year is due to shortage of funds. Could he indicate in this House whether they have now acquired the funds or not? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Omido: Yes, Sir, we have the funds. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the Assistant Minister is avoiding the question of technical teacher training. In the 8-4-4 programme, there is a provision for technical training. How come that the Ministry is not doing anything to establish technical teacher training colleges? Saying that I should take the question to another Ministry is not assisting me in any way. Why can he not take that part of question to therelevant Ministry so that the Ministry can reply on their behalf? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Omido: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we only undertake technical training for specific subjects in the ordinary teacher training colleges, but we do not construct technical teacher training colleges. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: On a point of information, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I would like to inform the hon. Assistant Minister that wananchi in my constituency have already raised some shs.319,000/- and on 4th July, there will be a Harambee meeting to contribute money towards the purchase of the required land on which to put up a teacher training college. So, the Ministry should go ahead with its plan to provide the money. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Omido: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the hon. Member for informing the House that the question of land has now been settled. I would like to inform him that currently, negotiations for funds are still going on and very soon, we will be able to give out the funds to start the college. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a critical issue regarding job creation and economic growth. Would the Assistant Minister please pass that part of the question to the appropriate Ministry to be given an answer next week? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Omido: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think that is the responsibility of the Clerk to the National Assembly. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Next Question, Mr. Lotim! </Newspeech><i>Question No.242 </i><HEADER>TELEPHONE SERVICES FOR ALALE DIVISION</HEADER>Mr. Lotim asked the Minister for Transport and Communication:-(a)what is delaying the provision of telephone services to the people of Alale division, and(b)since all Kenyans need telephone services, what immediate: action the Ministry is taking to provide the people of the said division with this vital service.<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Transport and Communication (Mr. Mutwol): Mr. Speaker, Sir, the answer I have with me here is not satisfactory and I would like to ask the House more time to give the House a more satisfactory answer on Tuesday next week. </Newspeech>(Question deferred)<Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Mr. Ndirangu's Question. </Newspeech>                                                                           <i>Question No.202</i><HEADER>ROOFING OF GACHIKA MARKET</HEADER>Mr. Ndirangu asked the Minister for Local Government whether he could consider roofing Gachika Market in Nyeri Town in order to provide shelter for the hawkers and traders in this market.<Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: The Minister for Local Government is not here? That Question will be deferred. </Newspeech>(Question deferred) POINTS OF ORDER<HEADER>SECURITY SITUATION IN ISIOLO DISTRICT</HEADER><Newspeech>Mr. Jaldesa: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I rise to raise a matter regarding the security situation in Isiolo District. During the month of May this year, 26 people were killed in my constituency in Isiolo District and 16 heard of cattle taken to Garissa District. As a result, we requested the Government to send armed forces to Isiolo and in compliance to our request, Government send 78 army officers to carry our patrol in this area with a view to bringing the culprits to book. Unfortunately, on 26th of last month, these army officers went to a placed called Makandaka in my constituency and started shooting everybody and as a result a civil servant and a primary school teacher were killed. This is a very sad affair and what is even more surprising is that when this incident took place, there were administration police, an assistant chief and others. This incident was done during the day and I think it is a very brutal and unfortunate incident. This is not the first time that something like this has happened in this area. Last year somebody was killed by army Major and no action was taken against this major. When he was summoned by the district officer, he refused to write a statement We are now in a situation where we do not know what to do. The bandits are killing us and taking our animals and then those who are sent by the Government to protect us start killing us. In connection with this, I would like to call upon the Minister in charge of internal security to carry out investigations into this incident and report back to this House with a thorough Ministerial statement telling us exactly why this happened. </Newspeech><HEADER>PRAYER MEETING BY THE CATHOLIC BISHOPS OF KENYA IN ELDORET</HEADER><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I rise on a point of order to say something about the proposed prayer meeting by the Catholic Bishops of Kenya in Eldoret on 7th June, 1992, to play for thevictims of the recent tribal clashes. The leaders of Eldoret and Uasin Gishu welcome and appreciate the proposed prayers. However, we hope and trust that they will confine themselves to praying for peace, unity and reconciliation. I am saying this because going by their past utterances, we are worried and apprehensive that these bishops may use Eldoret to continue with their uncalled for attacks against the Kenya Government and the President of Kenya. We know of a few bishops lead by the Catholic Bishop of Nakuru Bishop Ndingi, who recently predicted the collapse of the Kenya Government. We also know that other bishops have made very damaging remarks against certain leaders in this country. We would like to caution these men of God not to abuse</Newspeech><Newspeech>Hon. Members: They are not men of God; they are the devil. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: Mr. Speaker, Sir, they claim to be God in quiet. We would wish to caution these bishops not to abuse the hospitality, peace and tranquillity of Eldoret and Uasin Gishu people. Further, they should desist and avoid their usual distasteful remarks against the Kenya nation. In fact, if they intend to use Eldoret to launch or promote politics of destruction, division, confusion, or promote parties of their choices then they risk very harsh reaction from the people of the area. If they wanted to serve the people who have suffered because of these clashes it would have been better for them to hold these prayers in conflict areas so that they so that they would be able to minister to the people directly affected and give them assistance directly.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we call upon our Bishop in the Eldoret Diocese to ensure that his counterparts from outside his Diocese take note of the feelings of the people of that area. </Newspeech>MOTION<HEADER>APPROVAL OF DRAFT ELECTIONS REGULATIONS, 1992</Header>THAT, pursuant to Section 34 of the National and Presidential Elections Act (Chapter 7 of the Laws of Kenya) this House approves the draft Presidential and Parliamentary Elections Regulations, 1992 laid on the Table of this House on the 2nd June, 1992.(The Attorney-General on 2.6.92)(Resumption of Debate interrupted on 2.6.92<Newspeech>The Minister for Health (Mr. Nyagah): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to continue from where I stoppedyesterday. As at the close of business yesterday I had started on Section 30 of the Paper laid on the Table by the Attorney-General. This was on page 26 and I want to make just short comments on that item. In Section 30, subsections 2 and 3 the Attorney-General explained very well that if a vote got into the wrong box there will be one box for the parliamentary election and one for the Presidential election  it will be sorted out amicably and put into the right place. So, I congratulate him on this very wise advice to the people that will be dealing with it.However, I am a little worried about the punishment for those people who make a mistake in the elections. He has imposed a very high penalty of shs50,000/-. If anyone is found guilty of an offence he will is liable to a fine not exceeding shs50,000/-. That sounds all right, but why do we not have something like this "a fine of not less than shs10,000/- and not more than shs50,000/-"? This is leaves it quite open. Suppose a judge decides to fine somebody shs3/- or shs10/- that will not be a deterrence. It will be a good thing to a minimum amount or an alternative. What will happen to somebody who cannot raise a fine of shs50,000/-? One who have expected that if one cannot raise a fine of shs50,000/- he will get imprisoned for a period - it does not matter how long as long as it is stipulated.Mr. Speaker, Sir, Section 34 deals with the procedure at the close of the polls. On page 29 the Section states:-"The person in charge of the boxes will allow a candidate or an agent if he so desires to affix a seal to the packet or box."I would like to go a little further. These boxes have fixed locks and I would like to add a padlock to the seal. I did once when things were really bad; I had a seal and a padlock. So, in Section 34 I would like to see a little padlock added to the seal.Section 36(l)(a) reads:"At the counting of votes at an election any ballot paper:-(a) which does not bear the official mark; shall, subject to paragraph (2), be void and shall not be counted. Who fault is it that the paper was not stamped. An illiterate comes and is given a ballot paper and he has no business to check whether the paper has been stamped or not. I think a thing like this should be considered so that the fault is not placed on the voter. It is too much of a punishment to the person who had the vote cast for him. (c) of the same section says:- "on which any thing is written or so marked as to be uncertain for whom the vote has been cast" shall also have the vote discarded. Again it is possible that illiterate person will get a vote card that has been tempered with by someone. Why should we punish the person for whom that vote has been cast. Again nobody can ascertain whether the writing is by the voter. I think the Attorney-General should look into this one.I am glad that section 40 has provided for announcing of the Presidential candidates votes at the polling station as scored in that particular polling station. We should find a way of ensuring that the man who gets more votes does not have his votes reduced and the man who gets least votes does not have his least number of votes increased. There should be a way of ensuring that what was announced as scores for a Presidential candidate at a particular polling station is not tempered with; and if tempered with there must be a way of find out whether there has been any tempering at a stage before they come to the Electoral Commission.Mr. Speaker, Sir, finally, I will go to paragraph 41 on page 34. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. This paper contains Presidential and Parliamentary Election Regulations. I know it is in conformity with the amendments we made recently with regard to the Constitution. But some of us feel that the procedure needs to be taken to a committee within the manner prescribed by the Standing Orders so that certain amendments could be brought to this House for consideration. If you look at Standing Order 103, although it talks of a Bill I fell that this Motion should be committed to a committee so that we consider the procedure. I feel that electing a President who has countrywide majority but does not have the command of the House is superfluous. So, we feel this Motion should be brought to the committee of the House so that we devise a good and acceptable method. There is no use in having a President who has countrywide majority and then he his party has only 10 Members of Parliament. So, there I think there is need for us to commit this Motion to the committee of the House in Chambers. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Mr. Nyagah, continue. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am entitled to a reply from the Chair. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Order! Hon. Members, I am still studying this particular Standing Order which specifically refers to a Bill. It so happens that what is before the House now is a Motion and I need time to study it. In the meantime, the hon. Nyagah can continue with his contribution. I will give a reply in due course. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Health (Mr. Nyagah): Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am dealing withSection 41(1) of the Presidential and Parliamentary Elections Regulations, 1992 Arrangement of Regulations and it reads as follows:-"All documents relating to an election shall be retained in safe custody by the returning officer for a period of six months after the results of the elections have been declared and shall then, unless the Electoral Commission or an election court otherwise directs, be destroyed."My worry here is that the returning officer is supposed to keep all these documents in safe custody. Supposing the returning officer does not have a safe custody like a strong room or box since he is not a district commissioner  how are we going to ensure that this person will keep these documents in a safe place? I think there should be an alternative way of saying "He shall ensure that these documents are kept in a safe place be in the district or provincial commissioner's office or in a bank where they will be safe" than saying "He shall keep them safe " when he as no safe place to keep them.I said yesterday that it is my hope and prayer that the Electoral Commission members will be allowed to have their freedom so that they can be fair, impartial and as independent as possible. I will go a little further and [ say that they are Kenyans and they know that Kenyans want peace, progress and development throughout the country. Anything that might come in their way and which they think may not be in the national interest, they should not be afraid of not implementing it just because they are afraid of the electors, the Government or anybody.Finally, the elections of this kind of one man one vote, are now on us and we have graduated as Kenyans to that level and I would £lead with all Kenyans, regardless of their parties, to go and register as voters. By not registering, you will be forsaking your country and your right to elect a person of your choice.With these few remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Education (Mr. Karauri): Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me a chance to support this Motion on the National Assembly and Presidential Elections Act. I was here was the Attorney-General was moving this Motion and I would like to thank him for the manner in which he moved it. He moved it eloquently, clearly and he explained all the issues contained in the rules to the understanding of all hon. Members and, I believe, all Kenyans. I only notice that his officers are not here and it is very important that the suggestions that the hon. Members make are taken note of so that in case of necessity of amendments, they can be made with ease.Now that Kenyans are going to elect the President directly, according to these rules </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: We are not! </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Education (Mr. Karauri): I know the hon. Mwamzandi has his own ideas but what is in the rules presently is that the election of the President will be done directly by the people. If that is going to be the case, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must educate our people on facts pertaining to the Presidency. We must not mislead our people like it has happened recently. We have heard utterances about tribal presidency and I would like to say that this will not do this country any good. If a Kenyan feels that he wants to be a President, he will never attain that goal through a tribal vote. There is not tribe in this country that can elect a President alone.Anybody who aspires to be the President of this country we have many opposition parties which will field Presidential candidates - must be a person of integrity, one who can unite Kenyans and one who has no tribal feelings that are detrimental to the unity of Kenyans. This country has been what it has been since Independence because of the unity of Kenyans. Such tribal utterances as "We are a big tribe. It is our turn to lead. The small tribes must lead" are detrimental to our unity. Anybody who talks about tribalism, must be rejected by Kenyans.I believe that if we went by tribes or rotation by tribes and said that this and that tribe has led and it is the turn of this other one to lead, we would be going down the drain. A Kenyan of a Somali origin, a Pokot or a Pokomo or one from any other small tribes, can be a President of this country if he appears to Kenyans to be a person who can unite them and lead .them in a transparent manner and in extreme honesty and accountability. That is the person of person Kenyans would be looking for and not for person from a particular tribe.I want to say this because those who have been talking about tribalism, are not even to be in the Government. In order to be taken seriously, we must be seen to be above tribalism. We should not support tribalism by talking about the</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We know for certain that the person who brought that subject is the hon. Mwangale. The hon. Karauri is now discussing his colleague and this is against our Standing Orders. If he wants to talk about that subject, he should bring a Substantive Motion in order to discuss Mr. Mwangale who is his colleague as a Minister. He is, therefore, out of order to discuss this matter. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Education (Mr. Karauri): I am not discussing an individual, Mr. Speaker £ir. We are discussing these rules which talk about the election of a President. I will also talk about elections of Members of Parliament. I am not discussing an individual, but I am saying that in orderfor us to be seen to be serious in not supporting tribalism, if leaders insist on talking about tribalism, they should not holding those positions of leadership. Kenyans will not believe that we. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We know for certain that the person who said that is hon. Mwangale, and the Assistant Minister is now discrediting him by saying that he should not hold the post he has Ministry of Agriculture. Since he has already discussed the Minister, can he withdraw that? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Education (Mr. Karauri): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not know what the hon. Member understands by discussing a Member of Parliament's character. The matters I am discussing are properly written in these Regulations, and I am stipulating what kind of President Kenya should be looking for. Anybody who talks about tribalism and aspires to be the President because he belongs to a certain tribe is wrong. He is the kind of person who should not even be in leadership. Kenyans need to be led to even greater unity so that we can prosper economically, socially and in anything else that we undertake. I am not discussing a particular individual, but I am saying, without exception, that anybody worth the name of a leader who talks tribalism should not stay in that position of leadership because it continues to mislead Kenyans. When, on the one hand we say that we are above tribalism and we want unity and, on the other hand, leaders continue to say the very opposite of what we preach, then we will not be taken seriously. That is what I am saying.Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the question of polling and registration stations, the Electoral Commission should ensure that these are as near to the people as possible. It is very difficult for certain people to register when it comes to walking a distance of five kilometres. I have in mind the disabled and unhealthy people during the period of either registration or polling. We all know that if one does not register then he cannot vote. Therefore, the Electoral Commission should ensure that these stations are as near the people as possible. They should not retain the same old stations. Our population has been growing since Independence and, therefore, we should keep on increasing the number of polling stations.Also, Sir, I do not know why the Electoral Commission did not consider it a priority to increase the number of constituencies. I say so because some of our constituencies are very large. My constituency is an example. I also know of a constituency like Kitui North, where the Deputy Speaker comes from. There are some constituencies that are as large as some of the districts in this country. I had thought that to allow and to give freedom of vote and choice to every Kenyan, splitting of the larger constituencies would have been taken as a priority, considering that this Parliament enacted a law requiring 22 more constituencies. In any case, if theycannot do it now, we hope they will do it sooner than later. Maybe, when elections are over, the should consider that to be done as soon as possible.Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a shame that some leaders of the opposition parties are now calling on people not to register as voters. This is shocking. These people have been calling for elections. Registration is not going to be done for supporters of Kanu alone. All Kenyans are going to register as voters. It is, therefore, a big shame to hear opposition leaders saying that certain people should not go and register before certain conditions are met. They should be telling the people that the first condition is to register as voters. Let us negotiate later. They should be telling the people that if they do not register in large numbers they cannot elect leaders of their choice. I think these people are scared of an election. These people are not serious. They wanted a multiparty system, which is now here with us. They wanted elections to come very soon. In fact, they wanted elections held, maybe, by February last year and we are now in June. They know that elections are going to be done soon and they are now scared. Telling people not to register is telling them, "We are scared; we do not know whether we are going to win, so do not register."Mr. Speaker, Sir, Kenyans who want this country to prosper must go and register as voters; it is their choice between the opposition and Kanu and between the various parties. They cannot make that choice without the vote. So, anybody who tells the people not to register as voters is an enemy of this country and an enemy of democracy. You cannot advocate democracy and, in the same voice, tell people not to register as voters.The opposition has talked about identity cards. All of us would like people who have matured to the age of 18 to get identity cards. We are aware that over a long period of time there have been difficulties in giving the young people identity cards. It has not been because of the opposition but rather because of financial constraints. Very early in the 1980s we were told that there was a problem in importing the necessary films. I am saying this to tell the opposition that they should not pick on petty issues and appear to champion things that are already being done as if they are the only people who would like the young people to be registered. I, on my part, just as all other Kanu members, would like all the young people to be registered as voters because they are the ones who are going to vote for us. Why should anybody imagine that if the young people are registered they will vote for the opposition? I think the opposition should stop and re-think because we also have support among these young people. We have done a lot as Kanu and as individual Members of parliament for these young people and We know they support us, and we want them to be registered. I, for one, if all the young people in my constituency were registered, I would not be worried about anybody. I know that I would have over 20,000 majority over anybody. We want the opposition to know the difficulties in giving identity cards to the young people have been there even before the advent of multipartysm, and the Government has done a lot since the multiparty era.Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the past when polling stations were supposed to open at 6 o'clock in the morning, some presiding officers were known to open at 9 o'clock or at 10 o'clock. We want the Electoral Commission to ensure that those people charged with the responsibility of manning polling stations are there on time in order that everybody is given a chance to vote. If the opening time is 6 o'clock, the presiding officers should be there before that time in preparation so that at the closing time everybody has voted. It has been a practice in the past that these officers come late such that by 6 o'clock when the station is closing a lot of people have not voted. In order for fairness to be seen to have been done. The opposition in most of our constituencies are the same people, people you have beaten over and over; people with whom you have shared a platform urging the people to vote for you and the people have always voted for those of us who are here and have rejected the rest. Under the cover of multipartysm, they think the voters will like them because they are talking about a party and not their names. However, people know that even when join another party, you still remain the same person who was competing with me in the last elections. If you are a crook, you do not become clean just by joining another party. So, what we should do is to concentrate on telling our people what the elections are going to look like. Let urge them to wake up from their sleep in their houses to go and register as voters. In that way, they will vote in their best representative, and the question of different parties will not save anybody who would otherwise not come to Parliament.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Electoral Commission should employ sharp, efficient and educated clerks to deal with voters on the voting day. This exercise can, as has happened before, be delayed by a clerk who is very slow. So, we should have clerks who we know are going to push this exercise forward very fast to ensure that nobody complains at the end of the day. The same should apply even at the time of voter registration. We must have people</Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Education (Mr. Omido): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Hon. Members are making very important points regarding this Motion, but it is surprising to note that there is nobody here at the moment from the Attorney-General's office. This is a serious matter. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Education (Mr. Karauri): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I concur with my hon. colleague in that it is important for the Attorney- General to be here at this time. I wish the office of the Clerk of the National Assembly would summon him or his officers.Before I was interrupted, I was saying that we need efficient clerks. During past voter registration, we have seen people who do not know how to spell out other people's names properly. Although they are given national identity cards to register their owners, they read the correct names on these cards, but they misspell them in the register and, on the voting day, people have problems and they cannot vote. What I am saying is that these clerks should be chosen from among young or old people who are efficient and fast. We want everybody to know that we, in Kanu, are ready for elections because we know we have the necessary manpower. If people in other parties are scared of not having the necessary manpower, they will still complain even if elections come next year or the year after.Returning officers will now come from our constituencies. This is a very great thing that has happened in our electoral system. We will no longer have to hire vehicles and travel to our district headquarters. I do not know whether it is expressly mentioned that nomination will also be done at the constituency level. Unless the regulations are silent on this, in my reading thereof, I did not notice this. When the Attorney-General explained about returning officers, I was very happy about it, and this is why I am saying that this a great change in our electoral system. Nomination should also be done in the constituency. If there is a returning officer in the constituency, there is no need for us to go to district headquarters, where you find people who have no interest in your constituency. The things they say there may detrimental to your being elected a representative of your people. Since returning officers are going to be based at the constituency level, nomination also should be done at the same level. Supervision of vote counting is going to be done there, and I do not see why nomination cannot be done there, too.Mr. Speaker, Sir, since there are many other hon. Members who want to contribute to the Motion, with those very few remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Hon. Members, a while ago, hon. Mwamzandi raised the issue of committal of this Motion to the Committee of the whole House. I have studied the matter and found out that, although our Standing Orders do not provide for such committal, except that of a Bill, there is a precedence in which the committal of a Motion dealing with similar regulations was done sometime in 1968 or 1969. However, you will notice that even if this Motion were to be committed to the Committee of the whole House for consideration, item by item, this would have to come at the end of debate. In other words, it would assist debate in the Committee of the whole House if hon. Members would have made their contribution in full earlier so as to be able to- get through the Motion item by item and see how amendments may be brought in. In view of this, we will continue to discuss this matter until we exhaust it and, when I put the Question at the end of this debate, we will decide whether to go into the Committee of the whole House or not. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: Bw. Spika, nimetoa jambo hilo la nidhamu nikitaka Hoja hii izungumziwe na Kamati ya Bunge lote kwa sababu, badala ya kuikataa Hoja kama ilivyo, tungepewa nafasi ya kwenda kuzisoma vizuri sheria hizi. Labda sheria hizi zingekuwa sawa kama tungalikuwa na chama kimoja, lakini sasa tuna vyama vingi. Hivyo, sheria hizi, pamoja na lile badiliko linalohitaji Rais awe akichaguliwa na nchi nzima, haziwezi kufanya kazi sawa. Ikiwa zitafanya kazi nzuri, pengine itahitaji tuwe na Rais ambaye atakuwa alama tu, bila mamlaka ya Serikali. Hapo, itahitaji tuwe na Waziri Mkuu ambaye ndiye atakayekuwa na mamlaka haya. Hata hivyo, tulilikataa pendekezo hili la kuwa na Waziri Mkuu, na Katiba yetu hailikubali. Sheria hizi ni kama zile za United States of America.Ni Rais gani atanayeweza kuchaguliwa leo, halafu akija hapa akute kwamba Wabunge wa chama chake ni 15, lakini wamechaguliwa na chama kingine halafu yeye akapata wingi wa kura. Huyu atakuwa Rais ambaye hawezi kufanya kazi na, hivyo, Bunge litakuwa likivunjwa baada ya kila mwezi na nusu kwa sababu Wabunge hawatakuwa na imani katika Rais huyo.(Applause)Nikichaguliwa na wapiga kura 20, nitarudi hapa, lakini kuna sehemu nyingine, kama vile Nairobi na Kisumu, ambako Mbunge mmoja anaweza kuchaguliwa na watu 70,000. Wapiga kura hawa huenda wakamchagua Rais kutoka katika chama kingine kando ya kile cha Mbunge waliyemchagua. Hapo, utaona kwamba wingi wa kura za Rais wa Bunge hilo utakuwa kidogo kuliko wa yule ambaye hapendwi kwa sababu atakuwa amechaguliwa na watu kutoka sehemu nyingine ambao ni wapinzani wake. Kwa hivyo, huenda yule Rais wa chama fulani ambaye ana wingi wa kura aanguke katika kura za urais, ambapo hatakuwa na maana, na akichaguliwa kuwa Rais, ataliletea Bunge taabu.Bw. Spika, ingefaa hii Regulation itumike katika nchi kama kule Amerika ambako Rais anaweza kuteua Mawaziri wake kutoka mahali popote. Anaweza kwenda barabarani na kuokota watu wawe mawaziri wake. Lakini Katiba yetu inasema kwamba Mawaziri watateuliwakutoka miongoni mwa Wabunge walichaguliwa katika Bunge. Kwa hivyo sheria hii si nzuri kwetu. Kwa hivyo yafaa ichunguzwe. Hii ni kwa sababu tumeanzisha mfumo wa vyama vingi na yule atakayekuwa Rais ni yule atakayekuwa na wafuasi wengi katika Bunge hili. Hii ni kwa sababu ikiwa wewe kama Rais una Wabunge wapatao 150 katika Bunge hili dhidi ya wale wa upinzani wapatao LOO basi utakuwa na mamlaka ya kuiongoza nchi hii. Lakini si vyema kuleta mtu hapa ambaye hana ujuzi wo wote na kumfanya Rais. Hii ni kwa sababu hatakuwa na wafuasi katika Bunge hili.Ninafahamu kwamba tulipoijadili sheria hii mwaka wa 1969 tulikuwa na mfumo wa vyama vingi katika Katiba yetu lakini chama kilikuwa kimoja tu; Kanu peke yake. Kwa hivyo sheria hii haina maana sasa; mimi nichaguliwe na watu watatu waseme "wewe nenda ugombee kiti cha Rais" na nikichaguliwa niwe sina mamlaka yo yote juu ya Bunge hili. Hiyo itakuwa hatari kubwa. Bunge litakuwa likivunjwa baada ya kila miezi sita kwa sababu Rais hatakuwa na imani na Wabunge.Hivi karibuni tutaanza kujiandikisha kama wapiga kura. Ingefaa vituo vya kuwapa watu kadi za kupiga kura viwe karibu na watu iwezekanavyo. Kule kwangu kuna sehemu moja ambayo wakaazi wake hupata taabu nyingi. Hii ni kwa sababu ni jambo gumu sana kutembea umbali wa maili 17 kwenda kumpigia mtu kura. Hata hivyo ijapokuwa wakati wa kupiga kura watu huwa na shauku kubwa ya kumchagua mwakilishi wao lakini huwa. ni shida kubwa sana kutembea umbali kama huo. Lakini utaona kwamba wakati huu watu wa Electoral Commission hawakutupatia nafasi kutoa maoni yetu kuhusu vituo vya kupigia kura na kadhalika. Tungependa vituo kama hivyo viwekwe karibu na watu iwezekanavyo.Bw. Spika, viongozi wa vyama vya upinzani wananistaajabisha. Mara wanawahimiza watu wagomee Madaraka Dei; mara Wanasema watu wagomee kujiandikisha kama wapiga kura. Sijui ni kitu gani wanachokitaka watu hawa. Hawajulikani watakacho. Walikuwa wakisema kwamba yafaa uchaguzi ufanyike mapema iwezekanavyo lakini sasa wanatoa mwito kwa watu wasijiandikishe kama wapiga kura. Je, wanataka nini? </Newspeech><Newspeech>An hon. Member: Wanataka vita! </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: Hawa watu wanajaribu kuwafundisha wananchi mambo yasiyofaa; kutotii sheria. Wanajaribu kuwafanya wananchi wafikiri kwamba nchi hii haina sheria. Sisi viongozi tunawasumbua sana watu wadogo. Hii ni kwa sababu mtu mdogo ana shida; ukimpatia pesa kidogo na umwambie afanye mambo fulani yeye atayafanya mambo hayo. Watu waliambiwa wasiende kazini lakini wakapuuza mwito huo. Lakini wale akinayake wasiokuwa na cho chote, ambao hawana pa kulala wengine hulala kwenye vituo vya kuuza petroli ndio hushawishiwa kufanya uhalifu wa hali ya juu. Kuna haja gani kutarajia kuwa na ghasia ili uweze kupata nafasi ya kupora duka upate jozi moja ya viatu peke yake. Lakini utaona kwamba kwa sababu ya shida, mtu akisikia kwamba kuna fujo yeye hukimbilia kuvunja duka na kupora mali ya watu wengine. Ukibeba televisheni na dunia hii iharibike hiyo televisheni itakuwa na faida gani kwako? Ndugu zetu wa Somali walikuwa watu matajiri lakini leo wao ni maskini; wakimbizi wanao randaranda wakiomba chakula. Watu wa nchi hii wame waweka kwenye mizani hawa viongozi wa vyama vya upinzani. Wananchi wametambua kwamba hamu ya watu wengine katika vyama vya upinzarii ni kutawala tu hata ikiwa ni kwa muda wa siku mbili halafu wafe ndipo waweze kupatiwa state funeral. Kuna Mjaluo mmoja kule Msambweni ambaye anasema "I want Oginga Odinga to become the President so that when he dies he is given a State funeral." Haya ni mambo ya upuuzi mtupu. Tunataka kiongozi ambaye atayaendesha mambo ya nchi hii wala si mtu ambaye haja yake kubwa ni State funeral. Odinga alikataa kuiongoza nchi hii tangu zamani. Hata Bwana Moi hangekuwa Rais wa nchi hii leo. Lakini utaona kwamba kwa sababu ya vituko vyake Odinga alikosa kupata kiti cha Urais wa nchi hii. Odinga amefikia umri mbaya sana. Unaweza kufikiria hatari iliyotukabili wakati Hayati Mzee Jomo Kenyatta alikuwa hawezi kujiamulia mambo kwa sababu ya umri wake mkubwa. Kulikuwa na kikundi cha watu ambao walitawala nchi hii kwa muda wa miaka sita. Kenyatta alikuwa ni kama Mao Tsetung. Kazi ya Hayati Kenyatta ilikuwa ni kuja pale kwangu Msambweni na kupigiwa ngoma na watu halafu aende nyumbani. Wakati huo ilikuwa vigumu sana kumuona Hayati Kenyatta na kushauriana naye. Alikuwa kama vile alivyokuwa Sir Winston Churchill, alipokuwa akifuatwa na wajukuu hadi katika Bunge; watu walikuwa wakienda kuuona utoto wa Sir Winston Churchill kwa sababu kutokana na umri wake walikuwa kama mtoto. Hivyo ndivyo mambo yalivyokuwa hapa Kenya. Watu wengine walitawala bila Rais Hayati Kenyatta kujua ni nini kilikuwa kinatokea. Ni hatari kwa watu wa nchi hii kumchagua Odinga kama Rais wao. Mtafikiri ni yeye ambaye anatawala na kumbe ni kikundi cha watu ambacho kinatawala badala yake. It is too late for him. Nawasikitikia wale wanaompenda kwa sababu ya ukabila na kadhalika.Ningependa kugusia jambo lingine, Bw. Spika. Kule kwetu kuna hoteli ambayo inaitwa Jadini Beach Hotel na vile kuna Safari Park Hotel. Mahoteli haya ni ya Bw. Matiba. Anajidai kwamba yeye ni kiongozi wa kitaifa. Lakini utaona ni vigumu kwa Mdigo kupata kazi katika mahoteli hayo ya Bw. Matiba. Hawa watu tumewapa ardhi yetu. Wanaifurahia bahari yetu ambayo Mungu ametupa. Lakini utaona kwamba wafanyakazikatika mahoteli hayo wametoka sehemu za bara. Wakati wa uchaguzi uliopita magari mengi yakuja sehemu hiyo kuwabeba hawa wafanyakazi ili waende wakapige kura katika sehemu walizotoka. Sisi Wadigo hatuna haja na kazi kubwa. Watu wa sehemu yangu wanahitaji tu kazi ya kufagia na kuleta chakula katika hayo mahoteli. Mambo haya yanatushangaza. Mtu anawadanganya watu. Ni bahati mbaya kwamba unaweza kumdanganya mtu wa kawaida. Lakini huwezi kuwadanganya wale walioelimika. Watu wenye elimu na wale matajiri wamewaweka hawa viongozi wa upinzani kwenye mizani. Hawa watu hawana nia ya kuiongoza nchi hii. Hawa wanaongea juu ya "kurejesha demokrasia". Hiyo demokrasia ilikuwa imekwenda wapi? Sisi watu wa makabila yale mengine twajisikia salama katika uongozi wa Rais zaidi kulikuo ilivyokuwa wakati wa Hayati Mzee Jomo Kenyatta. Hawa watu! Mwanamke Mkikuyu anakuchezea- Siku hizi unaweza kwenda kumuona Rais Moi na mambo yakarekebishwa. Jambo kama hili lilikuwa haliwezekani wakati ule mwingine. </Newspeech><Newspeech>An hon. Member: Pia mwanamke ni mwanadamu! </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: Mwanamke amewekwa kutuzaa sisi lakini hazai bila sisi! We are better of now under President Moi. Tuko na afadhali sasa. Wengine sasa wanaona wivu kwa sababu Rais Moi anaweza kusimama popote na kusikiliza shida na maoni ya wananchi. Watu wengine wanaweza kupumua sasa lakini watu wengine wanataka kuturudisha kule tulikokuwa. Hili ndilo jambo lingine ambalo hawataki. Hii ni mapatano kwa sababu mawaziri wa kabila moja walijiuzulu kwa muda wa mwezi mmoja. Walikuwa wamegonjea nini? Ni afadhali sasa watusikilize nasi. Wao ni wengi - lakini kuna methali moja husema "wingi wa inzi haumalizi mavi". Ingawa ni wengi, si lazima watawale lakini makabila madogo yakichanganyika tutakuwa wengi zaidi kuliko wao. Tunataka Kenya ya amani na haingekuwa si ujasili wa Rais Moi nchi hii ingekuwa ishapasuka kwa sababu mambo madogo kama haya ndiyo yaliyopasua Somalia, Liberia na nchi nyingine. Mungu anatulinda kwa sababu watu wetu hawana mahali pa kwenda machafuko yakizuka. Watakwenda wapi ikiwa watu wa Kenya wanaonewa wivu kila mahali? Kwa hivyo Mungu anawachunga bila wao kujua. Wale wengine ambao wanaofanya fujo wana pasi, wana marafiki aina ya cowboys huko Amerika. Haja ya ukubwa wao ni kuharibi nchi tuu. Lakini pia tunawashukuru wananchi kwa sababu wamefahamu kwamba akili ya wapinzani haina maana ila kuharibi nchi. Wapinzani wasiharibu nchi kwa kusema kwamba wanaletewa ndege. Ningetaka raia wa Amerika waingie ndani ya ndege hizo kwa haraka iwezekanavyo na warudi kwao. Tunajua jinsi ya kupata hizo ndege lakini kwa nini wanaleta fujo? Ningetaka tukae sote pamoja kwa sababu Mwenyezi Mungu ametujalia amani na tunaishi kwa usalama.Bw. Spika jambo lingine la ajabu kuhusu vyama vya upinzani ni kwamba walidai kwamba ni heri uchaguzi ufanywe haraka iwezekanavyo. Wakiambiwa uchaguzi huu uko tayari, hawataki kufanya uchaguzi wa maofisa wa vyama vyao na kila wakati wanatumianeno "interim". Wanataka kwenda katika uchaguzi na vidngozi ambao ni"interim" au wanataka kutuambiaje? Kwa hivyo ni juu ya ofisi ya Mkuu wa Sheria iwapatie viongozi wa upinzani deadline ya kuchaguana. Tumechoka na maneno kama "interim chairmen" yani watu ambao wanaozungumuza bila idhini ya wananchi. We are tired of them! Hata mwenda wazimu anaweza kutengeneza mnVatasi yake na akaenda kwa Registrar kuandikisha chama chake. taikini siku ya uchaguzi ikifika wananchi watachagua wale walio na akili timamu na kuacha yule mwenda wazimu. Wasipofanya uchaguzi hatuwezi kwenda katika uchagunzi mkuu kwa sababu hawa bado ni "interim officials".Bw. Spika, wengine wao wamekwisha kula pesa. Unafikiri tangu walipoanza kufanya campaign Muamerika hajawapa pesa? Unafikiri kwamba hawajapewa pesa na Ford Foundation? Kwa nini watu wao wanapata taabu bila wao kuwafanyia msaada yeyote? Hii ni kwa sababu nia yao sio ya kuongoza nchi ila ni ya kukusanya pesa nyingi iwezekanavyo. Peza ambazo wanazokusanya kutokana na michango wanyofanya wanaziweka katika benki zao. Juzi nilisoma katika gazeti moja kwamba mweka hazina wachama cha FORD alitoa repoti kwamba chama hakina pesa. Si hilo ni tamshi la ajabu? Kwa hivyo ni jukumu letu tuwaangalie hawa watu sana kwa sababu si watu wazuri. Ni juu yetu sisi Wabuge na viongozi wengine kuwambia wananchi wautupilie mbali ule mwito wao kwamba watu wasiende kujiandikisha. Wananchi wa Kenya wameelimika ya kutosha. Juzi walipoambiwa wasihudhulie sherehe za Madaraka Day, wananchi walihudulia sherehe hizo kwa wingi. Wananchi wakishajua akili yako ni "hohe" na ni ya kuharibu, wao wanafanya mambo kwa njia ile ambao haukutarajia. Kwa mfano,hivi majuzi nilkuwa nilikuwa katika kata ya Msambweni na wananchi waliku huko kwa wingi kuhudhulia sherehe za Madaraka Day. Si hilo ni jambo la ajabu? Hawa watu wameelimika na wanajua haja ya wapinzani ni kuwapeleka shimoni ill wapotee kwa mapigano.Bw. Spika kuna haja ya kuyachunguza mapendekezo haya kwa makini kwa sababu mengi yao hayaambatani na Katiba ya Kenya. Hivi majuzi tulibadlilisha Katiba ya Kenya na tukakubaliana kwamba ni lazima Rais achaguliwe na raia. Tulipokuwa tukizungumuza niliwauliza wanzangu: "jamani tulikuwa tumelala au ni ule wakatiki wa akina Kibaki alipokiwa Makaumu wa Rais na tukasema ni lazima mtu fulani afukuzwe kutoka chama cha Kanu? Haya mshartihayawezi kutumiwa katika wakati wa siasa ya vyama vingi. Iko haja ya kuyabadilisha msharti haya na pia kubadilisha Katiba yenyewe ambayo inayosema kwamba Rais ni lazima achaguliewe na raia katika nchi nzima. Jambo hili haliwezekani haiwezekani. Chama cha Kanu hakina wasiwasi kwa sababu Rais Moi atapata kura za kutosha. Lakini ni lazima tulichunguze jambo hili la uchaguzi wa rais kwa sababu leo ni mimi na kesho ni mwingine.Bw. Spika, kama vile nilivyosema hapo mbeleni ni lazima masharti haya yachunguzwe kwa makini na kamati ya Bunge hili. Inafaa tuketi na Mkuu wa Sheria ili tuyachunguze masharti haya. Hakuna haja ya kuharakisha kupitishwa kwa masharti haya. Haya masharti yaliletwa jana na Mkuu wa Sheria alitoa notisi ya Hoja hii jana na mazungumuzo yakaanza. Haraka hii ni ya nini? Wapinzani hawajafanya uchaguzi wa vyama vyao. Kwa nini sisi twaharakishwa mbio ili tupitishe mambo vibaya bila kutafiti sawasawa? Hili ni jambo ambalo linalohusu mwananchi kwa hivyo si jambo la kupelekwa mbio kana kwamba kuna mtu anakufa kwa njaa. Hili ni jambo la kufikiriwa kwa sababu ni jambo ambalo litakuwa na mambo mengi sana. Kwa hivyo hakuna haja ya kupitisha masharti haya haraka kwa sababu sijui mawakili katika ofisi ya Mkuu wa Sheria walikuwa wakifiria nini wakati walikokuwa wakiyatengeneza masharti haya Huu mtindo wa kupeleka mambo ya Kenya mbio haufai kabisa. Kwa mfano wengi wanamlaumu Mtukufu Rais leo. Hi ni kwa sababu gani? Ni wao ndio waliosema "Mzee, unajua hawa watu ukitaka kuwaweza, anayekuudhi ama anayekuingilia ni lazima afukuzwe katika Kanu na Bunge". Si Rais Moi aliyesema mambo haya. Mimi nimekuwa katika Bunge hili kwa muda mrefu sana na ni wao wanaosema mambo haya katika mikutano. </Newspeech><Newspeech>An. Hon. Member: Ni akina nani? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwamzandi: Akina Kibaki. Ukwelini kwamba walifikiri kwamba wanamkinga Rais lakini hawakujua kwamba wanapotosha nchi. Kwa miaka mitatu ilioyopita hili Bunge lilikuwa na mabubu watupu. Mambo yalikuwa yakipitishwa hapa bila kuzungumziwa kikamilifu na Wabunge. Kibaki na wenzake walikuwa wakitoa amri kwamba ukifanya jambo fulani unatolewa mara moja katika chama cha Kanu, Bunge na kadhalika.Bw. Spika, jinsi tulivyomtoa Bw. Koech ni vibaya. Mtu amechaguliwa na watu 45,000 halafu anatolewa na watu sita ama 20 kwa fitina za watu ni vibaya Hiyo haikuwa nia ya Rais wa ChamaNamshukuru Bw. G.G. Kariuki. Anajua kwamba amerudi katika Chama cha Kanu. Lakini sio wale walio na dhambi, na wengine wametoka kidogo katika Bunge hili. Dhambi hizi zikimwingia Mtukufu Rais ni mbaya sana. Kisha mtu anatolewa na kamati ya National Executive ama Governing Council ya Chama cha Kanu. This was wrong. Jambo hili liliifanya Bunge hili kuwa na mabubu wengine. Hata leo Wabunge wengine hawajui kuzungumza! Pole! Walikuwa wakilinda viti vyao na mishahara tu. Lakini sisi wengine hatujali. Hata wakati mwingine nilileta mabadiliko hapa kuhusu Mswada wa Petroleum na yakakubaliwa. Kwa hivyo, yafaa tufanye kazi bila kutishwa ama kuogopa. Lakini mimi siogopi kuwataja wenye madhambi.Bw. Spika, kwa hayo machache, ningependekeza Hoja huu ujadiliwe tena katika Sessional Committee. Ahsante.Mr. Boy: Ahsante sana, Bw. Spika, kwa kunipatia nafasi ili nimuunge mkono Bw. Mwamzandi kusema kwamba yafaa Mkuu wa Sheria arudi akaitengeneze Hoja hii tena.Sababu ya kwanza, katika ukurasa wa tano, kuna maneno "Joint Elections". This means Presidential and Parliamentary Elections held together-in a General Election.Sababu ya pili, kuna maneno "Nomination for Presidential Candidates". This is again conflicting, and quote:-"For the purpose of section 5 of the Constitution, a candidate at a Presidential election shall be nominated by a political party by delivery to the Electoral Commission".Halafu hapa tunasema uchaguzi wa rais utakuwa direct; yaani the President shall be nominated by a political party.Halafu kifungu hiki kinaendelea kusema, and quote:-"In the case of a Presidential Election, whether or not forming part of a Joint Election, hold the certificate until the' results of election in every constituency have been received. Thereafter publish a notice in the Kenya Gazette declaring a person /who has received the greatest number of votes in the election and who has also been elected as a Member of the National Assembly to have been elected the President". Halafu Katiba, inasema, and quote:- "Summoning prorogation and dissolution of Parliament, if the National Assembly passes a resolution which is supported by a majority of all the Members of the National Assembly of which not less than seven days notice has been given in accordance with the Standing Orders of the National Assembly declaring that it has no confidence in the Government ofKenya, the President does . not within three days of passing that resolution either resigns from his office or dissolves Parliament, then Parliament shall stand dissolved on the fourth day following the resolution that was passed". Kwa hivyo, Bw. Spika, unaona kwamba regulations ama sheria hizi hazina maana hata kidogo. Hii ndiyo sababu tunapendekeza zirudishwe tena kwa ofisi ya Mkuu wa Sheria ili zifanyiwe marekebisho. Kama Rais amechaguliwa na watu lakini chama chake hakina watu wengi katika Bunge, yaani majority members, kwa hivyo chama ambacho kina watu wengi katika Bunge kikishaapishwa tu, siku ya pili kinaleta "Motion of vote of no confidence". Pia kama Rais huyo hataki kujiuzulu, Katiba inasema "Within four days Parliament is dissolved". Kwa hivyo, Mkuu wa Sheria anatuomba tupitishe nini hapa? Hakuna sheria hapa. Hii ndiyo maana ninasema kwamba nia ya sheria hizi inakosana kabisa na Katiba. Kwa hivyo, ikiwa wanataka kuleta mabadiliko, yafaa walete yote pamoja lakini siyo kuleta "in piece meals". If we pass this Motion we shbll be doing a lot of disservice to this country. Si Bw. Boy anasema hivyo lakini ni Katiba ya nchi hii. Kwa hivyo, kwa maoni yangu mwenyewe swala hili la "direct election of President" yafaa liletwe vizuri ili tuelewe maana yake. Ni bahati mbaya Mkuu wa Sheria hayuko hapa leo kusikiliza maoni yetu kuhusu sheria hizi. Lakini nawaomba Wabunge wenzangu tusipitishe sheria hizi katika Bunge hili.(Applause)Bw. Spika, kila sehemu ina idadi tofauti ya watu. Kwa mfano, Wilaya ya Kwale inaweza kuwa na watu 100,000 wakati constituency moja tu katika Nairobi, inaweza kuwa na watu 300,000. Hivyo ni kusema Rais anaweza kuchaguliwa na watu fulani katika sehemu fulani ya nchi hii. Wao watasema kwamba rais amechaguliwa na walio wengi, na kwa hivyo, tungemtaka Mkuu wa Sheria abadilishe Katiba kwanza kabla ya kuleta Hoja hii hapa Bungeni. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu Katiba yenyewe inasema kwamba: -The President shall hot be subjected to resign when Parliament passes a vote of no confidence. Kwa hivyo, nafikiri Mkuu wa Sheria amekosea hapa. Kwanza angeibadilisha sheria hiyo ili baadaye atuletee Hoja kama hii. Kwa hivyo, tungetaka Hoja hii irudishwe na mpango ufanywe wa kurekebisha sheria kama ilivyo kwa wakati huu. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu tukipitisha Hoja hii vile ilivyo, tutakuwa tumejifunga mikono na kuonekana kama kazi yetu nikupitisha mambo ambayo hatuyaelewi. Wananchi watasema kwamba Wabunge hawasomi ili kujua ni mambo gani wanayopitisha na kwamba kazi yetu kubwa ni kufaa masuti na kupitisha mambo ovyo.Ni lazima sisi kama Wabunge tuhimize umuhimu wa kuwa na umoja katika nchi hii. Hatutaki kukata shauri kwa njia inayoweza kutuletee matatizo katika siku sijazo. Kwanza, pesa za kufanya uchaguzi ni nyingi na hatutaki kusikia siku chache baada ya uchaguzi kuwasikia watu wengine wakisema hawana imani na rais waliyemchagua. Jambo hilo likifanyika, basi tutarudi kwa uchaguzi tena na kutumia pesa nyingi zaidi na tayari barabara zimeharibika na huko hakuna dawa kwatika mahospitali ya Serikali. Hivyo ni kusema kwamba tutakuwa na shida chungu nzima. Kwa hivyo, tukipitisha Hoja hii, tutakuwa tufanya makosa juu ya makosa mengine ambayo tayari imefanywa na Mkuu wa SheriaNi kwa sababu hii ningewaomba Wabunge ambao hawajaisoma ile sheria vizuri, wafanye hivyo kabla ya kuzungumzia Hoja hii. Nimetengeneza nakili ya sheria hii na ikiwa kuna Mbunge ambaye hajaisoma, nitampatia ili aweza kuisoma. Jambo muhimu ni kukubaliana kwa kauli moja kwamba Hoja hii irudishwe na kufanyiwa marekebisho kabla ya kuletwa hapa tena.Kwa hayo machache, naomba kupinga. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Anaswa: Ahsante sana Bw. Spika kwa kunipatia nafasi hii ili nami nizungumze juu ya Hoja hii ambayo ni muhimu sana. Kwaza, ningetaka kumshukuru Mtukufu Rais kwa kazi nzuri ambayo amefanya tangu alipochukua usukani wa kuiongoza nchi hii. Sisi sote tunamshukuru ikwa ile taarifa aliyotoa juzi kwamba atawaalika wageni kutoka nchi za ng'ambo ili kuangalia vile tutakavyokuwa tukiendesha uchaguzi wetu. Jambo hili linathihirisha wazi kwamba sisi watu wa Kenya tuko huru na kwamba tunaweza kujisimamia katika mambo yetu. Sisis hatuna wasiwasi wowote and tunafanya mambo yetu yote dhahili.Vile, kuhusu kamati ya uchaguzi, yaani electoral commission, ningetaka kusema kwamba kutoka zamani, watu. wetu wamekuwa wakilia kwamba maofisa wa utawala wanawasaidia watu wengine katika uchaguzi. Sasa kamati isiyotegemea upande wowote imechaguliwa na sidhani wananchi watalia tena. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu kila kitu kitafanywa kwa njia wazi. Ninawaunga mkono Wabunge wenzangu ambao wamezunguza juu ya Hoja hii kuhusu uchaguzi wa rais. Kama walivyosema ikiwa wananchi watamchagua rais ambaye atakapokuja katika Bunge hili ataungwa mkono na Wabunge wachache, ni lazima Bunge hilo litavunjwa na uchaguzi mwingine ukafanywa Kwa hivyo, tungetaka kumwambia Mkuu wa Sheria kwamba, kuna pengo kubwa sana katika hoja hii. Kwa hivyo, ni lazima irudishwe na kutengenezwa upya ili pengo hili lizibwe. Mswahili husema, "Ukiona ufa, uzibe". Sisi kama Wabunge tumeona ufa mkubwa katika Hoja hii na ni lazima tuuzibe. Kwa mfano, ikiwatumemchagua rais katika nchi hii, ni lazima aheshimiwe na kila mwananchi wa Kenya. Ili rais tutakayemchagua kuhistahili heshima hii, ni lazima sisi tuige mfano wa nchi za ng'ambo ambapo wanamchagua Waziri Mkuu, kwa mfano, nchi ya India. Katika nchi hii rais anapewa heshima sana kwa sababu yeye huwa na Waziri Mkuu ambaye anaendesha Serikali na nchi kwa jumla. Hivyo ni kusema kwamba ikiwa kuna makosa yoyote yule Waziri Mkuu ndiye atalaumiwa na ikiwa haitekelezi wajibu wake vizuri, anaambiwa ajiuzulu. Baaya ya kujiuzulu, rais atapata nafasi ya kumchagua Waziru Mkuu mwingine. Tukiwa na mpango kama huu, utasaidia sisi kuliziba pengo hilo lakini kiwa sisi hatutafanya hivyo, ole wetu, tutapata shida nyingi sana katika uongozi wa nchi hii. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu tatakuwa tukimchagua rais, lakini baada ya siku nne, Bunge litavunjwa tena na kurudi tena kwa uchaguzi na jambo hili litatufanya tupoteze pesa nyingi sana. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Bw. Spika, swali ni kwamba: pengo hili tutaliziba au la? Mkuu wa Sheria analitambua pengo hili? Ni lazima Hoja hii irudishwa na kutengenezwa tena. Vile, tunazungumza juu ya uchaguzi wa nchi ya Kenya. Tunazungumza juu ya uchaguzi wa rais na wabunge, lakini ni kwa nini tumewasahau viongozi wa serikali za wilaya, madiwani na kadhalika? Ni kwa nini Mkuu wa Seria hakuleta sheria ya uchaguzi wa madiwani? Ni lazima tuzungumze juu wa uchaguzi wa madiwani na tungetaka kujua Mkuu wa Sheria anangojea nini. Ningependa jambo hili lifikiriwe.Vile, Bw. Spika, ningependa kutilia mkazo mambo fulani ambayo huenda wenzangu wameyataja Wakati watu wanapochaguliwa kila mgombea uchaguzi huwa na maajenti wake ambao wanaangalia mambo ya uchaguzi wake. Kuna watu wanaotoa maajenti wawili na hali watu wengine wanatoa maajenti watano. Je, masharti haya yanamruhusu kila mtu kuwa na maajenti wangapi? Masharti yanaongea juu ya maajenti wa kuchunguza hesabu ya kura lakini hayasemi chochote kuhusu maajenti katika uchanguzi wenyewe. Ningependa Mkuu wa Sheria atuambie idadi ya maajenti kila mgombea uchanguzi anahitajika awe nao katika kila kituo cha uchaguzi na katika mahali pa kuhesabia kura. Inafaa alitilie maanani jambo hili ili tusije kuwa na shida inayotokea wakati mwingine. Hii ni kwa sababu ikiwa mtu mmoja atakuwa na maajenti wanne na hali mwingine ana ajenti mmoja kutakuwa na manung'iniko ambayo yanaweza kuchafua uchaguzi.Vile tukiangalia watu wamejiandikisha katika vyama mbali. Utaona kwamba mtu, mimi ninahisi tu, amejiandikisha katika chama cha FORD, mwingine KANU na mwingine DP na kadhalika. Utaona kwamba mtu mmoja amejiandikisha katika vyama vitatu na mtu kama huyo hana msimamo maalum.Jambo lingine ni kwamba utaona kwambatusipokuwa waangalifu watu watajiandikisha katika vituo kadhaa vya kupigia kura. Kwa njia hii ikiwa ule wino unaopakwa vidole baada ya mtu kupiga kura hautakuwa mzuri mtu kama huyu atauosha kwa kutumia mafuta fulani na kuweza kupiga kura mara kadhaa. Kwa vile atakuwa amejiandikisha katika Ford, Kanu na DP ataweza kupigia kura vyama vyote. Tutafanya nini ili watu kama hawa wasifaulu katika mtindo kama huu? Ningependa tusizibe nyufa hizi ili tusije kujenga nyufa. Tungependa wino utaokaotumika wakati wa kupiga kura uwe unakaa katika kidole gumba kwa muda mrefu. Tungependa vidole tofauti vipakwe wino wakati mtu atakapopiga kura ya diwani, Mbunge and Rais. Hii itaonyesha kwamba mtu amepiga kura ya diwani, mbunge na rais. Inafaa wino huwe vigumu kuoshwa. Pia ningependa Mkuu wa Sheria ajue kwamba wakati mwingine mipango ya kupiga kura haiwekwi vizuri na maofisa wa uchaguzi. Kwa hivyo, masanduku ya kura za diwani, mbunge na rais yasipowekwa vizuri mpiga kura atawekwa kura yake katika sanduku lisilo.la kura hiyo. katika wakati uliopita kura za diwani na zalnbunge zilikuwa zikitangazwa baada ya kuhesabikwa lakini wakati huu itakuwa bora kuhesabu kura za diwani, mbunge na rais na kutangaza zote wakati mmoja ili kura zinazowekwa katika masanduku yasiyo yake ziwe zimetolewa na kuwekwa mahali pake.Bw. Spika, kwa vile sasa tutakuwa na msamamizi wa uchaguzi katika mawakilisho ningependa kutilia mkazo kwamba inafaa tuwe na vifaa vya kutosha kama vile stima. Katika sehemu ambazo hazina stima wakati huu - na ninaamini uchaguzi uko kairbu inafaa zipewe mashine za kutoa stima au stima iwekwe wakati huu. Ninafikiri ni sehemu chache katika Kenya ambazo hazina stima. Ningependa Serikali itilie mkazo utoaji stima katika makao makuu ya tarafa ili wakati wa kuhesabu kura kusiwe na ujanja wa kdsema taa zimezimika au mafuta yamekwisha. Hii ni kwa sababu baada ya upigaji kura kuisha wananchi wataenda katika mahali pa kuhesabia kura na watataka kuona kila kitu kikifanyika kwa haraka, na kwa hivyo ni lazima tuwe na mwangaza wa kutosha katika mahali hapo. Kwa wakati huu, huko Marekani sasa wanang'ang'ania mambo ya urais. Wana vyama vya Demoractic na Republican na kuna wengine ambao wanajisimamia kibinafsi. Hata kola Ufilipino, kuna wale watu ambao hawako katika chama chochote na walisimama kwa uchaguzi. Ikiwa tuna demokrasia ya kutosha katika Kenya nafikiri itakuwapo basi kama kuna mtu mmoja ambaye anataka kusimama na anapendwa na watu wake, apewe nafasi hata kama atafanya hivyo kibinafsi. </Newspeech><Newspeech>An hon. Member: Bora awe Mluyha. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Anaswa: Hata akiwa Mluyha au Mteso, hatujali. Bora tu apewe nafasi na aendelee> Si lazima kila mtu awe katika chama fulani ambacho kitamchagua. Jambo hili litaleta shida. Kwa mfano, ikiwa watu watatu wamejitokeza kutoka chama kimoja na wapigigwe kura nawatu wao na mtu wa kwanza apate kura 502 na mwingine apate kura 501, utapata kwamba yule ambaye amepata kura 501 ataachwa. Ni lazima chama cha Kanu kichunguze jambo hili sana ili watu kama hawa wapewe nafasi. Ikiwa mtu atakubaliwa kusimama kibinafsi, anaweza kuwashawishi wananchi kumpigia na anaweza kushinda. Mtu kama huyu akiingia Bungeni, anaweza kuchagua abaki vile au ajiunge na kile chama kinachotawala. Kwa nini tumejifunga mikono eti ni lazima mtu awe katika chama fulani? Je, Mkuu wa Sheria anaonaje jambao hili? Acha alete marekebisho hapa, tujadiliane na tuyapitishe ili watu wawe na demokrasia ya kutosha. Waswahili husema "Mtoto akililia wembe, mpe." Wembe huo ukimkata kidogo, atajuta mwenyewe.Nikimaliza, ningependa kusema katika uchaguzi, kuna wale ambao watashinda na wale ambao watashindwa. Wale ambao watashindwa, watakuwa na malalamishi na kikatiba, wako na uwezo wa kupeleka malalamishi yao kortini. Ningependa Electoral Commission, wakati itakapoanza kazi yake hivi punde, watafute njia ya kutatua malalamishi ya matokeo ya uchaguzi. Kwa mfano, ikiwa mtu anapinga matokeo ya uchaguzi, basi ni lazima mlalamishi na yule ambaye ameshinda katika uchaguzi na maofisa wa Electoral Commission wote wakague zile kadi ambazo zilipigwa kura, orodha ya wapigaji kura na kadhalika. Kutoka hapo, basi mlalamishi atakuwa na uhuru wa kupeleka malalamishi yake kortini. Isiwe kwamba mlalamishi anakwenda kichinichini na mawakili wake na kuanza kuchezea kadi hizo na vyeti vinginge. Jambo kama hili linaweza kuleta mchezo mwingine wa paka na panya na mambo mengi yanaweza kuharibika. Inafaa jambo hili likomeshwe.Vikundi hivi vitatu vikikaa na kufanya uchunguzi, wataridhika na kutia sahihi na mambo yataendelea sawa. Lakini kwa wakati huu, huu mchezo wa panya na paka bado unaendelea na inafaa Mkuu wa Sheria arekebishe jambo hili.Kwa hayo machache, naunga mkono. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Tarar: Asante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika kwa kunipa nafasi hii ili nami niseme machache kuhusu Hoja hii. Kwanza kabisa ningependa kusema kwamba napinga Hoja hii kabisa nikiwa Mwakilishi wa Eldoret East. Mkuu wa Sheria angejua kwamba kila nchi iko na mwenendo wake wa kisiasa. Sisi hatujui kama mwenendo wa kisiasa ambao unaelekezwa kupitia Hoja hii ni wa Kimarekani au wa Kiingereza. Kama ni mwenendo wa kisiasa wa Kiingereza, basi tunajua ya kwamba kila chama kinapigania viti na kile ambacho kitashinda, kitaunda Serikali na yule'anayekiongoza, atakuwa Rais. Kama ni mwenendo wa kisiasa wa Kimarekani, nimeshindwa kwa sababu Hoja hii haikubaliani na kile kinachoendelea huko. Kwa mfano, kule Marekani,	.haja ya mtu yeyote kukukataza silaha yako ya haki.wakati wa uchaguzi wa rais, wanafanya uchaguzi wa rais	Kwa hivyo, nawaomba wanachi wa Kenya wote- peke yake kwanza.

Kwa hivyo, hakuna comes out of the Attorney-General's Chambers. So,we would ask the Attorney-General perhaps to ask the Speaker to suspend debate on this Motion until appropriate amendments have been done. If this cannot be done, then perhaps it will compel some of us to consider bringing a substantive Motion to that effect, which we do really do not want to do. We assume that the Attorney-General is hearing what we are saying and he should do so.First, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I believe that this Motion should have come as a White Paper to gather opinions to discuss, and then when opinions have been heard and adjustments made, the it comes to the House as a Motion. But it was brought to the House in a hurry; the same afternoon and the same day. This is an extremely important thing, and since the spirit of it is so good, we should do it properly. I request that the Attorney-General be given that little information so that he does the needful.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also want to join my friend, hon. Tarar, in what he said, that in this country we have followed the British tradition. Whether or not we like it this is our tradition now. Since this globe is small and we all occupy it together, we survive by borrowing from one another; it is the only way the world survives. So, we have borrowed the British system of Parliament and government. That system has been there for a long time and it states that the party with the majority in the House forms the government. That is the cardinal principle from which we cannot deviate. While this Paper is trying to stay with that principle, at the same time it makes the practice of that principal contradictory. It is, therefore, not aligned with the Constitution. That part should be ironed out properly so that both are aligned.The example has been given clearly in this House by you, hon. Tuva, this afternoon when you spoke earlier, that the situation</Newspeech><Newspeech>Hon. Members: Hon. Mwamzandi! </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: I am sorry, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it was you. hon. Mwamzandi.Under these regulations, a situation could arise where the President is elected because he is a popular man in the country as an individual, but when he comes to the House, we find that his party has the minority number of seats. How will he form the Government? He cannot. Therefore, this situation will lead us into a state of governmental instability, the very thing we are trying to avoid. We have gone to a very long extent to say that the chances of governmental instability should be reduced by tying the hon. Members of the House to the party so that if any hon. Member switches parties, he loses his seat as well. Obviously, the purpose of this is to make the House and the Government civil.With the provision of these rules, however, we are undoing that very principle, and making it possible tohave a President in the House who has no majority in that House. How will his party function as a Government? This cannot work. Therefore, that part should be restored and realigned. We cannot, at the same time, run both the American system and the European system because this is not possible. The American -system assumes that the President is the heart of the House and a kind of an executive king who runs the country under the law which the legislature maVes and the two are separate. Our system, howevr, assumes that the executive will propose laws tor the legislature, which houses and encompasses the executive, and these laws are enacted by Parliament. These rules make that assumption impossible to function.So, on that account, I repeat that we need to rethink these regulations and align them with our general principle of government. It is up to the Attorney-Gene' il to see which one is easier to change between the Constitution and these rules. I believe that it is much easier to adjust these rules to the requirements of our Constitution. This is, in a way, re-emphasising what my colleagues have said.Let me now go through this document and see what can be done. I want to say that we cannot really wait until the Committee Stage to have this vital thing implemented. I think it is too late for the kind of change that is required because whole sections of this document will have to be realigned, and you cannot do this only in the Committee stage. So, the correct thing to do is that the Attorney-General asks you to suspend debate so that this Motion does not appear on the Order Paper next week until realignment has been made. "Then, we may resume debate on the Motion at the appropriate time.I think we have time for this because this nation does not have to go for elections until February, 1993. So there is no hurry here. Of course, it a Presidential prerogative to dissolve Parliament at any time, but in the present circumstances, it would be the interest of the nation to take all the available time which is just six or seven months to arrange elections properly As other speakers have said, even the oppositior  are not ready for elections now. If these parties to boycott voter registration, that is well and good. Who bothers? You register as electors only if you want to. You are not forced to.do so, although it is advisable to do it. If, however, you do not want to do so, why should you be forced. It is up to opposition parties to decide what to do here.Having said that, Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me add that I think we must be very clear in our minds as to whether we really need to have a President who is entirely subjected to this House or one who is outside the House. That choice has never been made properly. We have rather tendedto follow what the opposition says. It says, "Let us have a President elected by the majority of the public." We have tended to be forced into that situation, but we must not be. The result is that we have now come up with clauses like "joint elections". Joint in what? You just wonder. Of course, it means that candidates to various chambers are going to be elected at the same time. If we are going to do that, I suggest that balloting rooms be separate. As the Attorney-General explained, if balloting is done in the same room, the possibility of ballot papers being swopped with the Presidential ballot papers going into the box meant for the parliamentary papers, and vice versa will be there. If this happens, how are you going to tell the position? Presidential ballot results will be forwarded later to the Electoral Commission in Nairobi while the other outcome is going to be announced locally in constituencies. So, there will be a delay. However, if there is a difference of only one vote, and this vote happens to be the one that has gone astray in the other box, you will have a President declared, and not elected since a vote will have been delayed in the constituencies. This should be changed so that if elections are to be held together on the same day, ballot rooms are separate in order to make it possible for a voter to go into the parliamentary ballot room, votes, walks out, takes another ballot paper and goes into the Presidential ballot room. This will avoid the possibility of ballot papers being swopped. I hope the officers from the Attorney-General Chambers are listening and that they are going to take this issue into account over and above the general subject. The whole issue should be looked at again.On page nine, there are sub-paragraph 7(1) and 7(2). The former deals with places to be used as polling stations. It is possible to find that there is no school near enough for people to walk to with ease or that the two schools in a place are too far apart. I suggest that we include the possibility of building a polling station where a school is not available. Even a vehicle can be used for the same purpose, but this is not provided for in paragraph 7. So, I suggest sub-paragraph 7(3) be included to take care of this such that a returning officer may order the construction of a. polling station where a school is not available.Sub-paragraph 10(1), on page 10, says:- " the Electoral Commission shall appoint a presiding officer to preside at each polling station " but in a different place, it says that the presiding officer will be appointed by the returning officer.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, these two should be put together so that we know who is appointing the Presiding Officers. Will the Presiding Officers be appointed by the Electoral Commission or the Returning Officers? Where the Returning Officer appoints the Presiding Officer that situation will be difficult. This is because the Presiding Officer is the officer immediately after the Returning Officer. I do not think that one should have power to appoint an officer immediately below him. I think that officer should be appointed by the Electoral Commission.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is no provision anywhere in this paper as to how the election officers and clerical officers are to be appointed. The paper is totally quiet on this matter. That should be settled now. Who is to appoint the election officers and clerical officers operating at polling stations? That is not stated in this paper. I think the Attorney-General should look at that again and see what needs to be done to correct this situation.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the provisions for candidate's proposer and seconder, it is proposed that where the proposers and seconders exceed the number required that is 18 they will take only the first 18. Supposed the first 18 are found to have a fault in them and there are all 26 names available, why can we not say that the Returning Officer will accept the first 18 correct entries so that you avoid a situation where a Returning Officer may cut off at 18 and yet find that he has less than seven out of those 18 who qualify and then the candidate fails to be nominated purely by a technicality. I think that is not right. So, I suggest that that part should be amended to read "that the Returning Officer will accept the first 18 qualifying entries." The minimum is seven and the maximum is 18. That is an amendment that is required in these papers.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is provision that the nomination fee will be refunded to a candidate who does not succeed in being nominated. I think the practice the world over is that the candidate who gathers a certain number of votes, maybe 25 per cent of all the votes cast, should get his nomination fee back. I think the Attorney-General should look at this one too. The forfeiture of nomination fee used to be to the party because the party needed money. But in the circumstances I do not think the situation is true. So, a candidate who gathers 25 or 30 per cent of the votes cast I think should be entitled to a refund of his nomination fee. But a candidate who gets very few votes two per cent or five per cent should lose that money because he has wasted people's time. These are some of the things that we need to have a look at in addition to the general remarks I have made.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Regulation 23(2) talks about admission to polling stations. I am not quite sure what is meant by this one. It says:-"The Presiding Officer shall admit to the polling station notless than two agents for each candidate-"This would mean that he may admit to the polling station more than two agents. What is the limit? Will it be 20 agents? Or really do we mean to say that he should not admit more than two agents? If the latter is true then the word "less" should be changed to read "more" otherwise the thing does not make sense. </Newspeech><Newspeech>An Hon. Member: You are pausing for too long! </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, somebody is trying to hurry me up. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Hon. Members: We are not in a hurry. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: There is no need for me to hurry because this is a vital thing that is happening to us in Kenya.On page 25 you begin a process which I think ought to be accepted; that an illiterate voter who is health and whole, who can see, hear and talk Such an illiterate voter should not need any assistance to mark his ballot. A blind person needs assistance to mark his ballot. But a person who cannot read surely can see colours. The parties are going to have their colours. Why can we not make it in such a way that an illiterate person who is healthy and whole can mark with his thump or his finger on the colour of the party and so eliminate this question of having to be helped? I say this because it is in that helping and assisting where very often problems arise. It is not that the Government rigs in that process. No. Most of the times it is the candidates who rig the process by paying the Presiding Officers to mark the papers in a different way. So, I suggest that this portion be amended so that an illiterate voter will clink his finger on the colour of the party for which he is voting. I think that is veiy easy; everyone will understand that and they will do it and we will do away with assisting the voters; tfiose who are blind or invalid in some way. That goes through into paragraph 30, 31(a) and (b) where declaration of & voter who is unable to vote They request for assistance. I am suggesting that we're move that altogether. So, it goes on up to page 27 where the last part of the first paragraph says that the Presiding Officer shall allow one representative for each candidate to witness the marking of the votes under this regulation. That should apply only where the voter is invalidated; where a voter cannot see or stand. It is not for an illiterate voter.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Kenya is not a very special country although it is a country that has got very many assets. We are just ordinary human beings and these things have been done, elsewhere. Let us not think that can do all of them. Let us copy where we have to copy because that is the way we grow. That is the course that nature does take; a child is bom and it learns by copying what father and mother do. That is how we grow up. So, let us copy what is done in some otherplaces. But let us not strike out to do a thing that only Kenya is trying to do; a thing that does not apply anywhere else in the world; a thing which is not popular and will not work.At page 10 it is provided that if a voter goes to the polling station and finds that someone else has voted in his place that all is done is to allow him also to vote and remarks made accordingly.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if it is discovered that someone else has voted in his place then I think that someone should later be found and be charged. Why should he go scot free for impersonating the genuine voter? This is a person who is undermining democracy and he should be punished. Arrangements, therefore, should be made where a genuine voter comes and finds that an impersonator has voted in his place so that the number of that ballot which is voted is noted down and disqualified because it is a false vote. This kind of thing has been practised very openly in the past elections. I used to go to various polling stations where I found people who went to vote and found that an impersonator had already voted their behalf. The poor person was left in a dilemma saying "how come this happened?" Nothing could be done because somebody deceived him.Some people are so smart that during the registration period they register in four different places. They go voting in one place and then vote in another place and then finally end up voting in their own home. There is this thing they call "indelible ink" but I do not think we have ever found an indelible ink which human sweat cannot remove. When they have used that indelible ink, they find some solution somewhere and together with perspiration this ink is erased and then they go and vote in the next place. Okay, you might ask where such people get extra identity cards to do so but it is easy for one to get even four identity cards and many people are capable of doing that. These identity cards are all false and such people should be arrested.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, to reduce this possibility, I am suggesting that at registration time people should register only in their sub-location and not elsewhere unless one has migrated entirely to the satisfaction of the registration officer. He should only register in his sub-location where people like village elders and even the "Likurus" know him. If he cannot do that, then there is no place for him to register. In doing so, we would reduce the cheating that goes on which causes rigging. Rigging often occurs in a certain way but dome people tend to think that it is the Government that does it. Most of the time it is not the Government that does rigging but it is all these agents who are working to feather their own nests that carry outrigging. Our rules should be strengthened to curb rigging. If that can be incorporated in some regulations so that one person only registers only once, I think it would help this nation a great deal.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, on the counting of votes, to assume that all votes can be counted during the day is impalatable. Votes will have to be counted at the time that is most convenient for everybody which is obviously at night. We cannot sit, dream and drowse with ballot papers overnight in a room. We are going to fight, things are going to happen, people will break into the strong room and even if they do not break into the strong room there were be rumour the following day that the ballots were changed in the strong room. Therefore, the votes should be counted as soon as all the ballot boxes arrive. To do that is to invite so much criticism over the system there will be a lot of rigging. Let the votes be counted even if it has to be carried out throughout the night, we will provide proper lights. If there is no electricity, hurricane and pressure lumps or torches will serve the purpose. These votes have to be counted as soon as possible because everybody is eagerly waiting for these results. Why go waiting for 14 hours for the results to come out? That section should be adjusted to stipulate that the votes are counted at once.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the area to be covered in the transportation of ballot boxes is smaller than it used to be before. This is because the counting will be done at the constituency level instead of being done at the district headquarters and this is a welcome move. During the past election there were few complaints because the votes used to be counted at the district level. A division is a smaller although some divisions are very big. A good example is my constituency where there is a sub-location you cannot go round in less than eight hours. Nevertheless, why wait another 14 hours to count the votes simply because it is dark. We must carry on and amend this so that the counting of votes starts as soon as the ballot papers have arrived in the place.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is also another area in which a lot of cheating has taken place and many voters including university professors make this mistake. They believe that by placing a cross against somebodies name, you have crossed him out. That is exactly what they do. I suggest that instead of the cross sign being placed in the box we should have that mark called the tick that everybody understands. So, if that is the person he wants, he will tick the ballot paper. I agree with the fact that the cross sign is used in many places but still here it happens and I have heard it being said by very learned people and I thought that if I put a cross against the name this will simply mean that I did not want that person. This continues to happen and you find that many voters go wrong in that way. Paragraph 36 (2) (b) which refers to what I am saying should be changed.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Attorney-General has done something very good here by saying that the cross sign should look good so that it can be accepted. This is good news because in the past the presiding officers were very strict. However this should be left to the discretion of the presiding officers.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I conclude my speech I would like to say that the issue of Presidential candidates should be looked into. You can have two or three Presidential candidates but when the voting time comes yfcu find that none of them commands majority votes. A Presidential candidate may win in his constituency, but lose the presidency. If you are only two in those situations then you will have a whole election with no President this is a possibility which has not been covered in these draft regulations. Mathews law states as follows: " If anything can happen, it will happen one day". Matthews law could apply here, that we may have three candidates for the presidency and none of them commands majority votes and in some case they can tie together. This can be a very embarrassing situation and it should be looked into. This paper does not provide for that situation. This situation should be put straight.Further, at the present, the Constitution provides that it is the President's prerogative to appoint the Vice-President. In the interest of proper constitutional development, that part of the Constitution should be reviewed to the effect that the President should appoint the Vice-President in consultation with some organisation. This is what we want to go into details. For instance, the Constitution provides that when the President vacates the seat, the Vice-President takes over immediately, and for 90 days he can take over and run the country. He may not be very popular, but in 90 days he can make such a change that we are forced to confirm him on the seat. So this part needs to be looked into.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we should not forget that most of these powers require checks and balances in their operation or application. We should not forget that in Germany, Hitler was elected constitutionally into power, and within a year or so, he had turned the whole of Germany into a most vicious dictatorship that we have witnessed on this earth for the last 500 years. This is something we must not forget. So our whole constitutional development needs to take care of the requirement for checks and balances to prevent tyranny being imposed on the nation.Kenya has been very fortunate in its two Presidents in that the late President Jomo Kenyatta was a great democrat and wanted the will of the majority to prevail. By a very good fortune, PresidentDaniel arap Moi has the same mentality in that he wants the will of the majority to prevail. We have a democratic- minded President, but we could have a tyranny-minded President who would impose tyranny on this nation. Therefore, we must see how to prevent such a situation happening in the future.This "idle situation" is a possibility that can happen and we must provide against it by separating powers sufficiently to prevent such a thing happening. I do not mean that we should embark on the overhaul of the Constitution entirely. But these are some of the things we ought to be cautious of. Therefore, this is an issue that we cannot just glide over and say, "Oh, the two Presidents have been wonderful democrats. Therefore, we shall always have democrats". No! President Moi's motto is "Look after the welfare of others". And what a great motto! But you will find another one who will succeed him put the welfare of others last; each one for himself, God for us all, and the devil takes the high moon(?).Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we should also not forget that in the main, the Constitution of Kenya and the Governmental system of Kenya, is "inherently dictatorial tyranny grown". This is because we just inherited the Governor's kind of Government a colonial Governor's Government  which was purely and totally dictatorial. The only authority over and controlling the colonial Governor was the Colonial Office in London. Yet in the main, that is our system of Government. We have adopted it so much that we even refer to our President as "His Excellency" just like the Governor used to be. We have also tended to look at the President in the same manner. Since I was a kid, I knew that once the Governor had said something, there was no controversy over it. It was said and done. That is the nature in which the majority of Kenyans have grown up. So we need to change that dictatorial kind of Constitution. The colonial mentality in the Constitution has to come out and be replaced by a layman's view. We are merely confirming in these regulations the status quo. Why should we do so? It is time we changed that. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Manpower Development and Employment (Mr. Otwani): On a point of order, Sir. Hon. Okondo has said that referring to our President as "His Excellency" is a colonial kind of adaptation. Can he tell us how we should address our President? What title does he suggest would be best for our President? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not sure what the hon. Member is saying that there is something wrong with "Mr. President". What is wrong with saying "Mr. President"?We are not making the laws of this country for ourselves, but for the future generations. We must see that what we are laying down is capable of lasting for a long time, and not just for our convenience today. In fact,what we are enjoying today was built several years ago. So what we are doing now must be for the future generations. That is why I find it rather odd for some people to stand, like an hon. Member friend of mine who came up and said "Now, we must have Presidents according to tribes". What a situation! How about the El Molo with 60 members? They will never have a chance to represent their people. What about small tribes? What chance do they have? I think that is a dangerous fallacy that has already turned Yugoslavia into a blood bath since a certain tribe thinks they are entitled to everything. That is the same notion that has brought Somalia into the situation in which it is today. It is a fallacy!Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would be happy if the next President would be a Mluhya, but it is not for me to go telling other tribes that the next President should be a Mluhya. That would be a fallacy! The fact that I as a Mluhya would like it, is a completely different story. On the other hand, how do you know if you are a Mluhya that a Mluhya President will be democratic. You could have a Mluhya running the country, but do you think that I am going to accept the fallacy that since he is Mluhya, then I have to tolerate his dictatorship at all costs. The answer is no! A candidate can qualify as President if he is the best at that time. I agree with the sentiments that it is not right in normal practice everything in one area but President Moi has shown us the way. Loot at the way he balances his Cabinet. He has never declared that he is going to do it on tribal basis, but he has done it in such a way that every group has some representation some where in the Government. Why can we not follow the same example instead of screaming? If you go on screaming that it is now the Abaluhya turn for the Presidency, what about the other communities. Are there no people in those communities who could be President? They also have! So, if everybody is going to scream that it is their turn, what will happen in the end? If they are going to say that the next President will be a Mluhya, they are making people to hate us and to treat us like they are now treating the Kalenjins who have been receiving orders to quit houses in Nairobi. I think this is false and I totally discourage it particularly when it is being down under some kind some kind of a guise. Nobody called a meeting for the Abaluhya to discuss this issue. This is totally wrong. Also, the assumption that the Abaluhya are the sole habitants of the Western Province is a fallacy. There are other non-luhya people in Western Province and I wonder whether we shall give them an opportunity under that luhya guide to be President?Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think this is terrible misconception. Perhaps the gentleman who has been screaming out these things has been advised by some important people somewhere to say these things. However, whatever it is, I think it is a very bad sore which is likely to cause hardship to our people and I would take this opportunity to advise the rest of the luhya people to forget this fallacy. If on the other hand a Luhya President was elected, he would have to distinguish himself amongst Kenyans and a President and not as a Mluhya. Already, to see the wickedness of the approach, somebody has said that I am a foreigner. This is in The Standard. If they say I am a foreigner, then they do not know what a foreigner is. I am a Member of this House and I was born in Kenya. Does it mean that for all those years that I have been a Member of this House, I have been breaking the law? Does it mean that all the people who know that I am a Kenyan have been accepting a fallacy of fraud? Things like these are very dangerous indeed and I hope these people, whoever they are, did not mean to call me a foreigner, but something else instead.Moreover, Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, I am nof in any way ashamed of being a Mluhya. I am a Mluhya because I was bom as one and I will live and die and a Mluhya. However, I am not going to say that every priority must be given to the Abaluhya because this would be a very high degree of tribalism and I am not going to accept it. If anything, we would be right to in saying that the best person at that time, should be the one to get the presidency. However, there must be a gentleman's agreement that we do not concentrate everything in one community. Everything must be distributed equally as President Moi has been doing in his Government. This is what we ought to do but we do not have to advertise it. In fact, when we advertise these things shows our weakness. Somebody will come up and say, "these characters are most disorganized". I think it is most unbecoming for people in responsible position to continue screaming in the open and saying things that do not make sense at all. Let them organize themselves and produce a man who can run this country without declaring that he is a Mluhya or a Mkikuyu. Let them say," here is a Kenyan who incidentally happens to come from Kimilili an who has worn the hearts of Kenyans" We shall all accept this! If you say that because you are a Mluhya, you are going to be the next President, what about the Tachoni or the Bukusu. What would they say? There are other communities within the luhya tribe and I do not know what they in turn would say.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is a development in our constitutional development which should be cut off and thrown away. We shall have a Mluhya President when we shall be able to produce a man who is able to win the hearts of all Kenyans. We shall put this man to the nation and if the nation accepts him we shall be happy, and I will be the happiest. We all know what we mean and this is not a place to name names. This Sessional Paper should be taken back to ' theAttorney-General's Office to enable him to redraft it along the requirements of this nation.With those few remarks, I beg to oppose. </Newspeech><Newspeech> Mr. Jalang'o: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my colleagues in condemning this Sessional Paper which has been very poorly drafted. It is quite evident that this Paper has not been given proper consideration because its whole nature is contradictory to the constitution that governs this country. These regulations were only presented to hon. Members yesterday and the same afternoon, put to the House under a Motion. . May I refer to the constitution, Section Ave, subsection three (f). This is what it says: "Whenever Parliament is dissolved, an election of the President shall be held and the candidate for the President who is elected as a Member of the National Assembly and who receives the greatest number of valid votes cast in the Presidential Elections than any other candidate for the Presidency, who is also elected as a Member of the National Assembly, shall be elected as a President." I am a mathematician by profession and it defeats all combinations to have a President elected under these conditions. First because elections are being held on the same day and on the same venue, and will be called joint elections. A voter will be given two cards, one for the Presidential elections and the other for Parliamentary elections. At the end of the day, the votes will be counted at the constituency level and transported to the district headquarters.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, at the end of the whole exercise, the Electoral commission will announce the candidate with the highest number of votes as the President. At the same time, this particular person, has also got to be elected in his own constituency with a majority votes. Suppose he does not get majority votes after the counting, what do you do? And yet this is what the Constitution says. At the same time the regulations we have been discussing, which were hurriedly brought to tlte House yesterday Section 40(2)(a) states:¬" thereafter publish a notice in the Gazette declaring the person who has received the greatest number of votes in the election and who has also been elected a Member of the National Assembly to have been elected President". When can you ever have this type of combination and at the same time that particular person, who cannot be statistically elected in this combination, is declared aPresident in the evening? That is the first thing which has to be done. Then when the constituency votes are counted he is found to have received the least number of votes. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mureithi: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think hon. Jalang'o is misleading this House. It states clearly here that the person will have received majority votes and will also have been elected as a Member of Parliament</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Jalang'o: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is exactly what I am saying. The rules we are discussing say that the person must be elected as a Member of the National Assembly and also receive the highest number of votes in the Presidential election. Suppose he has the maximum votes in the Presidential election but he is not elected in the National Assembly, what happens? He cannot be a President. What do we do? We will have an election the following day. If the thing is so open as it is</Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Co-operative Development (Mr. Cheruiyot): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.I think the hon. Member is not interpreting the regulations properly. The results of the parliamentary election will come out first. So, we will know whether this man is a Member of Parliament or not. The Electoral Commission will then, perhaps after two days, announce the election of the President. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Jalang'o: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am referring to both the Constitution of Kenya and the draft regulations. I have quoted from the regulations; but I will quote Section 40(2) (a) again for hon. Cheruiyot:-"thereafter publish a notice in the Gazette declaring the person who has received the greatest number of votes in the election and who has been elected as a Member of the National Assembly to have been elected President."I will say again that you can receive the maximum number of votes in the Presidential election but at the sanie time receive minority votes in the constituency election, in which case you do not qualify to be declared elected as a President. Why do we have to approve something we know that in the probability terms of mathematics is likely to happen? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mureithi: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I do not think what hon. Jalang'o is saying is in line with the Constitution. The Constitution states exactly what the rules state, unless he wants to say that we should also amend the Constitution, in the sense that if that person does not qualify under the two legs of the same cross then he does not become President and we have to carry out another election. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Jalang'o: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish the hon. Member could be patient and let me continue. I was coming to advising the Attorney-General to firstly amend the Constitution. If you want the Presidential election to be done by the majority of Kenyans then the first thing is to amend the Constitution and then these regulations will be in place.There was a time when the Attorney-General introduced in this House a Bill, which would have created the position of a prime minister and that of a President and you know what happened to it. A situation where Kenyans would like to see the President directly elected by the people should not be tied up to the condition on election in a constituency. If the majority of Kenyans elect the President of their choice regardless of what happens in a constituency then that will be a worthy thing. After all, what is a constituency to a President who is above constituency matters?The President is a national figure and if we would like to it well, especially at this critical stage of moving towards multi-elections, we have to be careful.If the Motion is rushed the way I have seen others being rushed and when ayes and noes are called for people just say "aye" we may pass something which is dangerous to the country. For example, suppose we elect a President who has minority Members of Parliament and on the first sitting of the House the majority Members of Parliament, who are perhaps in the opposition, say "We are passing a vote of no confidence in the President", what will stop them from doing that?Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think it is the high time these regulations were rejected by this House so that the Attorney-General can have time to go back and re-draft them so that they are in line with aspirations and wishes of Kenyans. In this way, we will be able to elect a President who is above petty issues and one who has the support of the majority of Kenyans.In the same breath, I would like to support the hon. Okondo when he said that the position of a Vice-President is extremely important in a country like Kenya. The Vice-President is the one who would automatically assume Presidency in the event of incapacitation of the President.When the Attorney-General is re-drafting these regulations and when he is making the necessary amendments to the Constitution, I would like him to ensure that the Vice-President is also elected by all Kenyans so that we have a person who can take over the Presidency of the country in the event of that position becoming vacant.We have seen cases where the performance of a Vice- President has been questionable. There is one case which we have discussed in this very House, Sir, and we do not want to go through it again.Even if the President is going to have his own running mate as a Vice-President, let it be so. In this way, we shall have a Vice-Presidential running mate who is also elected by Kenyans, and who also commands the respect of all the Kenyans. When you look at the way in which these draft regulation is put, it seems as if there is some pressure or rush somewhere to push them through. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Hon. Members: You are right! You are right! </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Jalang'o: This House would like to know where this pressure is coming from and why there is a rush to push these regulations through.The registration of voters is starting next week on 8 th June and we have at least three to four months, to go through voter registration, compilation of the voter registers, checking and examining them, making appeals and so on. But within four months, even if elections are called during that time although it is a prerogative of the President, do we have time to do a proper job? We should not, therefore, rush such important regulations through the House. I would like to appeal to my colleagues, especially those in the Front Bench, to critically look at the provisions of these regulations and if they conflict with practical experiences, then they recommend that these regulations be deferred. This document should be returned to Sheria House for re¬drafting before it is brought to the House for approval.I do not want to dwell on other sections of these regulations because the document is already faulty from the beginning. Why should we discuss a document which is faulty, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir? Why should we discuss regulations which are so important to the country, but which, on the other hand, are already in conflict with what has been experienced in the practical sense.I would like to urge all hon. Members of this House to reject this document the way it is so that these regulations can be deferred, returned, re-drafted and brought to this House for approval.With those few remarks, I do not support the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mureithi: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me the chance to say a few things concerning these regulations. In as far as these regulations are concerned, especially the section that the hon. Jalang'o has dwelt on. It is my considered view that this particular rule is in accordance with our Constitution. If the hon. Jalang'o wants the Constitution to be amended, he should specifically indicate the particular provisions jof the Constitution which he wants amended. After the Constitutions has been amended, we can have enact rules to comply with the Constitution. Butin as far as this rule is concerned, it states specifically what is provided for under the Constitution.If for any reason somebody is elected with majority votes in this country and he is unable to be elected by his constituents, then it will be too bad. Under this regulation he has to fulfil two requirements. First, he has to be elected by the majority of Kenyans and the secondly, he must be elected by his constituents. That is what our Constitution and this regulation says. I do not see anything in conflict between these regulations and the Constitution.Therefore, I would like to suggest to the hon. Jalang'o that he makes whatever recommendations he has about the Constitution to the House for consideration. The election of a Vice-President does not fall under this regulation. There is nothing the Attorney-General is going to do to bring about the issue of a running mate to the President this is also in accordance with the Constitution. It has absolutely nothing to do with-this regulation. These are the provisions which touch on the Constitution. This does not mean that these regulations are bad simply because they do not have such provisions. If the Attorney-General had drafted such provisions, then they would have been ultra vires to the Constitution and he would not have done a good job. If anybody wants to be elected as President and nobody is supporting him in his constituency, I would just say that it will be very bad and he will not be President in our present Constitution.I will now comment on the regulation which deals with party symbols, I think it is section 5(1).(The Attorney-General walked into the House)I am glad that the Attorney-General has finally come to the House and I hope that the extensive comments which have been made by the hon. Members, have been noted.Section 5(1) reads in part " a distinctive colour and a distinctive symbol	" I do not see the reason why a party cannot have two, three or four colours. I would suggest that it should read "colour or colours..." For instance, in Kanu, we are used to red, green and black colours and if we only use one colour, the voters may not know whether this is Kanu or not. They need to see all the colours of Kanu to be convinced that this is actually Kanu. I would, therefore, suggest that we amend this particular clause to provide for "colour or colours" in respect of party symbols.Under section 18 Validity of Nomination we have a situation where a returning officer can declare that somebody has not submitted valid papers. Under section 18(2), there is a provision that areturned officer shall be entitled to hold a nomination paper, invalid on the grounds that are stated in this document. My points relates to the actions of returning officers. Supposing a returning officei is biased on a particular candidate, what recourse does that particular have before the commencement of the election to have conections made.Before that provision be made that a candidate whose nomination papers have been declared invalid by a returning officer who can be biased that particular candidate should have recourse either to a tribunal or to a court within the next 48 hours for whatever period the rules may provide so that he can challenge that decision of the returning officer before elections are held. It is very important for an aggrieved party that he should have recourse to another authority or tribunal so that elections are not held and he feels that he was left out when, as far as he was concerned, his papers were in order.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will now go on to Rule 25 postponement of polling. For those who havc had experience before elections, we know that one of the ways of rigging elections has been that in a particular polling station where a certain candidate is not wanted, elections are delayed so that his supporters do not vote. So, yen have a situation where elections start after 10 o'clock and then by 6 o’clock the voters are told that the polling station must close. I am happy that sub¬section 3 makes that provision, that the returning officer shall, where there has been interruption or where the polling has started late the presiding officer may extend the hours of time by the amount of time lost before smiting The delay may be because on that particular day of voting there was in and no good vehicles to travel to that particular polling station. But I think this is one of the rules which returning and presiding officers should be very well versed with because in the past we have seen that where they want to rig elections the exercise starts late and, therefore, ensure that that particular candidate whom they know is popular does not get votes in that particular area.Another aspect at the polling station and I do not laid it provided for in these Regulations is that I have experienced a case during one election, where at one occasion there were 10 polling stations and the returning officer made sure that he sent wrong registers to the wiong stations. So, when the wananchi came to vote, none of them could find their names in the registers. This was deliberate. I would, therefore, urge the Attorney Geneial to make provision that at least one day before the polling starts the registers are at their correct polling staiions and I'se candidates and their agents have a chance to eiistne that the proper registers are there. I am saying this because of experience I have had, and it is no good leaving with the returning officers until the polling day. 1 would urge him to provide that if there shall be elections the following day, at least one or two days before iiie exercise the register is physically present and even wananchi allowed to check whether their names are there. Registers have been exchanged so that wananchi get fed up. By the time people realise that it is the whole register which is wrong, a lot of people have been turned away from that particular polling station.Having said that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I now want to touch on Rule 29(1 )(a) which states that the ballot paper shall be stamped with an official mark. We all arc aware of what has happened in the past. Some people have been given ballot papers which have no official marks, and hon. Members are all aware that that official mark is just a stamp which can be stamped by anybody. Then, when it comes to the counting of votes, you find 1000 or 2000 votes without the official stamp and are, therefore, declared spoilt votes, what offence has the candidate or his agent committed by not having these ballot papers marked? This i one of the areas where we have seen deliberate rigging of elections. If it is the Electoral Commission which has printed these ballot papers, I do not see why they want another mark. I am saying this because if the ballot paper has no mark, it is not the mistake of the candidate or his agent. Therefore, why should it tie declared invalid at the time of counting?Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would urge that hon. Juma Boy goes back to the Back¬Bench. He is not a member of the Front-Bench and he is talking to the Attorney-General while we are discussing very important issues here. It is not fair unless he has been promoted to assist the Attorney- General. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi): Order, hon. Mureithi. It is the practice of this House that Back-benches can go to the Front- Bench for consultation. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mureithi: I quite agree with you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, but it is not fair or reasonable for a member of the Back-Bench to go and consult a Minister who is concerned with the matter in issue before this House. Why does he not consult the rest of the Front-benchers? What he is doing is that he is not allowing the Attorney General hear the contribution of hon. Members. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: On, a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir How does the Chair assume that the Back-bencher is consulting the Minister concerned? </Newspeech><Newspeech>An hon. Member: Are you challenging the Chair? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: I mean, the hon. Member speaking! </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mureithi: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not know what Dr. Misoi is talking about because he is talking about the Chair and, at the same time, about the hon. Member speaking. He may even have a third person he is referring to. In anycase, it was not a point of order.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would now like to touch on Rule 42, which talks about returns on election expenses. We are now having elections where candidates are sponsored or supported by parties. We know that there is a limit of KShs.40,000/- for elections for Parliamentary candidates. First of all, everybody knows that KShs.40,000/- is such a small amount that I do not think it is practicable to follow that rule. Secondly, some of the voters assume that every candidate has been f KShs.40,000/- by the Government and, therefore, demand their shait of that amount. They say, "If the laws says that you must spend KShs.40,000/-, then you must have been given the money" and then they demand money ivoin you.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is no reason why a candidate should not be spending in a multiparty system because it is the party which has sponsored that candidate which will spend. Therefore, I think we have come to the time when this rule concerning expenditure in elections has become irrelevant. If anybody wants to spend KShs. 100 million to be elected, let him spend it and we get that money into our economy; it will be good for the economy of the country. This kind of rule can be used to frustrate people who have been validly elected because it is very easy to prove that somebody has spent KShs.40,000/-- This is a rule we should do without during this time when candidates are being sponsored by their parties. If it were individuals sponsoring themselves, then it would be all right.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am glad that the hon. Attorney-General has told me here, and that means he has told this House, that he totally agrees with me and will do away with this rule. He has whispered that but, if he think I have misquoted him, he is quire entitled to stand up on a point of order and refuting this, if he does not do this, hon Members of this House will; know that this is what he actually said.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, come to the question of the Electoral Commission has said that the registration of voters should start , a  June, 1992. I had hoped that if the opposition challenging the constitution of the Electoral Commission, it would do so (inaudible). Members of the opposition know that the Electoral Commission has been chosen a term of five years, and it has been explained to time, that member of this Commission have security of to I would like to know from members of the oppose wherever they are, how, if these people have security tenure provided by our law, we can get rid of them unless they breach their terms of appointment. How do youthis short of using bush law, urging for demonstrations and using other extra-legal machinery, which they have been doing already? Could the opposition tell us what kind of law we should use to get rid of the Electoral Commission? In the past, the opposition has been shouting that we have no security of tenure for judges and the Attorney-General. This was one of their principal items of agenda. This security was restored, but the opposition asked, "Where are the goods?" We now have security of tenure for members of the Electoral Commission, the lack of which has been one of the opposition's cardinal arguments against the Government? What else docs the opposition expect us to do at this time so as to do away with this Commission? As far as we are concerned, we have followed the law. Members of the Electoral Commission were appointed in 1991, and their tenure expires in 1996.As far as the registration of voters is concerned, it is these same voter who will vote the opposition in if they want it. I do nor see what is wrong with people registering themselves as voters at any time. I would urge everybody, both those who support the Government and those who oppose it, to register themselves as voters so that they can express their views in the next elections. Unless the opposition does not want elections, it should be able to encourage its own supporters to register as voters in big numbers so that they may do whatever they want. Discouraging them from registering themselves is not the way to promote multi-party democracy in this country.Finally, I am happy that the Minister for Co¬operative Development is here. In discussing elections, we are discussing how our people should live with good governance and in comfort. In my constituency, we do not have any cash crop, and the only way my constituents make money is by sale of milk. The Minister tor Co-operative Development assured this House that by the end of May which was last week, fanners would have been paid their money Therefore it should not tell us who it has sold thismilk to nor who has refused to pay it</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Boy: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I would not like to interrupt my best friend over there, but the Motion here says:- "THAT, pursuant to section 34 of the National Assembly and Presidential Elections Act (Chapter 7 of the Laws of Kenya), this House approves the draft Presidential and Parliamentary Elections Regulations, 1992 laid on the Table of this House on the 2nd June, 1992." There is nowhere here where it talks about the K.C.C. or dairy farmers. So, is the hon. Member in order to talk about these things now? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Co-operative Development (Mr. Cheruiyot); Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have information to give to the hon. Member regarding payments for milk, but I would have wished him to place a Question to which I can give a proper answer. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi): I entirely agree with hon. Boy in that dragging that matter to this Motion is not conducive because the Minister concerned may not be prepared to reply to it now. In any case, we are dealing with the National Assembly and Presidential Elections Act, and we should confine ourselves to that. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Malebe: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think hon. Mureithi is in order to refer to milk payments to farmers because these farmers will be expected to travel to registration centres. If they have no money, this will be impossible. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi): I have just said that this matter should not be dragged into the Motion before the House. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mureithi: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I had a Harambee funds drive last weekend, and my people said that they were unable to contribute to it because they had not had payment for their milk for the last three months. So, as hon. Malebe says, I am not digressing from the matter at hand. My people need money to travel to registration and polling stations. My constituency is very big, and we request the Electoral Commission to increase the number of registration and polling stations there, but it has so far refused to do so. This means that my people have to travel long distances to the present stations. Where will they get money from to enable to them to travel if they have not been paid for their milk for the last three months? The excuse being offered is that milk consumers have not paid the K.C.C., but there is no satisfactory explanation that the Minister can give as the only explanation we need is to enable farmers in our constituencies to have money. We do not want mere talk here; we only want money. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Co-operative Development(Mr. Cheruiyot): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.. The explanation I can give in this respect relates to when the said milk was paid for and the amounts of money paid. I can even quote the figures relating to April, 1992 as payments have been made already. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mureithi: Payments for which month? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Co-operative Development (Mr. Cheruiyot): For April, 1992, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I was with the K.C.C. Managing Director yesterday, and I know that the company has released all these payments. If the hon. Member gives me time, I can tell him specifically what is happening in the K.C.C. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mureithi: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am very happy to note that the Minister will tell us exactly what is happening in the K.C.C., but I still think it is high time the Kenya Dairy Board licensed other people to deal with milk so that the K.C.C. does not have a monopoly in this regard. This company tells us that it will buy milk from us at Sh.6.25 and sell it to other people at such- and-such a price. What is this? One man buys milk and sells it at prices that he himself controls! It is high time the Kenya Dairy Board, which is the regulatory agency for milk prices, licensed other people to compete with the K.C.C. so that we can get, at least, Sh.l0/- per kilogramme (?) of milk. We have made a calculation and found that one kilogramme (?) of milk costs more than Sh.l0/-. So, what is the use of discussing elections when our people have nothing in their pockets? Who will vote for you when he is hungry? Who is going to register? These are not irrelevant matters as far as these regulations are concerned as they apply to human beings. The welfare of Kenyans is paramount, and I urge the Minister for Co-operative Development to ensure that he ensures he supports the Kanu Government by seeing that dairy farmers are paid for their milk. If it is the Government that owes them money, he should do something to get these farmers paid.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support these regulations and urge, as was proposed by another hon. Member in this House, that the regulations go to a Committee of the whole House so that we nray^discuss them one by one. At this stage, there is no way in which anybody, besides the Attorney-General, could move an amendment to the regulations. So, I strongly urge that after this debate, the regulations be submitted to a Committee of the whole House so that we may ensure that we pass regulations which are in accordance with the Constitution and policies we have today.Sir, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Header>ADJOURNMENT</Header><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi): Hon. Members, it is now time for the interruption of business. The House is, therefore, adjourned until tomorrow, Thursday, 4th June, at 2.30 p.m. </Newspeech>The House rose at 6.30 p.m.
