However, we have already posted two more doctors to this hospital and they will arrive there at the end of this month. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wakole: Mr. Speaker, Sir, would the Assistant Minister tell this House what the required numbers of doctors and clinical officers in any one district hospital in the Republic are? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Speaker, Sir, initially, we required one doctor in this hospital but, due to our increased population and an increased number of cases of illness recorded at this particular hospital, we decided to increase the number of doctors to three. With regard to clinical officers, we have seven of them in this hospital and I think that is a good number just find now. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Arte: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister really in order to evade the question asked to him by hon. Wakple? He was asked to tell this House what the required numbers of doctors and clinical officers in district hospitals in the Republic are. We want to know the general establishment of doctors and clinical officers in each district hospital. He does not have to tell us what numbers of these officers there are right now.	</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the general establishment in any given hospital is one doctor.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Arte: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Hola District Hospital requires more than one doctor and I do not think the Assistant Minister is right in saying that the general establishment in any given district hospital is one doctor. This is not possible! The Assistant Minister has formed a habit of bulldozing questions like a tractor in this House. He stands up and says things which he is not sure about He should not mislead the House! He should tell us what the establishment of doctors and clinical officers is per district hospital according to the records he has in the Ministry. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not want to go into long stories. We have to wait until we have qualified doctors whom we can send to district hospitals. What I said is that at the moment we must have at least one qualified doctor in every district hospital. At the moment, we have three doctors at Hola District Hospital and seven clinical officers. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>Mr. Malebe: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister really in order to evade the question asked by hon. Wakole and then followed up by hon. Arte? The question itself is very simple. In the Ministry of Health, they must be havings an establishment chart which indicates that Such and such hospital should be run by so many doctors, clinical officer, nurses, and so on. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there should be three doctors in Hola District Hospital as pa the hospital's establishment. I know there was a time when it used to have only one doctor when we were short of doctors, but since we now have more doctors, we have posted two more doctors to this hospital However, if there is an urgent need for more doctors, we will send two or more doctors there for the sake of saving the lives of wananchi. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wambua: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could we know from the Assistant Minister when these two doctors will report to Hola District Hospital. Could he also give us the dates of the letters posting them to the hospital? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr.Speaker, Sir, Dr. J.W. Gitahi, P/No. 534555, will be leaving Embu Hospital to go to Hola District Hospital. Dr. F.H. Otieno, P/No.537237, will also leave Machakos Provincial Hospital for Hola District Hospital. There was a posting order, dated 15th April, 1992, issued to these two doctors and they will be arriving at Hola District Hospital at the end of June, this year. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Miruka-Owuor: I think the Assistant Minister is misleading the House. He should have said that the number of doctors in district hospitals depend on the population in the district. Perhaps when saying that there should at least be one doctor per district hospital, he could have said that the requirement is so many doctors per 1,000 people, or something like that. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the hon. Member heard me well, I said exactly that. You have, at least, to start from one doctor per hospital and then keep moving as we establish new departments within a given hospital. When posting doctors, we also take into consideration the average number of patients seen by a doctor per day. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wakole: Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the Minister aware that there is only one doctor and two clinical officers in Hola District Hospital and that this doctor is also serving Ngao District Hospital? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ogur: Yes, I am aware that there is one doctor in Hola District Hospital, but there are seven clinical officers in the hospital, and not two as the hon. Member is aleging. I have already stated that we have posted two more doctors to this hospital because of the problem in that area. </Newspeech><i>Question No. 167</i> <Header>COMPLETION OF YAMUMBI WATER PROJECT</Header>Dr. Misoi asked the Minister for Water Development: -(a)	what has delayed the completion of Yamumbi Water Project, in Uasin Gishu District; and(b)	whether he could consider extending this water supply to serve Ndege, Mutwot, Simat and Kapngetuny farms, in Simat Location, of Uasin Gishu District.<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Water Development (Mr. Mweu): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a) The completion of Yamumbi Water Project has been delayed by low annual funding of the implementation work by the European Economic Community. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wakole: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. From the way the Assistant Minister is answering the Question it looks as if he is sick! If he is sick he had better tell us so. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mweu: Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is hon. Wakole's opinion, but I am not sick. Perhaps, he should blame the recording machine and not me. I will repeat my reply.(a)	The completion of Yamumbi Water Project has been delayed by low annual funding of the implementation work by the European Economic Community during the 1981 to 1987 Financial Years and from 1989 to-date by the Uasin Gishu District Development Committee (DDC).(b)	Extension of the water supply to serve Ndege, Mutwot, Simat and Kapngetuny farms would depend on availability of shs950,000/- from the Uasin Gishu DDC to complete the remaining components of the project. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this project was started in 1981 and up to now it has not been completed. The Assistant Minister has not given adequate reasons why there was low funding by the EEC up to 1987 when the project had been designed for completion on time. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mweu: Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the information of the hon. Member the project was started in 1981. There has, however, been a delay in its implementation because of the financial flow. The EEC gave money as follows: Financial Year 1981/82 - Sh.300,000/=; Financial Year 1982/83 - Sh. 100,000/=; Financial Year 1983/84 - Sh.200,000/= and Financial Year 1984/85 - Sh.l50,000/=, making a total of Sh.750,000/=. This money was spread over four years, instead of being given in lumpsum at once. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: Mr. Speaker, Sir, whereas the Assistant has given the breakdown of the money given, he has not given the reasons why this money could not have been given in lumpsum at once. Could he tell the House whether the remaining components have been taken into account for the completion of the project and when the project is being completed? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mweu: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a self-help project. The Ministry of Water Development is merely giving technical advice on the construction work, whereas funds are coming from the EEC as well as from Uasin Gishu DDC, which gave Sh.515,800/= towards the construction work of Phase II. However, this money was not enough. The balance now required to complete this woik is Sh.950,000/=, and we look upon Uasin Gishu DDC to give us that balance to enable us to complete the project. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it would be inappropriate for the Ministry to say that it is only giving technical advice, especially when external funding is provided for a project like this one. Would it be in the interests of the good name of this country, especially from the donor side, for this project to stall? This is why the Ministry should chip in something as that is its role. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mweu: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Rural Development Fund (RDF) is a Government Fund, although the money in it comes from an external donor. Once this money comes to us, it becomes Government money, and we use it to help our people. We, as a Ministry, may not have money for this self-help project That is why we are maintaining that Uasin Gishu DDC should chip in to complete the second part of the project. </Newspeech><i>Question No. 250</i><Header>REPAIRS TO MAUGO RICE MILLS</Header>Mr. Ndong asked the Minister for Co-operative Development:-(a)	whether he is aware that the milling machine belonging to Maugo Rice Mills, in Kochia Location, has not been functioning for over a year; and(b)	if so, what remedial action is being taken to ensure that the machine is repaired or replaced.<Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: We have nobody here from the Ministry of Co-operative Development at the moment So we will come to this Question later. Mr. Mweru's Question. </Newspeech>(Question deferred) <i>Question No. 284</i><Header>TITLE DEED FOR MR. NDERIA</Header>Mr. Mweru asked the Minister for Local Government since Mr. L.M. Nderia, owner of Umoja Tenant Purchase House No. M150 A/C No.21985, has completed paying his loan in respect of the above property, what effort the Nairobi City Commission is making to enable Mr. Nderia to get his title deed for the property.<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Local Government (Mr. Wagura): Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I reply, I would like to know whether the hon. Questioner has consent from the sitting Member of Parliament for Embakasi to ask this Question. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Salat: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The hon. Member has asked a Question pertaining to a problem affecting a Kenyan and he does not need any consent from the Member of Parliament for Embakasi. Is he in order to say that he wants to know whether the hon. Questioner has consented to this Question being asked? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Supplies and Marketing (Mr. Mwenje): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I happen to be the Member of Parliament for this particular area and it is true that originally the hon. Questioner did not ask for my consent to ask this Question as he actually should have done. But, with due respect, I now give my consent for the Question to be answered because it is a fair one. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister misled the House. Instead of answering the Question, he sought to know whether clearance had been obtained from the Member of Parliament for Embakasi. Was he in order? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Order! I did not see anything wrong with that. I think the Assistant Minister was trying to draw attention that the hon. Questioner is not a Member of Parliament for Embakasi, which is not wrong. However, he would have had to answer the Question because once Questions come to the House they are to be answered regardless of where the hon. Members asking them come from. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Supplies and Marketing (Mr. Mwenje): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. With due respect to your ruling, I feel that it is a clear indication that if any hon. Member wants to ask a Question which affects another hon. Member's constituency he needs to get that hon. Member's consent So, I think it is clear that your ruling is fair. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Order! That is only for courtesy purposes. However, hon. Members can raise a Question on anything about Kenya. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ndirangu: On a point of order, Mr.Speaker, Sir. I do not know where the idea of consent from hon. Mwenje is coming in. This is because we have constituents who own property in Nairobi and they consult us to raise Questions regarding them in this House. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Mr. Ndirangu i agree with you and I have said you can ask about anything In Kenya. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Local Government (Mr. Wagura): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Cadastral survey of this particular area has been completed and reports have been submitted to the Director of Survey for his approval. As soon as the plans are authenticated and approved, title deeds to the allottees, including Mr. Nderia, will be issued. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mweru: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this tenant- purchase scheme was started in 1976 - it is 15 years now  and the Assistant Minister has said that survey work has been completed. Can he tell this House how soon title deeds are going to be issued? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wagura: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will not be able to give a definite date when the work will be completed but I can assure the hon. Member that it work in going on now and approval will be given at any time but I am not sure of the date. I would like to assure the hon. Member that title deeds will be issued as soon as possible. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mang'oli: The Assistant Minister has said that he cannot give a specific date when title deeds would be issued. Since he knows the workload that is remaining, he can calculate and tell when title deeds will be ready. He should not say that he does not know unless, he was, perhaps, given inadequate information by his officers. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wagura: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point here is that the Director of Survey is under the Ministry of Lands and Housing, and the Ministry and mine are coordinating this activity. Therefore, the hon. Member should rest assured that something is being done about this matter. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mang'oli: On a point of order, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister now implying that this exercise is being delayed by the Ministry of Lands and Housing? If he does not know when survey work will be completed, he should have referred this Question to the Ministry of Lands and Housing. We would like to know when these title deeds will be issued. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wagura: I think the hon. Mang'oli wants to mislead the House. The Director of Survey is under the Ministry of Lands and Housing and not under our Ministry. This exercise must, therefore, be done by those people. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Minister aware that this tenant purchase scheme comprises of over 3,000 units of which 50 per cent have been completely paid for? Was it in order not tell this House when title these deeds will be issued to these people? One thousand five hundred people have already paid up and they want title deeds. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wagura: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this scheme consists of 3,085 units. I have already said that work is going on now so that all the allottees can get their title deeds as soon as possible. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Omino: Mr, Speaker, Sir, since the very concept of tenant purchase scheme means that houses will be paid for and title deeds issued and since this seems to be a problem in all tenants purchase schemes in Nairobi, Kisumu, Mombasa and so on, can the Assistant Minister give an undertaking now that they are going to do this exercise in all tenants purchase schemes in the country so that title deeds are issued as soon loan repayment is completed? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wagura: Mr. Speaker, Sir, my good friend, the hon. Omino, has come up with a very good proposal and this is exactly what the Ministry has decided to do. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Hon. Members: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><i>Question No. 205</i><Header>TARMACKING OF ROADS IN KINGONGO ESTATE</Header>Mr. Ndirangu asked the Minister for Local Government what plans there are to tarmac roads in Kingongo Estate, of Nyeri Town. <Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Local Government (Mr. Wagura): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.There are no immediate plans to tarmac access roads in Kingongo Estate, of Nyeri Town, due to lack of funds. However, the Council has always endeavoured to murrain access roads to ensure that they are made all-weather. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ndirangu: Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the rainy season, those people with vehicles have a very rough time because their cars get stuck in the mud right in front of their houses, and yet this is a very important estate. Why should the Assistant Minister tell this House that the ministry has no funds to improve these roads? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wagura: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the problem we have is lack of funds. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Anaswa: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a very important question. What priority is this estate given in the infrastructure of the town? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wagura: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point here is that the council has tried all along to make these roads all-weather. In fact, during this particular financial year, the municipality has spent Sh.100,000/= on murraming this road. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Omino: Mr. Speaker, Sir, since it is now clear that the revenue raised in the form of road tolls can be used on repairing roads within municipalities, could the Assistant Minister tell us why only Nairobi has benefited from this money and not Kisumu, Nyeri, Eldoret, and so on? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wagura: Mr. Speaker, Sir, money from toll stations fall under the Ministry of Public Work. If the hon. Member wants to get more information on this matter, he should get in touch with that Ministry. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ndirangu: Mr. Speaker, Sir, Sh. 100,000/= is very little money being used on a road in an important estate like this one in a whole financial year. When I talk about this road, I have in mind avenues and other minor roads around Kingongo Estate. Could the Assistant Minister confirm or deny that Nyeri Municipal Council is doing very little or nothing to maintain existing roads and to put up new ones? However, when it comes to bickering and petty politics, I think the Council qualifies for a medal. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wagura: Mr. Speaker, Sir, Nyeri Municipal Council has done a lot despite the fact that it has very little money. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Let us go back to Mr. Salat's Question. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Salat: Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I ask my Question, I apologise for coming late. </Newspeech><i>Question No. 191</i><Header>RADIO COMMUNICATION IN GALMAGALLA</Header>Mr. Salat asked the Minister of State, Office of the President when he will provide a radio communication equipment for the administration police post at Galmagalla.<Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, Office of the President(Mr. Kikwai): Mr.Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Galmagalla Administrative Police Post has been itemised together with similar posts in operation areas to be equipped with radio communication facilities. However, this will be done as soon as funds are available. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Salat: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has given this House the traditional answer, "This will be done when funds become available." This area, however, is only about 30 kilometres from the Kenya- Somalia border and has always been used as a transit point by bandits coming from across the border. I asked this Question in 1989, and I was given the same reply to the effect that my request would be fulfilled when funds became available. Is the Assistant Minister really serious in ensuring that the security of this country is given priority above everything else? He should also tell us when radio communication equipment is going to be provided. We are now debating the Budget and funds are available. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kikwai: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I appreciate the hon. Member's concern, but, as I said earlier, we are looking for funds in order to install radio communication equipment in the area under question, hopefully during this financial year. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mang'oli: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister said earlier that this equipment would be provided when funds become available. He, however, now says that this is going to be done within this financial year. Which is which? It appears as if the Assistant Minister wants to borrow words to make his case in thisHouse. This is a security issue and if the Office of the President is going to handle security matters anyway, our hope of being protected is going to be eroded. Could the Assistant Minister tell us exactly when this police post will be supplied with the required equipment? We are not requesting that this equipment be installed in the hon. Questioner's house, but in a police post</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kikwai: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said that this equipment will be installed as a matter of priority and that this will definitely be done within this financial year. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has confirmed that this radio communication equipment will be installed in the said police post this year. How much money is it going to cost the Government to buy this equipment? lbs this money been budgeted? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kikwai: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would not be able to tell the exact amount of money involved, but estimates have been made and I can make them available to this House as soon as I get the proper figure. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mang'oli: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to say that he will bring this figure here later? If you listened to him properly, you will recall that he said, in his earlier reply, that this equipment would be installed when funds became available. He now says that he will bring the relevant estimates here later. Was he really prepared to reply to this Question? If he was not, we request you to defer this Question until the Assistant Minister comes here tomorrow with the relevant answer. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kikwai: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am in order to say what I have said. I have only said that I will bring the relevant figure here later. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Salat: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I appreciate the Assistant Minister's latter reply to the effect that funds for this purpose are going to be made available this financial year, I wonder whether he is in' order to tell us that installation of the said equipment will be done when funds become available. We should know that a certain amount of money is required for the purchase of radio communications equipment all over the country, including the set for Galmagalla. If he does not know how much this equipment is going to cost, which means he does not know how much money he is budgeting for, would not be in order to say that he is not giving us a proper answer, but only misleading us? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kikwai: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not misleading the House. Galmagalla Administration Police Post has been itemised together with similar posts in operation areas to be equipped with radio communication facilities. Finalisation of the supply of this vital service has been withheld until funds become available. Estimates have been made, and we will make them available to this House. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Salat: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. What I am trying to say is that Estimates have been made and funds will become available. If the Assistant Minister, however, does not know how much money is going to be available for buying this equipment, I think I would be in order to say that he is misleading this House. Could he provide the estimated cost of this equipment and tell us exactly when these funds are going to be available? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kikwai: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we put together all the money required for the purchase of security equipment. This is why I am requesting to be allowed to bring here the exact figure relating to Galmagalla Administration Police Post. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mang'oli: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We need your protection against Assistant Ministers who come here with answers that have not been prepared by their Ministries. The Assistant Minister here is now giving us an answer that has nothing to do with his Ministry. The Ministry told him to tell us that this equipment would be installed when funds become available, but he is now misleading this House by saying that this money will be available this fiscal year. We need your guidance here. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: In the interest of keeping time, the Questioner wants to know whether this radio communication equipment will be provided and when this will be done. At first, the Assistant Minister said that this would be done when funds become available, but that answer was not satisfactory. When he was pressed to say exactly when this would be done and how much money the purchase of the equipment would cost, he noticed this money was provided for in the current financial year but he was not sure of the exact sum relating to Galmagalla because it is put together with money for other areas. So, he asked for time to get the exact figure relating to Galmagalla. Perhaps you may want to ask him when exactly he is going to bring this figure here. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Salat: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from your wise ruling, could the Assistant Minister now tell us exactly when he is going to bring us an answer as to how much money has been voted in the current Estimates for Galmagalla radio communication equipment and when this equipment is going to be availed there? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kikwai: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will bring this answer here next week. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Let us go back to Mr. Ndong's Question. </Newspeech><i>Question No. 250</i><Header>REPAIRS TO MAUGO RICE MILLS</Header>Mr. Ndong asked the Minister for Co-operative Development:-(a)	whether he is aware that the milling machine belonging to Maugo Rice Mills, in Kochia Location, has not been functioning for over a year; and(b)	if so, what remedial action is being taken to ensure that the machine is repaired or replaced.<Newspeech>The Minister for Co-operative Development (Mr. Cheruiyot): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I apologise for coming late.I now beg to reply.(a)	Maugo Rice Mills is currently in operation using an old milling machine. However, during 1989, Maugo Co-operative Society purchased a new milling machine from Lagum Distributors Ltd., in Nairobi, machine model B7 at a cost of Sh.95,000/=. When the machine was found to be defective, Lagum Distributors refused to return the money and, subsequently, the society took the matter to court in September, 1991. The court finally ruled that Lagum Distributors should return to the society Sh.75,000/=.(b)	The question, therefore, of repairing the milling machine does not arise and it is the discretion of the society to purchase another machine when it receives funds from Lagum Distributors. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Ndong: While thanking the Minister for his answer, I wonder whether he is aware that Maugo Rice Mills, in Kochia Location Rangwe, has neither received its money back nor the machine it meant to purchase. Does he know that? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Cheruiyot: Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am aware of that, but there is nothing we can do because the court ordered Lagum Distributors to repay Sh.75,000/= to the society and so far it has not done so. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Minister in order to refuse to answer the question as to why this money cannot be repaid to the co-operative society whereas he is in charge of co-operative development? Is this in order? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Cheruiyot: Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is in order. What I said is that a court order is involved here. The said society went to court suing Lagum Distributors for a refund of the society's money, but the company has not refunded the money to the society. Since this is a court order, it has to be enforced and the society should apply for attachment or some other action by the court. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mang'oli: Mr. Speaker, Sir, what action has the Minister taken to enhance the delivery of this machine to the Society? What is the Ministry doing to assist this Society? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Cheruiyot: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we shall assist. We had not known that the Society had not received the money. Since we are now aware that the Society did not receive the money we will assist the Society to apply for the money. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Let us go back to Mr. Twarith's Question. </Newspeech><i>Question No.283</i><Header>LIVESTOCK DISEASES IN TANGULBEI</Header><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Is Mr. Twarith still not in? </Newspeech>(Question dropped)<Header>QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE NIGHT MEETING AT MR. MUTISYA'S HOME</Header><Newspeech>Mr. Wambua: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister of State, Office of the President, the following Question by Private Notice.(a)	Is the Minister aware that on the night of 28th May, 1992, a meeting was held in the home of a Mr. Simeon Mailu Mutisya, of Vyulya Sub-Location, Ndumbi Section, which started at 7.30 p.m. and ended after 9.00 p.m., and that the meeting was attended by over 12 people?(b)	If so, could the Minister tell this House whether this meeting was licensed and the date the licence was issued? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Mr. Onyancha): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.I am not aware of any meeting that took place on 28th May, 1992, as alleged in the Question. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wambua: Mr.Speaker, Sir, I wonder what is happening because the answers that I always get from the Office of the President are negative. I know for sure that there was a night meeting on that particular night. This meeting started at 7.30 p.m. and ended after 9.00 p.m. The meeting took place in the home of the person mentioned in this Question. I am surprised to hear from the Assistant Minister here that there was no such meeting. Could he tell us what machinery he used to investigate? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Onyancha: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have used our normal machinery to investigate this matter to find out whether any meeting took place, and we have not collected any information that would lead us to conclude that there was any such meeting. The hon. Member seems to be having information which can help us. If he has it, he is invited to give it to us so that we can use it to try and establish the facts involved. On the other hand, we would have expected that if he had that information and this is a night meeting which is illegal he should have reported this to the nearest police station immediately. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wambua: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Office of the President has the necessary machinery to enable them to carry out investigations. They have the Special Branch. I have told the Assistant Minister the exact place where the meeting was held and it is not for me to go and investigate the matter. Why did the  Assistant Minister not take time to find out why this illegal meeting was allowed to take place? Does it mean that night meetings have now been legalised? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Onyancha: The law is very clear, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in that no night meetings are allowed. That is why I said that the matter should have been reported to the nearest police station immediately. If the hon. Member has done so, we have not received any information up to now as to whether this meeting took place. As I said, we invite the hon. Member to give us any information which may be in his hands so that we can use it to try and find out whether this meeting actually took place. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Malebe: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is deliberately refusing to be aware of the matter at hand. This is becaiise the Office of the President has the machinery to know what is going on in the country because it has the Special Branch, for example. This particular meeting happens not to have been licensed because it was a night meeting. Are this Ministry's officers really working to inform the Assistant Minister of what goes on at night? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Onyancha: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are all human beings. Even Special Branch officers are human beings and they also go to sleep at night also. They only manage to collect information. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kamuyu: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Now that hon. Wambua has informed the Assistant Minister that this meeting was held in the home of a Mr. Simeon Mailu Mutisya, of Vyulya Sub-Location, Ndumbi Section, what action is the Assistant Minister going to take to investigate this matter? Could he confirm that he will send his officers, who he says make many mistakes, to that place to investigate the matter so that he may report back to this House later? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Onyancha: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the necessary steps have been taken. This Mr. Simeon Mailu Mutisya has denied he had any meeting or any people in his place during that particular night. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wambua: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister should look into this matter. Mr. Simeon Mailu Mutisya accommodated that night meeting in his house because even the registrationnumber of the vehicle which went there is known. </Newspeech><Newspeech>An. hon. Member: Give us their names! </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wambua: No, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not going to tell you who these people were. It is the Assistant Minister's business to and out what happened there, and I have given him that homework. The number of the people who went there is known. The meeting discussed things up to 9.00 p.m. and some money was dished out. Therefore, the Assistant Minister should look for the details of this meeting. Of course, Mr. Mailu will never accept that there was a meeting in his home on that night. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Onyancha: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am beginning to wonder whether the hon. Member himself attended that night meeting and also took part in the dishing out of this money. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wambua: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am very disappointed and I think the Assistant Minister should withdraw that remark because I did not attend that meeting. I will never attend any night meeting because I know what the law says about night meetings. The Assistant Minister should withdraw that remark because I was not there. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Onyancha: Mr. Speaker, Sir, no night meetings are allowed anywhere in this country. Even a licence cannot be given for a night meeting. The hon. Member seems to have in his possession information that can help us establish these facts. I have invited him to give me that information so that I can use it to investigate the matter. If he is not willing to give us that information, then I do not know what we are going to do. We have no information to indicate that there was such a meeting. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mang'oli: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Question should be deferred so that the Assistant Minister can go back and bring the necessary information. I suspect that those who are supposed to investigate this matter were have been asleep. So, when they wake up, we want them to go there and carry out investigations. The Assistant Minister should not come here and try to force an hon. Member to give him information. The Assistant Minister has the right machinery to enable him to carry out investigations into this matter. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Onyancha: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have taken the necessary steps and there is no evidence that that meeting took place. If the hon. Member has any information that can help us, let him co-operate with us so that we may establish the facts. We are all human beings. We are not angels. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Would I be in order to say that hon. Onyancha is not honest to himself. This is because</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Onyancha: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: I am on a point of order, Mr."Speaker, Sir. Unless the Office of the President has lost direction or is not in control, there is no way in which the Assistant Minister is unable to know whether there was a meeting or not. There might have been a gathering to make funeral arrangements. The Assistant Minister should be honest and tell us whether there was any kind of gathering there or not</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Onyancha: Before I answer that question, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is it in order for the hon. Member to insinuate that I am not honest in my answer to this Question? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Order, hon. Members! I did not hear that word being used, but if it was used, I must remind you that there are certain words that are not allowed to be used in this House because they are un-parliamentary. So, if you uttered those words, hon. Makhanu, you may wish to withdraw them and make peace with your colleague. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: Mr. Speaker, Sir, am I in order to say that hon. Onyancha is not honest with himself? That is almost tantamount to saying that he is misleading the House. </Newspeech>(Applause)<Newspeech>Mr. Onyancha: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I understand English well, that is tantamount to insinuating that I was dishonest in my answer. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Order! I do not think that he has said that you are dishonest. He says that the answer itself may not be all that orderly.(Noise)Order! Order, hon. Members! While an hon. Member may be honest, the answer that he gives may appear to be incorrect. In all fairness, we have to wait and read the HANSARD tomorrow to really know exactly what has been said in order that I may be able to give a proper ruling. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Onyancha: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member has repeated in this House infront of the Chair the actual words he used and so we do not need to wait up to tomorrow to refer to the HANSARD so as to confirm what he has said. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Well, I did not hear what he said properly. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Hon. Members: Point of order. On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Onyancha: In that case, Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Order! Order, hon. Onyancha! When an hon. Member rises on a point of order, you are supposed to sit down. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wambua: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister said that the investigations his Ministry carried out revealed that the person who accommodated this meeting did not reveal this. How can that person reveal that he held a meeting in his house? The Assistant Minister would have used his proper machinery and, at the same time, consulted people around that area instead of going straight to the person who accommodated the meeting. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Onyancha: Mr. Speaker, Sir, since this is a Question by Private Notice, the period between the day the hon. Member put the Question to the House and the time I am answering it was very brief. Within this brief period, our investigations have indicated that no positive information has been found to conclude that there was such a meeting. That is why I have repeated three times that the hon. Member would be useful to us and to himself if he could provide us with, some information which may be in his possession to help us establish these facts. Otherwise, I cannot see how fair I could be to the hon. Member. If he wants us to use our machinery, we will do so as long as it is possible and we will come back with a better reply. As far as we are concerned. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Order, hon. Members! This kind of situation consumes a lot of time that may be used on other very important points of order. The Assistant Minister has said that, in view of the fact that the Question is by Private Notice and that he has taken trouble to find out that no such meeting took place, he is prepared to carry out further investigations. However, since the hon. Member has come up with additional information, the Assistant Minister is willing to take that information and lode into the matter again. I hope that you are satisfied so that we may move on to other matters. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Wambua: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I quite agree with what the Assistant Minister and the Chair has said. In the first instance, I was not approached to provide any additional information. Therefore, could the Assistant Minister tell us the approximate time when he will be ready to bring the correct answer to this House? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Onyancha: I cannot, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because I am waiting for the hon. Member to give me the information that he has. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Hon. Members: Point'of order. On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Order! Order, hon. Members! I want you to be mindful of the time and the fact that the debate on the Committee of Ways and Means must start at exactly 3.30 p.m. When I see 10 hon. Members standing on points of order, I am getting worried that we may never start that debate in time. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Salat: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I appreciate your concern about the time, I must say that the Assistant Minister has made a very serious statement which he cannot be allowed to get away with. In his earlier reply, he said that Special Branch officers are also human beings and that they go to sleep at the night. Is he suggesting that when this meeting was held, there were no Special Branch officers on duty and that they could, therefore, not know what was happening? If so, how many such meetings go unreported in the country? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Order, Mr. Salat! The Assistant Minister has agreed to get more information from Mr. Wambua and continue with further investigations. You are taking us back by introducing the question of Special Branch officers going to sleep, and so on.Mr. Wako, please make your point of order. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Malebe: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Order, Mr. Malebe! I am still on my feet However, I have already called on the Attorney-General to raise his point of order. </Newspeech><Header>POINT OF ORDERIPK - ERRONEOUS NEWSPAPER HEADLINES</Header><Newspeech>The Attorney General (Mr. Wako): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. My attention has been drawn to headlines appearing in today's newspapers. The Daily Nation is headed: "Uproar over IPK as A-G leaves", whereas The Standard is headed: "IPK: Wako is illusive". I, therefore, think that I should explain to this House what exactly happened because if the newspapers were aware of what happened, these headlines would not have been used.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I received notice of a Question by Private Notice on Friday at about 3.30 p.m. as I was leaving for Kisumu. On arrival at Kisumu Airport, I telephoned my office to get the telephone number of hon. Mwidau because I felt that it was not an opportune time to reply to that question as I was expecting an appeal from the decision of the Registrar of Societies to the Attorney-General as required under the Societies Act When I get such an appeal I act in a quasi-judicial function. I have to study the grounds of the appeal carefully, formulate my answers and reply to, first and foremost, the appellant who in this case would be the Islamic Political Party of Kenya.I got two telephone numbers of hon. Mwidau and as soon as I go to Kisumu I telephoned those two numbers, and they were either not working, out of order or non existent I then managed to get hon. Bidu's telephone number and when I called him, I asked him to get in touch with hon. Mwidau, which he did on Saturday, and I also sent other emissaries. On Monday morning, I was assured that my message had arrived, and I had no reason to doubt that hon. Mwidau had agreed to defer his Question. I then came here at a 2.15 p.m. to wait for hon. Mwidau along with my emissaries. I continued to be assured that hon. Mwidau had agreed to defer the Question. I waited until 2.45 p.m, but hon. Mwidau still did not turn up. I assumed, may be wrongly, that he may not be coming to Parliament today and, due to pressure of work in my office, I went back to there. I was, therefore, not running away from answering the Question.(Applause)The Attorney-General of this country will answer any Questions which pertain to his office without fear or favour because he has been answering Questions every time since he was in high school, at the university and throughout his professional career. He will not shy off from answering any Question. That is why I felt that I must explain to the House exactly what happened.If hon. Mwidau informed my emissaries that he would defer his Question and did not" live up to it, then I will leave it to him and his God. If he never understood my emissaries, then I would apologise for that misunderstanding which has brought about these wrong headlines in today's newspapers. I thought I should explain to hon. Members exactly what happened yesterday. Thank you very much. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Next Order. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>Mr. Okondo: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker,Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: No, time does not allow any more points of order.Mr. Okondo, you are a long-serving hon. Member and we do not have time. It is now 3.30 p.m., time for commencement of business. Committee of Ways and Means must start its business not later than 3.30 p.m. </Newspeech>COMMITTEE OF WAYS AND MEANS(Order for Committee read)MOTIONTHAT, MR. SPEAKER DO NOW LEAVE THE CHAIR(The Vice-President and Minister for Finance on 4.6.92)(Resumption of Debate interrupted on 10.6.92)(Third Day of Budget Debate)<Newspeech>Mr. Kipkorir: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to contribute to this Motion. I stand up to congratulate His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for the manner in which he presented the budget in this House. It is high time we developed our country. The way the Budget was presented to us was most welcome. It has given us a very good opportunity to provide the necessary services to the country. His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance presented a very good Budget to the country.When it comes to essential commodities, particularly food, we. must be very thankful to His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for his budget. We must be grateful to the Government since it has a lot of understanding of our people. We need to work very hard in order to balance the nature of the economy of our country.Life continues and there is a lot of demand for food throughout the country, especially in my area. I would, therefore, like to appeal to the Minister for Agriculture to make use of water to grow some crops. I refer to some areas where all our cattle were taken away by bandits. It is high time the Ministers for Agriculture, Regional Development and Water Development co-operated so as to provide services to wananchi. My people are very hard-working, but they have been frustrated by banditry from neighbouring countries. It is high time our economy was improved. So it is up to my people and neighbours to work hard so that we are successful.Mr. Speaker, Sir, unless we have peace, love and unity in the country we will not be able to achieve anything. I thank the Government for the necessary action taken to provide security in the country. We need to improve more on this aspect Therefore, I would like to appeal to the Minister in charge of security to provide us with adequate security in the country.His Excellency the President is very much concerned about the welfare of every Kenyan, and I thank him for that. So those who are working with him should make sure that Ministries are well organised. For instance, people have been sick in my area and it took time for the Ministry concerned to provide people with drugs. Therefore, when this House passes resolutions.(Mr. Okondo and Dr. Misoi stood up in their places) </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Education (Mr. Karauri): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Our. Standing Orders provide that only one Member should be on his feet contributing at a time. But now I can see quite a number of Members on their feet Is that in order? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: No, it is not. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Hon. Okondo and Dr. Misoi, resume your seats, please! </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kipkorir: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as of now, we have very many people in my area without identity cards. When I ask the officer concerned why this is so, he tells me that funds have not been released from the relevant Ministry. So I would like to appeal to the Ministry and the Treasury to release funds as soon as possible since we want people to register as voters. I think it is high time His Excellency the President directed that everybody should have an identity card. When you ask people why they do not have these cards, they give some vague answers. At the moment, I am appealing to the Government to consider the plight of the people in my constituency, particularly in Endoo Mara and Emoi Locations, where drought has really affected the people. The people in these locations depend on cattle, most of which have died due to drought. As a result, most children there have been sent away from school for lack of school fees. It is for this reason that I am appealing to the Government to come to our aid by providing us with food.Mr. Speaker, I would also like to take this opportunity to appeal to various Government Ministries to ensure that funds allocated to projects are fully utilized instead of being returned to the Treasury at end of the financial year. At the moment, we see projects all over the country which have not been completed and we would like these projects to be completed before new ones are started. I have in mind some water projects in my constituency where a lot of money has been spent, but people do not get water. The district development officers and project officers in the field must assist the Government by doing their work properly. They must ensure that every cent is used for the purpose for which it has been voted. This is the only way in which development projects can be successful. At the moment, we need development projects to be started in every comer of the Republic.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to say something about the Ministry of Public Works. It is unfortunate to note that the majority of roads in the country are impassable. This Ministry should ensure that these roads are repaired so that wananchi can travel easily particularly at this time of registration of voters. We would like to see roads in rural areas being murramed so that they can be turned into all-weather road so that wananchi can communicate easily.With those few remarks, Sir, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Education (Mr. Kamotho): Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my colleagues in supporting the 1992/93 Budget Speech as presented by the Vice- President and Minister for Finance last Thursday in this House. I wish to record my appreciation to the Vice- President for bringing a Budget to this House which is extremely progressive; a Budget that shows a lot of concern for ordinary Kenyans and is likely to bring new life into the economy of this country. This clearly indicates the concern that the Kanu Government has for the plight of its own people. At a time like this, we are faced with problems of drought and an influx of refugees from our neighbouring countries, and the Budget itself indicated the concern it has on the current environmental situation in our country. Therefore, the decision by the Vice-President and Minister for Finance not to impose any tax which would dig deeper in to the pockets of ordinary Kenyan, is of great satisfaction to all of us.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to my fellow hon. colleagues in Kanu to have one common understanding in this new era of multi-party politics. It is absolutely important for all of us, as Kanu leaders, to demonstrate oneness in supporting the President. We must live up to the promises that we made to our own people on our attainment of Independence. At the inception of the ruling Party, Kanu, in 1960, we pledged to the people that we would try to promote national unity. We accepted at that crucial time that we would strive to make all the 42 Kenyan tribes one nation in order to promote the Uhuru ideals which made our people sacrifice their lives and property so that this country could be free.It is for this reason that we, as leaders, must talk with one voice, particularly at this time of multiparty politics. It is important that we do not make utterances or act in a manner that shows that we are not united as Kenyan leaders. After 29 years of Independence in this country, we should be speaking with one voice. When we attained Independence, we were almost 7.5 million Kenyans, but I assume that more than half of these people are dead today. Today, we have 24 million Kenyans most of whom were born after attainment of Independence. These people do not know that we were not given our Independence on a silver plate. We must tell them that we had to struggle to be free, and it is in defence of this freedom, that we must ensure that personal, sectional, tribal, ethnical or other interests in our society do not override national interests.Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to call upon my hon. colleagues in this House to stop making utterances which may bring about misunderstanding among our own people. The issue of Molo clashes is a thorn in our flesh and when our "wounds" are now healing, we do not want anybody to remind us of something we want to forget Therefore, leaders must stop taking us back to that issue. Let us bring our people together so that we can continue to develop a country that we can all be proud of.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to say that the Founding Father of this Nation, the late Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, must be respected and his name protected. His name must not be tarnished by anybody in this House or anywhere else. I would, in this connection, like to register my concern about what I saw in the Press last week that fellows of the opposition party called the Democratic Party of Kenya (D.P.) held a meeting in the late Mzee Jomo Kenyatta's home. If Kenyatta woke up today and found a party that was not Kanu holding a meeting in his home, he would whip anybody he found there. It is for this reason that I would like to register my concern by saying that whatever party we are in, we must all learn to respect the name of the founding father of this nation. He was also the founding father of Kanu and, it is wrong for any party to try to tarnish his name.Furthermore, I would like to appeal to the members of opposition parties to desist from calling upon Kenyans not to exercise their inalienable constitutional rights of registering as voters. Registering as a voter is the right of a citizen; it is not a political party affair. This is because whether you seek votes to be elected as a councillor, Member of Parliament or the President, you have to be a registered voter irrespective of your own party. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. J.N. Mungai: On-a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I quite agree with the sentiments of the Minister, which are quite good and we are all supporting the registration. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: What is your point of order? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. J.N. Mungai: Mr. point is that members of the opposition, though I am not supporting them, are talking about irregularities, such as the spoiling of voters cards, which I personally witnessed on Monday. Would I be in order to ask the hon. Minister to also make sure that these cards are not spoiled deliberately? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Education (Mr. Kamotho): Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member should know that we have an independent Electoral Commission, which is appointed in accordance with Constitution of this country. In any case, I am the Minister for Education and I have nothing to do with the implementation of voter registration. So, I cannot do anything about what the hon. Member is talking about. Secondly, registration of voters is not the work of Kanu; it is the work of the Electoral Commission.I would also like to ask Members of this House to understand one thing that we have said, and we will continue to say, which is that our Constitution protects minority and religious groups in this country and there should be no fear whatsoever. I would, therefore, like to make it absolutely clear that the protection of every individual. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. J.N. Mungai: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Could the Minister tell the House whether he is supporting the spoiling of voters cards or not? The way he answered me is as if he is an accomplice in thespoiling of these cards. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Education (Mr. Kamotho): Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I was saying the Constitution of this country covers all the individuals in this country. Thank you, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Water Development (Mr. Mweu): Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Spika. Mhe Njenga bado hajatueleza vile kura zinavyoharibiwa.Mr. J.N. Mungai: Bw. Spika, mimi naweza kusema zinaharibiwa kwa sababu Jumatatu iliyopita, mimi mwenyewe nilishuhudia kadi ya mama mmoja huko Molo ambayo ilikuwa imeharibiwa; tuliirudisha na ikarekebishwa. Kwa hivyo huwezi kuniambia mimi sijui ninayosema. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Water Development (Mr. Mweu): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Order! I will give hon. Mang'oli time to contribute to the debate; let us not digress. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mang'oli: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me time to also to contribute to this very important Motion, which was moved by the Vice- President and Minister for Finance. Now that the Budget has been read, I would like to ask Ministers to release funds to districts and divisions so that they may begin to spend them. As I am speaking now, there are still general complaints of lack of petrol in areas like Webuye. We hope that this money will be released as soon as possible.I would also like to thank the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for having presented a Budget which took care of the common man. Even though the Minister for Education, who is also the Kanu Secretary-General, told us not to touch on issues of Molo and Mt. Elgon, as if they did not exist, I would like to ask the Minister of State, Office of the President, to move the people of Mount Elgon who are still staying in churches back to their homes. I also urge the Minister to allow students who are not attending school in Mt. Elgon to go to schools in Chesamis and Kamusinga free of charge because they are losing their classes. Since tribal clashes started, they have not gone to class, and yet they will appear for examination. It is not that I want to ask for too much but I would like this to be done.Mr. Speaker, Sir, it rumoured that Webuye District Hospital was to be opened and I wonder why it has taken so long to open it. If it was because of lack of funds, now t{hat the money is available, we call upon the Minister for Health to have this hospital operating fully so that people may use it.I would also like to ask the Minister to release grant funds to schools in my constituency so that they may pay salaries to the staff who are employed directly by the Ministry. It is important that these grants are released on time. There have contradictions where the Minister says grants are available while his Assistant Minister says there are no grants. So, this money should be released to schools because at the moment schools are using school fees to pay their staff.The other area I would like to touch on is that there are some plots in Webuye Town Council which have up to now not been allocated to allottees. I would like the Minister for Local Government to ensure that title deeds are released to these people so that they may develop those particular plots.As for roads, I wonder why we should have poor roads in that area when we have all our tractors. I would like the Minister for Public works to instruct his officers to start working on these roads. As I am speaking now, you cannot drive on the Vokoli-Milani-Sereni Road because it is impassable, and yet that is a murrain road. There is very little to be done although you get officers saying that they need Sh.200,000/=. We are now in multi-party politics and we would like the Kanu Government to take this opportunity to do these things so that we can have a way of questioning what other parties are going to do.We have Malmonyo Health. Centre in my constituency which has been on the Budget for a long time now and I am wonder whether the money earmarked for it has been diverted to another project. This project appears on the Estimates every year, but the money earmarked for it is not released. The Ministry has kept on saying that there is no land for it. We have land in Malmonyo, Ndivisi Location, and - we would like construction of that particular health centre to be started so that the people can benefit. The nearest health centre is at Ndivisi, which is almost 30 or 40 miles away. I hope when the Vice-President and Minister for Finance comes to reply, he will tell us where these funds have been going because they have been appearing every year in the Estimates as having been released and yet nothing is happening on the ground.We also have another health centre in Webuye, called Sichivo, and I would like to urge the Minister to ensure that it starts operating. We have put up buildings on a Harambee basis, and what is now lacking is medical personnel. The local people have contributed money to this health centre and there has been an attempt to transfer it from Sichivo to Milo. I would like the Minister to clear the air on this matter and tell us why it has not started operating when the local people have already contributed Sh.200,000/= on a Harambee basis.The other thing I would like to talk about is electricity. We do not have electricity in Webuye, and this means that schools there do not undertake commercial education or industrial business, and I would like to urge the Minister for Energy to do something about it. The same thing applies to the Jua Kali sector. Money is provided in the estimates year after year to the tune of Sh.1.5 million for electrification in Webuye and I wonder where it goes. I asked the then Minister for Energy, Mr. Biwott, about this and he told me that his officers were going to start on this programme but up to now, nothing has been done. It is immaterial for us to talk about the Jua Kali sector in the rural areas when we are not ready to provide electricity to such industries. The Jua Kali sector cannot generate employment without the provision of electricity. I wonder whether the figure of those employed under the Jua Kali sector, as quoted in the Bill which we discussed, was correct. I do not believe that this figure is correct.I would like the Minister to provide us with electricity because the money is already there. The Ministry has carried out surveys and I wonder who is "sitting" on this money. Is it the Kenya Power and Lighting Company or has it been diverted to buying new Mercedes Benzes 300 SE when we have no electricity in Webuye? The cost of acquiring electricity in Webuye Town is so high that most people cannot afford it. For instance, in order for one to have electricity connected from a very close electric pole to his house, he is required to pay Sh.50,000/=. I have been talking about this issue even in public meetings, but nothing is being done.Finally, I would like to talk about water. I have always said that we have a problem of water in Webuye. Water cannot be obtained easily and yet we have Webuye Falls nearby. We have a water project in Khalumuri against which Sh.50,000/= has been provided and it has been said that Sh.20,000/= has already been spent and I believe the. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Your time is up, Mr. Mang'oli. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mang'oli: With those few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support this Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Education (Mr. Karauri): Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me a chance to contribute to this Motion.First of all, I would like to congratulate the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for presenting a very good and balanced Budget. I am sure that everybody in the country is happy about it because after reading the Economic Survey, which came out a few weeks before the Budget, people expected a very difficult Budget that would require them to pay a lot more. This Budget has come as relief to many Kenyans and if this trend continues, productivity of the economy will-Continue going up and not down. When people are taxed less, they produce more. In the final analysis they end up paying more in the form of taxes. But if they are over-taxed, productivity goes down and the people end up pay less in taxes than expected.In order for this economy to improve, we must all be productive in our areas of operation. I am happy that the Government is selling some of the unproductive parastatal bodies but the question we should ask ourselves is that the person who is going to buy them is expected to make profits. If our parastatal bodies cannot make profits, nobody will be ready to buy them. What lacks in most of these parastatal bodies is expert management. If we managed our parastatal bodies like private companies, I am sure we will make profits. But what happens occasionally is that once heads of parastatal bodies are appointed, they assume that they are running a public institution which they can loot and do anything they wish. This is because they think that the Government has an unending source of finance and that it will always finance what they have looted. Since not all parastatal bodies are going to be sold, we should try in future to have expert managers in those bodies. If we do this, I am sure we will not go wrong.In this Budget Speech, the Vice-President and Minister for Finance talked about how the prices of coffee have gone down. Since I am a coffee farmer and I represent a farming community! I would like to say something about this crop. When prices go down, as has been the case in the past, the farmers have a tendency of abandoning their coffee to the extent of even wanting to uproot it. How can we improve the situation? We can only do this by giving the farmers some incentives since this crop is a big foreign exchange earner. For instance, if farmers stay for one year without payment and they have to take their children to school the most natural reaction would be to abandon their coffee trees.I would like to suggest that those who are charged with the responsibility of managing coffee, that is, the Kenya Planters Co-operative Union, the Coffee Board of Kenya and the Government in general, must look for a way of keeping the farmer going when the prices are bad. Even if it means loans to be repaid over a long period, say, in 15 or 20 years, the coffee farmer must be given those incentives. Coffee prices keep on fluctuating and almost every five years, we have a coffee "boom". However, even if coffee went up when the production of the crop has gone down, our economy would not stand to gain from that "boom" in the international market. So, we must constantly thinking of keeping the coffee farmer afloat by means of loans or other incentives.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Vice-President and Minister for Finance mentioned that he is going to intensify efficiency in tax collection, and I want to congratulate him on that However, stringent measures must be taken to ensure that those who are charged with the responsibility of collecting tax do actually collect it because if they do not do so, the Government will not get the revenue itrequires.I also want to say that we must all, as leaders, desist from making tribal utterances. We may not realise how dangerous to the economy and the social welfare of this country our utterances are. If a particular person is worried about the next elections, let us not be worried about a tribe. Instead, let us worry about voters the Kenyans in our constituencies. I say this because what appears in the Press does not often serve this country. Instead it ruins the economy of the country. If we were to say, "We do not want anybody who is not a Mmeru", a non-Meru who wants to build a hotel in Meru Town will not do that. Therefore, such utterances discourage investment. If there is such tribal feelings all over the country, we must be sure that we are ruining our economy and whatever good Budget we bring here, we will continue to harm the economy if leaders do not desist from making tribal utterances that may discourage Kenyans from buying land, investing in rural property and doing anything else that can improve the economy in any area of the country.We talk about food shortages and lack of rain. What are we doing about this situation and for how long are we going to rely uncertain rains which come only when they want to? As a country, I think we must be prepared even to borrow foreign loans for irrigation and our survival. We must be prepared to borrow foreign money in the form of aid, loans, and so on, to enable us to tap rain water. Let us have water and stop relying entirely on rains that may or may not come. If we keep on relying on the rains all the time, we will continue to complain about food shortages due to lack of rain every 10 years or so. Israel, for example, has tapped ground water to the tune of 75 per cent and is now supplying fruits to the United States of America and European countries. Yet, we cannot do this regardless of all the rivers we have. This is a question of giving priority to irrigation and damming our rivers and stopping to rely on uncertain rains.I would also like to note that there are areas in this country of high agricultural productivity, but the roads there are impassable. In order to improve our economy and give more productivity to our agricultural economy, let us give priority to the construction of good roads in areas where farmers need access to their farms. These roads will not only enable such farmers to work on their farms but also to transport their produce to the market. I say this because for many years now, I have been complaining about a certain road that traverses my constituency. I am happy because the Government has already surveyed that road and I hope that, when funds, are available, the road will be tarmacked. However, with reference to other areas, are our planners really doing their work according to the order of priority? They might build a road leading to nowhere and leave an area that is agriculturally highly potential, thus making farmers unable, to move about the area during the rains, plant crops or transport their farm produce to the market?With those few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. J.N. Mungai: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand up to support this Motion and also congratulate His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance on the manner in which he moved this long Motion. The fact is that Kenya is facing a very difficult time now because we are not getting loans and donors are withholding the aid that they have been giving us. Therefore, we are facing a difficult time economically. Yet, the Vice-President and Minister for Finance was able to present a Budget in which he did not press on us very much. Particularly the poor common man was able to get off the Budget fairly-well.I have just mentioned that donors have withheld their loans, which we need. There is need for the world community to work with us, in Kenya, just like those of any other nation. Therefore, we ourselves must be able to work together. All communities must be able to live, work, visit and own property in every part of Kenya without fear of intimidation, death or destruction of their property or any abuse being hurled at them. We must, here at home, be able to live together so that we may be able to live with the world community. In the world of today, every community must be able to live with other communities outside its country. Whether these other communities are in Europe, Asia, America or here in Africa, we certainly need them.This is a very important time in. Kenya when we are carrying out voter registration for multi-party elections. Soon, we will be going to these elections. It is, therefore, very sad when some leading personalities, be they politicians or other leaders, make statements that are inflammatory or may, indeed, be misinterpreted by the people they lead. This morning, I saw, on page two of today's issue of The Standard that three people were killed in a registration station at Narok where they had gone to register as voters. This is very serious because the world is looking at Kenya and how we are going to conduct these multi-party elections. Kenyans and the world have been assured that these elections are going to be just and fair. When murders like those occur in registration stations, people are going to make conclusions that these elections may not be what they are said they are going to be. Therefore, we would like to make sure that there is security in every registration station and that people are able to register themselves without being harassed or abused. I say this because we have said that these elections are going to be just and fair, and the world is looking at us. We have always been ahead in this, kind of thing. I would like to have the Minister in charge of internal security make a statement in this House assuring the whole nation that people are going to be safe and secure when they go to register themselves as voters.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I say this because if that goes on in certain areas like Narok District, where registration of Voters is riot safe, the exercise should be suspended until there is security in every registration station. It is also very serious when a few days and a few months before a leading personality makes a statement threatening the non-Maasais in Narok District asking them to leave the district or to co-operate and do what the local people say. This is a free and democratic country and people who live wherever they live must be able to register as voters and vote for the candidate of any party that they may choose. At this juncture I would like to urge the Electoral Commission to issue a statement on who is eligible to register in what, place and how long he should have been living there and what are the conditions for registration so that this power does not go to other people except to the independent Electoral Commission.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to mention something about those people who have been talking about majimboism. Kanu has always been against majimboism; from the very beginning at Lancaster House. Kami's stand from the very beginning was anti-majimboism. Therefore anybody who goes against Kanu policy by advocating majimboism is himself against Kanu because Kanu is against majimboism. No Kanu supporter should go out publicly to support what Kanu does not support. This is because Kanu has always stood for a united nation with a strong central governmentMr. Speaker, Sir, I say that the people of Kenya, all of them citizens, must not lie low and they must not be folded like an envelope or lie low like an envelope. I say they should stand six feet tall, proud and free to move wherever they want to move in Kenya and own whatever they want to own in Kenya so long as they are acquiring it legally. That is what Kanu also stands for. That is what the Kenya Constitution stands for and that is what the Government of Kenya will support and protect Everybody must feel that he is protected by the Constitution of Kenya. Everybody must be able to go about his or her own business without interference.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I noticed that the registration centres were not very well advertised. I think that although the Electoral Commission is new the Provincial Administration should help even at this late stage, to publicise the registration stations and also to publicise where people should go for Identity  Cards so that we can have these cards issued on a daily basis. So far some of the stations are doing very well. The registration station in Westlands is registering very many people and they are doing extremely. However, it is important for the Minister responsible for the registration of persons to assure this House, and also to announce on a daily basis during: this when registration, how many young people who have attained the age of 18 years have been registered and how many are remaining so that nobody will not say that Government is not putting enough effort to register the people.Mr. Speaker, Sir, in any economy, you require free flow of information. If you try to hinder this then the development in that country becomes very slow. I, therefore, turn to the Press and say that I personally believe that there should be complete freedom of the Press in Kenya. The journalists in Kenya are as patriotic and as nationalistic and they love this country as much as Members of this Parliament do. Therefore Members of Parliament should not tell journalists what to write just as much as journalists do not tell Members of Parliament what to say. I think journalists should be responsible. They should write what is true and reflect what the nation really wants to know and to hear. This is because if you engage in gutter journalism nobody will take interest in your publication for a long time. This is because you will have done something that has not been done before. People may lode at your publication but they are going to lose taste for it. People want to be told the truth and I am sure that the journalists can write the truth.Mr. Speaker, Sir, Kanu as a party h&s no skeletons to hide in its closet. If any individual has skeletons to hide in his closet then that is not Kanu. Journalists should be able to expose those who have skeletons in their own closets but they should not say that Kany has any closet because Kanu does not have any skeletons.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have carried on sedition laws from the colonial times; sedition laws that concern journalism. I would urge the Attorney-General to review those laws and if he finds that there are some that are not applicable he should drop them and then just use what is applicable so that Kenya can always move forward and never put a reverse gear in every sphere of development, whether it be economic, journalism or any other.I beg to support the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Energy (Mr. Kyalo): Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I rise to support the Budget Speech. In my view this year's Budget has been prepared under very difficult conditions; when the economy of this country is going through a difficult period. In view of this, I feel that the Vice-President and Minister for Finance tried his best under very difficult circumstances to give us a very good Budget For an economy like Kanya's to survive, we have to ensure that all theresources that are available are made use of and we should also try to ensure that anything that is likely to disrupt the economy is avoided. I was surprised that some of the members of opposition in this country did say that the process that will enable our economy to thrive namely the democratic process which starts with the registration of voters should not take place. This is something which is very difficult for anybody to understand.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we believe that there should be democracy in Kenya. We have followed the rules of democracy. For democracy to survive we have to undertake certain measures one of them being the registration of voters. For some unknown reasons, members of the opposition, who understand very well that democracy can only survive if certain rules are followed are discouraging this process. The only question that one can ask is this: Does democracy to some people mean that if something does not suit them at a particular time then there is no democracy? This is because it is these very people who a few months ago were saying that elections must be held with immediate effect. They shouted from the top of their voices that there must be an immediate election and yet when the necessary steps are taken towards that election so that we can have a democratically elected government like we have done before then somebody says those elections should not be held. What has happened? Things have now been put in place and arrangements are being made, but immediately that has been done somebody turns around and says that registration should not continue. It is the same people who are saying that this parliament should be dissolved so as to give way to elections, yet when steps are being taken to ensure that democratic process are undertaken, things turn sour. We have to be sincere in whatever we are doing. We cannot have it both way. If Kenyans have decided that they should go democratic we should allow them to be democratic by following the processes that lead them to democracy.Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is also surprising to note that the same people in their statement yesterday said that donor should stop aiding Kenya. These people forget that money given to this country is given to the people of Kenya and not to individuals. Donors give money to Kenya so that wananchi benefit. If opposition members know that whatever comes here is for the people and that they stand for the interests of the people, the statement that they made yesterday shows that there is something wrong. In that, if money given by donors comes to our people, and we represent our people, it is the interests of the people that we should be minding about. It is not individual interests or what you or I say. Whatever comes here, does so in the name of the people and nobody has the power to say that that money should not come to our people. If there was a statement made by a leader that money should not come to the people, it is not correct. We have plenty of things to say, but things that will produce are contrary image to the interests of our people should be avoided whether they are said by the opposition or any other person, they should be discouraged. At the same time we should be careful about whatever we say.Mr. Speaker, Sir, while on this there is an issue which is likely to effect the economy of this country which touches on environment. For instance if we look at our rivers and mountains we find that the steps we have taken are likely to ruin our environment completely. Our rivers are getting silted every day and the slopes of the mountains are being denuded of trees and natural vegetation. Time has come for us to think in terms of how we can manage our environment. We must ensure that the environment of this country is taken care of before any project is started. We have started many projects and in most case they are completed, but in the final analysis most of these projects did not take into consideration issues that affect the environment of this country. As we continuing feeding our population we must ensure that matters affecting our environment are taken care of. I will not elaborate on this point. Although we have completed some projects we should ensure that we also complete the ones that were started long ago. These projects should be given priority because once the money is paid and the project is not completed, the money is wasted, so Ministries should ensure that those projects are completed. It is not easy to do that. Because I know that there are difficulties insofar as funds are concerned, but once we do that then we shall enrich this country in terms of strengthening our economy.While mi that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch on regional co-operation. When we look around, we find that practically all countries in Europe are getting together and we should ensure that we in Africa follow similar steps so that we unite so as to survive.With those few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Barng'etuny: Ashante sana Bw. Spika kwa kunipa nafasi hii kuzungumuza juu ya Hoja ya Bajeti.Bw. Spika, ningetalca kumshukuru Makamu wa Rais na Waziri wa Fedha kwa Bajeti ya mwaka huu hasa kwa kupunguza matumizi ya wakulima. Wakulima walikuwa wanaumia kwa upande wa mapato yao kwa sababu pesa zao zilikuwa zikikatwa. Kwa mfano, kodi ya mapato na malipo ya county councils na vitu vingine. Kwa hivyo wakulimu wote wameifurahia bajeti hii haswa wale wa miwa, mahindi na pai wale wa maziwa. Ingefaa viongozi wote wafikirie sana masilahi ya wakulima, ikiwa ni wakulima wa kahawa na mimea nyingine kwa sababu msingi wa inchi hii ni ukulima. Kwa hivyo, tunawatia moyo wakulima, yaani to give them moral support Kwa mfano, wakulima wa miwa au kahawa ambao wanaifanya kazi nyingi sana. Kwa hivyo, ingefaa Serikali iwapatie wakulima usaidizi wa kutosha.Pia, Bw. Spika, natoa shukrani nyingi sana kwa Mtukufu Rais kwa kusimamisha mgogoro ambao ulikuwa umeikumba nchi yetu kwa jumla. Nataka kuhimiza jambo hili na kuomba litiliwe maanani ili wananchi wote waishi kwa amani. Pia namuunga mkono mheshimiwa Dkt. Njoroge Mungai kwa kusema kwamba si si sote ni dada na ndugu katika nchi hii. Kwa hivyo, hatutaki wageni lcuja kutugawanya na kutufunza mambo ya Idkabila. Hii ndiyo maana Muingereza alikuwa anatumia mtindo wa "divide and rule" hapa kwetu nchini. Kwa hivyo, nawaomba wananchi wawe macho hasa wakati huu wa mvumo wa vyama vingi.Sisi tulipitisha katika uwanja wa Kasarani kwamba tunataka tuwe na vyama vingi vya kisiasa nchini. Lakini viongozi wa upinzani bado hawajatosheka na uongozi wa Kanu. Hii ndiyo maana wanataka kuzungumza siasa hata lcanisani. Haya ni makosa makubwa.Mwanzilishi wa taifa hili, hayati Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, alisema kwamba umoja wetu ndiyo nguvu yetu, na tunafuate mtindo huq. Halafu Mtukufu Rais Daniel arap Moi alikuja juzi na kusema tuache ukabila na kuwa kitu kimoja. Lakini kuna watu wengine ambao wanatumia makanisa kwa lcuzungumzia siasa. Nataka kuishukuru kanisa la A.I.C. Eldoret kwa kukataa siasa ndani ya kanisa. Watu wengine walikuwa wanataka kuitumia kanisa hilo kama platform ya kueneza siasa na kuwagawanya wananchi.Pia tunashukuni na kuunga mkono uandikishaji wa wapiga kura, yaani voter registration exercise ambao ulianzishwa juzi. Hata Mtukufu Rais tayari ameshiandikisha na watu wengine wengi wamehudhuria zaidi. Hatutaki wawe wanasiasa vifaranga na kutumiwa kama rubber-stamps. Nataka kila mtu aseme ukweli kabisa. Waswahili kusema "kizuri chqjiuza; kibaya chajitembeza". Kwa hivyo, hatutaki wabaya waeneze uwongo na kuwa mapabii wa uwqngo. Ikiwa mtu anapendwa na watu, hakuna haja ya kubabaika. Ingefaa asimame na kuomba kura kama mwanaume. Vitendo hunena zaidi badala ya maneno mengi.Bw. Spika, sina mengi. Naishukuru bajeti hii na kuiunga mkono. Ahsante sana. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Livestock Development (Mr. Chesire): Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to the debate on the budgetIndeed, I had expected a tough budget taking into account the difficult economic conditions that the country is facing at the moment. But I would like to congratulate the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for the great effort that he took to ensure thatthe budget was not going to be too punitive or biting to the ordinary mwahanchi.As I said, we are going through very difficult times economically. The weather has not been very good to us for the last two years. Even as I speak, even this year has not been very good. There have been a few crop failures here and there where there has been no rain. I do foresee a fairly difficult time ahead of us.I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate and thank His Excellency the President for alerting the world community yesterday that certain parts of Kenya are faced with difficult food situations to an extent that the world community is being requested to come and help the famine-stricken areas, particularly the northern part of Kenya. The world community has also been requested to give assistance to the half million refugees who have come to seek refuge in this country from countries such as Sudan, Somalia and Ethiopia. I do hope that the world community will indeed come to our rescue and help us.In the same breath, I would like to say that there are some areas in this country where the crops have failed for the last one or two years. I hope that when the Government considers the more needy areas of northern Kenya they should also look at those other areas. I have in mind, for example, areas like Eldoret North in my area where people have not been able to get any crops for the last two years. I appeal to the Government to come to the assistance of those people and give them some food.By the same breath, again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to comment on the decision by the Vice- President and Minister for Finance to levy a 10 per cent import duty on livestock for breeding, such as a cattle, horses and sheep. My own feeling, as a farmer, is that time has not yet come when we should start levying taxes and duties on animals for breeding in this country. We have traditionally been used to importing animals duty free to improve our livestock and this has gone a long way towards improving the quality of our livestock. Given the fact that in the future, Kenya will be seen as a supplier of breeding stock to the rest of the Preferential Trade Area countries, even to Southern Africa, it now a high time that the Treasury gave more incentive to farmers by exempting duty on the importation of livestock. This will go a long way to improve the quality of our livestock and in so doing, we should be able to get good prices for our livestock in the outside markets. This is really an area where an incentive ought to be given to the farmers by exemption duty on the importation of livestock for breeding including semen and seeds for certain species of grass.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch on the registration exercise that is going on at the moment. I must say that this exercise has started very well and congratulations must go to all the officials that have madeit possible for wananchi to register themselves. I would however like to take this opportunity to appeal to all Kenyans to come forward and exercise their constitutional right by registering as voters, This will enable them to elect leaders of their own choice when the right time comes, However, I would like to pass a word of advice to the Electoral Commission. There are areas, particularly in my own constitution, with very large population concentrated in one point which have not been given any registration unit. In these areas, you will find people travelling distances of up to eight or ten kilometres to go and register themselves. This will act as a disincentive particularly to the old and the weak who may not be able to get to the registrations centres. I would like to take this early opportunity to appeal to the Electoral Commission to increase the number of registration units, particularly in my constituency. I have places like Sugoi, Cheparus and one or two other areas where I feel very strongly that there should be registration centres to enable the people register themselves without subjecting them to undue hardships.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to take this opportunity to appeal to the Administration, the police and the security, personnel to assist people who have been displaced by tribal clashes in places like Turbo, Sugoi Location and so on. These people should be rehabilitated back to their homes so that they may also be able to exercise their constitutional rights by being registered as voters. At the moment, quite a number of people are still afraid of going back to their homes because they have not been given enough security. I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to the Government to give these people the necessary security so that they can go back home and register themselves.Mr. Speaker, Sir, It has been a tradition when it comes to the registration of voters, that an municipality area such as Eldoret Municipality, is divided into wards. In the latest computer print outs from the Electoral Commission, they have turned wards in Eldoret Municipality into sub-locations. Where they got they terminology from, I do not know. I do not understand the logic behind turning the eight wards that used to exist in the Eldoret Municipality into five sub-locations and I sincerely hope that the Electoral Commission will come out openly and tell us why they are doing things of this nature. It is unfortunate that when they were deciding on the registration centres, we as leaders were not consulted and this may be one of the reasons why there are problems here and there. However, I hope that when polling stations are actually gazetted, the Electoral Commission will have actually gone over these hurdles and cleared any confusion that may be arising [The Assistant Minister for Livestock Development]at the moment. For the time being, we are contented with the present registration of voters and I appeal to wananchi to turn up to register themselves. Let the Electoral Commission clean up things so that when voting comes, things will operate smoothly.Mr. Speaker, Sir, finally, I would like to take this opportunity once more to appeal to all leaders to watch their public utterances. It is the statement of leaders that would build or destroy this country. Some of the alarming statements that we have heard from some politicians in public meetings all over the country advocating for majimboism, clanism or inciting a certain tribe to gang up against another tribe, must be condemned strongly. All these statements do not help to build this country and it is for this reason that I would like to appeal to leaders to avoid making utterances which are likely to disrupt peace in this country.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Reclamation and Development of Arid, Semi-Arid and Wastelands (Mr. Ndotto): Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I would also like to take this opportunity to support the Vice-President and Minister for Finance in this Motion on the Budget I think we should all support him on this particular Motion. At the moment, this country is facing a very serious economic problems. At the same time, the political changes that this country is undergoing cannot be taken lightly and it is gratifying to note that even the Vice- President himself had to take into consideration these changes when he was preparing his Budget.Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget is not very hard on the ordinary mwananchi. We appreciate the fact that the Vice-President has to raise the revenue necessary for running this country and we congratulate him for the manner in which he presented his taxation measures. I would also like to say that we must all remember, whether in the Kanu party or in the opposition, that this is our country. For this reason, we must of everything possible to bring about unity for the sake of our children. The welfare of this country, must be the responsibility of every leader in this country. Therefore, as we approach the multi-party elections, it is important for us all to ensure that we make responsible public statements. We should say what we think is good for this country and what we are sure to be the truth.Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the moment, we are facing a very difficult situation in this country but some of the problems we are facing, we have no control over them. At the moment, there are some districts in the country where people do not have any food to eat for the next six or nine months. We cannot blame the Government for this because it does not make rain and we should therefore avoid giving the impression to the people that the Government ought to have done something to make sure there is sufficient food. The Government has done everything possible to assure that there is sufficient food but if the rain does not fall, there is nothing the Government can do. We should not use this problem as a political weapon to fight the GovernmentMr. Speaker, Sir, we know the prices of commodities in the international markets are going up while the prices of primary commodities are going down. The Kenya, or Nyayo, Government should not be treated as if it has any control over the prices of international commodities. I think it is, unfair for the opposition leaders to use this as a weapon. As and when they eome to lead the Government they will also expect those of us who will be m opposition at that time, when it comes, to be also responsible and say what is important for this country and avoid saying what is not important.At the moment we know that the donors are not giving us aid and that this is a very serious situation in the country. I am appealing to the donors to make a difference between what is going on in this country in terms of politics and the welfare of the ordinary mwananchi in this country. I think the Vice- President and the Minister for Finance and the Nyayo Government have done everything possible to meet what the donors would like us to do in terms of economic matters. We have gone a long way towards meeting their demands. It is important that we appeal to the donors to lift the suspension of aid because it is hitting mostly the ordinary mwananchi for all I know the aid of our brothers, the donors, is always intended to benefit ordinary Kenyans, who are suffering at the moment Therefore, we appeal to them to lift this suspension.As for the politics, we are in a multi-party situation. Therefore, we will continue to debate on various issues about the political situation in this country and we would like the donors to leave it to us, Kenyan leaders, to sort our political issues and not to mix that with the aid they give us.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to say something about multi-party politics. This is a new kind of politics in this country but in my own opinion we mixing too many issues when we are talking about multi-party politics. It would appear some of the leaders in this country think multi-party is abusing each other, or is issuing very strong statement which you cannot prove in court; or, it means abusing the institutions which are established by law in this country.I think some of us have got the whole concept of multi-party politics wrong. If we are leaders either in the Government or in the opposition and we start issuing statements which can cause chaos in this country I think we should be tried. Any leader, it does not matter which position he Is occupying in this country, should watch the statements he makes in this country. If you, as a leader, say two plus two is five and you saying this to Kenyans and rest of the world, I think it is only fair that we tell you are wrong. If you issue a statement which will sharpen tribal differences in this country I think we should all condemn you; it does not matter you are, if the statements you are issuing will make the tribes of this country start hating each other. This is our country and we must live peacefully; we must co-exist wherever we are and we must maintain peace and stability in our country. But anybody who makes a statement which he cannot substantiate I do not see such a person cannot be taken to a court of law and the law allowed to deal with him. Unless we do so we will keep on making very irresponsible statements, which can be very costly to this country. Therefore, I would like to appeal to my colleagues and all the leaders to make sure that they watch their tongues.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am very grateful to the Government that we are doing registration of voters at the moment. But I am surprised that three or four days ago opposition were telling the Government that they want us to go into elections as soon as possible; some even mentioned that they wanted elections to be in September, 1992. Now, registration of voters is a sign that we are going to elections but all of a sudden they have turned round and started saying they do not want voter registration; it should be suspended; the donors should not give money for the elections and all kind of lame excuses. Mistakes are with us; we all make mistakes and the opposition leaders who make mistakes. If there was a bad card or two somewhere in Kitui or Lamu that human; and it is normal human to err and this should not be taken that there is something basically wrong with the registration of voters. We should allow this exercise to continue. Therefore, it is important that we ask opposition not to look for all kind of excuses all the time to delay whatever they think is not in their favour, we should move forward and convinces the people instead of making statements which will not help this country.I would like to ask the Electoral Commission to ensure that they bring registration units nearer to the people. We must understand our people: some of our people today think that by going to register they doing a favour to the Government and therefore if the registration is not near they will not do so. Therefore, it is my appeal to the commission that Registration units should be brought nearer to the people .I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Leitich: Ahsante sana, Bw. Spika, kwa kunipa nafasi hii ili niungane na wenzangu katika hotuba ya Bajeti ambayo ilisomwa hapa hivi majuzi wakati Rasi Moi alikuwa amehudhuria kama Mbunge wa Baringo ya Kali. Kwanza nafikiri kwamba wakati huu nchi yetu imekumbwa na mambo mengi kama vile ukosefu ya chakula, ambacho sasa tunaagiza kutoka nje. Ningependa Serikali ifikirie kutuwezesha kukuza chakula kwa njia ya unyunyiziaji mashamba maji katika sehemu kama Nyanza na Tana River. Nilienda huko Israel ambayo ni jangwa na haipati mvua na nikaona wana chakula kingi kutushinda. Mchanga wao ni mbaya lakini wanabeba mchanga na kuutandaza katika mahali ambapo wanataka kukuza vyakula. Kwa hivyo, mimi naona tungetumia maji ya Mto Tana kukuza chakula katika sehemu kama Garissa na Naivasha.Mtukufu Rais amejaribu kujenga hospitali kupitia njia ya Harambee kote nchini. Sasa tuna Nyayo Wards katika sehemu nyingi hapa nchini. Ingawa majengo ya hospitali hizi yanang'ara, wagonjwa wanaambiwa waende kununua dawa kwa sababu kuna ukosefu wa dawa huko. Ingefaa Serikali itafute pesa za kutosha ili tuweze kuwa na dawa katika hospitali zetu. Hata katika hospitali za kibinafsi, wagonjwa wanaambiwa waende wanunue dawa kutoka maduka fulani ambapo wana nia fulani. Hata wakati Serikali inanunua dawa ya kutosha, bado inapotea kupita "njia za panya" na inauzwa nje ya hospitali. Inafaa Serikali itafute njia ya kuziba "jia hizi za panya" ili dawa iweze kupatikana katika hospitali zetu.Naishukuru Serikali kwa kutengeneza barabara hapa nchini ingawa kuna barabara nyingine ambazo zinahitaji marekebisho. Kwa mfano, barabara kutoka Nakuru kuelekea Eldoret ni mbaya sana na inasababisha ajali mbaya sana kila wakati. Inafaa Wizara inayohusika itengeneze barabara hii kwa kuziba mashimo makubwa makubwa ambayo yanasababisha ajali na kuwaharibia watu magari yao. Si vizuri kupoteza maisha ya watu kila wakati kupitia ajali za barabarani.Mimi mwenyewe naishi kule Rongai na kila mara ajali inapotokea barabarani, watu wanakuja kwangu kupiga simu ili wawajulishe watu wao juu ya ajali hiyo. Kama kuna pesa, inafaa barabara hii itengenenzwe ili ajali za barabarani ziweze kupunguzwe.Kitu kingine ni kwamba tuna zahanati nyingi mashambani ambako utapata mtu ambaye pengine alikuwa akifunga wagonjwa vidonda, anajiita daktari au clinical officer na kuanza kuwatibu wagonjwa. Ukimuuliza "Wapi daktari?" anakwambia "Alikwenda likizoni na yule ambaye angechukuwa nafasi yake, hajakuja." Ingefaa Wizara ione kwamba kama daktari amekwenda likizoni, daktari mwingine awe karibu kuchukuwa nafasi yake mpaka atakaporudi badala ya kumwachia mtu ambaye hana masomo yoyote kwa kazi hiyo.Mimi nimekuwa mwenyekiti wa county council kwa muda wa miaka 10 na sasa nina karibu miaka mitano kama mwenyekiti wa Kanu, Nakuru. Sasa watu wanatafuta njia ya kuniharibia jina. Kwa mfano, hivi mquzi, nilikuwa na Harambee ya mtoto kule Kericho na gazeti la Taifa Leo lilichapisha habari kusema kwamba Bw. Leitich alisema kwamba Molo ni ya Wakalenjin peke yake na makabila mengine yote yahame. Waliserqa pia eti nilisema Wakikuyu ni waoga. Mimi kama kiongozi wa watu wote kule Nakuru, siweze kutamka maneno kama hayo. Hii ni mbaya. Mimi mwenyewe nina taabu kwa sababu watu walipigana na kuuana na ni wajibu wangu kuwaambia watu wanidi makwao ili waendelee kukaa kwa amani kama zamani kwa vile sasa watu wanaangaliana kama maaduiKile nilichosema kilichapishwa sawa sawa katjka gazeti la Standard ukurasa wa tano. Jina la yule mwandishi aliyeandika habari hii katika gazeti la Taifa Leo, halikuchapishwa. Waliandika tu "Na mwandishi wenu". Sijui jina lake. Mimi nimekuwa kiongozi wa makabila yote katika Wilaya ya Nakuru na sijapatikana na makosa. Sasa hawa watu wanatumiwa na FORD na DP ili kuchafua jina langu na kujaribu kunikoroga na Wakikuyu kwa sababu wanajua kwamba jamii hii ndio imenisaidia kila mare kuchaguliwa kama mwenyekiti wa county council. Hata katika uwenyekiti wa Kanu, walisema, "Acha huyu mzee aendelee kushikilia kiti hicho." Sasa watu hawa wanatafuta njia ya kugonganisha watu wa kabila la Kalenjin na Kikuyu. Siwezi kuwa na ndoto kama hiyo. Wale watu ambao wana mashamba Nakuru wana haki kwa sababu hakuna mtu ambaye alipewa shamba huko bure; kila mtu alinunua kutokana na jasho lake. Kwa nini niseme eti shamba hili ni la mtu kutoka kabila fulani?Ningependa kuwaomba Wabunge hapa, wafutilie mbali jambo hili kutoka kwa roho zao. Mimi nimekuwa kiongozi kwa miaka 14 na nimefanya kazi ya Kanu kwa muda wa miaka 24 na mimi si mgeni kwa siasa. Nimekaa na Wakikuyu na Wajaluo kwa muda mrefu na hata ninaongea kwa lugha ya Kikuyu na Kijaluo. Ninawezaje kugeuka na kuwa kama nyoka? Ningependa kuwauliza wakaaji wa Nakuru wanidi kwa mashamba yao, wapalilie mahindi yao na kuendeleza kazi zao kama kawaida. Nitaandama na watu hawa wa magazeti kortini.Asante sana, Bw. Spika. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Environment and Natural Resources (Mr. K'Ombudo): Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute in support of this very good Motion. First of all, I would like to congratulate the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for producing the kind of Budget that he produced under very difficult economic conditions.Having said that, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Government and the President for heeding the call of the people of Nyakach to station the anti-stock theft unit in my area. This is a very welcome move which will help a great deal. Stock theft has beena problem to many years in Nyakach and Belgut [Mr. Speaker Ieft the Chair][The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Galgallo) took the Chair]We were very happy to receive this Anti-Stock Theft Unit and we are very thankful for this. The people of this country struggle to free themselves to from the colonial yoke and this struggle started many yean ago during the days of Harry Thuku, Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, J.D. Otiende and Achieng Oneko. These nationalists who struggled for the Independence of this country preached the unity of Kenya. I am taken aback to hare today politician, and Cabinet Ministers at that, calling for tribal divisions. What is this? I could not believe my eyes when I read that hon. Elijah Mwangale told Kenyans that in order to be the President of Kenya, you need not be competent or have merit, and that it was enough to be a tribal leader. </Newspeech><Newspeech>An hon. Member: He did not say that. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Environment and Natural Resources (Mr. K'Ombudo): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in 1992, it is a serious matter for hon. Elijah Mwangale to incite Kenyans against each other. This is not the spirit in which Mzee Jomo Kenyatta struggled for the Independence of tfiis country. He struggled for the unity of Kenyans. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.The Assistant Minister for Environment and Natural Resources (Mr. K'Ombudo): Is he another tribal Luhya leader? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Makhanu: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I do not want to interrupt my good colleague here, but the suggestion by hon. Mwangale' was not misplaced. He did not say that to be President, one needed no merit besides being a tribal leader. Anybody can declare his candidature for any seat in this country. What is wrong with that? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Environment and Natural Resources (Mr. K'Ombudo): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is true that any Kenya is qualified to be a leader in this country, but not on the basis of his tribe as we are now being hold. Kenya will never accept this. Let the advocates of tribal kingdoms know that Kenyans do not accept this kind of thing. Secondly, majimbo. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. Misoi: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the hon. speaker on the Floor aware that many other potential presidential candidates have been proposed on thebasis of tribal sentiments? If he condemns hon. Mwangale for this, he should condemn all the others such candidates. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Environment and Natural Resources (Mr. K'Ombudo): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me repeat what President Moi says. Kenya should be united in the spirit of "one Kenya, one nation". There should be no tribal kingdoms because we do not accept them. In 1963, if my memory serves me correct, majimbo was buried for good and we will not revive it. </Newspeech><Newspeech>An hon. Member: We could. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Environment and Natural Resources (Mr. K'Ombudo): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me tell you that we will not revive majimbo because Kenya is one from Mombasa to Busia and everywhere else. Kenya will always remain one, and these Johnnie come lately politicians who now want to divide Kenya into small tribal states will never succeed.The Rural Electrification Programme is a very good programme that the Government has supported for many yews. I would like this programme to resume. My people of Nyakach have not benefited from this programme. It installed one electric line to Nyabondo, and I am glad I have seen in the Development Estimates some provision for Upper Nyakach and Lower Nyakach Divisions. I plead with the Minister for Energy to see to it that electric lines are installed in Nyakach this time. We have waited for a long time.As you know, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is a famine in this country at the moment, and yet agriculture is our backbone. I brought a Motion here many years ago requesting for the implementation of the Sondu Miriu Hydro-electric and Irrigation project, and the. Motion was accepted. We have been looking forward to its implementation for a long time now. This project should be implemented now because it was only the other day that Kenya was rationing electricity. If this project had been implemented as planned, this would not have been the case. Irrigation from this project would have ensured abundance of food in the country. We would have been the granary of Africa if we used our waters properly. I plead with the Minister for Energy to hasten the implementation of the Sondu Miriu Project.We must register as voters because the call by the opposition not to register is misplaced. If there are any mistakes, they should be corrected. We, however, have to look forward because we are not going to go backwards or oscillate back and forth. People should register as voters in their large number in order to defeat those who are not fit to be in this House. People should register as voters in large numbers and throw tribalists outThere is some theory going round in which people are being misled about the statistics of this country. Since when have the Luhya become the second largest ethnic community in Kenya? Why are we being deceived? I want to correct this error. The Minister for Planning and National Development should make a statement to this effect because we do not want Kenyans to be deceived in broad daylight. There are children in school who want to know the proper statistics. It is common knowledge that the Luo are the second largest ethnic community in Kenya.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Mwangale): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I would like to join my colleagues in this debate. I did not want to speak today, but because hon. K'Ombudo is a good friend of mine and we come from the same Kavirondo region, I think it is good to respond to some of his remarks, which I support in the sense that these are his views. Of course, it is also in line with our democratic principles that one expresses his views. I believe that the only in which we can succeed as a country is to have this kind of open debate and expression of personal views about this country and its future.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me state my views quite clearly because there have been meetings. What I have said in our meetings in Western Kenya  and we want this to be clearly understood is first and foremost that we as a community, as Luhyas and Tesos and as people from Western Province have always and from Independence supported the Government. We" supported the Government of the late Mzee Jomo Kenyatta. If you look at the history of this pountry you will find any time when we tried to overthrow the Government or any of us engaging in subversion against Mzee 'Kenyatta's Government Secondly, indeed after Mzee Moi took over the leadership of this country we have also been in the forefront in supporting the President We have demonstrated practically that that is where we stand. You will never find a Luhya or a Teso or anybody from Western Kenya who has ever tried subvert this Government. I do not want to speak for other communities. I just wanted to put that case in the case of our community. Thirdly, we are the second largest ethnic group in Kenya I would like ask hon. K'Ombudo, if he cares to look at the statistics of this country- If he wants to do so he can look at the results of the national census of 1989 and he will find that we are the second largest community in Kenya. I just want to clarify this</Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Environment and Natural Resources (Mr. K'Ombudo): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.Is it in order for hon. Mwangale to </Newspeech><Newspeech>An hon. Member: The Minister! </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Environment and Natural Resources (Mr. K'Ombudo): Yes. The Minister for Agriculture! Is he in order to deliberately mislead this House and the country about well known Kenya statistics? Is he in order to say that Luhya's are the second largest tribe in this country when he knows that that is not true? Is it in order for him to mislead the House and the country? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Galgallo): Order! I think that unless anybody is giving us statistics here, we should concentrate on the Motion before the House. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>The Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Mwangale): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to emphasise to hon. K'Ombudo that even if he were to put the population of Siaya and Kisumu together it is not half of Kalkamega and Vihiga Districts. That is really obvious. We do not have to into this type of semantics because it is true that we are the second largest ethnic group in Kenya. Thirdly, what I pointed out-</Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Environment and Natural Resources (Mr. K'Ombudo): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Galgallo): Order! I think for the benefit of this House we should avoid discussing the question of population unless one of you has statistics. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Mwangale): Point taken, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I also want to make it clear to hon. K'Ombudo that we have no objection to Oginga Odinga standing for the Presidency of this country on a FORD ticket and</Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Environment and Natural Resources (Mr. K'Ombudo): Indeed, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have no objection to hon. Mwangale standing for the Presidency of this country on a FORD ticket as he is trying to campaign for. He has been campaigning for that. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Mwangale): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, Office of the Vice- President and Ministry of Finance (Mr. Kariuki): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. My point of order is whether in order for us to continue discussing matters that are so extraneous to the Budget Speech. We are debating the Budget Speech but hon. Members do not seem to be concentrating on that. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Galgallo): The Chair has made a ruling on that, hon. Kariuki. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Mwangale): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when we discuss theBudget here it has to be taken in the context of the stability, peace and security of this country. There is no way you can discuss about economics or the politics and social development of this country without taking into account the fact that we have a Government and a party that is led by a President whom the hon. K'Ombudo was choosing to ignore by mentioning other leaders while knowing very well that the leader who has been able to play the role that has brought this country where it is now historically is our President I would like to. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Environment and Natural Resources (Mr. K'Ombudo): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.- Could the hon. Mwangale substantiate his remarks? I have not ignored the President, have I? I do not remember ignoring the President in my speech. In fact I thanked him for sending the Anti-Stock Theft Unit to Nyakach. I understand English. I do not want these insinuations from a tribal leader. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Galgallo): Order! Hon. Members we are discussing the Financial Statement. Let us avoid dwelling on semantics. Proceed, hon. Mwangale. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Mwangale): As I was saying, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the leadership-</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Kirwa: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think that while the debate is very healthy and exciting, it is getting out of hand. Can I ask hon. K'Ombudo to withdraw the remark that hon. Mwangale is a tribal leader because I do not know him to be that? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Galgallo): Order! Hon. Members, Standing Order No.73(4) says:-"No Member shall impute improper motive to any other Member except by a specific substantive Motion calling into question the conduct of that Member."I urge all of you to decist from making unnecessary remarks and insinuations. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Mwangale): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the important point which I want to emphasise here is that we and as I said before  are debating this Motion and we have got to look at the present and the future of this country. I want to repeat what has already been said; that the impression that has been given to the international community is that there are only certain persons that can lead this country and we are saying no. It is very, very important. Just as I was saying it is wrong for the impression to be created that only Matiba, Kibaki and Muite can lead this country and that they can get away by using newspapers and magazines and churches to abuse our President and we remain quiet as if they are the only ones who can take over from him. We are saying that just like the late Mzee Jomo Kenyatta established the first principle and practice, that when he was President he saw it fit, and it was deliberate, not accidental, that to leave the seat to our current President; to lead this country coming from a different tribe and a different region. It is because he knew that Moi was a most capable person and also because it was fair that the leadership must move on. We are saying the same thing; that we are supporting our President to remain in power. If there is change of the Constitution as we are saying and he has got two more terms and after that it moves on; it does not go backwards, that is all we are saying. Luhyas are just presenting their case just like the Luo community is presenting their community in the case of Oginga Odinga or maybe K'Ombudo when he wants to stand in future. We are presenting our case just like everybody else. We do not want to go backwards. Thank you. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. arap Kirwa: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this very important Motion.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Motion is important because it concerns the welfare of this nation for the next one year and many more to come. I start by thanking His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for having made this Statement which concerns this year's Budget. There are some particular areas where I feel His Excellency the Vice-President did a good job for Kenyans in particular and generally for the entire economy of this particular region. I am happy about the removal of presumptive tax on milk which for many months was giving problems to farmers. This taxation was a burden to farmers because milk production is not very good business as many people know because most of this commodity is recycled by trying to sustain production in the long run.The issue that is pertinent to that is the payments from Kenya Co-operative Creameries (KCC) to dairy fanners. While I thank the Ministry of Co-operative Development and KCC for their effective payment for the last months milk production, there is need for them to maintain regular and prompt payments to farmers if we want KCC to survive. For the last three months or so a lot of milk was going to other destinations other than the KCC although the Dairy Board of Kenya restricts the sale of milk to KCC and other authorized dealers. This practice might have killed the entity which has been assisting many of our dairy fanners.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, on taxation, it is important for the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance to consider retaining the current taxation methods and modes instead of introducing new taxation measures. There was a lot of relieve in this year's Budget, but it is still evident that many Kenyans' are paying a lot of money through taxes. I urge the Ministry to consider ways and means of reducing the modes of taxation while at the same time ensuring that the taxation measures that are there are strictly adhered to. The situation as it pertains now is that there are very many people who evade taxes. This has necessitated the Government to introduce other taxation measures as a means of getting revenue. If the Government has several taxation measures it should ensure that people pay their taxes promptly instead of introducing new taxation measures.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, at the moment we are faced with the issue of importing food. Right now we have imported a lot of maize, sugar and wheat. I have said in and outside this House that if we could be careful this importation of food would not have been necessary. I am saying so because there are some areas in this country which, if looked after carefully would make us self-sufficient in food production for local consumption and even for export. Currently many parts of the country are faced with drought, a situation which has contributed to the shortage of food in the country. For the last one year many parts of this country had enough rains and if the food policy that was in force was properly followed, there would have been enough food in Kenya as I talk now. There are some areas in this country that we ignore which are very important for food production. Another factor is the issue of fertilizers. His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance clearly said that the decontrol of fertilizers has necessitated the availability of the commodity but I tend to differ with his statement The decontrol might have made fertilizers available because many businessmen are doing good business, but farmers are not able to purchase the commodity because of its high price. It is, therefore, imperative that the Ministry should ensure that we bring introduce measures which are going to lower the prices of fertilizers. I have always heard about the issue of subsidizing fertilizers in Kenya, but we are most of the time importing food while we could have subsidized the price of fertilizers to enable our fanners to boost food production.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the issue of food importation has so many problems and I do not have to enumerate them all. One of the problems is inconvenience. Secondly, when we import food we do not create employment locally and thirdly, to import food we have to use the much needed and scarce foreign exchange.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the price of some vehicles was reduced by sh.40,000/-, but that is not important to me. The price of tractors should have been lowered because to purchase a tractor at the moment one needs over sh.900,000/- This is the problem farmers are facing. Since farmers cannot purchase new tractors the amount of money used on repairs and maintenance of the tractors that they already have is a lot and the cost is transferred to the farmer who has no tractor because he has to hire one. These are the areas we have to look into because I believe that for the stability of this nation food is very important Tribal issues are secondary aspects because Kenyans need food regardless of the tribe they belong to. It is my earnest appeal to leaders in this country that we must accept the fact that there are many tribes in Kenya but we, as leaders must rise slightly above the tribal boundary. In doing so we shall be able to look into the problems of all Kenyans regardless of the tribal elementMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for the last one year, Kenyans have been bogged down by the issue of tribalism and no Kenyan can say that he is free from these feelings. Some of the opposition leaders are only appealing for tribal sentiments and are not going beyond that For example, if Ford held their general elections today and Oginga Odinga does not capture the top seat, the following day there will be no Luos in Ford.This is the truth. These are the issues that we know are there. We as hon. Members of this House should try as much as possible to play it down. It is very expensive, but we must always try to play it down.The issue that has not been addressed to fully and clearly this is very necessary for the stability of this country is how we are going to prepare Kenyans towards the forthcoming general elections. Many leaders are only concerned about winning their parties, but not how peaceful are the elections going to be. This is a very important point We in Kanu should not only be concerned about Kanu winning. We should also be concerned about what do we do after winning the elections. It is very necessary for Kenyans to go to elections peacefully and there must be peace afterwards since peace is paramount Every tribe or leader  be he a tribal or any other leader for that matter needs peace, and all Kenyans need peace.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Lengees: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me a chance also to join my colleagues to contribute towards this very important financial Motion.I would also like to take this chance to thank His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for presenting such a well-balanced budget that is supposed for the common man of this country. The budget was quite acceptable to all groups of people in this country. I can even call it a "multi-party budget" because since it was read in the House, we have never had any comments or complaints from the opposition nor from the entire community of this country. So the budget was well balanced.It is now high time for the Ministries to see that they implemented their activities properly. In particularly, the Ministry of Water Development is very important. However, the image of that Ministry has very much deteriorated since the services rendered to the public in terms of provision of water are very much questionable. In particular, my area, Samburu, we have had no water for some time. The dams around Maralal have all dried up due to prolonged dry spell. The residents of Maralal town have been very tolerant. We as the local D.D.C. decided to sink some boreholes for them without any assistance from the Ministry of Water Development at all.We also used to have solar operated boreholes in the northern division of my constituency which broke down about nine months ago. This solar machine has never been repaired and people are still waiting for its repair. This is very bad and disappointing to wananchi. While the wananchi appreciate the services rendered by the Ministry of Water Development the Ministry does not take quick action to correct whatever has gone wrong. I urge the Ministry to speed up the process of attending to the common man in the rural areas since water is life. Water is very vital towards life.The Ministry of Water Development promised that by the year 2000, every Kenyan would be provided with clean piped water. I think that was a very confusing and misleading statement from the Ministry. I think it is very important for them to try and change their image as a Ministry of Water Development since wananchi in Kenya wish to be provided with water.As I have said in the past, dams are very important in the dry areas of this country. Again, it is also very important for the Ministry to plan for dams properly. They should see to it that wherever there is a dam it is substituted by a borehole so that during the dry spell when the dam is dry, the borehole is operational to help the residents in those areas.As per the Ministry of Health's drugs supply is concerned, I wish to thank them. Whenever they send us kits for particular dispensaries or district hospitals, we receive them in good time. However, the nurses have to be trained and posted to all dispensaries and hospitals every year. Wananchi in the rural areas construct their own dispensaries through the spirit of Harambee. But if the dispensaries are not staffed with nurses, they cannothelp wananchi. So the Ministry should train mqre school leavers as nurses so that, they can tackle that problem.With regards to the Ministry of Supply and Marketing, we are in very hard times as Kenyans due to the drought facing us, particularly the people in the northern CM- eastern part of Kenya. The food supply like maize flour, sugar essential commodities are very rare in those areas. It is very important for the Ministry concerned to look seriously into that problem. They should make sure that there is enough food stock for inhabitants living in a particular area. Even the K.N.T.C. should see to it that sugar is also available in those areas.Again, price control is another very important issue. For instance, a bag of posho or maize costs about KSh.900.00 in some areas while it costs about KSh.400.00 from the N.C.P.B. It is very important for the local administration to check and control the prices of essential commodities in such areas.Again, it is high time for us, as leaders, particularly in this Parliament, respected each other, in particular His Excellency the President. I call upon each of us to respect one another and also respect His Excellency the President very much. It is also important for us as leaders in this House to respect the late Mzee Jomo Kenyatta. Let us respect him. Let us not talk anything bad about him because he is "sleeping" just next to the Parliament Buildings. It is very unusual in any African community to talk about someone who has passed away. At the same time, I appeal to the opposition parties and particularly those from the family of the late Mzee Kenyatta, to respect the President of this country because he is a man who had really shown much respect to the late Mzee Kenyatta. If Mzee Kenyatta was still alive, we Kenyans would have been following him. We had never said anything bad about him during his lifetime and now is not the time to do so. Therefore, all Kenyans must respect the late Mzee Kenyatta.With these few remarks I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Miruka-Owuor: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to join my colleagues in contributing to this important Motion and in doing so, I have only a few points to make. First of all, I wish to record my appreciation and thanks to the Minister for Finance for- the way he has managed the finances of this country inspite of world recession. There are problems arising out of lack of finances throughout the world and these problems should be made known to the people so that they are aware that it is not only Kenya where these problems are but throughout the world.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, while on this, I would like to request the hon. Minister to avoid the tendency of bringing mini-budgets. For instance you remember last year we passed a budget and thereafter more than 10 times, the price of petrol was increased and consequently the prices of foodstuffs were increased. I feel that the Ministry of Finance has experts who should advise the Minister on these things. They should foresee what is likely to happen and when they bring a budget it should be one which is going go last. Consequently, I think it is not right to bring mini- budgets something that we have witnessed in the past, particularly when prices of consumer goods have been increased every month. This puts unbearable burden on the ordinary mwananchi. So, the Minister ought to control this.[The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Galgallo) left the Chair][The Deputy Speaker took the Chair]Secondly, there is the question of money which is set aside for development. In many areas, it has been really disappointing to note that every year, money is set aside to build roads or hospitals or to bring rural electrification but in the end these funds are not used or they are misused because they are never returned to the Treasury. I will appeal very strongly to the hon. Minister to look into ways of ensuring that whatever money is voted is applied for the purpose for which it is intended. It should be used for that purpose.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other aspect I would request the Vice-President and Minister for Finance is that normally to look into is that we normally pass a very attractive Budget which is given wide publicity but after two months the Government is unable to operate. When you go to the police they tell you that they cannot move because they have no vehicle. Sometimes police have been known to ask victims of robbers, when they are rung, to arrest the robbers and take them to the police station; that kind of thing should be avoided.Sir, I would like to pay tribute to the Government with regard to the endemic problem of the Nyando floods. Here the Government has always come to our aid by bringing food, medical support and so on. But I have always pleaded with the Government that food and other support at the time of crisis is not enough. We request that the Government should take positive action to eliminate the root cause of the floods. We know the root cause of the floods; we have proposed it in the DDC several times and it seems no action is taken. The Government has some inertia, I do not know what causes it. With all good intentions, the Government waits until the people are in a dilemma before it moves in to assist. We appreciate all that is done but we pray that the Government should, while there are no floods, take action so that floods are avoided in the future. We have appealed, for instance, for the building of bridges which can enable the people to escaped in the event of floods, that is when they are marooned, but noaction has been taken in this regard.There is also a small matter about prices of consumer goods. Prices of a few commodities have decontrolled. Consequently, these items have disappeared from the market and all have had their prices doubled. For instance, in Kisumu region in the past one week there has been a dire shortage of sugar and when you found it instead of paying the normal price for a kilogramme you paid shs30/- or more for it. This is an area where the Government should step in to help wananchi.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, agriculture has been recognised by the country as the mainstay of the economy, the biggest foreign exchange earner by far. As I have said before, I do not feel that sufficient attention has been given to agriculture in the sense that people are not assisted.  The Minister for Agriculture is here, I believe, but instead of paying attention to agriculture he is indulging in useless matters like a Luhya presidency. I do not know why, but we are told that it is due to lack of support that one indulges in such talks. May I caution. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Regional Development (Mr. Okwara): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for hon. Miruka- Owuor to talk about Luhya presidency when I made it very clear in the morning that when a Luhya woman gives birth to a male child the cliild is called "omwani", which means the child will have to rule one day?Mr. Miruka-Owuor; Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was not aware is Mr. Okwara is also a candidate for the Luhya presidency. I only know of hon. Mwangale who is the Minister for Agriculture and who has pledged to run the Ministry, but now he is devoting time to this business of Luhya presidency; I do not why he is doing that You can be a Luyha President if you had build Miwani and Muhoroni Sugar Companies but not when they collapse. He has left the factories to collapse and he now wants to be the President.I was praying that more attention could be paid to roads particularly the question of constructing tarmac roads. It should Government policy to construct tarmac roads in every district so that the wananchi can travel with ease. For instance, 10 kilometres should be tarmacked per year in every district. I was opposing these people who were talking about a Luyha President because Kenya was created by Kanu as a unitary states. We are all the same and it does not matter whether we have a Turkana President so long as the people get the services that they require. But I think certain statements made by some Government Ministers are dangerous because they mislead the people.For instance, when Mr. Mwangale stands up and says that he wants a Luyha President, one may mistake it for a Government policy. We should be careful about this. He claimed that they are the second largest tribe and yet it has been known ever since that the Luos are the second largest tribe in Kenya. That sort of statement does not unify the people.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr. Otieno): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to join my colleagues in supporting this Motion and to congratulate the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for presenting a very well balanced Budget to the House. It is clear now that in terms of the policy framework, there is nothing that the opposition would bring that would be different from what the Kanu Government is already doing. It, therefore, tantamount to saying that it is just a matter of time that we will start seeing changes through certain personalities.This brings me to the issue of the Presidency which has caught the imagination of so many people and which is a matter of debate even in this House. I would like to make one point that all of us, Ministers, Assistant Ministers, Members of Parliament and so many other leaders in this country, are making the job of die next President very difficult. This is because we are trying to orientate the electorate to a point of choosing a Presidential tribe and then thereafter, an individual that may be Presidential material. In which case, are going to be destroying that President before he is even elected. This is because after he is elected, we will be telling him "you are the President of this tribe first and then the President of Kenya thereafter." The demands by his tribe on his shoulders will be enormous' and we are creating those circumstances right now for the next President.Why do we not, for goodness sake, re-orientate the thinking of Kenyans towards electing a Kenyan individual as President of Kenya? If that person happens to be a Luhya, he will be told, "You were elected by Kenyans, and not by the Luhya." As it is the Kikuyu have had a President of their tribe and now the Kalenjin have their, a President of their own tribe. If Kenyans were to make their choice of a presidential candidate on the basis of tribes, and these two tribes had a candidate each to offer, the Kalenjin would say, "Please, eliminate the Kikuyu candidate." If we have a candidate from another tribe who qualifies as presidential material and is as good as the Kalenjin candidate, his tribe will say, "Please, eliminate the Kalenjin because they have already had a President of their own tribe." For heaven's sake, however, we must avoid the minds of Kenyans to the effect that we are first going to choose a presidential tribe, from which we will look for a presidential candidate.If you take those of us in Kanu, who believe that Kanu has grassroots support throughout the country, that it is the party for national unity and stability and that it is going to develop this country in peace, love and unity, you are making our job difficult by asking us to indulge in tribal affairs because we are going to be told that our choice of a presidential candidate is tribalistic. If you are a Luo, and some mad Luo is a presidential candidate, you will definitely go for him. You are making it difficult to make a Kanu choice because you have distorted reasoning, you have dismissed reasoning from among our voters and you are now appealing to tribal emotions in order to get yourself a the ultimate choice of a President.I would like all leaders to forget this business of trying to choose a tribe and be bold enough to mention individual names of Kenyans whom they think are the right presidential candidates. Let Kenyans screen these individuals by way of their style and personal capacities so that we can finally agree or disagree as to who should be elected. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Mwangale): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I indeed accept that we are not a presidential tribe. However, we are simply saying that every tribe has presidential material and that this is not confined to the Kikuyu. That is all I am saying very simply. </Newspeech>(Applause)<Newspeech>The Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr. Otieno): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I totally agree. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Miruka-Owuor: On a point of order, Mr. Dejputy Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: You are overruled, Mr. Miruka-Owuor. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr. Otieno): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I totally agree with hon. Mwangale that every tribe. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Miruka-Owuor: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: You are overruled, Mr. Miruka-Owuor. Will you, for goodness' sake, allow hon. Dalmas Otieno to develop his thinking? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr. Otieno): Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for protecting me.I was saying that I totally agree with hon. Mwangale in that every ethnic group in this country is capable of producing presidential material by name of the personality concerned. However, my point is that he should not refer to that personality's tribe, but to the qualities that make him the right presidential candidate. Kenyans will then screen that personality as a person, with his ethnic origin in the background. When we weigh all declared candidates. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Miruka-Owuor: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the hon. speaker on the Floor is misleading the House because the fact of tribes is here in Kenya. We have a presidential candidate, hon. Mwangale, and all that he is saying is that all the Luhya should be with him, as should be the Luo, the Kikuyu and the rest of Kenyans. </Newspeech>(Applause)<Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Order! Order! Just like I suspected that indeed was no point of order! </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr. Otieno): Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for pointing out that. I want to make another small point and this is on the issue of majimboism. Without realising, I witnessed, in 1967, when land adjudication and land consolidation came there were Kenyans who reacted by trying to chase away their squatters. Initially when the land was communal they allowed squatters to live there and help them as herdsmen. But as soon as they heard that there was going to be land consolidation they started saying that the squatters should go away. Similarly, the moment you mention majimboism or federalism the first reaction of the ordinary Kenyan in border areas and particularly if they are settlement areas- The first reaction is "let us move the borderline." So, it is logical that the more we talk about majimboism the more we are telling Kenya citizens in border areas to start discussing where exactly does the boundary pass. It does not matter what intentions or objectives politicians have got. We all know it; that the politician's objective is not necessarily the consequence of the action which other people take as a result of what he says. You may be perfectly right saying that we need to protect ethnic minorities or that we need to protect this kind of group and if you put it in plain language and say " we want Majimboism" you are making such a broad statement subject to a lot of misinteipretation and consequences as to how do we examine each boundary. I would like to say that if we want to protect any ethnic minorities we should examine any legal provisions that would guarantee that protection.I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Manpower Development and Employment (Mr. Lugonzo): Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me a chance to contribute to the Budget Speech. The Budget was good in that there were some elements of reducing taxation and so on which wananchi are quite happy about.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I comment on the Budget proposals, I would like to join the debate that has just been on. There is this statement [The Assistant Minister for Manpower Development and Employment]by hon. Mwangale which seems to have gathered a lot of moss as it went a long and I would say what the Abaluhya people are thinking about it. </Newspeech><Newspeech>An Hon. Member: Who are you? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Manpower Development and Employment (Mr. Lugonzo): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are .the Abaluhya and I would like to assure hon. Mwangale that the statement he made was not far from what the Abaluhya are thinking about. I am not a tribalist but we the Abaluhya have learnt the hard way. We are being told that there should be no tribalism when actually nearly all these big tribes are tribalistic. All the big tribes are tribalistic. I could start with hon. Dalmas Otieno who has opposed the idea of Luhyas seeking to unite, and say that it is only a few months ago when hon. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Order! Hon. Lugonzo, are you saying that you read hon. Dalmas Otieno correctly when you said he opposed? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Manpower Development and Employment (Mr. Lugonzo): Yes, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Very well. Continue. The Assistant Minister for Manpower Development and Employment (Mr. Lugonzo): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to refer to the statement by Mr. Oloo-Aringo who said that. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Miruka-Owuor: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I do not think it is fair to talk against somebody who is not a Member of this House and, therefore, cannot defend himself. Let the hon. Member challenge us those who are here, and we shall tell him off! </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Order, Mr. Miruka- Owuor! You have just finished talking against hon. Mwangale a few minutes ago and you are now challenging hon. Seth Lugonzo. So it is important that we stick to the Standing Orders. Whereas I quite agree with you that it is against the Standing Orders to talk against somebody who is not a Member of the House, please, realise that you have just used Unparliamentary language, but the Chair did not want to interrupt you. Now, let the law lie where it may be, and continue. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Miruka-Owuor: On a point of order; Mr. Deputy Speaker. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: No, overruled! The Assistant Minister for Manpower Development and Employment (Mr. Lugonzo): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the kind of unity and coming together the Abaluhya are speaking of is not new. In fact, and it is true, that all these tribes are united. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister, Office of the Vice- President and Ministry of Finance (Mr. Kariuki): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think we seem to be getting lost. From the Orders of the Day, we are discussing the Financial Statement and matters arising. But what we have been hearing for the past few minutes has nothing at all to do with the Financial Statement. Is that really in order? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Manpower Development and Employment (Mr. Lugonzo): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Hon. Nduati Kariuki is an old Member of this House, and I am sure he is aware of the fact that when debating the budget, we touch nearly on everything. So I am quite . </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Order! For the benefit of hon. Member for Makuyu, paragraph two of the Budget Speech reads as follows, and quote:- "Mr. Speaker, world economic history is replete with examples of nations the economic disintegrations of which have followed political turmoilâ" I think that is where hon. Members are addressing. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister for Manpower Development and Employment (Mr. Lugonzo): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, whether we like it or not, all these tribes are united and, in fact, each has a leader, tribal or otherwise. </Newspeech>                                                          <Header>ADJOURNMENT</Header><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: It is now time for interruption of business. The House is, therefore, adjourned until tomorrow, Thursday, 11th June, 1992, at 2.30 p.m.The House rose at 6.30 p.m. </Newspeech>
