MEMBER: Use Kiswahili. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. EKIDOR: Bw. Spika. Waziri Msaidizi anafikiri pesa hizi zitakuwa tayari lini? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ONYANCHA: Bw.Spika. sikukisikia Kiswahili hicho . </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. EKIDOR: Bw. Spika, Waziri Msaidizi anafikiri pesa hizi zitakuwa tayari lini? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ONYANCHA: Bw. Spika; siwezi kujua kabisa ni tarehe gani ambapo pesa hizi zitakuwa tayari, lakini hati zote ambazo zilikuwa zikihi tajiwa zimekwishapewa ofisa anayehusika na malipo ya uzeeni na tunafikiri kwamba Bw. Kiptelepong atalipwa hivi karibuni tu. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: Bw. Spika, ningependa Waziri Msaidizi alieleze Bunge ni mwaka gani Bw. Kiptelepong alipostaafu. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ONYANCHA: Bw. Spika, Bw. Kiptelepong alistaafu nwezi wa Juni, 1989. </NEWSPPECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKHANU: Bw. Spika, ningependa kujua ni kiasi gani cha pesa atakacholipwa Bw. Kiptelepong. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OMYANCHA: Bw. Spika, sikulitarajia swali hili; kwa hivyo silijui jibu lake. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUTUA: Bw. Spika. inekuwa kawaida ya maofisa wa Serikali kutoa majibu kama hili ambalo ametoa Waziri Msaidizi. Ki kwa nini Ofisi ya Rais inaonekana kama haijui wakati maofisa wake wanapostaafu ili iwalipe pesa zao ya uzeeni papo hapo? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ONYANCHA: Bw. Spika, Bw. Kiptelepong alipostaafu hati iambatanayo na malipo haya ilitengenezwa na ilipotumwa katika Ofisi ya Rais, tuligundua kwamba hati mibili zilizohitajika zilikuwa hazijatumwa pamoja na ile hati kubwa. Mojawapo ya hati zilizokosekana ilikuwa nakili ya kitambulisno chake na hati ya pili ni payslip yake. Kwa hivyo, tulipopata hati ya kwanza, tuliandika barua kwa Mkuu waMR. OMYAHCHA (CTD.):Mkoakwa Rift valley ili atafute njia ya kumpigia simu Mkuu wa Wilaya ya West Pokot ambaye angetafuta hati zilizokosekana na kututumia. Hii ndiyo sababu jambo hili lilichukua muda kidogo kukamilisha. Sasa hivi, tumezipata hati hizi na tumamwomba ofisa anayehusika na malipo ya uzeeni amlipe Bw. Kiptelepong mara moja.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. MISOI : Bw. Spika, Swali hiii linahusu malipo ya Bw. Kiptelepong ambaye alistaafu, na ni ajabu kwarnba wakati Waziri Msaidizi alipolijibu Swali hili hapo awali alisema kwanba hakutarajia kuulizwa ni kiasi gani cha pesa ambacho Bw. Kiptelepong angelipwe. Kwa vile Swali hili linshusu pesa, lngakuwa vizuvi kwa waziri Msaidizi kuwaulize msofisa wake ni kiasi gani cha pesa kilichohusika. Jibu la Waziri Meaidizi si Kamilifu. Wi Kwa nini hakuuliza ni kiasi gani cna pesa ambacho Bw. Kiptelepong anafaa kulipwa?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OMYAMCHA: Bw. Spika, Swali lenyewe linahitaji Mwulizaji aambiwe ni kwa nini Bw. Kipteleoong hakulipwa pesa zake, lakini sio kiasi cha pesa anbacho angelipwa. Pengine, yule aliyetunga Swali hili kufuatana na shauri la Bw. Kiptelepong hakutaka Kenya nzima ijue ni kiasi gani cha pesa ambacho angelipwa, kwa kuwa pengine alikuwa akiyalinda maslahi ya Bw. Kiptelepong. </NEWSPEECH>	<NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: Jembo le nidhemu, Bw. Spika. Je, Waziri Msaidizi ana haki ya kulipotosha Bunge hiii kwa kusema kwamba huyo mtu hataki Kenya nzima ijue ni kiasi gani cha pesa ambacho anataka kulipwa? Je, Waziri Msaidizi ana habari kwamba Swali hili ni mali ya Bunge hili? Je, Weziri Ksaidizi ana habari kwamba Swali hili ni mali ya Bunge hili? Kwa hivyo ni Lazina alijibu Wali hili visuri. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ONYANCHA: Bw. Spika, nina haki ya kussma kwasba labda Bw. Kantol hakutaka Kenya nzima ijue ni. Kiasi gani cha pesa amoscho atalipwa. Hii ni kwa subabu yeye hakuniomba, kupitia kwa Bunge stalipwa. Hii ni kiaoi gani cha pesa ambacho atalipwe. Ewa hivya sis hatuwezi kufichua ni kiasi gani cha pesa ambacho anadad alipwe. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: Bw.Spika, nakuomba utusaidie, Tunataka Wazairi Msaidizi alieleze Bunge hiii ni kiasi gani cha pesa amoecho Bw.Kantol anataka kolipwa. Hii ni kwa sababu Bw.Kantol, akiwa kule nyumbani, angetaka kusikia, kupitia kwa Bunge hili, ni kiasi gani cha pesa anbacho atalipwa. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Mini nakubaliana na maoni ya Waziri Msaidizard kwamba hakuna haja kwa Bunge hili kuambiwa au kwa Kenya nzima kujua ni kiasi gani cha pesa ambacho mtu fuleni etelipwa. Hiyo ni siri ya mtu binafsi. </NEWSPEECH>Question No.200<HEADER>Expansion of Embotut Health Centre</HEADER>MR. KIPKORER asked the Minister for Health since ELGEYO/Marakwet D.D.C. has recommended the expansion of Embotut Health Centre in order to accommodate the increasing number of patients, when the Ministry will implement this recommendation.<NEWSPEECH>THE AS5I5TANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH ( Mr.Ogur) : Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.I would, like to inform the hon. Member that Empotut health facility is a dispensary and not a health centre until after the expansion will have been done, approved and upgraded. However, when the Elgeyo-Marakwet D.D.C. upgraded it. It has now been included in the current approved Forward Budget. It has also been earmarked for trending in 1991/92 with K£20,000 and a further K£5,000 during the 1992/93 Financial year. In other words, we have accepted the request from the hon. Member. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIPKORER : Mr.Speaker, Sir, why can the Ministry not fund the facility during . . . . . 1990/91 instead of 1991/92? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, may be the hon. Member does not understand the meaning of 1990/91 and 1991/92. It means when we are rich beginning from July each year. That is the meaning of it. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIPKORER : Could the Assistant Minister explain further? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, every year we do our planning from the month of July. So when we get rich in July this year, we will start the work of upgrading this particular dispensary? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Malebe’s Question </NEWSPEECH>Question No.167<HEADER>Deployment of Teachers in Igembe</HEADER>MR.MALABE asked the Minister for Education what was the monthly understaffing situation for the months of October, November, December, 1989, and January, February and March 1990, in Maua, Kangets and Akachiu educational zoneofIgember Division.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Omido): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.</NEWSPEECH>Maua Educational zone was over staffed by six teachers in the vehicles of October, November and December, 1939. In January 1990, it was understaffed by seven teachers and in February was by two teachers.Kangeta Educational zone was not understaffed but over staffed by five teachers in the months of October, November and December, 1939. In January, 1990, the zone was understaffed by 13 teachers and in February , 1990, it was understaffed by 14 teachers sad in march, there was no understaffing or overstaffing.Akachu Educational zone was understaffed in the months of October, November and December, 1939, by 23 teachers. In the months of January and February, I990, the zone was understaffed by 30 teachers and in March, 1990, it was understaffed by 20 teachers.<NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE- Mr. Speaker, Sir. Although this Question seems to have been, overtaken by events, could the Assistant Minister agree with me that as at 30th March, 1990, the understaffing situation in those zones was as . . . . . . . . . . . . . follows: Kargeta by seven teachers; Maua by 13 teachers and Akachiu by 30 teachers? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OMIDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the position as at 30th March. 1990, was exactly what I have told the House. </NEWSPECCH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALABE: Mr„ Speaker. Sir, the Assistant 2iinister has told us that there were 20 vacancies in Akachiu Educational Zone in March, 1990. Why did the Ministry not fill those vacancies with the Untrained Teachers who were recruited in November, 1939, and were posted to the respective zones were vacancies existed? </NEWSPEECH>	<NEWSPEECH>MR. OMIDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have accepted that there were shortages of teachers in those zones. But the figures I have mentioned have been reduced considerably. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALABE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is misleading the Mouse. He has stated clearly that there were 20 vacancies in Akachiu in March, 1990. Why did the Ministry not fill these vacancies with untrained teachers? Is he in order to try to mislead this House? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OMIDO: Mr.Speaker, Sir, I am not misleading the House at all I have just told the House what the position is I have also accepted that there was under staffing in those zones. But the Ministry has already taken action. These vacancies have already been filled and I think that is the most important tiling here. When the applicants are being interviewed, by the appropriate body we have to ensure that they will do a good job in the schools they will be posted to. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALABE: On a point of information, Mr. Speaker, Sir. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH> MR. SPEAKER: Next Question. </NEWSPEECH>																																Question No. 191<HEADER>Vehicle for Marsabit Game warden</HEADER>MR. FALANA asked the Minister for Tourism and Wildlife since poaching has only been reduced but not eradicated and considering the importance of easy mobility in the national parks; whether he could provide Marsabit Game Warden with vehicles to enable him execute his duties effectively.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILDLIFE (Mr. Awori): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Currently, the Kenya Wildlife Services does not have sufficient vehicles. However, it has embarked so, on a programme of rehabilitating its vehicles Is throughout Republic and we expect that Kalosabit will be one of the districts that will receive a rehabilitated vehicle. As a measure to step up anti - poaching activities in the area, the Kenya Wildlife Service has posted a new warden with an aircraft to take care of Marsabit and Sibiloi National Parks. He is expected to report on duty by 15th June, 1990. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. FALANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while appreciating that reply by the Assistant Minister, could he inform the House the number of serviceable and mobile vehicles that this warden has at his disposal? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. AWORI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, at present he has none. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell the House how long the Ministry is going to take to rehabilitate those vehicles; are they going to take two weeks, one year or three years? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. AWORI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we expect the rehabilitated vehicles to be in place in the next two or three months. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. FALANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, because of the current anti-poaching activities does the Assistant Minister expect any effective services to rendered by this warden without a vehicle? Can such an officer really render any services when he is not mobile? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. AWORI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I swore to tell the truth and what I have said is the truth. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. FALANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the Assistant Minister	MR .FALANA (Ctd.):for being honest and sincere. That being so and since there is no vehicle there and thus he does not expect this warden to render any services could he as a matter of urgency think of sending one vehicle to that station? This is because there are certain tasks than do not need the services of an aircraft. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. AWORI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have already said, there will be a plane to service the Marsabit and Sibiloi National Parks. I also expect to have vehicles within the next two or three months. But in the meantime whenever vehicle is required there is the usual collective responsibility, where other Officers like agriculture officers and district commissioners whose vehicles can be utilised when the need arises.</NEWSPEECH>Question No. 185<HEADER>Repair of Roads in Mombasa Municipality</HEADER>MR. KILIKU asked the Minister for Local Government when the  Second Phase of repairing roads in Mombasa Municipality would be started and how many roads in Changamwe Constituency are included in this programme.<NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Anybody from the Ministry of Local Government? Let us move on to the next Question. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 203<HEADER>Absorption of Youth Polytechnic Workers in the Civil Service</HEADER>MR. MAXHANU asked the Minister for Technical Training and Applied Technology since it is an acceptable fact that personnel of various youth polytechnics, who are employees of management committees of those youth polytechnics, are performing a sterling job in the 8—4—4 and Jua Kali programmes, whether he could consider absorbing all these personnel in the Civil Service and develop a scheme of service for them.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TECHNICAL TRAINING AND APPLIED TECHNOLOGY (Mr. Leakey): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.My Ministry is fully aware of the invaluable contribution being made by the staff of youth polytechnics in equipping young people with relevant vocational skills for gainful employment. My Ministry is also aware of the	THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TECHNICAL TRAINING AND APPLIED TECHNOLOGY (Mr. Leakey) (ctd.):need to formulate a suitable scheme of service for youth polytechnics personnel in order to attract and retain qualified staff to help implement the 8-4-4 technical programmes for youth polytechnics. My Ministry has therefore worked out a scheme of service for technical instructors and lecturers which is at a very advanced stage of discussion in established Government machinery. The scheme, if approved and accepted, will cover all cadres of technical teachers in the country including instructors and managers of these polytechnics. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Speaker. Sir, while appreciating the reply by the Assistant Minister and nothing that he has accepted the vital role played by these youth polytechnic instructors, could he confirm to this House that these personnel will be absorbed in the Civil Service to enable them to benefit from the scheme of service that his Ministry is working out?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. LEAKERY: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would imagine that most of them will ultimately be absorbed into the scheme provided that they qualify to do so. This is because my Ministry has a massive programme of expansion of youth polytechnics throughout the country. We, in fact, envisage a shortage of such qualified personnel. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 181<HEADER>Transfer of a Road from Meru to Isiolo District</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Jaldessa is not in yet? Next Question. </NEWSPEECH>Question. No. 212<HEADER>Ownership of a Piece of Land in Magarini<HEADER>MR. KDZAI asked the Minister for Lands., Housing and Physical Planning who allocated the piece of land, comprising approximately 100 acres, that was surveyed and demarcated by the occupants in GK 31 L and GX 235 M at Kadzanda Mafisi in Fundlissa Location, Magarini Division, during the month of December last year and completed on 14th December, 1989.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Bomett): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The piece of land measuring approximately 100 acres was allocatedTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Bomett) (ctd . ) :to Mr. T.M. Twahir of P.O. Box 72480, Nairobi by the Commissioner of Lands, on behalf of the Government of Kenya. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. NDZAI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the Minister aware that before this piece of land was allocated to Mr.Twahir there were already people living on it? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BOMETT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we were not aware of such a thing. This is because we asked the Lands Officer, Kilifito inform us watcher the land was free of squatters. In his reply he told us that the land was free and that there was only Maize that was being grown on it. But fortunately since we are aware that this land had been occupied by squatters we intend to reschedule this land so that the squatters can have their rightly land. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the reply that the Assistant Minister has given us and since he has agreed that there were squatters on that land— In fact for the information of the House there are 18 villages on that piece of land. Since these people are suffering, when does the Minister intend to reschedule this land to settle these people? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BOMETT: Mr. Speaker, Sir Discussions are going on with the Office of the President and we intend to do it as soon as possible. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWANZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir will the Minister tell this House why they had to allocate these 100 acres of land to one parson in a place like Malindi where land is scarce while other people have nothing? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BOMETT: Mr. Speaker. Sir, the reason is simple. This person applied to acquire this land in order to develop it for the good of the country since it was not being utilized. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. NDAZI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to his reply, the Assistant Minister said k that these squatters will not be disturbed. Does it then mean that the owner of this land will be settled somewhere else the squatters left there to be allocated this land since it belongs to the Government? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BOMETT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I never said, Sir. In fact, that is the Questioner's statement. I said that we have now discovered that there are squatters occupying this land although our officer in Kilifi told us that there were none, we have now found out that this information was not correct and we are, therefore, prepared to accommodate the squatters. We intend to curve a portion of these 100 acres and allocate it to the squatters. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. NDAZI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the Assistant Minister was given wrong information and now that he has the correct information, can he tell us the number of squatters in that place? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BOMETT: That  is not important, Sir. The important thing is that we have discovered that there are squatters who need to be accommodated and we shall do that. Their rusher is immaterial. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. NDAZI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister said that he has discovered that there are squatters there and that he is going to accommodate them. Now, how is he going to do that when he does not know how many they are? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BOMETT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said that currently, discussion, is going on between the Office of the President and my Ministry as far as this matter is concerned. The Office of the President comes in because they wouldthe number of squatters who are there and whether they are genuine or not. We are technical people who deal with the land and not with human beings. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.MWANZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to a letter from the chief of the this area, there are 18 villages not families occupying that land, would the Assistant Minister accept that fact d so that he does not refute it later on? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BOMETT: Sir. I repeat here that I am not interested in the number of squatters but in solving this question of squatters properly. The issue of the number of squatters will be looked into by the Office of the President under which the district officer, district commissioner and chiefs fail. These are the people who are actually serving the people of Kilifi. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 178<HEADER>Delay in Paying Late Mwemburi s Dues by the Public Trustee</HEADER>MR. MCHARO asked the Attorney-General why the Public Trustee has delayed the payment of gratuity benefits to the family of the late Mr. Joseph Mwamhuri, Adm. Case No. 774/84, Nairobi.<NEWSPEECH>THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. The estate of the late Joseph Mwamburi who died at Mombasa on 18thNovember, 1985, was referred to the Public Trustee by his wife on 18th April,1985. Its total estimated value is Kshs. 21, 631.70 which comprises Kshs.200,00 for personal effects, Kshs. 991.70 For unpaid salary by Kenya Railways Corporation and Kshs. 20, 440.00 for death gratuity from the Kenya Railways Corporation.	Alist of rightful heirs was received on the 5thJune, 1985 and the consent forms from the beneficiaries were received on 7thNovember, 1985.The estate was advertised by the Public Trustee in the Kenya Gazette on 19th September, 1986. On 22nd of November, 1989, the Public Trustee petitioned to the High Court for the grant of letters of administration and this grant was issued on 22nd March, 1990.A certified copy of the said grant of letters of administrationTHE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Mr. Muli): was sent to the Kenya Railways Corporation on 11th April, 1990. On 8th May, 1990, the Public Trustee received a cheque of Kshs. 19,931.70 from the Kenya Railways Corporation being the balance of the death gratuity of Kshs. 20,440.00 and unpaid salary at Kshs. 991.70. An amount of Kshs. 1,000.00 had been advanced by the Kenya Railways Corporation to the wife of the late Joseph Hwamburi in 1981 for her domestic use while Kshs. 500.00 had been advanced to the Public Trustee in 1936 for administration expenses as the estate had no funds.The Public Trustee has now drafted the application for confirmation of grant of letters of administration after which he will file the said application at the High Court of Kenya. Once this is done, the Public Trustee will proceed to finalise the administration of this long outstanding estate.I have replied to this Question in full in order to show the hon. Questioner why there has been such a delay since I984. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MCHARO: Mr. Speaker. Sir, arising from the Attorney-General’s answer that something will be. Done, May I know approximately when the Public Trustee will finalise the administration of this estate? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MULI: Mr. Speaker. Sir, I can say as soon as possible because an application to court has already been made. So, it is just about right to say as soon as possible. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, since this case has taken a long time - since 1984 -  it is not enough for the Attorney General, to say as soon as possible. He should tell us approximately when, tomorrow, next year or December this year? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MULI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, matters of this nature cannot, with precision has given an actual date of confirmation. We rely on the date of the court and all that I can say with honesty is that this estate is just about to be finalised. So, we would like to get it out of our books. The best I can say is that we will push on and the court will fix the hearing as soon as the diary of the court is available. I would say within this year; we mil not go beyond even July. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.

WAKEY0: On a point of order. Mr. Speaker, Sir. The rains have come and they g.re just about to end. Mumias Constituency produces nearly 50 per cent of sugar produced in this country and I would like to plead With the Ministry of Agriculture to give us a statement as to what has happened to the fertilizer. We have planted sugarcane and some planting has stopped because sugarcane is planted fertilize, together. As of now, fertiliser, that is urea, single superphosphate and di-ammonium phosphate is not available in Mumias and in certain other areas that stows sugarcane west of the Sift valley. We would like to hear from the Ministry of Agriculture as to what has happened to the fertilizer, not that I have any ill-motive about this, but definitely we are concerned because a number of people cannot just plant and those who have planted cannot put fertiliser in their sugarcane fields because the fertiliser is not yet available.Thank you, Sir. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.SPEAKER: Order! Order: Dr. Wameyo, you have been here for very many years. If you are interested in the Ministry giving you a very satisfactory reply, you bring up the issue in a form of Question by Private Notice. That is the best way you can get an answer to your issue. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KYONDA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am rising on a point of order concerning an answer I was given during the last Session by the Minister for Public Works on roads in my Constituency. The Minister said that the road would be repaired as soon as the rains stop. The rains stopped more than two weeks before we went on recess and since then we have not had any rains. The roads in my area are impassable. The road is repaired from Emali to a place called Kalama where the President visited last time, Even when the Minister for Co-operative visited the area for a Harambee, he nearly got stuck and it was difficult for him to move around. Apart from that, transport; cost has been doubled in the area, and everybody is talking about poor roads in the area. So, we need an answer from the Minister as to what happened because nobody seems to be able to give any explanation. We have talked about roads since that time and nothing seems to be happening. Even some roads have been washed away by water and apart from small vehicles big vehicles are not able to move. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.SPEAKER: Okay, that is enough. </NEWSPEECH>Next Order<HEADER>MOTION</HEADER>Adoption of the 1937/63 Public Accounts Committee ReportTHAT, this House adopts the Report of the Public Accounts Committee on the Government of Kenya Accounts for the year 1937/83 laid on the Table of the House on 28th March, 1990. (Mr. Tuva on 2.5.90)(Resumption of debate interrupted on 3.5.90)<NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Dr. Wameyo. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: Thank: you very much, Mr. Speaker. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had not completed my speech; I was contributing last time. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Order. Mr. Bidu. As far as we are concerned you had concluded your speech, Mr. Bidu. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: No, Mr. Speaker. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Okay, Mr. Bidu, continue. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir.Last time when I was contributing, I was on paragraph 23 talking about imprests. The paragraph states as follows:-“As in the previous years, the control of imprests remained unsatisfactory. According to records held by various Ministries and Departments, imprests totalling ESh.23, 117.909. 95 which should have been accounted for by 30th June, 1988, was still outstanding as at that date. Out of this figure, a total of, Ksh. 8, 383, 374.80 was due from officers on Job Group  ‘N’ and above.In addition, out of the total imprest of KSh.23,117,909.95 outstanding as at 30th June, 1988, imprests totalling Ksh.18, 436, 138.55 was still outstanding as 30th September, 1988.MR. BIDU (CTD):Mr. Speaker, Sir, you can see that most of these are big people and they are getting away with these public funds. From 1988 up to now there has been enough time for these people to show cause why they should not be reprimanded. I do not know whether, If we were to reprimand big people there would be a problem. It seems that big people do not care for public funds. These imprests date as far back 1988 and yet we know that, according to Government regulations, imprests must be accounted for within48 hour after the officers from journey. One wonders what these officers are up to. At the same I would blame whoever is supposed to take action against these officers. This is because we cannot let wananchi’s money to be squandered in this manner. We know that when a small money steals Shs.5/- he is imprisoned or fined and also blamed. Why should big people be left alone while snail people are made to suffer for smaller crimes?I would thus suggest that the vice-president and Minister for Finance takes appropriate action against these officers. Those on Job Group and above are senior officers who should know that this money has to be accounted for. In fact, drastic measures should be taken against them because they do not want to account for their imprests.I now want to refer to paragraph. 27 of the Report where it states:-“The customs Bonded Warehouse Registers maintained at Bonded Warehouses in Wairobi indicate that although goods and vehicle units with a total customs value of Shs, 44, 411, 023.40 were shown in the registers as still held in the customs Bonded Warehouses, audit inspections of the warehouses during the year under review could not confirm the presence of the goods in the respective warehouses. It would appear that the goods in question have already been removed from the customs BondedMR. BIDU (CTD):Warehouses although the payment of the import duty and sales tax amounting to Shs.15, 929, 954/- and Shs.4, 578, 777/-, respectively has not been confirmed. Similarly, various goods and vehicle units appear not to have been delivered from another eight custom.Bonded Warehouses although the Warehouses were no longer operational and import duty and sales tare amount to Shs.15,760.719/- has not been confirmed as having been received”.Mr. Speaker, Sir, you can see how things can get lost while they in a Customs .bonded Warehouse. If all this money is missing and nobody had discovered that it was missing, then all this leaves a lot to be desired. I blame the supervisory staff for this state of affairs. It seems that nobody was keen on ensuring that this public property was takes care of. I request the authorities concerned to be more vigilant than ever before. When we ask for implementation of projects, we are told this would be done when funds become available and yet here are funds which just went into the pockets of "robbers”. Unless we exercise greater vigilance, we shall continue to lose a lot of money in various institutions.On its part, the Committee stated:-"The Committee therefore recommends that the a Accounting Officer should ensure that bonded warehouses records are strictly and accurately maintained and that in future no goods are removed from the warehouses without duty and sales tax being collected. The Committee further recommends that in cases of goods which had left the warehouses without duty and sales. Sales tax being paid the Accounting Officer should follow up the matter and collect tine taxes in question and disciplinary action, including dismissal, be taken against the officers involved.”Although I commend the Committee's recommendation hers, I do not see why we should continue talking year in year out about the same recommendations. The Committee should come up with better and specific measure to be taken. We do not know whether the Accounting officer were vigorously interrogated. Every year the Committee MR. BIDU (CTD):recommends that the Accounting Officers be asked to rectify things.I think those who misappropriate public funds should be taken to court and also made to pay whatever they have lost, because their actions are ruining our economy. The Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance should make. Accounting Officers recover public money lost by their officers.Mr. Speaker, Sir, paragraph 29 of the Report, states:-"The Sizure Register ana the Register of Goods Deposited in Customs Warehouses and Abandoned and Unclaimed Goods shoved that various goods and currencies were held at Namanga. The Actual value of the goods was not shown in the registers, but the items included Kenya Currency totalling Shs.167,075/-. However, when a physical survey it he customs warehouse was carried out in March, 1988, the goods and currencies in question were not found in the warehouse but it was not indicated how the money and the goods were disposed of. Further, although the- Register of Goods - Deposited in the Customs - Warehouse indicated that five vehicles were sent to Nairobi Customs Headquarters from Namanga, the Import Entries through which the vehicles were imported were not shown and it has not therefore been possible to confirm whether the appropriate import duty and sales tare were collected."MR. BIDU (Ctd.):Mr. Speaker, Sir, here is another racket. How could this happen in a station, manned by a civil servant at Nanarga Customs Station? It could not have happened unless the man in charge of the station knew about it. Why has that man not been re-premanded? We cannot just leave this thing the way it is and keep quiet. If that station had a person in charge and if there was good supervision, such a thing would not have happened. We are told here that some things were brought to Nairobi and nobody seems to know about them. We should be more vigilant when appointing or promoting people to .man stations were we get some little money. My feeling is that we should have periodical checks in these stations. Officers from the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance should carry out thorough checks in each and every station to ensure chat a situation like this does not arise. This thing happened because the people who were responsible for manning the station in question were not trust worth. This thing happened way back in 1988 and up to now nothing has been done, and we have not beer, told––– </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. While appreciating the sentiments being made by hon. Bidu, I think to be fair to himself and to this House and to the public, he should also read the answers that go along with, the findings of the Committee. I am saying that because the answer under the particular paragraph he is discussing goes on to say, and quite clearly, that:-"The Committee heard the evidence given by the Accouning Officer, arising out of the findings of the Committee, and noted that most of the goods had beer; accounted for. The Committee further- noted the control measures that had been taken to ensure that such cases do not occur".I think the hon. Member is not being balanced in his views then he takes the lopsided aspect and leaves the other. I think we must be fair. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but the Assistant Minister should not forget the fact that the sane Committee we are referring to, in the last lines of the paragraph, recommends that any amount outstanding should be recovered. If the amount outstanding should be recovered, then when will thatMR. BIDU (Ctd.):be done? This thing happened in 1988 and today we are in 1990. Why was the amount outstanding not recovered when this cases reported? Why should we wait for the Committee to come and interview officers here? I am reading the paragraphs aloud for the Assistant Minister to know that I read before I talk. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I really thank the hon. Member for his observations, but the purpose of the Public Accounts Committee is precisely what it has reported here. It is because the Committee has been charged by this House with a duty of ensuring that public funds are properly utilised and accounted for, that this is happening. Therefore, the Committee is doing exactly what this House has asked it to do.Secondly, I would like to say that the procedures are such that once the sea nomalies have been found by the Committee action is taken subsequent to the Committee's recommendations. So, the time is yet to come for the recommendations to be taken into consideration and effected. So, we must really understand the sequence of the procedures. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: That was a point of information, hon. Keah. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Thank you. Mr. Speaker, Sir. I almost said that. Who is not reading? Is it me or the Assistant Minister? Having said that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me turn to paragraph 30, page 15,which talks about Nairobi Customs Warehouse. It says:-"During 1987/88, various goods were seized and recorded in the central offences register and	Nairobi offences register. The seizure register maintained at Nairobi Customs Warehouse shows that: the goods in question which were forfeited were not recorded in the register car and the whereabouts could not be ascertained. Consequently, it has not been possible to establish whether revenue amounting to KShs.289, 055.00 which was indicated in the offences register as due was collected. In a number of cases, however, the amount of the revenue due has not even been indicated in the register".The Committee reports here that it heard the evidence given by the Accounting Officer and noted that information regarding the audit has been submitted to the Controller and Auditor-General.MR. BIDU (Ctd.):Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are talking about: something that happened in 1987/88 and my main complaint is as to why a solution to a problem like this should take so long to be found. When shall we ever fulfil our obligations? When we find that there has been misappropriation of funds, action should be taken immediately. We should not allow the culprits to get away with it. According to the information we have here, the Controller and Auditor-General is still studying the papers presented to him and, therefore, has not taken any action. It is the duty of everybody in this country to protect public funds. Wananchi are being taxed very heavily in order to make our country economically stable, and it is surprising to see somebody grabbing money that comes from the sweat of wananchi without any action being taken against him. It will not be a wonder if we read the same things next year. The Controller and Auditor-General appear to be satisfied that, things are going well when, in fact, things are not going on the way we want. I humbly request that things be put in an horizontal move. We should take action against any person found to be misappropriating public funds; action should not be delayed.Sometimes I wonder why an ordinary clerk is imprisoned for two years for stealing only KShs.20/- and the big people who steal thousands of shillings are allowed to get away with it. Why should stern action not be taken against these big people? It is my sincere hope that things will change for the better in 1990. I hope that: the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance will ensure that people who misappropriate public funds are taken to court.MR. BIDU (ctd.):Mr. Speaker, Sir. I would like to request all the officers who are in charge of public funds to account for any money that may be misappropriated. Misappropriation of public funds should be termed as daylight robbery. Sir I would also like all funds which have been misappropriated to be returned to the Government plus interest.Sir, l would now like to turn to paragraphs/S1 and S2  which are on page 23 of the Public Accounts Report book. Those paragraphs are dealing with the Office of the President. Paragraphs/S1 and S2 on indicate that there were some pending bills. The attention of the Public Accounts Committee was drawn to some pending bills for 1986/87 totalling to paid K£7, 059, 873.00. Some of those bills were not paid during that Financial Year, but instead, they were carried forward to 1987/88, Financial Year. Available information indicates that out of total of K£7. 059, 873, 00 only sum of K£2,094,061.00 was cleared during the 1987/88, Financial Year, leaving out a balance of K£4, 965, 312. 00 unsettled as at 30th June, 1988- Sir, why should the Office of the President accumulate all those bills? Sir, each year we have a Budget and each Ministry is given sufficient money to run its affairs. Sir, even next Thursday. A Budget day and each Ministry will be given sufficient money to spend and to pay its bills. Why should we carry forward outstanding bills from one rear to another? Whom are we threatening? Sir, since each Ministry has its own vote, I cannot understand why some Ministries have been carrying forward their bills from 1986 up-to-date. </NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU (Ctd.):Sir, if any Ministry has got an out-standing debt, then we should vote more money so that it can settle the debt. </NEWSPEECH><HEADER>QUORUM</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Member, who is making some very good contributions, but unfortunately there is no quorum in the House. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Mr. SPEAKER: Yes, we do not have a quorum, Ring the Division Bill. </NEWSPEECH>(The Division Bell was rung)<NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: We have a quorum now. You may continue, Mr. Bidu. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank hon. Dr. Wameyo for raising the issue of quorum, because I would like every hon. Member to hear what I am saying about public funds. Sir, today, there is an outstanding balance ofK£4.9 million in the Office of the as President. If the Office of the President has such a big debt, the other Ministries may copy that bad example. Sir, I would like to request that while budgeting for the Office of the President during the next, Financial Year, we reduce that money	which is outstanding. I do not understand why such a big office can accumulate such a big debt, and yet we have some very qualified officers there. Sir, the Office of the President is a major office, and it should get to the other Ministries. Sir, if a Ministry spends all the money that was voted to it, and then it starts borrowing, then it is notBIDU (Ctd. ) :doing it is work properly. Sir, I sincerely hope that during the next Financial Year, Office of the president will make financial Year, the Office of the President will make SURE IT DOES NOT have any debts. It is a very shameful for such a big office to have debts.Sir, I would now like to turn to paragraph 53 and 54 which Provincial Administration District Cash Fund.MR. BIDU (CTD.): Paragraphs 53 Says:-“The Provincial Administration Districts Cash Funds Account indicates as at 30th June. 1983 fourteen District Treasures”(Hon. Semo crossed the Floor without bowing to the chair)MR. MAGOLI: On a Point of Order, Mr. Speaker Sir. Hon. Semo knows the rules of this House. But he has just failed to observe them strictly and I would like him to do now in future. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am on paragraph 53, on page“The provincial Administration Districts Cash fund Account indicate that as at 30th June, 1988 Fourteen District Treasures had exceeded their Cash Funds by a total of K£710,500 as at 30th June, 1988. It has been explained that the additional cash wash required to cater for increased demand as a result of implementation with a view resolving the problem The Committee heard the evidence given by the Accounting Officer and noted that out of K£710,500 outstanding an amount of K£580,500 has been cleared leaving a balance of K£30,000.The Committee therefore recommends that the .Accounting Officer should ensure that the outstanding amount is cleared forthwith."The word "forthwith" appears too many times in this Report. I cannot see why the Provincial Administration could spend this money without authority. We should tighten our regulations here and say that if anybody exceeds what has been allocated to him? He pays from his pocket the excess he has incurred. The Provincial Administration should be very strict with funds. A balance of £30,000 is still outstanding in this case, and this is a lot of money. Why was this case not taken to be a big offence? As you know, I am not an accountant, but I know that nobody should exceed whatever amount of money has been allocated to a certain vote unless he first getsMR. BIDU (CTD.)proper authority from the Treasury. So I wonder who authorised the Provincial Administration m this case to spend so much money. We should be very vigilant here because if we allow such things as this to happen, anybody can overspend under the pretext of the District Focus for Rural Development Strategy. We know that this strategy is there, but this does not mean that we should overspend. I would request the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance to be very strict here because it is due to such overspending as this that when we want to implement our projects in the provinces we are told that there are no funds. This is because certain people use public funds just the way they want.Let me now go to paragraphs 103 to 105, on page 48, which related to the Ministry of Health's pending bills. We always vote money for public health. I am sure that the Office of the vice- President and Ministry of Finance is always very careful when allocating funds to the Ministry of health, but we how see there are some pending bills here.Paragraph 103 Says:-	“The Ministry of Health records indicate that bills totalling to K.Shs.172, 262,646.00 which were due to payment by 30th June, 1988, were not so paid but were instead carried forward for payment in 1988/89 or later and this expenditure has therefore been excluded from the Appropriation Accounts for 1987/88. The records bills are not, however, up –to date as most of the returns from outstations and especially from the provinces are therefore that the figure of K.Shs.172.252.848.00 for the Development Vote, may have taken into account all the pending bills as at 30th June, 1988 further, because of the inadequacy of the records, it has not been possible to determine how much of 1987/88 and how much is in respect of 1986/87 and earlier years.”Paragraph 104says:-MR. BIDU (CTD.)“'The reason, giver, for the non-payment of the outstanding bills is lack of funds. Had they known expenditure of K£3,613.127-O8-00 been charged to the respective Votes? R. 11 and D. 11 for 1987£88 the Appropriation Account for vote R.11.would have ended with an Excess of K£S . 134, 797 -17 -20 instead of the net surplus to be surrendered to the Exchequer of K£1,739,174-00-00 now shown. Similarly, the Appropriation Account for vote D.11 would have reflected a net surplus to be surrendered to the Exchequer of KE3, 402,037-11-20 instead of, K£, 141, 193-00-00 now shown.You can now see what has happened in the case of the Ministry of Health. Every time we complain here about lack of drugs and other medical facilities, but every time we vote sufficient money for the Ministry in this august House. When we see that the Ministry has such pending bills, we wonder what the officers in this Ministry are doing and what the Ministry is doing about the officers who do not look after the amount of money allocated to the Ministry.MR.BIDU (CTD):Mr. Speaker, Sir you will find that we talk of cost-sharing when the Ministry of health has a lot money in the form of outstanding bills. How has that money come to accumulate to such large amounts? Appropriate action could have been taken 1988 but you will find that nothing has been done so far. The Ministry must ensure that there is proper supervision. If we had good supervisors these things would not have arisen at all. There is lack of proper supervision in the Ministry of Health. We cannot allow Government Ministries to go on having outstanding bills when we are always voting money for those Ministries every year. The state of hospitals all over the country is very poor. This is because the suppliers of drugs in our hospitals. If you do not pay the supplier, how do you expect him to supply you with the drugs? We should clear these debts completely. We should not talk of outstanding bills next year. I hope that we will not read about outstanding bill in next report of the public Accounts Committee.	Mr. Speaker, Sir, paragraph 123 of the Report reads as follows:“The records of the Ministry of local Government and Physical Planning indicate that bills and claims due for payment 1987/88 amounting to KShs.10,763,883.15 were not paid but were instead carried forward to 1968/89. Carrying over of these bills has the effect of misstating expenditure outturn as reflected in the Appropriation Accounts for the year to which the bills relate and adversely affects the provision for the following year.”“The Committee heard the evidence given by the Accounting Officer that the bills were not paid due to inadequacy of Exchange Issues and Government directives on control of expenditure during the fiscal year.”Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Ministry should be having a lot of money. This is a rich Ministry. This is rich Ministry. This is because it collects a lot of money from license and cess. Where does this money go?MR. BIDU (CTD.);	Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to the normal budgetary provisions, this Ministry collectors a lot of money in the form of cess, this Ministry collects a lot of money in the form of cess, the service charge and so on. Why is this Ministry unable to clear these pending bills. The Ministry has not paid pending bills which amount to over Kshs.10 million. The Ministry has not even been remitting its employees contributions to the National Social security funds. Where does that money? Why is the Ministry unable to clear these pending bills? I believe that here again the problem is lack of proper supervision. The Ministry should clear all these pending bills.Mr. Speaker, Sir you will find that roads in all the towns in this country are impassable; they are full of potholes. This is because the Ministry has not paid these pending bills. As results of this, it is not possible for the Ministry to get the materials it requires to repair these roads. So I would humbly request the Ministry to make sure that it pays all these pending bills without any further delayMr. Speaker, Sir, paragraph 126 – Arrears of revenue, reads as follows:“Concern has in the past been expressed over the deteriorating position of collection of revenue in respect Loan Redemption and Loan Interest Receipts and in respect of which arrears have been increasing year after year. The arrears situation determined further with the amount owning and in arrears standing at K£25,519,113.00 as at 2x 30th June 1988, as follows:Loan Redemption Receipts	K£7,314,587Loan Interest Receipts	K£18,204,526The Committee heard the evidence given by the Accounting Officer and deplored the continued deterioration of non-collection of revenue. The committee while nothing that efforts have been instituted to recover arrears due from local authorities directly from rates due to then recommends that a proper method should be instituted to answer that all arrears of revenue are recovered without further delay.”MR.BIDU (ctd.)Last year we had the same statement of arrears of revenue. This means that there is a lot of money lying idle somewhere... This happens because there is no follow-up on such issues. When we express 	our sentiments here and makes recommendations on what should be done, nobody bothers to take any action which is why every year we get such things. If these arrears of revenue had been collected then today we would be talking of a different thing or of a project that is going on somewhere in this country. But because there is nobody eager to ensure that every cent we have is well spent, we keep on landing into such problems. We must ensure that we collect all the arrears of revenue that are outstanding. It is my wish that the Public Accounts Committee will not have to deliberate and recommend on this same issue. We would like to see positive changes taking place and effective and responsible officers taking care of our money. Why can these people responsible for these arrears of revenue not be sued in court? Why should some people be allowed to have these arrears of revenue? We hope that this situation will change and all arrears of revenue collected so that we can utilise it where it is needed most.Mr. Speaker, Sir, on page 27, paragraph 128 - Statement of Outstanding Loans - it is stated as follows:-"In the report for 1986/87 mention was made of an amount of K£234,226 being balance of expenditure of K£2,455,080 which was incurred during 1985/86 and not accounted for in that year's Statement of Outstanding Loans. A further expenditure of K£6,458,076 incurred during 1986/87 and which was excluded from the Development Appropriation Account for Vote D.12 for that year was also excluded from the Statement of Outstanding Loans, bringing the total of the amount so excluded from the Statement of Outstanding Loans as at 3Cth June, 1987 to X£S,592,302. During 1987/38 a total of X£2,4-^3.143 which was spent during the year was excluded from the Ministry's Development Appropriation Account for 1987/88 and also from the Statement of Outstanding Loans bringing the total amount so left out of the accounts to K£9,140,445 as at 30th June, 1988."Does this mean that we do not have accountants, qualified officers in our offices supervisors who can manage our funds? Does this also mean that we do not have people who feel bad when such things happen? When we have such large amountsMR. BIDU ( Ctd.):Outstanding and nobody is bothering to collect them. Then we are not being serious in whatever we are doing. The people who are responsible Ibis for this are not being serious. How could they allow the outstanding amount to go to as high as to million? To make matters worse the people who were given these loans are well known to the officials and if that is so they should we have outstanding loans?So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is my sincere hope that there will be changes on such issues. We have to maintain the economy of this country and the only to do that is by being conscious of such things and ensure that we do not give any person a chance to misappropriate our funds.On page 89, paragraph 197 - Loss of Cash - it is stated as follows:-"During the year under review loss of cash amount to Kshs.100, 028.65 occurred at the Ministry Headquarters revenue collections office. The counterfoil receipt books and the Ministry's Revenue Cash Book indicate that collections totalling Kshs.34, 238, 094.00 were received between 29th December, 1987 and 30th June, 1988 while the Revenue Cashier surrendered only an amount of Kshs.34, 138, 020.35 to the main cashier thus retaining the balance of Kshs.100, 028.65. The fraud lasted about six months before it was detected and Revenue Cashier interdicted. Had the Revenue Cashier been checked daily by a responsible officer as should have been the case, the fraud would have been detected earlier and the loss minimized.While appreciating the action taken this officer, I hope in the long run he will be dismissed. But why did it take six months before this fraud was detected? Why should such a thing go as far as the headquarters before it is detected?MR.BIDU: (Ctd.)Mr. Speaker Sir, this is what I am saying that we should be careful when employing people. Although, it is sincere feeling that people must work. We must be careful. It is very serious for an amount of Kshs-100, 000.00 to be deducted after a period of six months, we hare auditors, supervisors, managers and so on and yet a thing like this is not detected until after six months. I feel that such officers should not only be interdicted––– </NEWSPEECH><HEADER>QUORUM</HEADER>NEWSPEECH>DR.WAMEYO: On a point of order, Sir. I am sorry there is no quorum in the House.

It should be noted 33 that the officers who supervise those offices must have a daily record of what is going on. It is surprising that it took- six months before it was discovered that there was loss of cash.I will now turn to page 94 Paragraph 205 which is about pending bills, under the Ministry of Culture and Social Services. It reads as follows:"Available records indicate that unpaid bills totalling - to K£4,113,508-7-15 chargeable to Vote R.18 were held by the Ministry s. as at 30th June, 1988.

The larger part of'-the outstanding bills, that is, K£3,051,271 —6-00 related to the 4th All African Games which took place in August 1987- Had the total amount of K£4, 113, 508-7-15 been paid during 1987/88, the Appropriation account for Vote R.18 would have ended with an excess of K£1,960,019 instead of the surplus to be surrendered to the Exchequer of K£2,153,489 now shown.In addition, although payment vouchers amounting to K£3.44O, 144-17-15 all relating to Vote D.18 were processed for payment as at 30th June. 1988, they were carried forward to 1988/89 financial year due to lack of funds- Of this figure, an amount of K£3,428.883-19-60 related to 1987/88 while the balance of K£11,260-17-55 related to 1986/87- Had the total expenditure of K£3,440,144-17-15 been charged to 1987/88, the Development Appropriation Account for D.18 for 1987/88, would have reflected as an excess vote of K£5, 311,658 instead of K£1.871,513 now shown. "HR. BIDU (Ctd.):Here again, we should not allow such a situation to arise whereas we have the sependings! It is our prime duty to make sure that the offices become much vigilant so that there is no penny which should he called pending! It is our prime duty in this august nou.se to make sure that the officers who are responsible are punished. We cannot allow these pending’. We “pend” up to when?Now, I go to paragraph 208 on page 95. This deals with computers. In the report for 1986/87, it says and I Quote:-“Reference was made to the lease to the lease of 50 units of Multi-Technical Mini Computers which were acquired by the Ministry at a cost of Ksh.15, 800, 000, 00 for use during the 4th All Africa Games. Although according to the Lease Agreement, the computers were to be handed over to the Government after the Games, they were not so handed over to the Government until 29th June, 1988, a period of about 10 1/2 months after the Gares. Further, although the contract provided for the leasing and eventual donation of 50 Multi-Technical mini computers, the equipment leased and eventually donated was 50 Micro ComputersIn addition, according to the information available some of the equipment handed over to the Government was found faulty but the supplier claim that the equipment may have got damaged during the Games.”We are talking of the computers lease, and of course, after the lease the computers would be given to the Government as donation” Now, one wonders, what happened when we have very competent officers in the Ministry of Culture and Social Services? I would like to be told what happened. We need these units of mini computers. It took more than 10 ½ months before they were given to the Government. If they gave them freely, they were forced to do so. So, one wonders what type of management this one was. We had so many committees during the 4th All Africa Games. We had many people who were selected and proved to be clever. But then the question is: How could it take more than 10 ½ months to do that? If they were forced, who forced them?MR. BIDU (Ctd.)Here, the Committee Says, and I Quote:-“ The Committee heard the evidence given by the accounting Officer and deplored the fact that by the Ministry received 50 units of Micro Computers of as donation instead of the 50 units of Multi- Technical Computers which had been leased at a cost of KSh. 15, 800,000,00.”The Committee was further concerned that the amount paid for leasing could have been that the amount paid for leasing could have been more than the real cost of computers.”Now, how long are we going to investigate something that took place in 1987? We are now in 1990 and there is no answer. In fact, the donation turned out be a different computer when the Ministry was to be given another computer. So, one wonders. If we can spend KSh. 15, 800, 000, 00 the Committee noted as follows.:”The Committee recommends that leasing of these computers should be looked by the probe Committee as recommended under paragraph 205”	This is quite true. But why should we wait until the Public Accounts Committee sits? Why should the Ministry of Culture and Social Services wait? Why did they not give a proper answer? Why did they not take these people to court? When we talk of public funds’, we are very much concerned. We do not want people to get money by unfair means. Time has now come that each Ministry should be looked into. We should make sure that those people charged with responsibility in those Ministries are capable and proper officers because proper officers because if we employ who have negative attitudes towards public funds, we are doing no good. That is my sincere request to the Ministry of Culture and Social Services. They should come out and see that they safeguard public funds. We should make sure that people who are brothers and who get employment through brotherhood they are the one's-who do not care about public funds.Now, I go to paragraph 209 on the same page 95. This concerns payment of allowances. It states and I quote:-MR. BIDU (Ctd ) :“After the 4th All Africa Games which took pIace from 1st to 12th August, 1987, the personnel who worked for the Games were paid allowances totalling to KSh.11, 268.790 .85. The relevant payment voucher indicate that the amounts were dram in the names of the Directors and Heads of various Games Committees and institutions, but large number of these vouchers are not supported by the payees.Consequently it has not been possible to confirm whether an amount of KSh. 8, 652 .63, 85 was properly paid to persons who were entitled to receive the payments.”This is where 1 would request this august House to recommend that a probe committee be formed to look into that issueHow can you pay somebody without a signature? How can you say that you paid the Directors9 There were so many people who were paid even if they were not workers. So I would requestMr. MALEEE: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. A Probe Committee was already appointed to look into that issue unless the Hon. Member has not read the recommendation of the Public Accounts Committee below.“The Committee heard the evidence given by the Accounting Officer and noted that a Probe committee was appointed to look into the financial and administrative affairs of the Games whose report has not been published”.Now, here is where is where we can go back and ask ourselves, this was in 1987. We had a whole year in 1958 and also in 1989. We are now in May 1990, almost going to 1991. How long does a Probe Committee take to verify a situation? How long does it take to come out with an answer? Wananchi are very eager to know where their money went Including myself and yourself. Everybody is eager to know their money wentMR. BIDU (CTD): Unless that probe committee was not properly organised—I am sorry if I offend anybody whoever is leading it should now cell kenyans where this money went. It is no use for us in this House to continue talking about a probe committee on a matter that took place in 1987. We have had very many probe committees in this country that have taken three or six months to complete their work. We are still talking of a probe committee long after Mr.Berg went back to America with our money or after he paid allowances through impersonation.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I hope this is the last time the Public Accounts Committee is making a recommendation of this kind. I hope that by next year we shall have heard the probe committee's recommendation; these who "ate" this money and how many of them will have been jailed. But I do not trunk it is proper to have a probe committee running for three years without getting even a clue from it. Whenever a proper committee is appointed in this country, we keep on reading about its progress in the newspapers, Why is this not the case with thus particular probe committee?I hope that next time a probe committee will be appointed to look the affairs of those games, or any other issue, hon. Members will be included in it, because they take public affairs seriously. I know there is belief that civil servants are knowledgeable and can tackle matters properly but we can now see that they failed us in the conduct of the 4th All Africa Games. Letter a probe committee was set up, regarding which the Report states"The Committee heard the evidence given by the Accounting Officer and. noted that a probe committee was appointed to look into the financial and administrative affairs of the games whose report had not been published".MR. BIDU (CTD):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, why can we not dissolve this committee and set up a Parliamentary Select Committee to probe those financial and administrative affairs of the games. We have competent accountants and other professionals in this House who can deal with anything. If we were set up such a Parliamentary probe committee, I am sure by next year many people will have been jailed for misappropriating funds during those games. The Accounting Officers who give evidence to the public accounts Committee are the same officers whom is appropriated the funds. The Committee should ensure that Accounting Officers do not give the same reasons every year. I wonder why we have not come up with a firm solution in the misuse of public funds. We represent 24 million Kenyans in this House and I am sure our feelings regarding misuse of public funds are the same as theirs. Every kenyan sacrificed in one way or another for the success of the 4th All Africa Games. So I do not see why should have “eaten” proceeds from those and be left alone for three years as if we do not know anything about it. I will urge that sometimes as done about the issue of payment of allowances. Paragraph 210 of the Report clearly that somebody made plane to steal. The Paragraph states:- "During the 4th All Africa Games various guests were accommodated in six schools, nine hotels and three education institutions on the instructions of the Games Accommodation Sub- Committee. The names of the specific guests accommodated in any one particular place only the number of guests and the period of stay were indicated.You can see that this was daylight "robbery", somebody somewhere who was entruted with the responsibility of administering those did not want it to be known which guests stayed in which placeMR. BIDU (CTD):and how much was paid for their accommodation. Although I agree that all Kenyans are "brothers, we cannot avoid taking to court those of our brothers who are thieves.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sorry that we are still talking about the 4th All African Games while this matter should have been dealt with a long time a. go. This is why I insist that in future hon. Members should be included in committees, or sub-committees, probing public affairs because they are the watchdogs of this country.MR. BIDU ( Ctd) :We are the watchdogs of this country. I am sure if hon. Chris Oaure and I were there. We would have said who the people sleeping in these rooms vote. But the officer's in charge of this accommodation were all united to defraud the Government up to now we do not know who were accommodated in these schools; and how much each was charged.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the paragraph continues to say: -"The names of the specific guests accommodated in any one particular place were not, however given, and instead only the number of guests and the period ox stay was indicated. The institutions also did not indicate in the invoices the names of the guests they had accommodated or the length of stay. According to available information, the institutions were paid a total of KShs.10, 276 , 812 for such accommodation".Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this was really a very organised robbery. I cannot know how the schools and institutions could not give the names of the guests who were accommodated by them. That was a very organised thing and we cannot keep quiet until we know what happened.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have very qualified and competent accountants and auditors in this country, and I am very sorry to say that the figures presented were neither accounted for nor audited. We had very qualified auditors participating in the All Africa Games financial control and, to my surpise, these anomalies were not detected. As a result, there was collusion between the institutions and the sub-committee.Sir, we are told here that accommodation charges alone paid to the schools amounted to KShs.5, 754, 600. We wonder whether the authorities governing these schools just prepared the bill without disclosing the names of the people who they accommodated. So, you can see that there was a very organised day robbery. The school authorities just presented invoices and were given the money for accommodation(The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Dr. Wameyo) left the Chair) (The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kagwima) took the Chair)Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for relieving my hon. friend.MR. BIDU ( Ctd.)Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, whereas accomodation charges for guests who were putting up hotels totalled to KShs. 1,817,420 institution and we do not know which ones amounted to KShs. 2,804,800 and charged for schools amounted to KShs. 5,754,500. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: Walikula mali ya Kenya bure! </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: The whole ox this public money was eaten without authority. The whole of this money was snatched from the poor tax-payer. Somebody big caused darkness somewhere so that he could eat the money without being seen. This is why I feel that something should be done. If we do not find a solution to this problem, we shall have more games organised in Kenya and we shall continue losing money. I am sure that since those people who stole the money are not being bothered by anybody they are still looking forward for other games to be organised here so that they can grab money. Whoever ate this money must be jailed and be made to pay. Why should you eat public money that has been collected from poor wananchi and yet you get a fat salary? A small man does not get any salary from anywhere. The time has come when we should not fear anybody. The people who misappropriate public funds should be mentioned publicly. Unless something is done, we shall still have problems in future because more events are being planned to take place in this country. It is the people who, initially, pretend that they are good and, in the end, they- misuse public funds. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have not heard of any big man being punished because of misappropriating public funds. We should ensure that these big people who commit such crimes are punished. I say so because when a common man steals KShs-2-00, he is dealt with through mob justice before he is imprisoned. Why is it that when a big man steals KShs.10 million nobody bothers? For how long shall we leave this situation to persist? We want equality because we are all equal before the law. If you steal, the best action to be taken against you is to be taken to court.Mr. BIDU (Ctd.) Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir we do not want to see such things in the public Accounts Committee Report for next year. When want to next year to those people who misappropriated public funds have fund taken to Nanyani Prison of other prisons. They should be found oak pad abound no matter who they are.Sir, while still on the sane subject of All Africa Games, I would like to draw the attention of hon. Members to paragraph 211, which says:-"In July, 1987, the protocol sub-committee received three quotations for the supply of decorative flowers to be delivered to selected venues during the Fourth All Africa Games and approved the quotation from one florist only. Although it is stated that the florist selected had quoted the lowest price, it has not been possible to confirm this assertion because the quotation documents are said to be untraceable and cannot, therefore, be produced for audit. The total amount so far paid to the florist stands at KShs.252, 700, with a further claim of KShs.175, 700".Is this not robbery? This is day-light robberyMR.BIDU (Ctd.):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, where on earth have you seen that system? Sir, the officer who approved that document should be dealt with. How can one approve a document without some supporting evidence? Even if one is not an accountant he should not sign anything which does not have some documentary evidence. Row come that that officer signed for that money without any documentary evidence? Sir, according to the Report, the document relating to the procurement of flowers had not been traced, and therefore, the Committee recommended that the accounting officer should intensify his efforts to trace that document. If that s document has been missing since 1987, what kind of effort were the Members of the Public Accounts Committee talking about. Sir, if I were a member of that Committee. I would had asked that accounting officer how he could have approved something q without any documentary evidence. My hon. Colleagues, should be able to see that mistake? After three years, somebody is told "Go and trace that document and bring it. Six for the first time, I am blaming the Committee. I think that Committee should also be dissolved; it is not doing any good work. How can you tell somebody to go and look for a document which has been missing for three years?Sir, through you, I would like to request that the Public Accounts Committee to be looked into. How can they tell somebody to go and look for a document which he has not been able to trace for three years? Will that man ever trace that document? Simply it is not there, he can only bring a false document, The Committee why should have a reprimanding voice Why should that Committee call the same person for threeMR. BIDU (Ctd. ) :	Consecutive year’s keeps on saying that he has not yet traced that document. Next year, the Committee will summon the same fellow. Sir, I would like to request the this august House to have a selective probe committee which can interview those people who are misusing public funds. Sir, now everybody is fighting the economy of this country. There are some sabotuers of our economy like this man who has not traced a document for three years. The Committee keeps on asking him to bring that document year after year. Sir, "there is no need of nursing anybody, we have to reprimand, I think the Committee should always have police nearby, so that such people can be taken away to answer charges immediately. We do not have to wait for years for a document to be produced.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, 1990 is a year of action, and therefore, I would like to request the Vice- President and Minister for Finance, when he will be replying, to say that such malpractices should be detected beforehand. We do not want any accounting officer who has misappropriated public funds to appear before the Public Accounts Committee. We want to hear that such an accounting officer is in Manyani Prisons eating beans. That will be a lesson to any other person who wants to misappropriate public funds. Sir, some senior officers in charge, of Ministries just sit in the offices. They do not go to the sites to do physical checking. They believe in seeing written documents and reports. Sir, I would like to request those senior officers to do periodical visits to certain offices. If a senior officer goes to the junior officers, he will know how the money was spent. The problem here is that the public offices have been left to the junior officers. They are theMR. BIDU (Ctd. ) :ones who are running the offices. That is why we are having these problems.Sir, I have gone through the Public Accounts Report of last year, and I have found out that the same accounting officers are called each year. The Committee then asks the accounting officers to go back to the Ministries and make sure that the mistakes are rectified. They tell them that such and-such a figure should be entered into the ledgers and so on. The Committee should not do that, but I instead it should ask police officers to sit in the Committee room, so that anybody who I appeared before the Committee last year, and has not improved ,on anything is taken away by the police. Whereas we are sympathising with the jobless people, we should also sympathise with those officers who are not serious with their duties. We would like the senior officers to carry out periodical visits to some areas in their Ministries. Some of the senior officers in Nairobi have never visited any office in the provinces. They just make calls there asking whether the s accounts are proper, but I am sure that anybody will say yes. Even if I were the one working in the provinces and I was asked by senior officer through telephone, how the accounts are, I would tell him that they are alright and up-to-date, although they have some mistakes. We should sack all dead woods. Anybody who does not have any control over public funds should be retiredMR. BIDU (CTD.)Sack them and let young people replace them: so that we do not continue to get such problems. Somebody somewhere was given money for flowers, end he now wants us to bring the documents concerned. When we ask for these documents, we are told that they cannot be traced In fact that man merits a death sentence, when a responsible officer says chat a certain important document is not traceable; he should really be––– </NEWSPEECH>	<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FLAMMING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Ogle): You have already said that. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I notice the habit of that Assistant Minister over there to interrupt other hon. Members. Through your Chair, I request you to tell him to listen.Let me now go to paragraph 212, on page 97. Which is on typesetting, printing and supplying of official programmes. My colleague hon. Members- should be happy because I studied this book, and this is why I am coming up with this contribution. I want to alert this august House as to where our public funds are being misappropriated.Paragraph 212 says:-"In July, 1337, quotations were received from six firms for typesetting, printing and supplying of the official programmes for the 4th All Africa Games. The firm which was awarded the tender at a contract sum of K.Shs. 65/= per copy of the programme supplied 14,000 copies of the programme and was paid K.Shs. 910,000/=. On 29th July, 1987, another firm wrote to the Ministry claiming that they had also been contracted by the firm which had been given a contract to market the games to print 20,000 copies of the programme for K.Shs. 1, 425, 000/= . The Ministry apparently also accepted this claim and the company printed all the 20,000 copies of the official programme and were paid a total of K.Shs. 1,425,000/=. When authorizing the payment. Treasury stated that the contract documents for this firm were being processed for countersignature. Up to now, however, no contract documents have been seen to support the payment of K.Shs.1, 425, 000/=."MR. BIDU (CTD.):<NEWSPEECH>HON. MEMBERS: Shame! Shame! </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, are we nursing these people? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>AN HON. MEMBER: we seem to be. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Is the Minister for Culture and Social Services aware that this amount of money was misappropriated? Does he also know that there are some officers who are so careless that they do not care about any documentary evidence?From 1987 to 1990 is a very long period, and yet no supporting document has been seen whereas payment has already been made. Whereas I praise the office of Vice-President and Ministry of Finance, I want to say that it should also be very vigilant. This happened in 1997 and we are now in 1990: so we are talking about impossibilities which have now become possibilities. Somebody has misused Shs.1.4 million, and the Public Accounts Committee accepted this. This is why I am saying that we should get rid of the Public Accounts Committee and form a proper committee to look into these matters. However, let us near what the Public Accounts Committee says in this case.“The Committee heard the evidence given by the Accounting  officer that the payment of K.Shs. 1,425,000.00 was made through Treasury Authority though the document supposed to have been counter signed by Treasury had not been available for audit.The Committee therefore recommends that this document should be submitted for audit without further delay.”After three years, the public Accounts Committee is taking this Accounting Officer to submit a certain document without further delay! Are we being fair to our country, the Government and the ordinary mwananchi? Are we being fair to the tax- prayer? Here is a committee of my learned friends saying very amicably:-MR. BIDU (CTD.)	"The Committee therefore recommends that this document should be submitted for audit without further delay."What further delay are these people talking about after three years? Are we being fair with our English dictionaries" Are we serious? Somebody spent over Shs.1 million, and then his Accounting Officer came here to represent him; To make matters worse, we pay hon. Members of the Public Accounts Committee sitting allowances for the work they do here, but they seem to be nursing this Accounting Officer. I want to re-read this portion again because I want all Kenyans to hear it."The Committee therefore recommends that this document should be submitted for audit without further delay."We should be serious in deliberating on matters that concern this country because these are the things that are ruining the economy of our country. We are retarding our own development by allowing such things to happen and. by doing so, we are sabotaging the economy of the country. Why should we allow such loopholes to continue to exist for three years, from 1937 to 1SS0? Next year, the same Accounting Officer will be called to Parliament again and asked the same question.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. We need very active officers who are committed to their duties. We must make sure that wherever we are appointed to take up responsibilities, these responsibilities remain ours and become part and parcel of us. I know that we may be taking this as a joke here, but it is very painful to discover that somebody spent Shs.1 million without any documentary evidence and the case was accepted. We should be more active than this. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Could the hon. Member substantiate that we areMR. MALEBE (CTD.):taking what he is saying as a joke? I think we are considering this Report very seriously, but he says that we are taking it as a joke. Could he substantiate his claim?<NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I doubt whether hon. Malebi understands my English. When I say we are not serious it is the Committee I am talking about and not the house. You should know how to express yourself idiomatically. I think my hon. friend never went to school. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.MALEBI: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary-Deputy Speaker, Sir. Could the hon. Member on the Floor be specific enough? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir Hon. Malebi is making things worse, I will bring him the Collins Dictionary so that he can go through it u have pointed out that Accounts Committee should take its work more seriously. They should even ask for assistance when they are interviewing people We cannot interview people and nurse then at the same tine Accounting Officer: are responsible officers and they should take their work more seriously. </NEWSPEECH>Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker; Sir, paragraph 217 on page 93 of this cook reads as follows:"In the Report for 1984/85 reference was made to a contract entered into between the Ministry of Culture and Social. Services and a Security Guards Company for provision of eight security guards at KShs. 1,000.00 per guard per month with effect from 16th July, 1982, without proper authority. Reference was also made to stolen items worth KShs.650,000.00 as at January, 1984, for which no claim had been submitted to the Security Company in terms of the Contract, when granting post-facto authority for the employment of the guards, Treasury asked the Ministry to make efforts to recover the loss from the security firm. Although an audit request for an indication of action taken by the ministry with a view to recovering the loss as requested by the Treasury was made in November, 1986–––“<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. As I Would not like to interrupt the hon. Member who is very good friend of mine. Is he in order to continue reading the whole book for us? We have already read this book and if the hon. Member intends to read every paragraph in this House then he will speak for one week. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: MR. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir that is not my mistake. The hon. Assistant Minister has just come into the Chamber. It appears that he has not read this Report. We are seriously discussing the Report of the Public Accounts Committee. The ordinary wananchi do not have these books. The Assistant Minister in order to interrupt me, when I am talking on this very important issue? Please, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir tell hon. Karauri to go and road this book! </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION: (Mr. Zarauri) On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have already road the Report and the hon. Member should not read out every paragraph to us. That is why I am completing. And in any case this Report is a public documentary wananchi, who want to read the book can have it. So the Hon. Member is not right when he says that wananchi do not have the Report. </NEWSPEECH>	<NEWSPEECH>MR.BIDU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, these books have been made available to us in order to enable us to make reference to certain portions of the Report while making constructions. Even courts of law you are allowed to refer to documents. I do not know where that Assistant Minister got that idea. From that I am reading the entire book. I am just referring to specific to specific paragraph. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Order! Hon. Members are allowed to quote certain portions of this Report or any other document. But it is also not good to read the entire book paragraph by paragraph. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Mr. Bidu: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Although I do not wish to challenge your ruling, I would like to state here that I have not been reading the whole book but that I have been quoting specific paragraph. I am not reading everything. I am just making reference to certain portion of the Report unless somebody has a motive behind interrupting me. I can see hon. Karauri smiling and that indicates that he agree with me. I have been referring that he agrees with me. I have been referring to paragraph 217 regarding the loss of property at Kasarani Sports Complex. It appears that property can disappear without trace. There must have been an agreement signed between the Security Company and the Ministry of Culture and social Services. But you will find that nothing has been done to recover this loss from the security firm since 1934. What action did the Ministry take to recover this loss from the security firm? I would like to request the Ministry to be more vigilant than ever before. This is because we do not want to be discussing this matter in the House every year. </NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH>Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Paragraph 220 reads as follows:MR.BIDU (CTD.):"In the reports for the previous five years, reference was made to grants issued to various self-help projects without the approval of the National Social Development Committee. During the year, under review, grants totalling KShs.295.000.00 .were paid iron a provison of J5hs;4 million without the approval of the : National Social Development Committee. In addition and as in the previous years, the Committee which met in November, 1937, also approved a proposal to retain E5hs.300, 000.00 at the Headquarters as reserve Fund without setting the criteria under whirr, the projects to benefit from the fund were to be identified or selected.”So, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, you can see here that there was no proper financial control. People did what they did with the proper authority, We must safeguard public funds.MR. BIDU (Ctd.):All that I have been saying has been heard. Since the Budget day is only on 7th June, 1990, I am sure that all the Ministries have prepared their budgets and know the amount of money they will be requiring for the next financial year. I would like to suggest and request that if a Ministry has any outstanding amount it should, be deducted from its budget allocation. We would also like to request the Treasury to have tighter checks and balances to ensure that funds are not misused. If an officer has been asked to account for certain sum of money within three months and he falls to do so, they should take the appropriate action against the officer. We must ensure that public funds are not worth.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Every year we got offices mentioned in the Report who have misappropriated public funds. My main concern here is on the small people who are suffering more than the other people. This is because you will find a mere clerical officer being interdicted for failing to account for shs.10.00 yet we have senior officers in Job Group "M" like Permanent Secretaries, directors of departments who fail to account for imprests. The junior officers fail to take any action because they fear these senior officers. What is the use of being a senior officer when you do not behave and act like one? </NEWSPEECH><HEADER>QUORUM</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The House has no quorum. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): You are right, Dr. Warneyo, we do not have a quorum. Ring the Division Bell. </NEWSPEECH>(The Division Bell was rung)<NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwi.ua): We have a quorum now. You may continue, Mr. Bidu. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: With those long remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like to make a few observation on this Motion. Since I do not want to bore myDR. WAMEYO (Ctd.):colleagues, I will concentrate rats on the Ministry of Health which I know better than any other Ministry. This Ministry is embarrassing all hon. Members. As I have mentioned before in this House, even when I have been asked to substantiate, the issue of drugs in hospitals is very serious because we lack drugs there.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, although the Public Accounts Committee did not touch very much on drugs, on page 47, paragraph 106 - Irregular Award of Contracts the comments there show clearly what is going on in that Ministry. What has been pointed out there is also still going despite the fact that the public Accounts Committee from time to time has pointed out these failings. In fact, to be no changes being made by officials of this Ministry. That paragraph states as follows:-"During 1987/88, a number of irregularities relating to the award of contracts were noted among them being:(a) Absolute Ethyl Alcohol (Ethenol) ARThe Medical Stores Co-ordinating Unit recommended to the Central Tender Board that the fifth lowest tenderer be awarded to supply 500 x 2.5 litre packs of the item at the price of Kshs.625.00 per 2.5 litre pack and the Central Tender Board approved the award of the tender to the firm at that price. The firm/recommended for the award of the contract on the basis that they had submitted an acceptable sample of the item. The tender documents, however, indicate that the firm, as well as all the other firms which had tendered for the item, did not submit an acceptable sample with its tender documents. It is not. Therefore, clear on what other basis the medical Stores Co-ordinating Unit recommended the Central Tender Board that this firm, which had not clearly submitted an acceptable sample, be awarded the contract in preference to the other tenderers who had quoted lower prices. If the tender had been awarded to the lowest tenderer, at Kshs. 171.92 per 2.5 litre pack, the Government would have saved Kshs. 225,540,00."This is a thing that is recurring in the Ministry of Health and the Public Accounts Committee is forced to keep on bringing it to the attention of this House. The question here is: Why does the Government allow the Ministry of Health to continue doing this sort of thing despite the fact that the Government is short of funds?DR. WANSY0 (ctd):The papers I laid, here the other day showed that if the Ministry had awarded the tender to the lowest tenderer, over Kshs. 7 million would have been saved. Unfortunately, this thing keeps on occurring in every Report of the Public Accounts Committee. The question is why does the Ministry or the Government take action? Who are the people involved? The Committee recommended that the officers responsible be surcharged a token sum of i-Ishs. 5,000.00 each. I have never known whether that actually happens, what has happened is that this state of affairs has continued, the Government has spent too much money and our hospitals have ended with no drugs.For example patients go to hospital and are given prescriptions but they cannot get the drugs in the hospital pharmacies. If they have relatives who can afford, then they will buy them the drags from private chemists. I have an example of patients who went to the Cast General Hospital and I put this Question to the Minister some time back - on 31st May, 1990 and was given a prescription for Crystaline Peniciline and Gentamycin out; they were not available at the hospital pharmacy. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER ERALTE (Mr. Ogur) : On a point of order, Sir. It is not my intention to interfere with the contribution of the hon. Member out the two drags which are said to be unavailable at the Coast General Hospital have not been brought to the attention of my Ministry. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: Sir, I have not understood what the hon. Assistant Ministries saying but I have the prescription and I had to buy that medicine for a patient who comes from Butere Constituency. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MDUSTHR FOR HEALTH (Mr. 0gar): On a point of order, Sir. If Hr. Vianeyc, who is a medical doctor, had prescribed a particular drug for his patient and which was not available as at 31st of May at the Coast General Hospital, he should have prescribed an alternative drug. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: Sir, I do not know what the Assistant minister is talking about and he should he ruled out of order. It is the doctors at the Coast General Hospital who prescribed the medicine and it is they who should knew the alternative. If they did not have an alternative drug and the patient came to me with that problem. I had no choice but to assist by prescribing the same Gentamycine to be bought on my account. That was in the interest of the patient.The question still regains to the effect that why does the Ministry of Health continue giving tenders to k people who have offered the highest prices as is indicated in this Report? With due respect, the Government is finding it difficult to get adequate finances due to the expansion of the services that are required in the Republic. Why do the officers under the Ministry of Health not accept the idea that they should always offer tenders to the lowest tenderers? Why should they always award tenders to the highest tenderers thus mailing the Government to overspend and even after they have been criticised they continue doing the same? This Batter is contained in the Public Accounts Committee Report of 1986/87 and it is also raised in the current Report of 1987/88 and I believe it may recur in the Report of 1988/89.Under paragraph 107 pages 48, we note that the Ministry paid for goods worth Kshs.60,000.00 to a first based in Kisurra which purported to supply 1,000 metres of white cloth material for nurses uniforms at the Provincial General Hospital which I presume to be Kisumu. Although stores records indicate that 100 metres were taken on charge on 24th September. 1987; no such material had been received and the entire consignment had not been delivered by January, 1988.Why should a Ministry with such efficient and highly educated individuals pay for material that have not been received? In any case why should the officials in the Ministry not take action against the officers concerned? There is evidence that an auditor who discovered these anomalies in the Ministry of Health was eventually transferred, Way transferDR. WAMEYO (Ctd) :an officer who is discovering fraud in the Ministry? This is a very serious matter and as a result the Ministry is not giving the people the services that they require. All these is due to sheer wastage of funds. I am merely repeating what the previous speaker said but I am concentrating on the Ministry of Health.I will turn to paragraph 109 which is about the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NEIF) - There are something very strange about this Fund. This Fund was established to assist patients meet hospital bills in certain private hospitals and those who use certain amenities in Government that are paid for. Even in this House, there are hon. Members who contribute to the NEIF unfortunately, if you check the records, you will find a card for those contributing members. This is happening in many Ministries, what is happening is that when a person becomes sick and is admitted in a private hospital, when h he goes to look for his NEIF card from his employer, he does not find it and yet money is paid to the Fund every month, since the person was employed. I believe that action will be taker, to rectify this situation so that whoever contributes to the Fund has a card in the relevant department. If the card is not available, where does the money go? I deal with patients and I know these things.For example, I know of a patient who cam e to Mombasa whose husband has worked with the City Commission for many years out he did not have the NEIF card, when he was eventually given the card, the period had expired and he had to go and do the claims himself. Where does the money go if those cards cannot be traced? Someone may come up and give an explanation on this very serious matter out Members of Parliament should make sure that there cards are actually here so that when they become sick , it would be easy for their relatives to collect the card.. If that card is not there, the department involved must explain where they have been taking the money.DR.WAMEYO (Ctd):	Sir, I am using this opportunity to highlight the fact that the issue of drugs and the procurement of equipment is a very serious matter According to the Report of I986/87, the Ministry of Health purchase X-ray equipment in 1931 for Kakamega, Nyeri and Nakuru Provincial General Hospital and up to 1987 equipment in Nyeri and Kakamega had not been installed.I am sure it is already obsolete. Why was it bought? The equipment for Nakuru was installed in 1984 or 1988 while the others had not.DR. WAMEYO (Ctd.):We have very serious problems with the Ministry of Health and I am appealing to the Ministry officials that they have let not the Party down by not providing as required and also by offering tenders to the highest bidders. It is not public auction. If was public auction, I could understand, but this is providing a service. As of now, for patients to get even operating treatment it is very difficult and it is important that the Ministry of Health addresses itself to the situation whereby drugs become available to the hospitals to provide treatment to patients. Also, to provide beds and blankets to patients and also food to patients. Some time ago I was parsing through Eldoret hospital and there were old men with fractures, and the standard way of reducing a fracture is by using a Thomas Link (?). In Eldoret Hospital throughout the Surgical Ward there is not a single Thomas Link (?). The oldman, poor chap, by the time he leaves the hospital and the fracture is healed the knee will be stiff. She availability of this equipment* in the hospitals has be cone difficult "because of these problems of people being no longer accountable.The other day the Ministry of Health was holding a big seminar on medical ethics. But what happened to the ethics? Even people in Government hospitals are being charged money, and when they have been arrested, nothing happens. In the past in the Ministry of Health and when hon. Kyalo was Permanent Secretary, if a person was found having done a mistake and v/as charged in court and the court acquitted him on technicalities the Ministry of Health still took action on him because he had been found that he actually aid it. The Ministry took action and interdicted the fellow and even in one case the fellow was sacked. But here, people have been caught ready-handed in hospitals taking moneyDR. WAMEYO (Ctd.):from patients so as to operate on them. When they have not been prosecuted because of interference from too many quarters, still no action is taken against them. If police gives a patient money - if a doctor wants money, all right there is money - and the patient gives the doctor and the police arrests the doctor and then on technicalities and interference, the doctor is not charge in court; why does the Minis try not take action against him because it is unethical and a breach of rules? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr.Ogur): On a point of order. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The hon. Member, Dr. Wameyo knows very well that there cannot be a doctor to receive money in form of bribes from patients or people and police are aware of that and yet that doctor goes scot free. It just cannot happen and that is an allegation that is unfounded. It is not true and Dr. Wameyo knows that. No policeman today in Kenya can leave alone a doctor who has taken a bribe from people and leave him to continue working. Even if Dr. Wameyo himself does that today he will be arrested. So, his allegation was untrue. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir, my friend is interfering with me a great deal, why does he not talk about the KSh.60,000.00 which was paid to a firm based in Kisumu to supply uniforms and no uniforms has been supplied up to date : </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr.Kagwima) Dr. Wameyo I think we should hear of one case which about where somebody attending to patents received money and the police saw him and no action was taken against the person. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, I think I have been quoted wrongly. I said that a patient at the Coast General Hospital, Mombasa, was asked to pay KSh.3, 000.00 to have an operation in a Government hospital. The patient was very bright. He went to the Central Police Station in MombasaDR. WAMEYO (Ctd.):and was given ESh.3,000.00 treated money by the police. The patient gave the money to the doctor and the doctor was picked up by the police. He was locked up in the Central Police Station Mombasa for three days. But the Ministry of Health gave him leave to go to India I This is obvious. Let me carry on with my contribution. I do not want interference from the hon. Member, because I have information. I will come here with a file if he insists.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to enough appeal to the Ministry of Health to provide enough drugs and equipment to hospitals and to make sure that drags that are in hospitals are available to patients. There is a bill and the Public Accounts Committee has mentioned about a big amount of money which Kakamega Hospital and Kisumu the bills have not been paid. Now, if the bills have been accumulating since 1982/83 and here every year we pass the Budget, Why are those bills being brought forward and not being paid for? There must be something fumy here. Either there are no bills because the Public Accounts Committee is complaining that the documents were not seen, and if the bills were genuine, why are they not being settled? Why are they being brought forward year after year? There is something wary fishy here and I call upon the Ministry of Health to provide service to the people.My comments are confined to the Ministry of Health. At the moment, drugs are unavailable and also why the highest tenderers not are/being offered the tender to supply and no action is being taken against individuals and people in turn suffer? This is something that the Ministry should go into. Otherwise, as my friend said, we will also move a Motion here for a Select Committee to find out what the problem is with the ministry of Health. Thank you very much. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER: (Mr. Kagwima): Hon. Members, since no other hon. Member wishes to speak, I wall call upon the  Assist Minister Hon. Keah, to reply. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir for giving me this opportunity to reply to hon. Members comments before the Hover comes to make his final submissions.In the outset I wish to acknowledge the very valuable contributions and comments that have been made by hon. Members with, respect to the Report of the Public Accounts Committee for the year 1987/88. I would like to say that here that unfortunately a lot of the comments that have made appear to be one—sided. This is because for every audit query that has been raised there has been a corresponding comment on what action has been taken. Be that as it may. I would like to make reference to very specific major areas that have been touched on virtually by all the hon. Members who spoke.One of the issues that has been raised by hon. Members relates to tie submission of incorrect accounts and unbalanced statements of assets and liabilities., I would like to ask hon. Members to bear with me because I would like to explain in some detail the procedures involved and what action is usually- taken when this happens. I wish to state here that Section lo of the Exchequer and Audit Act Revised edition. 1980, stipulates that each Accounting Officer in respect of the Votes and the monies for which he is responsible will prepare an appropriation account showing the services for which money is expended were voted, the sums actually expended on each service and the appropriation shall be signed personally by the Accounting Officer. This is rule and the exact procedure that should be adopted. Where, therefore,THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah) (CTD):Accounting Officers do not this regulation; definitely they are at fault.In addition to the appropriation of account a statement of assets and liabilities as at 30th June each year in respect of the current Vote, the Development Vote and Funds and Deposits must also he prepared and signed by the head of the accounting unit of the Ministry or department concerned and be submitted together with the appropriation account to the Controller and Auditor-General on or before the 31st October of each year for audit purposes. This is the accounting procedure and control mechanism for the finances of this Republic.Coupled with the requirements of the said Act, the Treasury issues annual Treasury circulars to all Accounting Officers on the procedures to be followed the preparation the appropriation account and the statements of assets and liabilities, which every Accounting Officer is expected to follow. Sir, you can see that there are clear- instructions in accounting matters.The Treasury has also undertaken to improve accounting standards and performance of accounting staff by training accounting personnel locality and abroad; we have trained them professionally: we have also: organised workshops for heads of accounting units: having enforcement of internal audit in every ministry and department; the use of microcomputers in the preparation of appropriation accounts and other statements. I am going into these details to show what measures the Treasury has taker in an attempt to improve on the mechanisms, control and standards in accounting procedures. We also have the involvement of the office of the head ofTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah) (CTD):accountancy Services in monitoring and offering guidance where necessary on the preparation of the appropriation accounts and other statements and in ensuring that the monthly computer ledgers and trial balances are produced promptly and not later than the21st of the month following. The problem would, therefore, appear to stem from the failure by the individual accounting officers to follow the requirements of the Act and instructions as per the treasury circulars and financial orders.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir, I would also wish to add here that it is the responsibility:- of each Accounting Officer to ensure that proper and accurate appropriation account and statements of assets and liabilities are submitted to the Controller and Auditor-General; this is not the responsibility of the Treasury I should, however, add and emphasise here that it should be noted that four Accounting Officers out of 34 Accounting Officers submitted unbalanced statements of assets and liabilities. He should; therefore not condemn all the Accounting Officers wholesale. The Treasury has since undertaken corrective measures by posting more experienced officers as heads of accounting units to the four Ministries involved, I hope that hon. Members will be satisfied with on taken by the Treasury, A second point of major concern is the expenditure control relating to excess votes and pending bills. The excess vote a to £7, 603, 519-15-05 in the 1987/88 accounts report that we discussing. The control of funds expended on each Vote is clearly outlined in the Financial Orders. But additionally the regulations stipulated in the Financial Orders are regularly supplemented by the Treasury circulars; for example Treasury circular No.1 of THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah) (CTD):4th February, 1932 and No.5 8th April, 1938. All these are still operative and. are the guiding principles to be followed by the Accounting Officers.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would wish to point out that whenever an Accounting Officer has spent more than the total budgetary provisions granted, it is his responsibility to make an. application for the en-cess vote to Parliament and not to the Treasury. This is a grave responsibility; he has to apply to this Parliament because it is the one which allocated I for the ministry. If he therefore exceeds his approved budgetary prevision the onus to apply to this august house for--the "excess vote is on the Accounting Officer.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah) (ctd.):This august House may consider to allow or disallow the excess vote depending on the circumstances leading to the excess. It should also be noted here that through stringent expenditure control measures instituted by the Treasury, the level of excess votes dropped from K£18,754,411-19-45 for 1986/87 to only K£7,603,619-15-50 for the year 1987/88 under review. The Treasury is still determined to ensure that in future excess votes are reduced to an absolute minimal or nothing.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in so far as pending bills are concerned, hon. Members noted quite rightly that the pending bills amounting to K£82,705,957-07-15 for the Ministries were carried fox-ward during the 1987/88 Financial Year to 1988/89. Towards the end of the third quarter of the year 1987/88, the Government was facing some severe budgetary constraints, mainly due to the current account deficit caused by the balance of payments and an additional expenditure which had been incurred during the financial year on high-priority national services and activities. In order to overcome the resultant liquidity problem, accounting officers were directed to reduce their expenditure on the Recurrent Vote and on all Government financed development projects. The issues from the Exchequer therefore, were also strictly controlled so that these accounting officers who did not fully implement the Treasury directive ended up with pending bills. I am explaining the background with regard to the pending bill's issue. It would, therefore, appear that……. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWENJE: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think what the hon. Assistant Minister is saying is a bit misleading, particularly when he says that an accounting officer is directly responsible to Parliament because accounting officers do not come here. I thought that an accounting officer would be responsible to the Treasury and then the Minister would be accountable to this House. Can the Assistant Minister clarify to how an accounting officer becomes accountable to Parliament? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR FINANCE (Mr. Keah): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I quoted the provisions of the relevant Act. Each Ministry is given individual Vote, and it is the accounting officer of each Ministry who is accountable to Parliament. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWENJE: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the Assistant Minister is not telling us how an accounting officer becomes accountable to this House when, in fact, accounting officers do not appear- in this House. I thought that since the money .is released by the Treasury, it is the Ministers who are accountable to this House and who should, in turn, punish accounting officers who incur excess votes. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND ministry OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am quoting the law. I started by saying that the Act provides. If hon. Mwenje wants to change the Act, then he is by all means free to make his proposals. The Act clearly stipulates that each accounting officer is responsible to this House for any excess he may incur. That still stands as the law, and I do not think. I can do any better than referring the hon. Member to the Act. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagw.ima): Despite that condition of the law accounting officers are responsible to their respective Ministers and the Ministers report to the House. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANR MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Perhaps I may continue if my hon. colleague is happy with that. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWENJE: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Taking your ruling into consideration and also what the Act. Says, could the Assistant Mininster coats up with an amendment to the Act? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will jump that one. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Sir, I did give the background as to why there were particular pending bills with respect to the year 1937/38. Which were primary as a result of expenditure?THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah) (ctd.):having to be incurred on more priority items. It would, therefore, appear that those accounting officers who ended up with huge amounts of pending bills were those who deliberately ignored Treasury circulars or directives which, had they adhered to the issue of pending bills would not have arisen at all.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the next point related to the failure to collect revenue. Hon. Members were certainly concerned, and rightly so, with the huge sums of money reflected as arrears in Customs and Excise duties, Income tax and other taxes in the report. I would like to observe here that virtually every hon. Member who spoke did touch on this aspect and expressed their concern. In so far as the Customs and Excise duty is concerned, in the past the Ministry of Commerce was required to deduct some excise duty from payments due to sugar manufacturers before paying for the sugar supplied. This method was, in fact, found unsuitable and, currently, the Customs and Excise duty in respect of sugar are being collected at source by Custom and resident officers who also update the records. The arrears resorted upon are mostly result of the penalties on the earlier amounts. The Government is charging some 2 per cent on all outstanding amounts.In so far an Income tax is concerned, Sir, the outstanding amounts e due to (a) inclusion in the statement of arrears amounts .relating to disputed assessments. (b) Inclusion in the statement of assessments collectable after 30th June, 1983 and, (c) too much paper work involved which has also made it not very possible to give accurate amounts due to arrears. These problems are soon to be overcome, I hope, as soon as the computerization programme of the Income Tax Department operations is finalised. So, we are moving towards computerization and I am hoping that these problems will be minimized soon.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in so far as other taxes are concerned, the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation is the main debtor as regards the telecommunications, tax which they collect on bah elf of the Government. To solveTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah)(ctd.):the problem, the Treasury and the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation have appointed a task force for reconciling the telephone accounts. As soon as the exercise is complete, the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications will issue a cheque to the Treasury. So, work is at progress in so far as that aspect is concerned.There is a fourth point which, of course, was a major concern among hon. Members, and this relates to the overdrawing of the Paymasters General AccountTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah) (ctd-):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is true that the Paymaster General Account has been overdraw, for the last four years. That situation has arisen as a result of uncleared excess votes and Exchequers under issues for previous years. The two factors have contributed considerably to the increase on the overdrafts. As and when Parliament approves the outstanding excess votes, funds will be released by Ex-chequers to clear them up. Sir, efforts are also being made by the Treasury to clear the Exchequers under issues, we are also monitoring the cash positions of all the Ministries on weekly basis, in order to ensure that they do not overdraw their accounts without the written consent and authority of the Treasury, The accounting officers were not allowed to overdraw their accounts with the Paymaster General Account, without prior authority from the Treasury, Most of the recurrent and development votes which were overdrawn as at 30th June, 1983 were either fully or partly covered by the Treasury at authority.I would now like to turn to the fifth point which relates to the control of imprests. Hon. Members were concerned with the continued non recovery of imprest issued to Government officers Sir, the Treasury has issued very clear adequate instruction in its circular No. 3 of 18th, April,, 1933 which still operative, regarding- the control of imprests; and in which the following issues were clearly covered.1. Conditions under which imprests are to be issued — are clearly stated.2. The period, within which the imprest must be account for.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah) (ctd.):3. The actions which the accounting officers must take against imprest defaulters.Sir, the internal auditors are also being used in monitoring flouting of the Treasury instructions, regarding imprests by accounting officers. Therefore, the Treasury has taken clear steps in order to ensure that the accounting officers do not flout the rules. But, as I have always said here, taking the-horse to-the well- is-one thing, and making it drink the water is another. I hope that as I say these words all accounting officers are taking heed.Sir, the sixth point relates to the control of expenditure. Hon. Members were also concerned with the taxed expenditure control by accounting officers resulting to excess rotes. The Treasury has introduced measures on control of expenditure, and which accounting officers are required to adhere to- In addition, .the Treasury Circular No. of April, 1988, on control of Government expenditure, required accounting officers to strictly enforce the measures stated therein. Therefore, the expenditure control is in the hands of the accounting officers.Sir, as concerns Government investments, hon. Members assumed that there was no firm policy regarding Government with investments particular reference to companies which have failed to pay dividends and which have either wound up or are under receivership.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah) (Ctd.):It should be noted that the Government has established policies on ail its investments, and these policies are usually updated from rime" re time. These investment policies have been issued through various documents, such as the State Corporations Act, cap. 446 of 1988, Sessional Papers, such as No. 1 of 1986 on Economic Management for Renewed Growth, and various Treasury- circulars. As for companies that failed to pay dividends, they did not make profits, in which case, they could not pay dividends. Examples of such companies are the Kenya Industrial Estates and the East African Sugar Industries. Certain companies do not pay dividends due to operational problems, and these include the uplands Bacon Factory Ltd or being under receivership such, as was the case Kenya fluosparal Company and Kenya Fluosparal Company Ltd. As for those companies that have been would up or under receivership the Government like any other is creditor, will have to follow the in law in the recovery of its invested funds. It is expected that in the case of companies that have been wound up and their assets sold, the sales proceeds will be divided among the creditors concerned, including the Government.Another issue that was raised was delays in implementing the recommendation of the public Accounts Committee. Hon. Members wanted to know what machinery is applied to ensure the implementation of these recommendations and how effective it is. The procedure regarding the implementation of public Accounts committee recommendation is that as soon as the Committee Report is adopted by this House, the Treasury sends out a circular to all Accounting Officers, that is Permanent Secretaries; requiring them to take action on the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee and gives them a deadline by which they should advise the TreasuryTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AMD MINISTRY OF FIMAMCE (Mr. Keah.M Ctd.):of the action they have taken to implement those recommendations. Thereafter, the Treasury prepares a Treasury memorandum which is submitted to the National Assembly. This memorandum is actually attached to this particular document in respect of 1987/88. The Treasury is in constant pursuit of those Accounting Officers who nave not implemented fully the recommendations.Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Si r, the other issue that was raised here and which I have not touched upon is the 4th All- Africa Games. As for this one, there is a probe committee and until we receive its report, we would rather wait for the report to be made public before we go into it or else we would be pre-empting the committee’s recommendations. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.

DEPUTY SPEAKER: Nobody here from the Ministry of Water Development? Mr. Falana’s Question.Question No. 192Waiver of Gate Pees For Badassa and Songa Game ParksMR. FALANA asked the Minister for Tourism and wildlife whether he could consider waiving the gate fees currently being paid, by the local people who live in Badassa and Songa and have to use the gate to and from Marsabit Town on a daily basis. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILDLIFE (Mr. Awori):Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.People who live in Badassa and Songa areas and who have to pass through the Game Park when going to and iron the market are not required to pay any fees whatsoever. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. FALANA: Mr, Deputy Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for his reply, I would like to say that what the Assistant Minister has told the House is completely different from What is actually happening in that area. Farmers -, who go to their shambas have to pass through a particular stretch of the Game Park. These farmers are being taxed and this tends to discourage then from going to their shambas. The truth of the natter is that each individual must pay KShs.40.00 and if he has to carry anything from the shamba he is taxed KShs.100.00. Could the Ministry waive those fees? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. AWORI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, my reply is simply that residents who are moving through the Game Park going to and from the market are not required to pay any fees whatsoever. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MANGOLI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. There are contradicting statements here. The Assistant Ministry says that, local', residents are- not supposed to pay any fees, at all and the hon. Members says that they; are paying fees. Could, the Assistant- Minister assure the House that if it is found out that these I people are paying fees, the Ministry will take action against those who are charging these fees? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. AWORI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the hon. Member has evidence showing that there is a single person who has been charged for passing through the parks by the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife, let him bring it to the House and certainly action will taken. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.GALGALLO: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, sir. I think we need your guidance here. Since the hon. Member still insists that people are being charged for passing through the parks and the Assistant Minister refutes that, could the Assistant Minister tell us the people who are charging these wananchi for passing through the parks? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. AWORI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, how can I do that when I am saying that we do not charge any people for passing through the parks. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Next Question. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. FALANA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. What I have said is the truth and I do not know why the Assistant Minister is contradicting me.- Could he assure the country that people are not supposed to be charged for passing through the parks. On the other hand if he wants the evidence, I am ready to provide it to him. Could he issue an order that the farmers who pass through the parks to go to their farms should not be charged anything as of this moment? This is because this thing is happening there. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. AWORI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like, to repeat what I have already stated. If the hon. Member can bring any evidence to the Ministry that an innocent person has been, charged for passing through the park to go the market, action will be taken, I would like to assure the nation right now that the charges are only for those people going into the park and not for those passing through it in carrying out their innocent businesses. </NEWSPEECH>MR.

KIILU asked the Minister for Public Works when, the road from Muri Farm to Kiatineni in Masinga Division will be graded.	.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Archbiship Ondiek): Mr- Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I reply to this Question I would like to apologise for not being here when the Question was first asked. Having said that I beg to reply.Grading of Muri to Kiatineni Road was scheduled to commence during the third week in April, 1990. However, this process was hampered by the rains. Plans are in hand to start grading the road as soon as the weather conditions improve. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIILU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I am surprised by the reply given By the Assistant Minister because at the moment the weather is "so good" and yet nothing has been done. This shows that there is no truth in whatever the Assistant Minister is telling the House. Could he tell us when this work is going to be done? This is because nothing so far has been done and yet the weather is, "so good". In fact, there are no signs to show that something is going to be done soon on this road. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the weather is "so good" then I believe that the work will be done soon. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIILU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, what does the Assistant Minister mean by "soon"? In his original reply he has said that the work was hampered by the rains but since there are no rains currently what does he mean by "as soon as possible"? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member realises and is aware that there were heavy rains just a few weeks ago. If the weather conditions have improved then work is going to start. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister confirm whether there are any graders which have been sent, to the area so that they can start grading these roads or is he just assuming that they will them- there in the near future? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, definitely the graders are in our yard and, will be sent there soon. The graders cannot be on the road. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIILU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the way the Assistant Ministers replying to my Question is not good. Why does he not tell the House the truth? This is because his officer visited the site only after I had presented this Question to the House In fact, when this visit was being made there were not rains and furthermore there have been no rains in that area for more than a month now. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we shall have to send an officer there to check whether the weather conditions Have improved. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.KYONDA: -Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister is misleading the House because, during the last Session Tasked a similar Question and I was told that work would start as soon as the rains subsided. For more than two months now we have had no rains in Machakos and yet no work has started there. What is the Ministry's officer going to check there if the hon. Member has confirmed that there are no rains there currently? The roads there are impassable. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am denying that the road is just bad since the hon. Member has already told me that it is so. But what lam saying is that the road is going to be repaired if the weather conditions are favourable. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let us go back to Mr. Katurkana's Question. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 215<HEADER>Where abouts of Chemolingot Water Pump</HEADER>MR. EKIDOR, kwa niaba ya Mr. Katurkana alimuuliza Waziri wa Ustawi wa Maji icujim ule mtambo wajnaji uliokabidhiwa kisima cha maji cha Chemolingot mnamo mwezi wa Oktoba, 1989 na UNICEF ulipelekwa wapi.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Kisiero): Bw.Naibu Spika, kabla ya kulijibu Swali hili ningependa kuomba msamaha kwa kutokuwahapa lilipoulizwa hapo awali Naomba kujibu.Hakuna mtambo wowote uliokabidhiwa kisima cha maji cha Chemolingotmnamo mwezi wa Oktoba, 1989, na shirika la UNICEF kama anavyodai mhe-Mbunge. Habra nilizopokea kutoka kwa shirika hilo zaonyesha kwamba halina habari zozotekuhusu mtambo huo. Ilivyofanyika ni kwamba, Wizara yangu ilitoa kwa District Development Officer (DDO) mahitaji yote ya mtambo uliokusudiwa kutumiwa kwakisima hicho. Shirika la NORAD lilijitolea kuununua mtambo huo kupitia kwaRDF. Vyombo vyake vilipofika, vingine havikuweza kuingiliana na vikarudishwaili viletwe vingine vinavyofaa. Bomba lenyewe limeagizwa kupitia RDF, nayatumainiwa kwamba litawasili baada ya mwezi mmoja. Wizara yangu itahakikishakwamba mara litakapowasili litawekwa kutumika kwenye kisima hicho. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let us go back to Mr. P.K.

WAMBUA: Sir, I thank the Assistant Minister for his reply. Could he tell this House when these items were despatched to this xx hospital? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Sir, records available in my Ministry indicate that they were sent on 8th February, 1990. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAMBUA: Sir, I wanted a specific time when they were to this hospital because the other time I was told here that linen had been sent there whereas, nothing was received at the hospital. I would like to know the time and number the registration of vehicle which despatched these items. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Sir, of course, nobody would have carried all these items on a bicycle on his head or by donkey to Machakos Provincial Hospital but by vehicle. I have already said that they were despatched on 8th February, 1990. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Sir. It seems as if the Assistant Minister is not answering hon. Wambua's Question. He wanted to know the registration number of vehicle which delivered these linen. If that number is given, hon. Wambua will be able to go and check the work ticket in order to know whether the Assistant Minister is telling the truth or not. Can he answer that question properly? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have already said that this was large consignment which was delivered by vehicle on 8th February, 1990 to Machakos Provincial Hospital. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.

Can he also tell us the registration number of the vehicle which the delivery? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Sir, the hon. Member was not in Machakos Provincial Hospital yesterday but I was here. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAMBUA: The problem here is that patients in Machakos Provincial Hospital are suffering as they do not have blankets and bed sheets. I was not there yesterday because I also know very well that I was here. When were these items despatched because they are hot there as I am speaking now? If the Assistant Minister wants to confirm that, I can take him to that hospital and he will not find these items there. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR:- Sir, it could only be that, they have not started spreading these linen on the beds accordingly and since the hon. Member was not a patient–––– </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAMBUA: On a point of order, Sir. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Give him time to respond. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Since the hon. Member was not patient there, he could not have seen the linen on the beds. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MANG’OLI: On a point of order, Sir. Is the hon. Assistant Minister in order to impute ill motives against the hon. Member by saying that he (Mr. wambua) was not a patient in that hospital when he has asked an important Question? This Question was not brought here for the sake of making big head lines in the Press.<NEWSPEECH>MR.OGUR: Sir, these linen were to he used by patients and they were delivered to Machakos Provincial Hospital on 8th February, 1990 and they have not been returned to Afya House. They are there and it could be. That they have not yet been spread on the patients beds. According to the informations have, they are already at the hospital. We have also-made arrangements to send, more linen, there as well as to all hospitals in the country. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MRS. NDETEI: Can, the Assistant Minister tell, this House the number of blankets, bed sheets and dress which were delivered to Machakos Provincial Hospital because it is in a pathetic situation. I do not think that it even has detergents to clean the walls. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Sir, 300 bed sheets, 200 bed covers, 200 cot sheets and400 blankets were delivered to Machakos Provincial Hospital on 8th February,1990. Plans are also underway to supply more linen to all hospitals in the country and that includes Machakos Provincial Hospital. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Bidu ssupplementary question will be the last one on this matter. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: while appreciating the answer given by the Assistant Minister, would he give us the delivery note number of those items which were delivered, to Machakos Provincial Hospital? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: If. I were doubting that these items were delivered, then I would have brought the delivery note number to prove the contrary to the House.

This House urges the Government to Sub-division them into manageable unites, with to allocation them to individuals.<NEWSPEECH>MR.DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr.Jaldessa is not in? Let us move on to the next Motion. </NEWSPEECH><HEADER>School of Nursing at we buye Health center</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>MR.MAN’GOLI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir , I beg to move the following Motion:-THAT, while appreciating the Government‘s commitment and efforts to avail facilities and personal to ensure accessibility to medical care by all Kenyans in every part of our country and being particularly gratified by the construction of webuye Hospital and in order to facilitate the rapid expansion of medical services this house urges the Government to convert the current webuye Health or center facilities into a school of nursing .There already exists facilities in webuye in the name of webuye Health center and we are only asking the Ministry to convert that facility into school of nursing. The Ministry to convert that facility into a schooling nursing . The Ministry will spend nothing in terms of putting up that school since the buildings are already there. There is maternity ward out patient ward and houses for medical personal which can easily be converted which can easily be converted into a school nursing.(MR. Deputy Speaker left the Chair )(The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mcharo) took the Chair ))MR.MANGAOLI (Ctd .):I am sure that the Minister will go long way to appreciate that this is a very important motion I would like the ministry to find out why it has taken so long to moved the personnel to go and start building the Webuye District hospital sewerage system in order to open this hospital this is a big hospital and it is and it is of its own kind indeed I am grateful to government for having seen it fit to have this hospital built in this area the hospital is in a centre along the international highway and the facilities I am told will be unique it is a hospital that will have an intensive care unit (I.C.U) and so on already the equipment is there as we are talking now.I am told that ksh 5 million was allocated for the sewerage system but up to now it has not been constructed properly they had directed the sewrange system to a septic tank that is poorly constructed therefore in future for the purposes of building hospital, the Ministry personnel should liaise with the Ministry of public works so that they can be told what kind of buildings are required.There are no nursing school in Western province, and if there is one, it is only a training center. We also used to have Kaimosi Training Centre which is no longer training We also used to have Mukumu Trainings Centre but it does not train nurses. This is not the issue now The issue at hand now is that we would like to have a fully-fledged nursing school to be established in webuye with all the facilities . The area is big and it should be able to serve all parts of western Kenya. If you come from Kendu Bay, South Nyanza and so on, webuye is still the centre. It is a very important centre for health The Minister should put all his efforts to make sure that. This particular training schools forMR. MANGAOLI (Ctd. ):nurse is opened. We should start a nursing school in this building which is being vacated by the ministry. They are leavings the building empty. We do not want to entertain the idea of leaving buildings Government empty and unused.The nursing school will serve most, of the western Province because we do not have a single nursing home or school at the moment in the whole province. We do not have a nursing home in Busia, Bungoma District Hospital or anywhere else in western province.Sincerely speaking I talked to the Minister and he told me that this particular Motion should be approved by the Government. Therefore I would like the Minister to provide a token pound in their forward budget so that it is in line with the decision that the Ministry will take. It is not enough for the Minister to accent and support the Motion and promise to start a nursing school in the area without concrete plans that this is going to happen.I am sure the Minister, when reacting to this Motion will see the importance of it. As we know in areas where we have training schools for nurses/the hospitals are very clean because in most cases-doctors use nurses to make sure that the hospital are very clean. Therefore, we want a nursing school to be established at the current Webuye Health Centre so that we can keep the webuye District Hospital clean. This is a very important component. I am sure when the minister reacts to the Motion he will tell us when the district hospital at Webuye is going to be opened. I am sure funds are underway for the Minister to make sure that the hospital .is opened. The buildings are already there and already there all that we need now is a doctor who will be working at the district hospital and at the same time lecturing to the nurses at the nursing school. He will be provided with everything. We are not going to employ extra staff. So, we are really making full use of the personnel thatMR.MANG'OLI (Ctd. )Will be deployed in this hospital.Nurses are very important component in the medical profession. They have done commendable jobs and jobs the Government has more recently even looked at their terms of service. So it is important that this particular institution be established in Webuye so that it can serve the areas I have just mentioned. It. is the centre of Western Province. It will serve the same patients in webuye hospital and at the same time train the nurses. Those patients who come from Nandi, Uasin Gishu, Trans Nzoia, West Pokot and so on will be served by these nurses. It is the centre of western province. I am requesting the Minister to go ahead and implement the terms of this Motion immediately.We have passed Motions here in the past, but we have never seen the ministries following them up. This should be the case. We should not just pass Motions here and thereafter no implementation takes place. It just remains on paper that the Motion by hon. Mang’oli has been passed". I want to see nurses at the webuye Health Centre in their training attire and thereafter we shall appreciate the fact that the Government is doing a commendable job. It has done it before but it was taken now because Webuye District hospital is a unique hospital. It is of its own kind and I am sure the Minister will appreciate and record that Webuye people appreciate the assistance that the Government has given to them.     I am aware that training facilities at the provincial level have been there, but the kind of training I am requesting here is the combined one. It should be for both community and registered nurses. We do not have this kind of training in western Province All that we are asking the Government to do is to look into the question of increasing the nursing population in Western Province to keep up with the increasing population in the area.  MR.MANG’OLI (CTD)Conversion of this health center into a school of nursing will provide more nurses to Webuye Hospital which will in turn will make the hospital constantly clean; this is because it is nurses, and not doctors, who maintain cleanliness in Hospital.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sure that the Minister will agree with me that the ministry will find it easy to convert this health into a school of nursing. This is because we will the Webuye hospital and the old health centre building to make use of. I do not need to emphasise the importance of nurses because the minister knows that all of us need them Even when the minister himself goes to Hospital the first personnel to attend him are nurses. That is why I want a nursing school for them at Webuye. Additionally starting this school will be a way of creating employment for those who train there and those who will be employed there as subordinate staff and so on.I hope the Government will agree with me that this is very important project, and that once we have approved it here the minister will ensure that its implementation will, not be delayed by his officers. As I: am talking now there, has been a public: hue and cry over the non opening of the Webuye Hospital because, the sewerage system has not, been installed. I hope the Minister Will in his is reply, tell us why there has been this delay. I am interested in this point because the personnel will have to move from the health centre a to the hospital before the Health centre facilities can be converted into school of nursing. Delay in implementation is also bad because it increases costs. I am sure the originally quoted cost of Shs.2 million will not be enough now for the installation of the sewerage system - it will now cost about Shs.10 million. Perhaps those who have delayed the Implementation of the project wanted to be paid 10 per cent. We would to know the officers concerned.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this project will create jobs for the people from busia, Bungoma, Kakamega, Nandi, Usain-Gishnu, Trans-Nzoia, West Pokot and south. Nyanza Districts which are near it. It should also be noted that Kaimosi and Mukumu Hospitals are no longer training nurses, leaving the whole of Western Province with no nursing school. The nursing school and Webuy Hospital are strategically situated on a highway and will serve road accident victims. I have told that the hospital will have an intensive care until and will, therefore, serve Western Kanya well.While I have touched on quite number of issues, the Central point in this motion is the conversion of webuye Health centre into a school of nursing. We want the ministry to accept this motion so that we can move on to the issue of when the school will be opened. I have talked to the Minister for health, Hon. Kibaki, who agreed with me that the establishment of this nursing school is in the interest of this nation and that this motion would be accepted by the Government. If the Minister accepts this motion and opens the school, all those who will through it will remain to remember him as the person who made it possible for them to receive training, get jobs and serve this nation anywhere. As sign of the Ministry’s intention to open this school, I would like it to make a token Provision of shs.20/- for the school in its forward budget and projection. This will make it easy for us to follow up the opening of the school. I am sure all of us here, including the Ministers, will accept this motion.With those few remarks I would like to ask hon. Kiliku, who Knows how important this Motion is, to second it.<NEWSPEECH>Mr. Kiliku: Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda Kwanza kabisa nataka kuichukua nafasi hii kumshukuru mhe. Mang'oli kwa kuleta Hoja kama hii hapa Bungeni. Hii ni Hoja ya kumbusha Waziri wa Afya jinsi tunavyoweza kuupanga. uchumii wanchi yetu. Hii ni Hoja ya kuisaidia Serikali katika matumizt ya pesa. Badala ya, kutumia pesa kujenga shuie ya uuguzi, Hoja hii inayopendekeza"kwamba majengo na. vifaa ambavyo viko tayari vitwniwe. Hii ni Hoja inayotukumbusha kwamba idadi ya watu wetll, imeongezeka. Pia, inatukullbusha kwamba baada ya mwezi wa Agosti, wakati dawa ya Ukimwi itakapoanza kufanya kazi kirasmi, dunia nzima itakuwa ikija Kenya kama vile sisi tunavyoenda nchi za nje kutafuta na kununua mafuta. Watu kutoka kote duniani watakuwa wakija hapa kununua dawa ya Ukimwi na kutibiwa. Yafaa tuweke maanani kwallba wale watakaokuwa wakiwatibu wagonjwa wa Ukimwi si wengine bali ni hallla lIIauguzi wanasemekana wakafunzwe katika ki tuo cha afya cha webuye. Ni Lazima tufikirie idadi ya wagonjwa wa Ukimwi ambao watakuwa wakitibiwa baada ya mwezi wa Agosti mwaka huu.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, Mungu si Athmani. Tumekuwa tukitafuta mafuta kwa muda mrefu iIi tuweze kupata pesa za kigeni, lakini hadi sasa hatujafanikiwa na Mungu amewaongoza watu wetu wakavumbua dawa ya Ukimwi Basi tutakuwa tukipata pesa za kigeni kutoka nchi za nje ambazo zitakuwa zikiwatuma wagonjwa wa Ukimwi kuja hapa kununua dawa na kutibiwa. Zile pesa za kigeni tutakazokuwa tukitumia kununua mafuta zitakuwa zikipatikana kutokana na mauzo ya dawa ya Ukimwi. Kama vile nimesema, wale watakaokuwa wakiwatibu wagonjwa wa Ukimwi si wengine bali ni hawa mhe. Mang'oli anaopendekeza waanze kufunzwa katika kituo cha afya cha Webuye.Ukweli ni kwamba baada ya Serikali kuona kwallba Wilaya ya Webuye lazima iwe na hospitali ya Wilaya, hospitali kalla hiyo ilijengwa na kituo cha afya kilichokuweko zamani kikaachwa bila kazi. Kwa hivyo yafaa badala ya, kuyaacha yale majengo ya zamani yazoroteke yatengenezwe ili yawe kituo cha kufunza wauguzi. Wauguzi hao watakapofuzu watakuwa wakifanya kazi kila mahali katika Kenya. na hili la mhe. Mang'oli ni fikira zuri sana. Waziri atakaposimalla kujibu tunataka atueleze ni mipango gani ambayo imo kuhakikisha kwamba pendekezo la mhe. Mang'oli limetekelezwa.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, nataka kuichukua nafasi hii kufahamisha Waziri Wa Afya kwamba nyongeza iliyowekwa katika National Hospital Insurance Fund ilikuwaNi ya kuwaumiza wafanyakazi. Ukweli wa mambo ni kwamba baada ya wafanyakazi kuonge-zewa kitu kidogo iIi wafurahi, Wizara ya Afya ilirudi ikachukua ile nyongeza na kuiweka kwa National Hospital Insurance Fund. Kuna tofauti kubwa sana baina ya KShs.20/- na KShs.320/- ambazo zitakuwa zikilipwa kila mwisho wa mwezi. Na wafanyakazi Kwa mfano, ile niongeza kidogo, wafanYakazi wa Serikali wangeanza  kupata mwarizo wa mwezi wa Julai imechukuliwa na National Hospital Insurance Fund. Hao wafanyakazi. hawatasikia ka. lIa wa lIepata nyongeza yoyote ya mshahara. Nataka tIaziri afikirie tena juu ya pesa za National Hospital Insrance Fund kwa sababu wafanyakazi wamelalamika. Nchi yetu ni ya kidemokrasia na tuna uhuru wa kuzungumza, na leo nina.'lIwa.'lIbia tIaziri wa Afya kwa.'lIba ni Iazima afikirie tena juu ya nyongeza ya pesa za National Insrance Fund. Ninaishukuru Serikali sana kwa kufikiria kwamba yafaa kila mkoa na wilaya iwe na kituo cha kufunza wauguzi. Hasa, naishukuru Serikali kwa kujenga kituo cha kufunza wauguzi katika sehemu ya Changamwe. Kile ki tu ki takachotakiwa sana ni wafanyakazi. Si kwamba wauguzi watakaofuzu katika kituo kinachopendekezwa cha tIebuye ki takuwa kikiwafunza watu kutoka pande hizo peke yake; Kenya hakuna ukabila. Kituo hicho kitakuwa kikifunza.watu kuotika pembe zote za Kenya. Kama vile Serikali imechukua hatua kuvifanya vyuo fulani vya mafunzo kuwa vyuo vikuu tunaweza kfanya hivyo hivyo kuwa ria vyuo vya kufunza wauguzi. Hakuna maana ya kujenga mijengo mipya; tunaweza kutumia"majengo ambayo yako tayari. Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, Hoja inapoletwa hapa na kupitishwa na Bunge hili, ni lazima itiliwe maanani kabisa na Mawaziri. Wananchi ndio sauti yetu.. Hata ukiitwa Mheshimiwa Mbunge na watu wako wawe wanalalamika, jina hila Iitakuwa halina maana. Tunapozungumza hapa tunazungwnza na nguvu ya wananchi. Kwa hivyo, yafaa Mawaziri wawe wakiyachukua mambo ya Bunge hili vizuri sana. Ikiwa Mawaziri hawatayachukua mantbo ya Bunge hili vifaavyo, basi wajue kwantba wakati wa uchaguzi wananchi hawajui Waziri ni nani; wanajua waziri ambaye hakufanya kazi kikamilifu. Kwa mfano, lazima mambo, ya National Hospital Insurance Fund yaangaliwe tena.Nataka pia kuichukua nafasi hii kusema kwamba ni lazima wizara ya. Afya ihakikishe kwamba dawa zinapotolewa zinafika katika hospitali na vituo vya afyawakati ufaao. Tumeambiwa na Public Accounts committee vile ulanguzi unavyoendelea katika lIIizara ya Mya kuhusu tenda. Huu ulanguzi ndio unafanya watu wasipata dawa wakati unaofaa. Serikali hutoa dawa za kutosha, na watu wengine katika Wizara ya afya wanaleta ulanguzi hivi kwamba dawa haziwafikii wananchi. Jambo linalofanyika ni kwamba wakati wa kutoa tenda yule anayeuza dawa kwa bei  ghali ndiye hupata tenda huku yule anayetoa bei ya chini hapati. Hiyo tender system ndiyo inayotatiza utoaji wa dawa katika hospitali na vituo vya afya. Hii tender system inastahili kuchunguzwa na kamati ya Bunge hili kwa sababu kutoka 1970 hadi leo kumekuwa na matatizo makubwa sana.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, jambo lingine ambalo ningetaka kutaja ni kwamba hivi majuzi niliwasilisha Mezani hati kadhaa kuhusu ulanguzi katika Wizara ya Afya na zikachukuliwa na mhe. Biwott, na ninamwomba anirudishie hati hizo leo. Nataka kuziwasilisha hapa tena iIi ionekane vile watu wanavyokula pesa. </NEWSPEECH></NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Lower or higher quotations in tendering is not the only criteria in awarding tenders. That is only one, There are many other things looked into like samples and readiness to supply the correct quality and quantity . Therefore, the hon. Member should take that point into account. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>AN HON. MEMBER: What is your point of order? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur): Sir, the hon. Member was saying that we normally award tenders to the highest bidders, something that is not true. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): That is a point of information, hon. Ogur. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda. Inatakiwa tuwena semina siku moja ili Mawaziri wafundishwe jinsi ya kuendesha shughuli za Bunge. Niliikuwa nikisema kwamba yafaa wakati dawa zinapotolewa na Serikali ziwe zinafika katika hospitali na vi tuo vya afya wakati unaofaa. Dawa zinapocheleweshwa wananchi watafikiri kwamba Serikali h~a pesa za kununua dawa. Kuna watu wengine ambao huchelewesha dawa na hivyo kuifanya serikali kulaumiwa na wananchi. Ukweli ni.MR. KILIKU  (Ctd.):kwamba dawa zinachelewa kwa sababu ya tender system na huku unakuwa ,wananchi wanalalamika kwamba hakuna dawa. Waziri wa Afya alipokuwa bado kuingia hapa, nilikuwa pia nimesema kwamba pesa zilizoongezwa kutolewa ria wafanyakazi kwa National Hospital Insurance Fund ni nyingi na nyongeza, hiyo imechukua pesa kidogo ambazo wafanyakazi waliongezwa hivi majuzi. Nilisema yafaa Waziri afikirie msimamo wake tena kuhusu pesa za National Hospital Insurance Fund.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, hii ni Hoja nzuri ambayo itaisaidia Serikali katika matumizi ya pes a kwa sababu hakutakuwa na haja ya kujenga majengo mapya; tutatumia yale ambayo yako tayari.MR. KILIKU (Ctd.)Bw. Naibu Soika wa Muda, kama Mawaziri watakuwa Wakisikliza vile Wahe. Wabunge wanavyosema basi matatizo yatapungua Vile vile ni lazima Waziri wa Afya awatime maofisa kuangalia Webuye Health Centre ili wajue vile wanavyoweza kuitumia kwa kuwafunza waguzi wengi.Kwa hayo machache naunga mkono. </NEWSPEECH> (Question proposed)<NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: Thank you Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to support this very important Motion which was moved by hon. Mang'oli.Sir, this Motion has come at a time when we should remind the Ministry of Health to be mindful of the wananchits welfare in all parts of the country. The Ministry of Health does not seem to have a master plan for training the medical staff, para-medical staff and the nursing officers. Sir, there are very many health centres and dispensaries in Kenya which do not have well trained medical staff. Sir, I appreciate the expansion being carried out at Webuye Hospital, but there are other areas in the country where the Ministry has not yet planned to start any health facilities. In fact, this Motion has brought out some cost sharing element because the buildings are available, and the people to be trained as nurses are available, but the Ministry of Health should come up and improve on those buildings, recruit nursing trainees, convert Webuye Health Centre into a school of nursing and then give out some money, so that the training programme can start. The money given to the nursing school should only be used for buying equipment textbooks and also for paying the tutors, who are very readily available. Therefore, Sir, since thisMR. MALEBE (ctd.)Motion is very straight forward and simple, the Ministry of Health should readily accept it. All the buildings have been prepared and therefore the Government should come in and expand that project so that a school of nursing can be established at Webuye Hospital.Sir, in my constituency, there are some areas which do not have Government hospitals, or any kind of medical training college at all. Therefore, the Government should consider all areas "in the country which have no, hospitals aided by the Government. Some areas of the country are served by the non-governmental hospitals only. For example, in my constituency, there is Maua Hospital which is serving the people very well, but the Government does not seem to appreciate the efforts of the non-governmental organisation which is running that hospital by giving it some medical facilities. Sir, the system of health cost sharing which has failed so far is not working in ray constituency, because the private hospitals keep on raising the hospital fee regularly. I am sure that the private hospitals get a 100 per cent profit, because there are no Government hospitals there people in my area are very unfortunate because they do not have any Government hospitals, and therefore, the Element of cost sharing is alien to them.Sir, in Maua Hospital, there is a nursing training centre which is not even supported by the Government. It is a private nursing centre which trains only nurses every year. That number is very low because the area needs an improvement as far as health facilities are concerned Sir, there is a Government Hospital in Igembe, and I therefore, feel that the Government should keep aside some money for Maua. HospitalMR. MALEBE (ctd.)	so that the nursing centre can train more nurses and improve the medical facilities in Igembe Division.Sir, also if an area has got a nursing training centre it is possible to control mosquitoes. If the Government provides some grants to the private nursing training centres, the money could be used by the nurses to control those mosquitoes which are very many in some parts of our country. Sir, my constituency also experiences problems in the family planning programmes. The family planning Association of Kenya may wants to come and educate the people on family planning methods, but unfortunately, they cannot do so because there are no proper centres where they could carry out such instructions. The Family Planning Association of Kenya is a semi-Government organisation, and therefore, they cannot just go to a private hospital and start using their facilities to educate people on family planning.Sir, while supporting this Motion, I would also like to request the Ministry of Health to come up with a national plan which will improve the medical training facilities all over the country Nursing schools should be established in all parts of the country, but they should be under one body.MR. MALEBE (Ctd.):I understand that a Bill will soon be introduced in this House to incorporate all the nursing schools under one principal with a view to creating a parastatal so that health facilities are improved. I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to the Minister for Health to come up with a national wide master plan regarding the improvement of health facilities in the country, particularly in. the field of training. He should adress himself to the specific problems: now affecting health facilities with a view to introducing long-term plans, particularly in" the field of training. In areas where there are no training facilities, the Ministry should come up with plans and tell us what they intend to do to provide health facilities in these areas.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in Meru District, the District Development Committee has recommended the expansion of Keru School of Nursing and the improvement of facilities there They have also recommended the establishment of a subsidiary school of nursing to cater for private hospitals. However, I think the Ministry of Health has put a deaf ear on this and therefore, this Motion should now remind him to address himself to the problems facing wananchi regarding health facilities in the country. He should come up with specific proposals of how he intends to improve the health facilities in this country, particularly in areas where Government hospitals are not available.With those few remarks, I beg to support the Motion. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. GALGALLO: Ahsante sana Bw. Naibu Spika, wa Muda kwa. kunipatia nafasi hii ili nami niseme machache kuhusu hoja hii. Kwanza, ningetaka kusema kwamba Hoja hii ni ya maana sana kwa sababu inaiomba Wizara ipanua kituo cha afya cha Webuye na kukifanya kituo cha kuwafundisha wauguzi. Nasema Hoja hii ni muhimu kwa sabebu shida kubwa tuliyonayo katika nchi hii ni ukosefu wa hudumazu afya Tunakosa wafanyakazi wa kutosha katika hospitali zetu na vituo vya afya kote nchini. Kama tunavyofahamu, jambo la matibabu ni jambo muhimu sana na ni ajabu kuona kwamba katika nchi hii kuna ukosefu mkubwa wa wauguzi katika hospitali zetu, hasa katika sehemu za mashambani Vituo vya afya katika sehemu za mashambani ndizo msingi wa huduma za afya katika nchi hii kwa jumla na.kwa hivyo, tunahitaji wafanya-MR. GALGALLO (Ctd.):kazi wa kutosha. Katika vituo hivi, tungetaka Wizara iwe ikiwafunza, sio wauguzi wa diploma, lakini wa vyeo vya chini, kwa mfano community nurses, physiotherapists na kadhalika ambao wanahitajika sana katika vituo vya afya katika sehemu za mashambani.Ningetaka kuishukuru Wizara ya .Afya kwa vile inavyojaribu sana kulinda afya ya wananchi kote nchini, lakini matatizo tuliyonayo kwa wakati. - huu ni makubwa na hii ni. kwa sababu hatuna wafanyakazi wa kutosha katika. hospitali na vituo vya afya kote nchini, hasa katika sehemu za mashambani. Hii ndiyo sababu tunaiomba Wizara ya Afya ikubali kukipanua kituo cha afya cha Webuye na kukifanya cha kuwafunza wauguzi ambao wanaweza kutumiwa katika vituo vya afya kote nchini. Kama tunavyofahamu, wizara hii imefanya bidii sana kwa kuanzisha vituo vya mafunzo ya wauguzi katika kila mkoa. Tunaishukuru Wizara kwa sababu, vituo hivi vya mafunzo vinatoa wauguzi wenye masomo ya juu ambao wanawasaidia sana wananchi katika hospitali zetu pamoja na vituo vya afya Hata hivyo, idadi ya wafanyakazi hawa haitoshi kwa sababu hospitali zetu zinazidi kupanuliwa na vituo vya afya vinajengwa katika karibu kila kijiji kote nchini sasa. Kwa hivyo, nchi hii inahitaji kuwa na wafanyakazi wengi wa hospitali ili kuweza kuwahudumia wananchi katika vituo vyetu vya afya. Vile vile, idadi ya watu katika nchi hii inazidi kuongezeka na kwa sababu hii, Wizara inapaswa kuwafunza wauguzi wa kutosha kila mwaka ili kuweza kuwahudumia wananchi katika mambo ya afya katika nchi hii.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, pamoja na ukosefu wa wafanyakazi wa kutosha, utaona pia kwamba vituo vya afya katika sehemu za mashambani havina vifaa vya kutosha, hasa katika upande wa kuwafungua akina. mama. Isitoshe, vituo hivi hivi, 	vinawalipisha akina mama wazito pesa nyingi hata kama. haziwezi kuwapatia huduma wanavyohitaji kwa vile havina vifaa vya kutosha. Ningetaka kumwomba Waziri ahakikishe kwamba hospitali ambazo haziwezi kuwahudumia akina mama wazito, hazikubaliwi kuwalipisha pesa hata kidogo. Kwa wakati huu, ingawa hawa kina mama wanalipishwa pesa za matibabu, hawapatiwi matibabu wanayohitaji. Tungetaka Waziri aupige marufuku ulipizaji wa pesa za matibabu kwa upande wa akina mama wazito katika hospitali ambapo hakuna vifaa vinavyohitajikaMR. GALGALLO (Ctd.):	Jambo la pili Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ni kwamba ni lazima usafi uanzishe katika hospitali, lakini ajabu ni kwamba hali ya usafi katika hospitali katika zetu ni mbaya sana Hospitali nyingi sana katika nchi hii, hasa katika mikoa na wilaya, ziko katika hali mbaya sana. Utaona uchafu mwingi sana katika kila pahali unapoingia katika hospitali hizi. Vile vile, utaona kwamba mijengo katika hospitali hizi hairekebi shwi, na wagonjwa. hawapatiwi huduma za kutosha na mbu wako wengi ukienda katika hospitali ya Garissa au katika ile Provincial Hospital ya Mombasa, the situation is pathetic! Hospitali hizi zinanuka na hata kabla ya kuingia kule, utasikia. Mnuko mbaya sana. Ikiwa Sisi kama vyongozi tunasizitiza umuhimu wa usafi kote mijini na kwingineko, lakini ukiingia katika hospitali zetu, zinamuka, sijui sasa tutawaambia wetu wetu kitu gani. Kwa hivyo, ni lazima Waziri ahakikishe kwamba hospitali zetu zinatoa mfano mwema katika mambo ya usafi. Leo ukiingia katika hospitali ya Hola, utaona kuna mbu wengi na kwa muda wa mwaka mzima hiyo hospitali haina maji. Utaona kwamba wagonjwa wanaletewa maji kutoka mtoni; maji ambayo si masafi kata kidogo na isitoshe hawa wagonjwa wanalipishwa. Utaona kile chumba cha X-Ray. katika hospitali hii kinavunja na ningetaka waziri achukue hatua ya kuyarekebisha mambo haya. Ni lazima usafi uanzishwe kule hospitalini kwenyewe.MR. GALGALLO (CTD.): Ikiwa Wizara haiwezi kuziangalia hospitali zetu vizuri, kuwaambia watu kwamba itadumisha hali nzuri ya afya ni kama kuwaadaa.Ningependa pia kusema kwamba ingefaa Waziri ayaondoe kabisa malipo yanayotozwa watu hospitali kwa sababu hospitali nyingi hazina dawa, lakini unapokwenda huko ni lazima ulipe Sh.20/= unapoandikiwa ile kadi ya kuonyesha kwamba ulikwenda huko. Kumekuwa na mtindo wa kwenda hospitali, unalipa pesa, kisha unaambiwa uende ukanunue dawa kutoka kwa wauzaji dawa wa kibinafsi. Mtindo huu unafaa kukomeshwa.Ninamheshimu sana Waziri wa Afya kwa kuwa ninajua kwamba yeye ni mtu mwenye nia nzuri na ameitumikia nchi hii kwa nia safi kwa muda mrefu,. lakini Wizara yake imekuwa na mtindo wa social explotation na inadumisha corridors of corruption. Ukienda hospitali ya Serikali unatozwa KShs.20 kuandikiwa kadi tu ya kuonyesha kwamba ulikwenda huko, kisha unaambiwa kwamba unahitaji dawa aina hii, lakini haipo hospitalini. Ndipo sasa unaambiwa uende ukaitafute kwa wauzaji dawa wa kibinafsi. Unalipa pesa hizo kwa sababu gani? Huku ni kumnyanganya mwananchi Sh.20 zake ambazo amezipata kwa taabu.Kwa haya machache, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, naunga mkono. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. P.J.W. MASINDE: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to support this very important Motion. This is a very straightforward Motion which I hope the Minister concerned is not going to amend at all. The Motion is self-explanatory and requires support from everybody.We have quite a number of health centres and dispensaries whose construction has been completed, but they take a long time to be opened due to lack of staff. However, I must appreciate from the outset the work that the Minister for Health is trying to do. He has tried his level best to rectify the situation in his Ministry, and I am also grateful that, despite the pressure there is on the question of staff, he has helped me in person to have a small dispensary in my constituency opened. However, by and large, he has no sufficient staff and wananchi are suffering all over the country. I, therefore,MR.P.J.W. MASINDE (CTD.):	support this Motion very strongly which calls for the opening of Webuye as a trading centre for nurses and clinical officers. These two categories of health workers have done a lot in saving the lives of wananchi in this country. We have many young children who have left school at "O" and "A" levels, and they should be given an opportunity to serve wananchi in the medical profession. The question of their prying around due to lack of facilities should not arise nor should the limitations of selection due to lack of facilities. We have fairly suitable facilities in Webuye Health Centre, and we fully support the idea that training of nurses and clinical officers should take place in the health centre. Besides the question of staff, we have many dispensaries and health centres that are not properly supplied with medicine. You will find that many patients visit various health centres and they are turned away because there is no medicine in these centres. Quite a number of hon. Members have talked in this august House about the distribution of drugs depending on the prevalent diseases in various areas. Western Kenya, for instance, is grossly infested with malaria, and there is no reason why there should be a lack of drugs for malaria in. this place. There are other areas, such as. Coast Province, where we have plenty, of snakes, and there is no reason why there should be no medicine for snake bites in the area. Medicine should be distributed according to the prevalent diseases in various areas.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the previous speakers has talked about cost-sharing. I think cost-sharing in the Ministry of Health has been too much rushed into, and I support the previous speaker in suggesting that this should be completely suspended for the time being. Even in today's newspapers, people are still talking of having seminars to discuss the issue of cost-sharing in hospitals. It would appear to me that the Ministry rushed into introducing this idea and, whereas the Ministry is still talking about possible ways of making it work, I suggest that it be completely suspended. Since sickness does not give anybody any notice, somebody may fall sick, when he has no money in his pockets and when he goes to hospitalthe question of paying before he isMR. P.J.W. MASINDE (CTD.): treated should not arise We have also come across cases where patients are made to pay and they are examined, but when they go to the pharmacy, they find no medicine there. Surely, this should not be the case. It is alleged that medical staff would assess the situation and know who is able and who is not able to pay, but the staff is not competent enough to gauge whether somebody is poor enough to warrant him to get free treatment or not. Therefore, before the Ministry of Health gets a proper solution, the question of cost-sharing should be done away with. Recently, were allowed to continue to get free treatment. However, civil servants get a monthly salary, whereas this does not apply to people who do not even have means of livelihood. So, I feel that while conferences are being held with a view to solving the question of cost-sharing in health, something should be done until the Ministry of Health comes up with a proper and viable means of assessing who can and who cannot afford to pay for treatment. Meanwhile, the Ministry can continue to assign special treatment areas even in public hospitals where those who can afford it can go for treatment while those who cannot afford it should be treated without any harassment.We have ways of elininating diseases, such as malaria. Why does the Ministry of Health not intensify malaria control instead of waiting for the President to say something about it? It is only when the President talks about this issue that you find people clearing certain areas and emptying tins with stagnant water. Once this is over, those concerned just sit .back and wait for the President to mention the issue on another day. Why is this not a routine exercise which would eventually probably eliminate the breeding of mosquitoes so that malaria is fully controlled in this country?With these few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH>MR.MAKAU: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute on this Motion. Everybody in this country is aware that medical services in Kenya are wide spread and very advanced and that is one of the biggest achievements this country has had since Independence. But we have problems in the Ministry of Health. One of the things that have been mentioned before is this Question of cost- sharing in health services. We understand, because of structural adjustment programmes, that cost-sharing is a concept that this country has to accept. But when it comes to health, I would like to say that the people of this country have enjoyed free medical care for years. The introduction of cost-sharing in hospitals had two intentions when the planning was being done. But this has become administratively impossible. The cost-sharing policy in the Ministry -of Health is impossible to implement. I am saying so after the first three months the. Director of Medical Services said that the collections_ that had been made amounted to KShs.10 million. Recently we also read in the newspapers that the money that has so far beer collected has not been put into use because there is no clear-cut policy as to how that money is going to be used. I am raising this matter because before implementation of this policy those concerned should have made sure that the committees working in various districts were ready for it. So, instead of calling for the suspension of this policy we should call for total scrapping of cost-sharing in health. Last week I visited Machakos Provincial Hospital and I found out that drugs are not available in that Hospital. I was disturbed to find that oxygen - which is very essential to people suffering from stroke is not available in that Hospital. The patient I had gone to see had suffered from a stroke and he died because there was no oxygen in that Hospital. So, insteadMR. MAKAU (CTD);of suspending cost-sharing in hospitals I suggest that we should scrap it completely. The Minister for Health should liaise with the Vice-President and Minister for Finance to find ways and means of scrapping cost-sharing in health. This is because the money collected from medical fees has not been put into use. So, this concept of cost-sharing has failed totally and it should be scrapped immediately Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we should scrap the cost-sharing policy and introduce amenity wards in all hospitals so that those who have money can pay. This is because the majority of our people are unable to pay for medical care. Even these who manage to pay cannot get treatment because there are no drugs in our hospitals. So, you can see that cost-sharing in health does not make a lot of sense to us in this country. So, we should scrap this concept and introdu.ee amenity wards in our hospitals.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Motion is very very important because it is asking the Government to convert the current Webuye Health Centre facilities in a school of nursing. The Minister for Health aware, that we have a shortage of medical and para-medical personnel in this country. A lot of health centres have been started in the spirit of Harambee but they cannot, be put into use immediately due to lack of personnel. The Ministry of Health is always talking about shortage of personnel. So, the Government must accept this Motion without any amendments because we have a shortage of nurses in this country and it is high time we trained more nurses.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me now touch on the question of constructing health centres and dispensaries on Harambee basis. People are encouraged to construct health centres on Harambee basis but when these facilities, are complete the Ministry of Health does not take them over, so that ourMR. MAKAU (ctd);May benefit. We in Moooni Constituency have constructed two health centres on Harambee basis cut up to now the Ministry of Health has not provided these health centres with personnel and as a result of this they are not operational. So, when Wananchi build health centres on Harambee basis, those health centres should be provided with personnel and drugs so that the efforts of our people are rewarded. We have constructed a health centre in a place called Mutemouku but it is not operational because the Ministry has not provided it with drugs and personnel.I would now like to touch on the shortage of drugs in our health centres and hospitals. The Ministry of Health should device methods of ensuring that at least basic drugs are available in all hospitals. Essential drugs should be made available in every hospital in this country. That patient I mentioned at the beginning died because of lack of oxygen. The doctors at Machakos Provincial Hospital said that the little oxygen they had could only be administered to patients, in operation theatres. That patient passed away about two days ago. But you will find that oxygen is not a very expensive commodity and there is no. reason, why it should not be available in. hospitals.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in addition to converting Webuye Health Centre into a nursing home, the Minister for Health should sake sure that more facilities and opportunities are made available to those people who are interested in taking up a medical career. This is because we heed adequate medical personnel in our hospitals. I would therefore like to call upon the Minister for Health to make sure that more medical and para-medical personnel are trained in this country. We need people to mann our health centres clinics and dispensaries.MR. MAKAU (CTD);			So, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Motion calls upon the Government to convert Webuye Health Centre into a nursing home so that more medical personnel can be trained. I would like to stress that cost-sharing in hospitals should be scrapped and amenity	wards be started in every hospital in this country so that those who can afford to pay can do so. I say this because the	implementation of the cost sharing policy in our hospitals has caused a lot of suffering to our people. This is because it is not easy to distinguish between a person who is able to pay and a person who is unable to pay for medical treatment. So, the Minister for Health should liaise with the Minister for Finance to find ways and means of raising money for health care instead of doing so through cost-sharing which hascaused a lot of suffering to our people.MR. MAKAU (ctd.):	This is the reason why I am asking the Minister for Health to liaise with the Vice-President and Minister for Finance to look into ways and means of raising money instead of raising through the cost-sharing programme in hospitals. This is because this is causing a lot of untold suffering to the people. The main problem with this programme is of the numerous implementation problems as have been pointed out in this House by hon. Members and by members of the public.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIPKORIR: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to contribute to this Motion. I would like to start by saying that this is a very straightforward Motion which should be accepted and implemented. The motto of this nation is that we should all be mindful of other people's welfare. As the economy and the population of this country expands so does the need for more services especially in health. Since the majority of our people live in the rural areas, I think, as somebody has already pointed out, that is where health services are needed most.Although we know that the Government has done a lot towards the development of this country, there are certain parts of this country that also need services like health. You will find that hospitals like those in my area are not running because of lack of facilities. Such problems are cropping up because they are unable to meet hospital charges. The charges are, in fact, too high for them. I think the aim of the Government should be to extend health facilities to all parts of this country. I would like to appeal to the Ministry of Health to ensure that they provide health facilities to all parts of this country. It is with this in mind that we are supporting the Motion on hand. If the Motion was to be implemented, then more people could be trained there.I think the health of a nation's people is more important than anything else. In order for any nation to develop it must first of all have healthy people which means that we must have enough health facilities in our hospitals. This is very vital.Mr. KIPKORIR (ctd.):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, sir if the current Webuye Health Centre facilities were to be converted into a school of nursing even the people of the Rift Valley Province would also benefit. Webuye is a centre for farming and if this Motion is implemented, then people from Eldoret, Kapenguria, Uganda and kisumu will benefit a lot. So it is very important that this Motion be implemented. The other people who would also benefit from such a thing would our young people who are jobless. They can be trained there and deployed in the rural areas where they will offer to the people the much needed heath services.In my constituency there is only one health centre. My people cannot visit this health centre because it has no facilities. As a result my people are suffering a lot. In fact, those suffering from malaria are the ones who have been hard hit most. We are just fortunate that we have missionaries there who have really tried to help my people. So we need the support of the Government in providing health services and facilities to my people. It is unfortunate that my people have to travel from Chevali to Kapswara Dispensary which is about 100 kilometres away. So it is high time that the Government, trained more health personnel to ensure that all wananchi receive health services.It is time we also started genuinely be mindful of other people's welfare. It is with this in mind that I would like to thank the Government for decentralising most services in this country. This has ensured that officers know exactly the problems facing wananchi at the grass root level. So it should be the aim of every Kenyan to ensure that he does all his best when rendering services to the people of this country. It is the duty of every one of us to see that we help each other where and when possible. Since we are about to embark on a new financial" year, I hope that the Ministry of Health will implement this Motion so that this nursing school can start training people to serve this country. We should not waste time discussing things which we know are in line with the policy of the Government.MR. KIPKORIR (ctd.):	since it is the policy of the Government to expand health facilities we hope that this Motion will be implemented as soon as possible.Mr. Temporary Deputy. Speaker, Sir, I would like to appeal to the officers who are responsible for implementing projects to ensure that projects are started at the right time and completed on time. This ensures that funds are not wasted and wananchi benefit from those projects.A hospital needs to be well equipped so that it can handle all cases. This also gives confidence to the people to go for treatment at that hospital.MR.KIPKORIR (ctd):It is a shame to go to a hospital and find it smelling while who are charged with cleanliness should, do their duty properly. Hospitals should be clean in order to attract the local community because if such facilities are dirty the people will not go there for treatment.We are	 here to speak on behalf of our constituents and we speak from experience. Those who are in charge should implement the wishes of the people as far as health facilities are concerned.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur) : Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply to the Motion.I agree that this is a very straightforward Motion. I have a few clarifications I would to here for the attention of the hon. Member who moved this Motion. For example, I would like to inform the hon. Member that sewerage problem is not entirely a problem of the Ministry of Health. I hope that he will make an. effort to see the right Ministry, that is, the Ministry of Water Development so that this problem can be rectified accordingly. We will come in and help whenever we are required.I would also like, to inform the House that Webuye Health. Centre is not a mere health centre as the hon. Member seems to think. This is a very important health centre to the Ministry and to the people of the area to the extent that we have made it a. screening point. It is also important that. It should be promoted to a medical training centre except that the Ministry is not ready right now. We do not also see the urgency here particularly when we know very well that Kakamega, Kamesi and Mukmmi Medical Training Schools which are in Western Province admit students in July of every year.Probably, the Ministry would consider expanding the existing three medical training schools so as to admit more students before thinking of promoting Webuye Health Centre to a school of nursing. Therefore, there is no serious lack of a medical training school in Western Province. This does notTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur) Ctd:	mean that there should not be consideration for future plans to promote this health centre, which is currently being used as a screening point to a school of nursing. We are not, therefore, saying that we will not consider this proposal in future.In the training of paramedical staff, we do not "only train nurses but other faculties, such as, laboratory technicians and so on. Therefore, when the hon. Member talks about nursing, it may not be understood clearly as we also have other faculties which are offered at nursing schools.Many hon. Members said that cost-sharing is awkward and I would like to say that it is not. If there are a few problems, they will be discussed and we will see the best way of improving the system for the benefit of this nation. The suggestion from the hon. Members that cost-sharing is failing is not true because we are modifying the system as the need arises.The other thing is about the existing facilities which have beer put up by the wananchi through Harambee efforts with the help of their Members of Parliament. One hon. Member said that he has a number of such facilities in his constituency but are not operational either because of lack of drugs or personnel. I would- like to inform the House that if my Ministry is made aware of the existence 0f such facilities completed to our satisfaction. we will come in and help, We have medical officers of health in every district who will inform us the nature of such facilities and we will find out why they are not operational. I do not believe that there would exist a completed health centre or a dispensary that would be left idle by the Government without providing it with drugs and personnel. I admit that when we are made aware of such facilities, we will try to assist wherever possible. This is because our Ministry is there to assist the wananchi. There is no reason why we would say that such and such a health centre should not operate because we do not have any other motives but to assist the people.	THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur.) (Ctd. ): At the end of the last sentence, I wish to add the follow and words with your permission, Mr. Temporary Deputy speaker:- "as soon as funds become available".The reason why I move this amendment is because, as I have already said that there is no immediate urgent need to change Webuye Health Centre into a medical training school because we have the ones I have already mentioned. They are already operating and admitting enough students which we can cope up with because of the limited availability of funds. We also agree that when future calls to expand those existing facilities for training to admit more students before we may find it necessary to take on Webuye. So, Webuye is not an ordinary health centre but a screening post which is very important for use to this nation. So, with that little amendment, I beg to move. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Kibaki ): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to second the amendment.I would like to explain that the purposes of the Mover of the Motion and also the purposes of the Ministry of Health are similar. But we have recognised, or at least you would agree that we have to be honest with the House and tell the truth. If we say that we are not able to open up this school at the moment, we shall not be telling the truth, because the resources that, are available to us are likely to go towards improving the existing schools. That way, the money will take us further. The purpose is to train more nurses. So, if we improve the existing schools at Kakamega, Kaimosi and at Bukumu, we shall take more trainees more quickly. That is the purpose of the Motion.Hon. Members may not know that right now if we could have 1,500 nurses we could employ them and use them. We need them. But we have very many of the health centres and clinics which haveTHE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Ctd. ): been completed and which are short of staff. So, we are all agreed that we need to train more staff. We also need to train slightly higher grades. This is a very important point because many hon. Members keep coming to us about recruitment. We have to upgrade the nursing profession so that now that we have many girls going to high schools, we are, in fact, insisting on proper high school grades for those who are going to train as nurses. But this does not mean that in some parts of the country we do not take girls who may not have completed high school. That is only a few areas, by and large in the country as a whole.Finally, Sir, I also want to mention that we do go out of our way because we have been misunderstood here to make sure that we recruit nurses trainees from all parts of the country. This is the only way we can be efficient because the work of nurses to deal with mothers and children, to talk about family planning and so on, we need a nurse who will not only speak in Kiswahili but also sometimes to go local and speak the local language. Then she can communicate the message we are trying to get to the mothers. We recognise this fact. So, wherever we can get nurses trainees from a locality, we are recruiting locally, and I would to assure the hon. Member that that is exactly what we will have to do.This particular health centre will become an important institution. It is a screening centre now, but it will help relief the Webuye hospital. Webuye Hospital is a modern hospital which is very well constructed, and as soon as the sewerage works is complete we shall open it. So, the hon. Member for Webuye should be very grateful and happy about the hospital and then this other development will come later on.THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Ctd ):The only other point that I wanted to add on to what has already been said is that we have a very genuine problem on the deployment of nurses and the hon. Members should be aware of this serious problem. As soon as we have trained nurses, they get married. We are not saying it is a tragedy. No! It is normal and it is natural. They get married to senior people living in towns. So, they move to towns as married people. Even if they continued working with us, we are overstaffed in some towns than in rural areas. So, we are not getting the staff we need in the rural areas. Therefore, we have a very real genuine problem and it is not one that can be solved quickly because it is part of the human society that we are in now. It just happens that the category of people who get married to nurses are either employed or businessmen in towns. They may not realise what serious problem they are creating for us in the rural areas. They leave us with a serious shortage of nurses. So, whenever hon. Members are asking questions concerning transfer of nurses, this is one of our major handicaps because it is not easy in our social system for a nurse to work in one rural area part of Kenya when the husband is working in town. So, these are the problems that we are facing. This little amendment is purely factual so that as soon as they have completed the expansion of the other three health centres and we are doing well there then we shall move on to others.Sir, I beg to second the amendment.("Question, that the words to be added be added, Proposed)MR.MWENJE: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the amendment to this Motion. Atleast the spirit that has been shown by the Ministry of Health is acceptable. While the words "as soon as possible" do not really fit into the Motion, I at least want to appreciate the Ministry's indication of the understanding that we really need this kind of training schools in the rural areas; I hope it will not take a long time to set them up. However, the words "as soon as possible" could refer to a long or short time. I want to appeal to the Ministry to implement this project in the shortest time possible. Tomorrow is our Budget Day and soon after that the Ministry will come up with the figure of the amount of money it requires for the financial year. Since the Ministry received notice of this Motion some back, it would have included the money required to run this particular school of nursing in their estimates for the next financial year. Assuming that the time factor did not allow the Ministry to include this money in their estimates for the next financial year, then it should include this money in its 1991/92 Estimates.We no doubt have shortage of nurses in this country. I want to differ with the Assistant Minister who moved the amendment over his argument that the Ministry has not been informed of any completed health facilities and failed to start operating it. This is because I can give several examples- of such health, facilities, some in my own constituency. We have Dandora dispensary which is ready but has not been operational for the last, about six years. I have drawn the attention of the Ministry to this matter through a Question in this House but nothing has happened. I have also in this House drawn the attention of the Ministry existence of a dispensary building and other facilities at Kayole Site and Service Scheme, where about 30,000 people will be settled already about a quarter have now been settled there. We even haveMR. MWENJE (CTD):	mattresses, in addition to the building and other facilities, which are beginning to not but the Ministry is not doing anything about them. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, even though these dispensaries are under the Nairobi City Commission (NCC), the NCC is only an agent of the Ministry of Health. Therefore, the Ministry should have taken up the matter with the NCC and ensured that the Dandaro and Kayale Dispensaries become operational. When I ask they have not started operating the explanation is always that the NCC does not have enough nurses to start operating them.Now an hon. Member is asking the Ministry to start a school nursing to train nurses who would then be posted throughout the country, including Embakasi. It is easy to start this school in Webuye because there buildings that are no under proper use and the Ministry will only need personnel and money to start operating the school. We should, therefore, support this Motion and pass it. However, we should not be told that it will be implemented as soon as possible only for us to- wait for another four years. If the school cannot be started in the next financial year, it should certainly become operational in the 1991/92 Financial Year. We will give full support to the. Ministry when requests for money to start, it.I also to differ with the Assistant Minister over his argument, that when nurses, are trained upcountry, they get married and come to live in this City. That may be true, but why then do we have shortage of nurses within the City? It means that shortage of nurses is all over the country. The implication by the Assistant Minister is that the City has no problem, of nurses; yet I have just cited cases of dispensaries that have not become operational due toMR. MWENJE (CTD): shortage of staff . The NCC has told us that it approached the Ministry to provide it with nurses out it has been told that they are not available. I am glad that the Ministry lies assisted the NCC with a few doctors, but it still needs to assist the NCC with nurses so that these dispensaries, which have remained un-operational because of lack of staff, can be opened.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, expect the Ministries of Health and Local Government and find a solution to this problem. As long as the reason for not operating these dispensaries continues to be non-availability of staff, then this emphasises the reason why the Ministry should open the Webuye School of Nursing even tomorrow so that the country becomes self-sufficient in the area of nursing personnel.I hope thus the Ministry of Health will give this issue a more serious attention. By starting this nursing school it will not be helping Webuye only but will also be solving the problem of shortage of nursing throughout the country. If we have two completed dispensaries: with faculties in Embakasi which are not operational because of shortage of staff, then we must be having a lot of such health- facilities in the whole Republic. The Assistant Minister says that existence of such health facilities has not been brought to. the attention of the Ministry, I want it to be on record that I have now, and even before, brought to the attention of the Assistant Minister the existence of two non-operational dispensaries in my constituency and that the explanation I have been given is that there is lack of nursing personnel. If it is true that we do not have enough nurses to man our dispensaries, let the Ministry now tell us when it will open this school of nursing. Now we have many Standard Eight, Form Four, Form Six and universityMR. MWENJE (CTD):	leavers who are unemployed and who can be trained as nurses and be used to run these dispensaries which have remained un-operational due to shortage of staff.With those few remarks, I beg to support.(Question, that the words to be added be added, put and agreed to)<NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Hon. Members, in view of the time limit, it is time for the Mover to reply. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MANG'OLI: Thank you very much. Mr, Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Before I reply to the debate, I would like to allocate five minutes of my time to the Chief Whip to contribute because he was very eager to contribute to the Motion. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. A.K. KINYANJUI: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, for these five minutes. I think the hon. Mover of this Motion has given the Government some food for thought in so far as the expansion of our health institutions is concerned, starting with the Nyayo Wards. The expansion of health institutions should go hand-in-hand with the training of personnel. Take an example of an area like Lari Constituency where I have about five upcoming dispensaries. The expansion of our health institutions calls upon our Ministry of Health to think of ways and means of getting personnel to man the expanded facilities. It would be meaningless to have expanded facilities, including Nyayo Wards, and have no personnel to man them. It is, therefore, important for the Ministry of Health to think of how to organise crash programmes to train medical personnel to man these expanded health institutions. The Kanu Manifesto provides for health care for our people, and we should, therefore, be able to have enough qualified personnel in the field of medicine.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would even go further and say that the missionary health training institutions we have, like Kijabe, be assisted by the Government to expand. As the hon. Member from Embaskasi has rightly said, we have given a number of buildings to be used as health training institutions and we want to see them fully utilised. As I have said, I have a health centre at a place called Kamburu, another one at Gitithia, another one at Kinari and others 	coming up, and all these facilities would be meaningless without adequate trained personnel. So, the training of medical personnel should also be expanded by the Government. That should be treated as a priority now and not tomorrow. There isMR. A.K. KINYANJUI (ctd. ):no point of having institutions like Nyayo Wards without the personnel to man them. We have, as I have said, mission training centres all over the country and we should expand them. That is why I feel that the Motion before us is very important.Let me conclude by thanking the Minister for Health for only amending the Motion slightly rather than brushing it off.With those few remarks, Sir, I beg to support the Motion as amended. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MANG'OLI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, what we are driving home is the fact that there is need to train medical personnel. We can realise from the hon. Chief Whip that the Ministry has a crash programme to establish dispensaries in various areas, and therefore the need for the personnel that should be trained at the former Webuye Health Centre. The Minister's response to the Motion is very good in that there will be training for medical nurses at the Webuye Health Centre once it is converted to a training centre. If that is going to be so, I am sure that our people will get the services that they require from the Ministry.Let me take this opportunity to thank the Ministry to have the Motion carry the day. I hope, as my colleagues have said, that the Ministry will go further and see if they can provide a small token in their forward budgeting system. One thing I want to point out is that Kaimosi Training School falls under a mission and it only trains dressers and not nurses. In fact, the school has abandoned the original intention. I do not want Kaimosi Training School to be compared with the proposed Webuye Medical Training Centre because there is very little training going on there. I am quite happy with the spirit the Ministry has taken the Motion and I am sure that it will go a long way in serving the nation.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as many speakers have said, I also have very many dispensaries and health centres in my constituency. There is Sitivo, Bokoli and many others, not to mention Sirisia, Kimilili and Mt. Elgon dispensaries. We need trained personnel to man these institutions, and that is why I am saying that once Webuye Medical Training Centre is set up, it will serve the whole nation; I do not want to be selfish.MR. MANG'OLI (ctd.):Sir, I am sure that the hon. Minister understands the English phrase which says "as soon as possible" since he read English language and Economics at Makerere University. The people outside this House know that the Minister understands the meaning of that phrase and they expect him to undertake the project "as soon as possible". The hon. Member for Embakasi has told us that there are health centres available and that what we are lacking is the personnel to man them. Therefore, I hope that the phrase "as soon as possible" will become a reality by the Minister taking action in the final implementation stages.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to take this opportunity to thank the hon. Members who have ushered in the idea of establishing a medical training school in Webuye, an institution which will serve the whole nation. I am sure that hon. Members from that area will support the idea because this institution will cater for all those people in the area. As I look at the Minister for Health, he seems ready to start the training programme. That is the spirit with which we conclude this Motion.	With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.(Question of the Motion as amended put and agreed to)Resolved accordingly:THAT, while appreciating Government's commitment and efforts to avail facilities and qualified personnel to ensure accessibility to medical care by all Kenyans in every part of our country; and being particularly gratified by the construction of the Webuye Hospital, and in order to ensure constant availability of qualified personnel to facilitate the rapid expansion of medical services; this House urges the Government to convert the current Webuye Health Centre facilities into a school of nursing as soon as funds become available". </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. FALANA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the following Motion-“THAT in view of the fact that Kenya is a renown sporting nation that has produced heroes and heroines who have flown the Kenya flag high at international meetings, this House urges the Government to set aside funds for establishment of a retirement scheme for them”.This a very straightforward Motion. My main concern is on those people who have given up their time, their energies and everything that they have to this nation. They have won this nation a good name by being good ambassadors abroad. Recently, there was an article, about a. blind man who at one time in the past was an international boxer, and he represented this nation very well in the international World of sports. Today, that man is not known, to anybody. That is a very pathetic thing. When that man was energetic, he had won a good name for our country. We do not expect such a man to be energetic throughout his life. Time will" come when age will overtake him. Also other physical disabilities can develop and such a person is forced to retire from sports. It is a shameMR. FALANA (ctd.):on our side if we only value a person. when he is able to earn a good name for our nation but once he retires he is forgotten completely. I think the whole nation should be concerned about such people. The people who gave their good time and energies to this nation, instead of using it for their own benefits, should be well taken care of by the Government. Those people have families to take care of. They have wives and children to take care of, but since they used all their time and energies to earn a good name for this nation, I think it is only proper for the Government to take care of them and their families, when they are no longer able to take care of them.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Kenya has a very good name in the ± international world of sports. I therefore, feel that time has come when a comprehensive sports programme well developed in this country. Sometimes our medal winners are invited to participate in sports outside this country. The countries extending the invitations use a very carefree method of inviting those medal winners to their countries. They just advertise through the media, saying such and such a person is invited to go and participate in a certain sport in America or any other country. The medal winners who are invited have to look for ways of paying for their own transport there, so that they can go and compete in that nation. That is a big shames, It shows how disorganised, we are. When those people- compete and win the medals, they bring fame to our nation. I therefore, think that the Government should organise, so that those people can do their practice here very well before they go to compete. The Government should also organise for a better method of contacting, those people, instead of them beingMR. FALANA (ctd.)		invited through the media. That is a very bad thing. We have to be serious with sports in Kenya. Kenya has a very good name in sports internationally. I think God has given us a natural talents in sports, and that is what has given us fame internationally, but the Ministry of Culture and Social Services is doing very little to promote that good name of sports. I do not know where the problem lies.Sir, there are some x countries which are much smaller than Kenya, which have never even won any medals, but they have a Ministry which is concerned with sports only. But in Kenya, although we have good sportsmen and women, the Ministry of Culture and Social Services has Only a very small section which is running sports welfare I think an independent Ministry should ; 5 be created to take care of those sportsmen and women. Such a Ministry should coach the sportsmen and women very well. Sir, currently our coaches are very poorly remunerated, and in most cases we do not have any qualified coaches in the various sports. Mostly, it only the teachers who are patriotic and devoted who give up their time to coach sportsmen and Women in athletics. How can a whole Ministry ignore sports?When you watch the television and see our sportsmen flying the Kenyan flag high in international sports, if you are 	a true Kenyan, you also become happy. Any Kenyan will feel happy seeing our flag being flown round the field. If all that we can do as a nation is just to sit there and watch the television set and appreciate the medal winners, instead of contributing to their success, so that we can win more medals, I think as a nation we are not doing what we are supposed to do. The Ministry of Culture and Social Services should think ofMR. FALANA (ctd.)	employing qualified coaches. Coaches are everywhere, may be the Ministry is just being means, they do not want to pay them well. Our sportsmen and sportswomen are left at the mercy of school teachers who give their free time to coach them. Sir, as I had already said, only the God given talents which have made us win all those medals. During the Seoul Olympic Games, Kenya won medals in every race that they participated in, from the 800 metres to the 5000 metres race.		MR. FALANA (Ctd.):This is a great achievement and therefore, we should encourage our athletes in order to give them future hope. He should appreciate what they have achieved for this country by protecting the welfare of their families, when these athletes retire. By retirement, I do not mean retirement from the daily work that our sportsmen and women are doing at the moment. After all, not all of them are employed in the Civil Service or in the private sector, and by retirement here, I mean retirement from sporting activities. I know there are some sportsmen and women who have been doing sports for even ten years and due to some unavoidable reasons, they just decide to leave sporting. I think some ways and means should be sought to provide such people with some kind of retirement benefits as a token of appreciation from Government for their achievement. The Government should come out and show that these sportsmen and women have been good ambassadors for this country at one time that or another and that they actually did uplift the good name of this country. Those sportsmen and women who have served this country for a long period should be considered for this kind of retirement benefits.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are certain sporting fields in this country which are not fully exploited and I do not know why this is so. As we all know, God has given as our people sporting talents, but if you take, for example, sports like Javelin, shortput, discus, hammer and so on, you would find that these sports Have not been fully exploited in Kenya and	I one wonders why. At the moment, very little is being done in this field and I think what is lacking is proper coaching. A lot of Kenyans, particularly, j the nomads, such as the Masai, Borana, Rendile, are very good at throwing spears. Javelin is nothing else but throwing of spears in sane modern style	 and I do not know why we do not come up in the field of javelin. Similarly, in discus and shortput, there is nothing so difficult because these are sports that our people are used to. The difference is only the style in which the modern javelin, shortput or discuss is practised, however, with some amount of coaching, I am sure our people can prove to be as good in these sports, as they	MR. FALANA (Ctd.)	have been in other forms of sports.As I said, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is a very straight-forward Motion and on top of what I have already said, the Ministry of Culture and Social Services should take more interest in the sporting field in this country where no coaching has been done. The Ministry should make efforts to invite experts on certain sports to come here and coach our people in these sports. These sports should expand into the rural areas where most of our sportsmen and women are. These experts should go to places like North-Eastern Kenya, namely, Marsabit, Isiolo, and so on because this is where you get people who are very good in running, throwing javelin and so on. They should go to places like Pokot, Turkana , Samburu and so on where they can really get very good sportsmen and women. The Ministry of Culture and Social Services should take the trouble to explore into this field of sports.With those few remarks, I call upon hon. Bidu to second this Motion . </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIHU: Ahsanta Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kumipatia nafasi hii. Kwanza, range taka kutoa shukrani kwa mhe. Pal ana kwa kuile'ta Hoja hii hapa ili Bunge hili liweza kuwa na nafasi ya kutoa shukrani kwa wanariadha ambao wamelileta jina nzuri katika Jamhuri yetu ya Kenya. Sisi sote tunafahamu. kwamba Kenya imekuwa kilele cha. nchi zote ulimwenguni kwa. upartde wa riadha. Mnasema hivyo kwa sababu hapo mnamo mwaka wa 1936/37 wakati wa Fourth All Africa Games, watu kutoka Afrika nzima, walikuja hapa Nairobi, sio tu kuangalia ile michezo iliyokuwa ikiendelea hapa, bali pia kwa sababu walikuwa wamesikia katika kwamba katika Kenya kuna wanariadha wazuri sana Leo, popote uendapo katika ulimwengu, unasikia sifa ya Kenya katika upande wa riadha. Waswahili wanasema, "Kidole kizuri, huVisiwa pete" Vile vile, mtu mzuri anayeleta sifa njema katika Kenya ni lazima atambuliwe na kupatiwa msaada wa aina fulani baada ya kuacha riadha.Bw. ffaibu Spika, ningetaka kusema juu ya aina mbili za wanariadha. Kuna wanariadha ambao wanafanya michezo hapa Kenya na kuna wale wanaokwenda ngambo na kuleta sifa kwa Jamhuri yetu. Bendera ya Kenya katika nchi za kigeni ambapo wanari adha we tu wanakwenda, inapeperushwa. Kwa hivyo, hawa wanariadha wangefikiriwa. Kuna mwanaxiadha mmoja ambaye alituletea sifa kubwa sanaMR. BIdu (Ctd.):	hapa Kenya, yaani, Bw. Kipchoge Keino. Sasa katika Kenya nasikia kwamba kuma uwanja wa michezo uitwao Kipchoge Keino Stadium, lakini hiyo peke yake haitoshi. Kuupatia uwaaja huu jina la yule mwanariadha, kunamsaidia kwa njia gani? Mtu hawezi kula uwanja wa michezo. Ningependekeza kwamba, badala ya kuweka jina lake kwa uwanja wa michezo kwa ajili ya ukumbusho, ingefaa kama angepatiwa msaada pamoja na jamii yake ili wale watoto wawe wakikumbuka kwamba babao aliiletea nchi hii sifa kubwa. Jambo hili litawatia moyo wanariadha wengine ili wazidi kutuletea sifa kubwa katika ulimwengu.Kwa hivyo, mi lazima wizara hii ifanye mpango wa kuwakumbuka wale wanariadha ambao wanatuletea sifa katika Kenya. Utaona kwamba vanakenya wako katika kila aina ya mchezo. Ninaishukuru Serikali na halmashauri ya aina mbali mbali kwa kujitolea kuwalipa wanariadha wetu ili waweze kuendelea na michezo Lakini kuwalipa wanariadha pesa wakati wako na nguvu za kufanya kazi ya aina nyingine, ni jambo ambalo halina maana.MR. BIDU (CTD.):Ingefaa mchezajj hnyu awe akilipwa allowance kidogo ili awe aki jua kwamba akiifanyia Kenya kazi nzuri, atakapozeeka atapewa bakshishi kwa kazi yake. Kwa ninaiunga Hoja hii mkono kikamilifu, na nina akika kwamba rafiki yangu, Waziri, pia ataiunga mkono bila tashwishi yo yote. Ni haki kumshukuru kila mtu anayefanya vizuri.Ninashukuru kwa sababu wachezaji hodari hupewa nishani na wakizifaa wanajulikana kote duniani kwamba walifanya kazi nzuri, lakini tunaomba wachezaji hawa, wanapozeeka na pengine kuwa vipofu, wafanyiwe kitu fulani ili wawe wakijua kwamba hata ingawa watazeeka na kuwa vipofu, watalipwa marupurupu kwa lile jasho walilolitoa kwa niaba ya Kenya. Ni haki kabisa kuwatambua wachezaji wetu na kuwapa malipo ya uzeeni. Ingefaa kuwe na hazina fulani ya kuwasaidia wachezaji ambao wameleta sifa katika Jamhuri yetu wanapozeeka. Sio lazima walipwe wakifikia umri wa miaka 55, kwa sababu katika michezo huwezi kufikia umri huu bado ukiwa unacheza. Kunafaa kuwa na mpango wa kumshukuru mchezaji anapoleta sifa hapa ili aweze kufurahi pamoja na jamii yake. Hatutakuwa tukifanya haki ikiwa tutamwacha ovyo tu mchezaji ambaye ameiletea Kenya nzima sifa.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kuna pesa nyingi zinazofujwa. ovyo ovyo hapa na pale, na tukiguzia jambo hili, tunaambiwa kwamba Wizara fulani na fulani zimetumia pesa zaidi ya kiasi zilichopewa. Pesa hizi zinazofujwa ovyo ovyo zingefanyiwa mpango zikatumiwa kuwapa bakshishi wachezaji ambao wameleta sifa katika nchi yetu. Kwa hivyo, ninaomba jambo ili liangaliwe vizuri kwa sababu kila mtu, hata sisi waheshimiwa Wabunge, huona raha sifa ikija katika Kenya. Ingefaa tuwashikilie kabisa coaches wetu, na hatufai kuwa na ule mpango wa caretaker committees. Kila mara kunapotokea jambo ndogo tu, unasikia kwamba caretaker committee imeundwa ambapo tunawachagua watu wasio na ujuzi wa michezo na kuwaweka katika kamati hiyo. Ingefaa tuliangalie jambo hili sana kwa sababu linayarudisha nyuma maendeleo ya michezo. Ni lazima tuhakikishe kwamba wale watu tunaowaweka katika kamati hizi ni wenye ujuzi wa kazi iliyopo. Sioni ni kwa sababu gani mtu ambaye alikuwa na high blood pressure na asiyecheza anafanywa kuwa mwenyekiti wa kamati kama hii na hali hajui.hata vile, kandanda.MR. BIDU (CTD. ) :	huchezwa. Jambo hili la caretaker. committees linatuharibia michezo, na hii ndiyo sababu tunashindwa kila siku tunapokwenda kucheza kandanda na timu nyingine. Kwa hivyo, naiomba Wizara ya Utamaduni na Huduma za Jamii iliangalie jambo hili sana na kuhakikisha kwamba hakuna ye yote anayeteuliwa kuwa mwenyekiti wa kamati kama hii eti kwa sababu yeye ni mkubwa tu na hali hajui kuiendesha michezo.Wakati mwingine, coaches wetu huwa ni wazungu wazee, na hali tuna Uhuru ambao unamaanisha kwamba tunajitosheleza wenyewe. Si kwamba hatuna watu katika Kenya ambao wana ujuzi wa kuwa coaches. Jambo hili la kumchukua mzungu ambaye amekataliwa ule kwao na kumwajiri halifai. Tunafaa kuwateua watu wetu ambao wanajua kazi hii. Kwa hivyo, ikiwa tunataka kumteua coach ambaye tunataka aikuze timu yetu ya taifa, anafaa kuwa na ujuzi. Hatufai kumteua mtu eti kwa sababu ametoka Ujerumani, kwa mfano. Wengine wa watu hawa huwa wameasi kule kwao na wakakimbilia hapa.kwetu. Pengine watu hawa huwa wamefanya timu zao kushindwa halafu wakakimbilia hapa Kenya. Sifa yetu imekuwa kubwa, lakini inasemekana kwamba ukimsifu mgema, hulitia pombe maji. Kwa hivyo, tusije tukasifiwa sana kiasi kwamba tunaiharibu sifa yetu. Tunafaa kuwa macho wakati wote, huku tukikumbuka ni kwa nini wachezaji wetu hutuletea sifa. Pia, tunahitaji kufikiria kile tutawapa wachezaji hawa ili wengine waweze kutaka kuingia katika michezo.Namwomba Waziri wa Utamaduni na Huduma za Jamii aiunge Hoja hii mkono kikamilifu atakaposimama kujibu. Tunataka kuitengeneza Kenya iwe nchi sawa sawa, yenye sifa na inayojivuniwa zaidi.Kwa hayo machache, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, naunga mkono. </NEWSPEECH>(Question proposed)<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURE RESOURCES (MR. SAID-HEMED ) Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, mimi vile vile ningependa kujiunga pamoja na wenzangu katika kuiunga mkono Hoja hii. tumeyasikia mengi ambayo yamekwishatajwa na waheshimiwa Wabunge walioongea hapo awali. Kitu  muhimu ambacho tunahitaji kukifikiria ni kwamba wachezaji wa Kenya wanaocheza mpira, wanaokimbia na kucheza michezo mingineyo,	 kwa kucheza kwa ushujaa, ujasiri na uhodari wao, wameweza kuinua jina la nchi hii katika ulimwengu mzimaTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES ( MR. SAID-HEMED) (CTD. ):Na kuipa nchi hii sifa. Nchi yetu imekwishajulikana katika riadha, kandanda na michezo mingine kadha. Wachezaji hawa hawafai kuachiliwa ovyo tu na Serikali, yetu. Tulikuwa nao wachezaji kama vile Kipchoge Keino, Kandege, Elijah Lidonde na wengineo ambao hawako michezoni leo, bali wanazunguka barabarani tu bila lo lote la kufanya. Hakuna ye yote aliyewafikiria na kuona ni kitu gani ambacho tungefanya ili kuwahifadhi watu hawa wasije kuhangaika katika maisha yao.Kila kunapokuwa na michezo ya Olympics, world cup au michezo ya Jumuhia ya Madola, wachezaji wetu huihudhuria na kuridi hapa na nishani za dhahabu, lakini kile tunachofanya ni kuwapa publicity kubwa wakifika hapa. Tunawapiga picha nyingi, halafu jambo hilo humalizika. Mchezaji huenda akapata nishani ya dhahabu mara mbili au tatu, lakini atakapozeeka hataweza kucheza tena kwa kuwa wale wanaomfuata ni vijana walio na nguvu zaidi na bidii nyingi, na hawa ndio watakaocheza siku zifuatazo. Mchezaji huyo ni lazima aondoke michezoni na kuwaachia vijana kazi hiyo.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES(Mr. Said-Hemed)(Ctd);Bw. Naibu Spike wa Muda, haifai kuisahau kasi nzuri ambayo inefanywa na hawa wanariadha wetu. Tusiwachukue kama watu ambao hawakufanya cho chote cha manufaa katika nohi hii. Kwa mfano tunaye mlinda lango au goalkeeper kama Bw. Mahamoul Abbass. Alikuwa akifanya kazi katika kampuni ya Kenya Airways. Huyu ni mtu ambaye ameiletea nchi hii sifa karowa katika mambo ya kandanda. Alikuwa goalkeeper hedari sara. Hata wakati mnoja wakati penoti silipopogwa yeye binafsi aliweza kuiokoa nehi hii. Lakini utaona kwamba alifanya kosa ndoge ambalo Kenya Airways ingeweza kulipunza. Baada ya kosa kilo yeye alifukuawa kazini moja kwa moja. Yeye ana mke na watoto ma ana taabu nyingi sana. Pia utaona kwamba watu katika nehi hii hufanya makosa makubwa sana lakini makosa hayo hufichwa. Kwa hivyo, kisa na maana.ai kwamba Sw. Abbass alichukua tiketi ya ndege na cadala ya kumpa mamake au babake alimpa ndugu yake na kumbe hicho kilikuwa kinyume ma taeatibu yz za Kenya Airways . Sasa badala ya kuambiwa arudishe pesa hizo au thamani ya tiketi, alifutwa kazi, Kwa hivyo hi lazima mambo kama haya yaangaliwe. Yafaa tuwasaidie hawa watu ambac wanailetea sifa nchi hii katika. Mambo ya michezo. Yafaa watuhawa wapeme kitu cha kumatika moyo wakucheza zaidilili waweze kuiletea nchi hii sifa zaidi. Ni lazima watu hawa wapewe usaidizi baada ya kustaafu kutoka michezoni.kwa hivyo, mimi ningependa kuiunga mkono Hoja	hii kwa sababu wakati unefika ambapo ni lazima Wizara inayohusika pamoja na. Serikali, iangalie ni njia gani ambayo inawesa kutumiwa ili kuwasaidia hawa ndugu zatu ambao wameiletea nchi hii sifa kubwa katika ulimwengu. </NEWSPEECH>MR. TARAR: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to support this motion which is very timely. I would like to congratulate the Mover of this Motion for bringing up this Motion at this time. I would also like to join the previous speakers in supporting this Motion.	Kenya is known all over the world because of our sportsmen and women who have put the country on the map of the world. Kenya has been leading in the world of sports. In the 1940s Kenya used to lead in the East African athletics meetings and it has been leading almost all the time.MR. TARAR (ctd.): Although we have very many heroes in this country, you will find that there is no single school or sports field that has been named after them. Something should be done to ensure that these people are remembered by our future generations. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, teachers are the promoters of sports. If this is so then there is need for a teachers sports training college where the teachers can go for in-service courses in sports and sports administrators and trainers can be trained. This is because at the moment we do not have such a college where such people can for training on all sports aspects.Perhaps our universities could also have faculties that deal with sports. Sports should be a discipline that can be pursued up to degree level so that we can have in future fully qualified people to run sports in the country. I think we also require sports officers at the divisional level to promote sports. For example you will find that football is more concentrated in the Western Province whereas if we had trainers at the divisional level the sport could spread to the other parts of this country so that we get players from these areas who can excel in football. These officers that I am talking about would be people who would be visiting schools and advising and helping teachers to train the young-future sportsmen and women. At the moment I am sorry that this sport is not well co-ordinated in this country. So we require the Ministry- of Culture and Social Services to pay special attention to the training of sportsmen in the country.I think we need to pay special attention to international sports meetings because it is in these meetings where we can use our athletes to promote our products like tea and coffee. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>AN HON. MEMBER: And miraa! </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. TARAR: And Miraa for Meru! The Ministry could sponsor these athletes by providing them with sports gear on which our products are-advertised. They can even be used to promote our tourism abroad. What we only need is co-ordination of the various aspects by either the Ministry of Culture andMR. TARAR (ctd.):Social Services or the Commissioner for sports in these international meetings.I also think that—<NEWSPEECH>MR. GALGALLO: On a point of order, Sir. I do not wish to interrupt the hon. Member who is on the floor but. I am- surprised that this Motion is being discussed without a representative from, the Ministry of Culture and Social Services. I wonder whether this Motion merits any debate. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>AN HON. MEMBER: The Minister for Local Government is here. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. GALGALLO: I am talking about the Ministry of Culture and Social Services. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge) : what is your point of order? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. GALGALLO: I am questioning the merit of debating this Motion when there is nobody from the Ministry of Culture and Social Services to take note of the hon. Members expressions. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): We have what we call "collective responsibility." </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. GALGALLO: That is true, Sir, but it should be noted that the Ministry of Culture and Social Services is not represented in this House when a Motion that is directed to it is being debated here when they are fully aware. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. wabuge) : Yes, your point is taken but I explained, that we have what we call "collective responsibility. Some Members of the Front Bench are in the House and I think they will attention the "Minister concerned. Whatever notes they are taking will be given to the Minister when he comes to reply.	Let us proceed. </NEWSPEECH>	<NEWSPEECH>MR. TARAR: As I was saying, we can make use of our international athletes in advertising our produce and tourism wherever they go. The Ministry should also come up with a policy which will enable our international athletes who win medals for our country, to be rewarded handsomely. They should be given cash awards when they win medals as such a gesture will give them more incentive.MR. TARAR (ctd) 	The Ministry should start right away to work out modalities for paying these heroes and heroines their pension. Those who excelled some years back should be included so that they benefit also. I would also like to congratulate the new Commissioner for Sports who has been an outstanding sportsman for our country. Dr. Boit, the Commissioner for Sports, is a qualified person and we expect a lot of improvement in sports. He has had an illustrious career as an athlete by winning a lot of medals and fane. With his appointment, I believe things will change for the better.with those few remarks, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER PUBLIC WORKS (Mr.Maiyani): Thank you, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my colleagues in supporting this very humane Motion which is seeking financial benefits for great sportsmen who have ended up unemployed and financially embarrassed upon retirement.I have lived in Europe for many years and I know that sportsmen are given a very special place in society. They are also organised in such a way that they have means of earning a living like any other citizen so that they do not get frustrated and abandon their sporting skills.		THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Maiyani)(Ctd.):Here in Kenya, as it has already been said by previous speakers, we have very many talented sportsmen and women and during their youthful days they gave to this country a very good name in the sporting world. There is no doubt about that. We have seen them go to many countries abroad and come back with many medals. They are given such wonderful publicity. But there is something very serious lacking concerning financial security for these people. As soon as they retire from their: respective games - and mind you they do not go very far beyond the age of 35 or 40 - the younger ones take their places. This is quite natural. But then what happens to their future? Therefore, we should urge the Ministry of Culture and Social Services and others to examine this serious problem and see to it that these people are either employed in various Ministries or Parastatal. Also, a fund should be set up to help these people after they retire from their respective games.Also, Sir, these people are human beings and when they are employed one may make a little mistake disciplinary action unless caught up with a serious criminal offence, should take human consideration into account. I say so because; I have one great sportsman of our time in mind called Mohamed Abbas who was employed by the Kenya Airways Limited. In that organisation, all members of staff are entitled to a free ticket - I understand - forth themselves or any member of their family, if I am right. So, Mohamed Abbas got a ticket for his brother, but mistakenly, in that list of members of the family, a brother or sister is not included.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (MR. Maiyani ) (CTD):If I am right, Mohamed Abbas got a ticket for his brother by mistake. He did not know that a brother or sister is not allowed to be helped because he had been very busy working and going to his sporting ground. Now, it is a long time since he was interdicted and has never been reinstated in his job. Such a great and famous goalkeeper in this country, who has a wife and children, is now suffering for a very small mistake. He could have been made to pay for that ticket if his brother was not entitled to that kind of help instead of being interdicted and thrown in the Nairobi streets.I would urge the Ministries of Culture and Social Services and Transport and Communications to see how they can help this great sportsman. If he did not commit a serious crime, his case should be reviewed with a view to giving back his job or getting him another job so that he can the morale to play and bring victories to this country.With those few words, I beg to support the Location. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KAMUYU: Thank you Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to, this very important Motion regarding our sportsmen and sportsmen and their future. Kenya made, its name internationally as one of the most outstanding sporting nations in the world. The essense of this Motion is to encourage particularly the future generation so that they know while they aim at making good names for themselves and carrying the Kenyan flag high in all international, meetings and sporting associations, this Government also	thinks rather very seriously about our sportsmen, especially with regard to their future.We have seen, many outstanding sportsmen in this countryMR. KAMUYU (CTD): from the days of Kipchoge Keino and more recently the likes of wangila, who has become a very outstanding sportsmen of this nation. Unless we assure our sportsmen and sportswomen that something will be done for them after they have retired, we are going to deflate their morale. If we do that, the sporting future of this nation will suffer. Let us take, as an example, the case of Stephen Muchoki. As a professional promoter of boxing I feel hurt by his case. My feeling, and that of other sport lovers in this nation, is that we must encourage those have triumphed internationally. Stephen Muchoki was one of Kenya's most outstanding boxers, but now he has been forgotten and is rotting in the background.MR. KAMUYU (ctd. ) :		He was the last person to be awarded the Order of the Burning Spear by the late President kenyatta. Soon after that he just withered away and today we do not hear anything about Stephen Muchoki. Where is Muchoki? I am sure that there are other Stephen Muchokis of this nation who have withered in the background. What is this nation doing about such people?Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I know of another very pathetic case. As I said, I am a professional boxing promoter; that is one of my hobbies. There is one case of one Steve Moi–––– </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Muturia): Are you a boxer? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KAMUYU: You can try me later! </NEWSPEECH>As I was saying, there is one case of one Steve Moi who was a very outstanding boxer of this nation. In one of his international contents he got hit somewhere just above his eyes and, soon after that, he lost his eyesight completely. Today he lives in the slums of Mathare blind without food or shelter or anybody to care for him, yet he carried the flag of this nation high internationally. I personally intend to organise a small Harambee for that particular former boxer, and I do appeal to sport lovers in this House and outside to join me in that very worthy while project.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, sir, it is about time that the Ministry of Culture and Social Services gave more serious, attention to the current sportsmen of this nation. If we do not take that action now, this nation will go down the road as far as sports are concerned, something that, is going to be an international shame. For example, Ghana takes a lot of interest in their sportsmen, whether in soccer or in athletics or boxing. Sportsmen in that country are given some donations while they are active and are also looked after when they retire. Unless this is done here so that we can encourage the future sportsmen, the future of this country in terms of sports will, be very bad.MR. KAMUYU (ctd.):	In the area of soccer, many African countries have what they call semi- professionals. The concerned Ministries take particular interest in these soccer players and give them certain allowances so that they encourage them. Therefore, it is about time that the Kenya Football Federation got itself streamlined. Sport is a very vital public relation of any nation. When we look at the economy of a country, we should also look at its socilological nature. Sport is the major public relation.With those few words, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion. </NEWSPEECH><HEADER>ADJOURNMENT</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Hon.

On the contrary, I am happy to inform the an hon. Member that Ksh 20,000 have been provided in the forward budget, for the facility in the 1950/91 Financial Year. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SALAT: While- appreciating the answer given by the Assistant Minister, I would like to state that the tender for the construction of this dispensary was awarded late last year. To-date the tender has not been awarded. What has delayed the rewarding of this tender? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. GODANA: As the hon. Member has indicated, funds were allocated and tenders were advertised and opened on 2nd February, 1990 but have not been adjudicated. The reason, we understand, was that the Treasury, through a circular letter to districts, had frozen all new expenditures. To confirm the commitment of my Ministry to the project, we have allocated K£20,000 in the forward budget. The project is, therefore, still on. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SALAT: Sir, can the Assistant Minister tell this House how much money had initially been allocated for this project? It can be given to the hon.

It is a very easy matter. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SALAT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister is speaking too fast and I cannot grasp what he is saying. Can he repeat his reply slowly so that I can follow what he is saying? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. GODANA: Sir, I said that we did not think that/initial allocation of funds to this project was part of the Question and I therefore do not have that figure at hand.

MALEBE asked the Minister for Environment and Natural Resources whether he could provide a list of all existing exclusive prospecting and special licences with names of geologists or i mining engineers who have been engaged by the licensees, for the purpose of supervising exploration work in the area of their prospects.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. Hemed): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. A total, of 46 exclusive prospecting and special licences are currently extant. These comprise seven exclusive prospecting licences E.P.L.S and 39 special licences. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: Sir, I wanted to be given a list of alexisting/exclusive prospecting and special licences. The Assistant Minister has not given us the names of geologists or mining engineers who have been engaged by these licensees. Can he answer the question properly? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. HEMED: Sir, I have the list of names here but it is just too long and it may take me more than one hour to go through. I will Table it here. </NEWSPEECH>(Mr. Hemed laid the list on the Table)<NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: For the benefit of the country, could the Assistant Minister the requirement of the Mining Act? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. HEMED: Mr. Speaker, Sir, all licensees have complied with the Mining Act and I have a comprehensive list of names here which contains more information than what the hon. Member has asked for. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Sir. If the Assistant Minister is convinced that he has provided the right information, why is he afraid of reading out the names? This is because I have evidence that most of these licensees have not engaged geologists or mining engineers to supervise exploration work which is a. necessity. Why can he not read out the names? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. EBMED: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if Mr. Malebe has that evidence, can he give it to us so that we disapprove him by the list I have here? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: On a  point of order, Sir. The Assistant Minister is my friend. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>AS HON. MEMBER: So what? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: The hon. Questioner wanted to know the names of these people. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. HEMED: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the names of the licensees are contain in this list. First of all, hon. Malebe should declare - his interest in this matter. Secondly, if he has documentary evidence to prove that these licensees have not engaged geologists, let him give us the names of those companies. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIILU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for the hon. Assistant Minister to refuse to give the list of names of the people: as per the Question which is the property of the House? <NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SAID-HEMKD: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the list is just too long. It bears all the answers that hon. Male be is asking for. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. J.N. MURGAI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, on a point, of order. First of all, the hon. Questioner claims that he has not been given a written reply to his Question. Then the Assistant Minister stands to read a written reply which he had and he says that he cannot read the whole answer because there is no time to do so. Is this not just a way of twisting things? Can we get your guidance that he should read all the names? This is a Question in the House and which is the property of the House. Ye need to know whether he is twisting something in the Question and that could be the reason why he did not give a written answer to the hon. Questioner. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Order! Order!" Once the list of names of the people has been laid on the Table there is no need for the hon. Assistant Minister to read it. It becomes public record. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZAHDI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Questioner had given notice for the names specifically to be given to the House. It is also unusual that before the House requests for the list of names to be laid on the Table the hon. Assistant Minister ought to have laid it on the Table first. What is he fearing? Can we have the list of names read, to the House? There is ample time for the House . We have never followed such a procedure before. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Unless the hon. Assistant Minister is trying to hide something from this particular Question, he should read the list to us.MR. MALEBE (Ctd.):I know that, we have very few-geologists in the country. The hon. Assistant Minister has given the number of licences as 46. However, I am very, sure and I can also bring documentary evidence that these licensees are very few. In fact, they are either two or three Others are not geologists. So, they have not fulfilled the requirements of the Mines Act. So, could the hon. Assistant Minister read the list of the names of the licensees just for the interest of the public and also the House? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Order! Order! I think for the interest of the public, that is why that paper has been in id on the Table. It is for public information. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.GALGALLO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. That I want to get clear here is the issue of whether it is the Chair that authorised the Assistant Minister to lay papers on the Table or he did it on his own volition. We want him to answer the Question, but instead he chose to lay the paper on the Table even without your permission! Can you guide us and assist here? </NEWSPEECH>(applause)<NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Order! Order! I am very ready to guide the House here. Next Question, please, Mr. Falana </NEWSPEECH>(laughter)Question No.194<HEADER>Implementation of ASAL Livestock Project in Saku</HEADER>MR. FALANA asked the Minister for Livestock Development why the ASAL Livestock Project earmarked for Jaldessa and Kalacha has not been implemented.<NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Mwangale ): Mr. Speaker Sir, on behalf of the Minister for Livestock Development, I beg to reply.The proper name for the project that the hon. Member is referring to is ASAl/KLDP which stands for the Arid, Semi-Arid Lands Kenya Livestock Development Programme covering ten districtsTHE MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Ctd.): 	of northern Kenya; Kalacha and Jaldessa in Marsabit District are also in the programme. The overall implementation, of the programme has had some delay because of the conditions Which had been imposed by the European Economic Community (E.E.C.) precedent to the disbursement of the funds. In other words, there were certain conditions which had been laid down by the E.E.C. because this was a grant - and we had to meet those conditions first.I would also like to say that the actual implementation date which was agreed upon between ourselves and the E.E.C. was supposed to be September last year, 1989. Therefore, the project itself is not late. Some of the conditions include putting in place of a proper accounting system to ensure proper utilisation of the programme money. I am glad to announce that this main condition has already been met by opening up of special district accounts through which funds should be channelled to specific district projects, like Kalacha and Jaldessa. This is now in progress and from the beginning of next month implementation will take place.Another condition was for the appointment of a financial controller and I have now got a financial controller from the Price Waterhouse in place in Isiolo. Also, we required that each district should have a proper accounting system and that one is also in place. I am also glad to report that all the ten districts that are involved in this programme have already received tractors and Land Rovers from the E.E.C.MR. FALANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Minister for his detailed answer, we had held public rallies and told the people that the Government had wisely thought of starting the project immediately. We did this some time, early in February this year. Could the Minister be very precise now because everything hasMR.FALA1TA (Ctd..)already, been finalised and tell the House exactly when the construction of the physical facilities would start? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWANGALE: Mr.Speaker, Sir, in all the districts, the implementation will start from 1st July this year. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Okay. Next Question, Mr. Mate. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 230<HEADER>Lowering of Education Charges in Embu</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Mate not here? Next Question, Mr.Wambua. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 221<HEADER>Repair of Telephone Facilities in Mwala</HEADER>MR. WAMEUA asked the Minister for Transport and Communications since most of the telephones in Mwala Constituency are out of order and telephone posts along Masii, Vyulya and Katheka lines have already fallen off, if he could direct the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications personnel to repair these lines, particularly Masii, vyulya to Katheka Secondary School line .<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Mutwol): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. The work of rectifying telephone faults, which includes replacement of fallen poles, is a continuous exercise carried out by the personnel of Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation. However, during the rainy season, the speed of rectification, of these faults in some areas is usually hampered by impassable roads which make the transportation of materials and personnel to the problem areas very difficult. The foregoing is what had affected telephone lines in Masii, Vyulya and Katheka. areas during the rainy season. However, despite of the foregoing problems, rectification of the faulty lines and replacement of poles started in the month of March this year. At the moment, all the faulty lines have been rectified, which include Masii, Vyulya to Katheka Secondary School line. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAMBUA-: Mr. Speaker,Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for his good reply, I would like to inform him that there are some telephone posts which fell down in May, 1989. I wonder why it took from 1939 to March, 1990 for the work to start. The issue of rain that he raises does not come in because these telephone lines are yet to work properly. Could the Assistant Minister direct that the posts be re-erected and the lines fixed? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUTWOL Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do appreciate what the hon. Member is saying. It is due to the vastness of his constituency that our small post office personnel takes a long time to complete work in his area. However, I can assure him that we Will ask the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporations to re-erect whatever posts have fallen down in that area. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, telephone owners in that area have been receiving telephones bills threatening disconnection of their telephones and yet they did not have telephones for a whole year. How come that telephones services will be cut.when the telephones are operating? Could the Assistant Ministers order that these telephones bills be withdrawn? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUTOL: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not understand what have fallen down, then being used and post office does not charge for services which have not been used. I, therefore, do not agree with the hon. Member that people are being charged for telephones which are not working. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAMEUA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am saying what I know: People have been charged, for telephones services which they have not used. So I am asking the Assistant Minister to order his people in Machakos to withdraw all the telephone bills because the telephones have not been working. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUTWOL: Mr. Speaker, Sir, unlesss the hon. member is ready to prove his point I cannot do that. There are standing charges made for the telephone equipment; maybe that is what the hon. Member is calling telephone bills. Otherwise, if the telephone line has fallen down you cannot make a call or receive one. I therefore do not see how you can be charged when your line is out of order. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 220<HEADER>Shortage of Parking Facilities in Nairobi</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>Mr. Speaker: Mrs. NdeteI is not in; so let us go to </NEWSPEECH>Mr. P.G.

Mr. Jalang'o </NEWSPEECH>(Question dropped)Question No. 222Grading of Hoad (C28)MR. JALAITG'O asked the Minister for Public Works what urgent measures his Ministry is taking to make the road, between Aram Market and Luanda Kotieno (C28) passable in order to facilitate the movement of passengers and perishable goods from Luanda Kotieno to KLsuau.THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC Works (Mr. Mioei): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Ministry has scheduled to grade and gravel patch Arram to Luanda Kotieno section of road 028 soon after the current rains subside.<NEWSPEECH>MR. JALANG'O: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not quite sure of what the Minister, means by "after the current rains subside". I as far I am aware, the last, time the rains were experienced in that area was on 18th May, 1990. So, now that rains have subsided in the area can the Minister start work immediately? </NEWSPEECH>MR. MIBEI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will check whether it is true that rains have subsided and order that the work starts.MR. JALANG’O: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not for the Assistant Minister to check. I live in that constituency and I left the place yesterday. I am an hon. Member and if I tell the Minister that the last time it rained in that was on 18th May, 1990 he should take my word. Now, assuming that he has accepted my word of honour, can he order that the work commences on that road immediately?MR. MIBEI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, although I trust the hon. Member, I need to cross ckeck this information with my officers in the field.MR. JALANG’O: Mr. Speaker, Sir, between April and May, 1990 the fishermen in that area lost fish worth Shs.650, 000/- because of the inaccessibility of the road. So, when I am not asking Minister to grade that road because so that passengers can travel, but because of the heavy loss the fishermen in that area have incurred. In view of this heavy loss, will the Minister, as a matter of urgency, accept to grade the road and commence work on it immediately?MR. MIBEI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I accept that. The hon. Member may be pleased to also know that a contract for the bituminisation of this road between Ndori and Owimoi has also been awarded.Question No. 226<HEADER>Grading of Roads in Mwatate</HEADER>MR. MCHARO asked the Minister for Public Works what glans he has to repair and improve roads in Mwatate Division:-1. Kighombo-Rong’e Juu2. Dembwa-Wafu-Kungu3. Mose-Wafe4. Matate-Mwachawaza, and5. Sanga-Mrughua<NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Mibei): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Kighombo Rong'e Juu Road (D54 0), which is 12.4 kilometres long as well as Dembwa-Wafu-Kungu Road (E689) , which is 14 kilometres long were graded and drainages improved in Kay, 1990. My Ministry has no plans to grade Mwatate-Mwachawza Road because it is not 	classified and so the Ministry has no budgetary provision for its maintenance. Moseafu and Sang Mrughua Roads in Mwatate Division were not in priority list for roads grading during the current financial year. However, I promise the hon. member that these roads will be graded in the next financial year, 1990/91 starting in July, 1990. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KUBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am surprised to hear the Minister talking about priorities in grading the roads. Grading roads is a maintenance job and I understand that all classified roads are supposed to be graded annually. Can the Minister, therefore, tell us why these roads are not being graded while we have the graders and only diesel is required in that area? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MIBEI: Mr.Speaker, Sir, we grade roads on a programme. However, as I have said, the Mwatate-Mwachawaza road will not be graded because it has not been classified. The hon. Member will recall that we supplied two graders to the area, which we can make use of as long as fuel is avaiable. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWACHARO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I agree that as far as the Kigho.nbo-Rong'e Juu road is concerned, a grader has been seen there and that a little bit of grading has been done, but there is no drainage at all. I would like to inform the hon. Minister that if it rains today the roads are going to be impassable again due to lack of drainage. I put this question because these roads have not been graded for a long time, and as hon. KUBO said, the roads which are considered not to be high-priority ones by the Ministry are so considered by the local people. I am getting a little bit worried because these are priority roads as far as I am concerned and the machines are there. Since the financial year is just about to begin next month, I do not see why efforts should not be made to grade the roads. I would like the Minister to urge the roads engineer in the area to give these roads due recognition because they are the ones I personally use and, therefore, to me they are priority roads. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MIBEI: We shall do that, Sir. I am glad that the hon. Member saw the grader at the site- I think work should have been started. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Let us go back to hon. Mate's Question if he is in. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 230<NEWSPEECH>MR. KAGWIMA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I ask this Question on behalf of hon. Mate, I wish to apologise for having been out when it was called the first time.<HEADER>Lowering of Education Charges in Embu</HEADER>MR. KAGWIMA, on behalf of Mr. Mate, asked the Minister for Education whether, since the tuition, boarding, activity, development fund, equipment, caution and medical fees (charges) levied by Government maintained, assisted and Harambee secondary schools in Embu District are too high for the parents, he could, in consultration with the board of governors, lower these charges with effect from next term.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): Mr. Speaker, Sir,I beg to reply.The Government tuition fees charged in low-cost secondary schools are KShs.450/- and KShs.900/- for boarding. For high cost schools, the Government charges KShs.450/- for tuition and KShs.1,800/- for boarding. The rest of the fees are decided by the board of governors and the Parents/Teachers Association. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KAGWIMA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for the answer he has given, I am sure that he will agree with me that in the past school fees and other monies paid to schools used to cover textbooks but, as we stand today, students are buying their own books. In view of this fact, why can the Ministry not reduce the current fees? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have given a breakdown of the fees charged by the Government for both tuition and boarding. The rest of the money that is required by schools is decided upon by the board of governors and the Parents Teachers Association. So, the Ministry does not come in any way. The hon. Member should approach any school board of governors and, if they find that they can buy food, at a cheaper price and the same can be done with uniform and other requirements, I do not see why they cannot reduce the fees. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, bearing in mind that the parents are of low income, and the Ministry being the intermediary, between the board of governors and the parents, why can the Ministry not intervene, and reduce the fees so that education can be accessible to all? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already said that the fees charged by the Government are fixed, and I have even gone further to give the details about the figures. All hon. Members of Parliament are members of boards of governors of schools in their respective constituencies. So, since hon. Members sit on those boards, they should be able to tell the rest of the members the reasons why the fees should go down. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is it in order, therefore, for the Government to keep quiet when school boards of governors chargeMR.MALEBE(.ctd):exorbitant fees to the parents while the whole idea of education is to encourage everybody to be educated? Why should the Government leave parents to be exploited by boards of governors? Although hon. Members of Parliament are supposed to be members of school boards of governors, there are some boards which might be charging exorbitant fees unnecessarily. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KARAURI: Maybe, Sir, the hon. Member can give us an example of one board of governors that is charging exorbitant fees. As far as the Ministry is aware, schools in Embu are charged fairly reasonable fees ranging from KShs. 4, 900/- to KShs.7, 000/. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MCHARO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the time has come when the Ministry of Education must do something about the long fees statements children are given by schools. Whenever we look at the fees statements for many schools, we see items called Development Fund, PTA Fund, School Equipment Fund and so on. As far as I know, all these development funds are supposed to be raised by parents during Harambee meetings and not to be asked for from the parents through the children. Since the children are sent home when they do not take these fees to school, can the Ministry make a very clear statement regarding the charges? As far as I am concerned, the fact that hon. Members of Parliament are members of school boards of governors does not assist in anything.	 </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government directed that development fund should not be charged to students and that that kind of money should be collected through Harambee. If there is any school charging development fund that is wrong. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KUBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister is very much aware why school boards of governors charge money in the name of all these funds, the fact of the matter is that the Ministry has withdrawn grants to schools. Will the Assistant Minister tell us how the Ministry expects boards of governors to raise enough money to keep the schools going? What is the Ministry going to do to ensure that schools are running well financially? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Education has not withdrawn grants to   schools; we continue to give grants to schools. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.

KINYANJXJI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Attorney-General the following Question by Private Notice(a) When will Mr. David Mutua Kinuthia be paid damages assessed in the Civil Case No. 1284 of 1988, Nairobi?(b) Since judgement was entered on 15th- August 1989, what is delaying the settlement of this payment despite reminders on 3rd November, 1989 and 30th March, 1990? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Civil Case No.1284 of 1988 at the High Court of Kenya at Nairobi was a suit filed by Mr. David Mutua Kinuthia for injuries he sustained during a shooting instance by the Kenya Police on 1st April, 1985 along the Gigiri ridgeTHE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Mr. Muli) (ctd.)Road, while he was driving his vehicle registration number KKY 880. That case came up for hearing on 1st August, 1989, and judgement was delivered on 15th August, 1989, in favour of the plaintiff, Mr. David Mutua Kinuthia, for the sum of Kshs.427, 480.00 Delay in paying that amount has been caused by the advocates of the claimant, who have, not extracted the decree and a certificate of court in accordance with section 21 of the courts, For my own transmission to the Commissioner of Police. However, despite that, X have already forwarded a copy of the judgement to the Commissioner of Police requesting him to forward the money to me so that I can pay the plaintiff with the approval of the Treasury. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, after the judgement has been passed who should make sure that it is implemented? Since payments ordered by the courts appear to be delayed undully, what steps is the Attorney General taking to ensure that such payments are paid in time? Can he also tell us when that specific payment shall be made? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MULI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I give hon. P.K. Kinyanju: an open cheque, whose duty is it to go and cash it? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KUBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Question has been raised because the Government normally does not pay compensation immediately the judgement is passed. There has even been cases where the Public Accounts Committee has questioned that by the Government, because the Government ends up paying a lot of money as interests. Therefore, would the Attorney General advise all the Government departments to the money day as soon as judgement is passed against them because if is not paid on time, it will be paid plus interest, and that is a waste of public funds. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MULI: Sir, that is generalisation which is outside the context of this Question. My hon. colleague is lawyer, who knows that the Government is always ready to meet its liabilities and obligations to the wananchi as soon as all the machineries by the court and the lawyers who may be involved have been exhausted. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KUBO: Sir, I am not making wild general accusations. I asked a similar Question last year, and up to now, that person has not yet been paid. Therefore, I am not generalising, it is something which is well known. Everybody is aware that there is that delay in the Government. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MULI: That is another generalisation – everybody knows about it who does not knows about it? The Government is ready to honour its own obligations and liabilities to the machineries that have been set up by our rules have been exhausted. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the Attorney General is evading that issue by talking about the Government machineries. We know that there is a machinery which should be well followed. This is only one case, but there many other cases. I can bring documents of a case where such payments were delayed for more than two years. Since the Attorneys-General knows that a given Government Ministry has been requested to effect payments, does he have any machineries to follo and make sure that such payments are paid promptly, because the affected wananchi are suffering? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MULI: I have already answered that supplementary question, although it has been generated regards this particular Question, the plaintiffs lawyer did not exhaust the machinery. He has not extracted the decree that is the document upon which payment is based. Unless that is done, thereMR.MULI(ctd.)might be funther delays,although I have taken some steps to pass on the judgement itself. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, would the Attorney General accept that on this specific Question, the lawyer concerned has been writing to the Attorney General's Chambers without getting any reply. I can quote two letters sent to the Attorney Generals Chamber by the lawyer, but the Attorney General's Chambers did not reply. That means that some of the delay was caused by the Attorney General's Chambers. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MULI: I do not agree with those wild allegations. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Sir, I am prepared to lay on the Table these two letters which were never replied to One was written by the plaintiffs lawyer on 3rd November, 1989, but there was no reply. The lawyer sent a reminder on 30th March, 1990, yet he did not receive any reply, and that is why the plaintiff came to me for assistance. Surely the Attorney General should admit that there are undue delays in his office. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MULI: I do not agree with those wild allegations that there is delay in my office. The letters that hon. P.K. Kinyanjui is talking about are not decrees. There are documents which quantify the amount payable, including costs and so on. Those documents are known as degrees and a certificates of court. The letters the hon. Member is talking about are not the proper documents, and therefore, they are irrelevant. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.

However, there is one more point which I would like to address myself to and this is with regard to the issue of procurement of tenders. This point was raised by hon. Dr. wameyo and I think I should make a comment on it I would like to that the operative circular regarding the procurement of tenders in Government is Treasury Circular No.5 of 1987 which clearly states the procedures for the procurement and disposal of Government stores and services.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the complaint me raised by hon. Dr. wameyo was that Accounting Officers are not following the laid down procedures. I can only say that in this particular respect where the Accounting Officers have not followed those procedures, it is the duty of the Public Accounts Committee to make the necessary recommendations for the appropriate action to be taken through the Treasury with regard to those who do not follow the laid down procedures.Mr. Speaker, Sir, another issue was raised by hon. Mwenje regarding the way money was spent during The Fourth All Africa Games. Perhaps I should first take this opportunity to congratulate hon. Kwenje joining the Front Bench. I suppose he will readily understand that there is a probe committee that was appointed to investigate into this matter and when it completes itsTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr.Keah) (ctd.):findings, the Report will be made public. This is what has been indicated in the Report by the Public Accounts Committee. In my concluding remarks, I would like to comment on a certain point raised by hon. Bidu that the Public Accounts Committee should be scrapped since it is a useless committee. I was surprised that hon. Bidu made such a remark in this House particularly because he is fully aware that the Public Accounts Committee is a committee of this August House. Therefore, it is really very surprising that an hon. Member of this House can disown himself by saying that the Public Accounts Committee should be scrapped. By saying this, he is, in fact, dis-owning himself. However, as we all know the Public Accounts Committee is appointed in every Session and if he is not satisfied with the function of one particular committee, he is at liberty to criticise it. This is the freedom we have in our democracy and the hon. Member has a right to criticise the committee. However, he should not disown it because it is his own committee.Mr. Speaker, Sir, perhaps I should enlight hon. Bidu by reminding him that the duty of the Public Accounts Committee is not to act as a prosecutor. This Committee receives the report from the Controller and Auditor-General, reviews the Report on behalf of the hon. Members of this House and then makes the appropriate recommendations far action to be taken. This Committee is the watch-dog of this August House and scrutinizes the financial vote for each Ministry so that where there are excess expenditures, it recommends the action to be taken. However, the work of the Public Accounts is not that of a prosecutor.Having said that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to highly commend the Public Accounts Committee for bringing almost up to date the accounts of the previous years. We have covered 1987/88 and the report on 1988/89 Accounts was tabled here only yesterday. So, we have really caught up and I would like to commend the Public Accounts Committee for the exemplary manner it has executed its responsibilities and for the speed with, which they have, carried out their work.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. TUVA: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chance to reply. I would like to say straightaway that although I am replying to the points raised on this Motion, the response from Government is what matters most. I would like to take this opportunity to thank hon. Members who have contributed to this Motion. Having said that, I would like to urge all hon. Members to take keen interest in the Reports of the Public Accounts Committee. I am saying this because the recommendations that have been made in the Report would enable this House to approve or not to approve some of the expenditure which is not very clear. Therefore, it is most important for hon. Members to read, this Report properly so that thsy can express their opinion regarding these recommendations. So far very few hon. Members have contributed to this Motion and since the quorum of the committee is only three aonbers, hon. Members should take more interest in the Report of the Public Accounts Committee. We do not want to pass a Report which was deliberated by only three hon. Members, without x thoroughly scrutinizing it.Mr. Speaker, Sir, some hon. Members suggested that where the committee has recommended that some officers should be charged, action should be taken try the police immediately. What is happening is that when the Accounting Officers give their evidence and the Committee recommends that somebody should be charged in a court of law, it is the responsibility of the Attorney-General, to whom the case is referred, to investigate the matter. However, somebody cannot be taken to court on the strength of the recommendations of the Committee. The parent Ministry is responsible for following up the recommendations of the Committee with the Attorney-General. Therefore, it is not possible as has been recommended by some of the hon.Members here, that action should be taken forthwith after the Public Accounts Committee has made its recocmendatiais. In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recommendations made by the Public Accounts Committee are followed up by Treasury memorandum which shows clearly what action has been taken by the different Ministries against the various officers who have been accused of embezzling or misusing Government finances. However, these Treasury memorandum take far too long before they come cut for action to be taken. Sometimes these Public Accounts Reports may cover severalMR. TUVA (Ctd.): - 		years and when the Treasury memorandum eventually come out, we find that some of the culprits are either dead, retired on their own will or on public interest.MR. TUVA (CTD.):Thus, the effect is not felt by, the people who are supposed to suffer as a result of their misdemeanor. Therefore, I urge the Treasury and parent Ministries to be faster in taking action against the people that we recommend for action either by the Treasury, the Attorney-General or the parent Ministry.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have said many times in this House that if Accounting Officers respond to the reference sheets sent to them by the Controller and Auditor-General in time, maybe the Controller and Auditor General's report will not be as big as it always appears to be because if Accounting Officers respond to these reference sheets in time, you will find that some of the problems that are raised by the Controller and Auditor-General are solved. I say so because in some cases, Accounting Officers respond to the reference sheets the night before they appear to give evidence to the Public Accounts Committee, and this shows laxity particularly on the part of the Accounting Officers in not responding in time.It is now about three or four years since the introduction of internal auditors in our various Ministries and departments, but it is funny to see that records, particularly those relating to bonded warehouses, which are accountable documents, are not properly kept, resulting in the Government losing a lot of money. I said this when I was moving the Motion, but I have to emphasize the need for the internal audit to be used properly so that the records of bonded warehouses are properly kept, in which case, proper taxation will be levied and the Government will not lose the amounts of money that we have been complaining about.There is one other point that I would like to emphasize. We have talked about this issue time and again and, in fact, the Attorneys-General promised about three years ago to act on it. The Government has been losing a lot of money through contracts involving foreigners in which there have been a lot of loopholes as a result of which the Government has been conned out of a lot of money. We urge the Attorney—General to train some of the people in his department or establish a special department to deal exclusively with international contracts so that we may stop losing money through being connedMR.TUVA (CTD.) :by these funny people from outside the country.It was recently brought to my notice that the Treasury appeared to be a bit angry with me when I pointed out the misuse of ex-gratia payments. What I said that it looks immoral to me and many other people in the country for people to pay tax and the money is used to assist some able-bodied people in the country to pay tax for their vehicles. However, I understand that the Treasury has now started gazetting the exemption of people who, under normal circumstances, would not qualify for exemption. If this continues to be done, we will have no more complaints. It is immoral for the Treasury to take money from wananchi's taxation and use it to assist some people who should be able to pay customs duty on their own.Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said, the people who are qualified enough to respond to the points that have been raised by hon. Members are Treasury officials. I personally do not have much to say, but there is one thing that I would like to remind civil servants particularly who, when they appear before the Public Accounts Committee, are asked who the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee is and, to my surprise, mention my name. I would like to emphasize here that I have Sever been the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. Therefore, those concerned should read the HANSARD and find out who is going to be the Chairman of the next Public Accounts Committee.With these few remarks, I would like to thank the latest Chairman, hon. John Kyalo, who is now a Minister. I would also like to congratulate one of the hon. Members of the latest Public Accounts Committee who has now been upgraded to an Assistant Minister, that is hon. Mwenje. The Committee is now short of one Member, but I think this will be filled in the near future. With, these remarks, I urge the House to adopt the Report of the Public Accounts Committee of 1987/88.(Question put and agreed to)<HEADER>BILL</HEADER>(Second-Reading)<HEADER>The Finance Bill</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR FINANCE (Mr. Keah): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move that the Finance Bill be now read a Second Time.The Bill before the House seeks to bring forth an Act of Parliament to amend the law relating to various taxes and duties. The object of this Bill is to increase the rate of excise duty on cigarettes and the rest of Value Added Tax on Stout and Beer. After careful consideration, His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance agreed to allow some price increases to manufacturers of beer and cigarettes, both of which are price controlled. In doing so, we took into account the adverse effect of bad weather on the barley crop, resulting in costly imports, the prevailing rate of inflation, the need to encourage export oriented expansion and the ratio between company profits and tax revenue. Hence, the Bill.On cigarettes, the excise rate remained unchanged but the factory selling prices at which they were to be applied were adjusted upwards by 23 per cent, translating this to weighted average price of 19.5 per cent. The effect was a price rise such that Embassy went up by KShs.2.20, Sportsman went up by KShs.1.80, Score brand went up by KShs.1.80; Rooster went up by KShs.1.70 and Ten Cents brand went up by KShs.2.00. The prices of smoking tobacco would be adjusted accordingly.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTARY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah)(ctd);Mr. Speaker,Sir, the prices of smoking tobacco will be adjusted accordingly. As regards beer and stout the price for half-litre bottle increased by KShs.1.20 with prorata increases in other sizes. These increases also demolished the customary bad habits of the get-rich-overnight hopes of some traders who usually hoard these types of items near Budget time. let me also mention the fact that the Zxchecuer revenue went up a little.With those remarks, I beg to move. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL(Mr.Nuli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to second this very short	Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to tax wananchi on certain goods or commodities that they consume. I am here talking about cigarettes and beer. On many occasions hon. Members have discussed Finance Bills always asking the Consolidated Fund to pay so much money to Ministries and Departments. Barely the Government wishes to raise money for the Consolidated Fund by way of taxation. A country like ours which is always being praised for upholding democratic principles does not believe in taxation without representation. Our Government upholds the long-standing principle that there should be no taxation without representation. So, the Government is coming to this House which represents all wananchi throughout our Republic, to sanction the actual taxation. Taxation without the sanction of the House would be tantamount to an arbitrary act and therefore in breach of that long standing principle of no taxation without representation. So, this Bill as it stands seeks to sanction what the Government has done to raise the prices of cigarettes and beer so that the Consolidated Fund can have some money to be able to meet other obligations which are very necessary for the development of of our country.	THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (CTD) So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a straightforward Bill which has been honoured in all principles of law and our Constitution is therefore quite valid. Therefore those who enjoy cigarettes and beer should be taxed a little so that we can enhance the Consolidated Fund for the development of this country.I beg to second. </NEWSPEECH>(Question Proposed)<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREION AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION (Mr.Munyi): Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I just want the whole world to know that our Government which is very democratic dees not do things without seeking to approval of Parliament. The world should also know that under our one-party system the views of everybody are listened to. When the prices of beer and cigarettes were increased some people were asking whether the increases would be discussed in this House. Now you car see that we are discussing the matter in the House. The matter has been brought to this House by a very able Assistant Minister in the Office of the Vice President and Minister for Finance. The Bill has been seconded by our very able Attorney-General and this demonstrates: to the world that under one party system of Government you can have more democracy than in any other system. This act of seeking approval of the House is a demonstration that under one-party system we can do a lot.Recently, when you visited West Germany, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you appealed to the Governments of Western Europe to give the money they are spending on arms to developing countries. You made a very good appeal and we are very proud of you. You told them that the money they are using on arms could be used to develop Third World countries for the peace of the world. </NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPEARATION (Mr.Munyi) (ctd);You also told them that Kenya does things legally and in a democratic manner.I would like to ask the Minister to do something about the growing of barley in this country. We want more and more people to be encouraged to grow barley. We do not want to enccurage people to drink. We can a grow barley for export. We are even exrporting beer to the United States of America. I even una erst and that Japan, intends to buy beer from Kenya. Many countries want to buy Kenyan beerRecently the whole world celebrated the World No Smoking Day. Although we do not want to encrouage Kenyans to start smoking, but we can produce cigarettes and export them to other countries. </NEWSPEECH><HEADER>QUORUM</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIILU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We have no Quorum in the House. </NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Ring the Bell</NEWSPEECH>(The Division Bell was rung)<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION (Mr. Munyi): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to continue by saying, that we should not continue to export barley as we are doing currently because we have the potential to grow all the barley we need in this country. I would like to request the Ministry of Agriculture to look for more good land that is suitable for the growth of barley. If we increase our yields and acreages for this crop we can even export some of it to other countries which will earn us more foreign exchange. We would like our scientists to research on this crop with the aim of increasing our yields.As for the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife, I would like to appeal to them to carry out more aggressive campaigns in attracting tourists to this country. There are very many Middle East tourists who would like to visit Kenya. There are also very many countries in the Middle East like Oman who are interested in buying cigarettes from us. If we could get a share of this market then our country would earn a lot of foreign exchange.Since this Bill is more or less connected with the Budget which will be presented to the House tomorrow, I do not have much to say.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KAGWIMA: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to support this Bill. I have two issues that have been mentioned in the Bill that I would like to concentrate on. One of them is the shortage of raw materials for the manufacture of beer. I support the review of the prices of beer to accommodate the cost of the raw materials that will have to be exported for the manufacture of beer.The other issue is that in raising the prices of beer the Government wanted to raise revenue to cater and finance the projects that are needed by the same wananchi.After saying that I would like to point out that although wananchi are eagerly waiting for the Budget tomorrow to know what has been raised, the Ministry should be careful to ensure that there are no mini-budgets after that.MR. KAGWIMA. (ctd.):		This is because if such a trend continues then people will lose faith in the Budget saying that even after it they will still be other mini-budgets. So it would be better if in the Budget all the cases that necessitate mini-budgets are accommodated in the Budget. That is the only way of ensuring that people do not lose confidence in the House and the Ministry concerned. Furthermore, such a trend shows that the Ministry and the House cannot plan ahead. We are supposed to look ahead so that when we say something today it remains the same tomorrow. So it is not encouraging to keep on having mini-budgets after the Budget has been presented.So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, although I support the review of the prices of certain goods to generate revenue for our development projects, we should as much as possible try to plan ahead to avoid having mini-budgets in the middle of a given financial year.With those few remarks I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Since there is no other hon. Member willing to contribute I would now like to call upon the Mover to reply. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah): Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to reply to hon. Members comments. As has been stated, the Bill is very short, explicit- and not too difficult to understand and digest. I would like to thank the hon. Members who have contributed and I am sure that hon. Mwangale, the Minister for Agriculture has heard hon. Munyi's comments that every encouragement should be given to more barley growing either through research or increased acreage. I am sure that the Minister will take recognizant of those comments.	I would also like to thank hon. Kagwima for what he has started and the caution he has given has been taken note of. I would like to thank the Attorney-General for capably seconding the Bill.Since there are no too many things to comment upon, I beg to move. </NEWSPEECH>(Question was put and agreed to)(The Bill was read a Second Time and committed to a Committee of the Whole House today by leave of the House)<HEADER>COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE HOUSE</HEADER>(Order for the Committee read)(Mr. Speaker left the Chair)<HEADER>IN THE COMMITTEE</HEADER>(The Temporary Deputy Chairman (Mr.Mabuge) took the Chair))<HEADER>The Finance Bill</HEADER>(Clauses 2 and 3 agreed to)(Title agreed to)(Clause 1 agreed to)<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. keah): Mr. Temporary Deputy Chair man, Sir, I beg to move that the Committee doth report to the House its consideration of the Finance Bill and its approval thereof without amendment.(Question proposed)(Question put and agreed to)(House resumed)(Mr. Speaker in the chair)<HEADER>REPORT AND THIRD READING</HEADER><HEADER>The Finance Bill</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>MR.

Our planning process has placed priority on rural development programmes and the provision of such basic services as education, health and water supplies. We are therefore convinced that the economic strategy which we have chosen for ourselves is the right one. Our faith in the principles enunciated in the Sessional Paper No. 10 of 1965 remains unshaken. We will reject the uninformed and misguided arguments of those who would like us to change our course and place our hard won independence in peril. We will be guided by our own experience in determining how best to respond to the development needs of our people.As hon. Members are plainly aware, the economic wellbeing of a nation owes far more to the vitality and political foresight of its leadership and the stability of its institutions than to any single act of the Government, however important. Our beloved President has all along been on the forefront in maintaining peace and stability. Under his leadership and his philosophy of Peace, Love and Unity, Kenya should be able to achieve the economic and social goals which we have set for ourselves. I am sure I speak for all hon. Members, in stating that we should individually and collectively resolve to continue to support His Excellency's efforts.Mr. Speaker, this is the fifth consecutive Budget which has translated into action the policies for rapid economic growth through the restructuring of the economy, contained in Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1986. On” Economic Management for Renewed Growth". While the process of transformation is continuing, the need to control- inflationary pressures, to provide employment opportunities for a rapidly rising labour force and to achievea sustainable balance of payments position, requires enhanced growth with emphasis on a strong export drive. It is within this context that I have formulated the 1990/91 Budget around the theme "Enhanced Economic Growth through Export Promotion".As is customary, I would like to begin by reviewing the international economic environment, the Sub-Saharan African regional scene and Kenya's economic performance in 1989 and provide a prognosis for this year and beyond. Finally, I shall address the budget out-turns for 1989/90 and 1990/91 fiscal years and propose specific taxation measures with other changes.<HEADER>THE GLOBAL SCENE</HEADER>Mr. Speaker, the moderate slow-down in economic activity in the industrial economies and in the world economy that we are presently witnessing is primarily the result of restrictive monetary policies pursued in most industrial countries. The tighter monetary policies, reflected in rising interest rates throughout the world, have been motivated by signs of rising inflationary pressures over the past few years. However, the more restrictive policies seem already to have calmed inflationary expectations. Various international forecasts predict lower inflation rates in the next few years. For instance, the rate of inflation in the industrial countries, measured as the G.D.P. deflator, is expected to be reduced from about 4.0% in 1989 to 3.5% in 1991 and even lower thereafter. Thus, we do not have to fear a repetition of the extreme inflationary episode experienced early in the 1980s. World inflation has. In fact, remained very moderate during the past eight years, except in Latin America.The performance of the world economy in the period ahead is likely to be influenced by a number of specific factors. Firstly, the political changes in Eastern Europe will have economic consequences which are difficult to predict. Most observers believe that the liberalization of these economies will strengthen economic activity in Europe as a whole. In particular, the prospective unification of East and West Germany is expected to induce economic activity in both countries. Secondly, the movement towards an integrated Europe in December. 1992 will stimulate investment and output, as will in intra-European trade. Thirdly, the reduction in defence spending in U.S.A. and the Soviet Union may have an initial dampening effect on demand and output in those two countries, but the longer term effects in the world as a whole are likely to be positive as resources now spent on defence will be used in more productive ways.Turning now to the economic performance in Sub- Saharan Africa, gross domestic product recorded a growth rate of 2.9% in 1989 compared with 2.4% in 1988. The rate of population growth is estimated at 3% leading to a per capita G.D.P. fall of 0.1%. In 1990-1991, growth is likely to remain broadly unchanged at some 3% per year and this implies that per capita output will remain stagnant.However, the economic outlook for the continent is, somewhat brighter than a few years ago. For sometime now weather conditions in Sub-Saharan Africa have been favourable and a number of countries have adopted structural adjustment programmes. These two factors are key to further improvements in incomes and welfare. There are signs that the growth rate of population is declining and this means that per capita output will improve in the long run. The[The Vice-President and Minister for Finance]demographic figures for Kenya indicate that the rate of growth of our population has been reduced to about 3.5% per year and that fertility rates are still declining. A continuation of these tendencies in Kenya and elsewhere in Africa, together with economic policies designed to foster productivity and a better use of our human resources, should Iead to a growth in per capita incomes in Sub-Saharan Africa over the coming years, thus reversing the negative trend that has prevailed for nearly two decades.Inflation in Africa has accelerated in the last few years to an average of about 20% per annum. One factor behind this unwelcome development is most likely- the appreciation of foreign currencies, which makes imports more expensive. Another factor is the remaining fiscal imbalances and excessively rapid monetary expansion in many countries. As adjustment programmes have only recently been implemented, significant recovery seems unlikely in the short run. These structural changes should stimulate exports, reduce price distortions and thereby raise growth.Looking ahead, and relating the Sub-Saharan countries to the global economy, I want to stress the need for continued and large capital inflows into the region. Private capital flows have been negative in the past decade. Although concessional aid flows will remain important for all countries on the continent, it is hoped that as our economics recover and our policies become more outward oriented, Africa will once again begin to attract net private capital inflows. These are necessary to complement our own domestic savings, to help reduce high external debt burdens, and thus augment growth.THE DOMESTIC ECONOMYFIVE YEAR TRACK RECORDMr. Speaker, I would now like to go out of tradition and provide an overview of our five year track record since 1985, the year in which I presented my first Budget within the framework of what came to be known, when it was published, as the Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1986. V/e then set ourselves a target to restructure the economy into a more efficient and less vulnerable one. We aimed among other things, to increase the inflow of external resources and to reverse the deteriorating investment environment. Mr. Speaker, with the exception of the post coffee boom years of 1977 and 1978, the years 1985 to 1989 have been better as a block than any period since 1972. Our average growth in real terms since 1985 has been 5.2%. Both the secondary or manufacturing sector and the tertiary or service sector have grown by some 5.5%, while the primary or agricultural sector has been growing by about 4.4% which is well ahead of population growth. The primary sector on average, now accounts for just over 31% of our Gross Domestic Product compared with 35.5% at the beginning of the 1970s. Consequently, we have now become less vulnerable to the international changes of our major export commodities.The growth of Gross Fixed Capital Formation by sectors is even more spectacular. Again, with the exception of the post coffee boom years, we experienced an average decline in investment in each sector up to 1984. Since 1985 we have not only reversed this trend but have also recorded a very healthy annual average investment growth in the Secondary sector at 7.1% with services close behind at 5.4%.It is important that we should review the economy with this perspective since past experience is easily forgotten. In this context 1 would wish particularly to note that the average rate of inflation over these last five years is 9% against the average for the preceding 12 years of over 13%. This has meant that workers have in fact had real growth in their average wage over these last five years in contrast with the earlier period. We should also not forget that there were negative real rates of interest on average from 1972 to 1984 with the consequent discouragement of savings and of the efficient utilization of scarce resources. The positive real interest rates which we have had since 1985 have reversed these undesirable effects.With respect to the rate of growth of our external debt, I would like to inform this House that the quality of our debt has improved substantially. The average interest rate on public external debt is now less than 3% compared with about 4.3% ten years ago. The grace period on loans is now on average around 8.7 years against 7.1 years 10 years ago, while the maturity of our overseas debt has improved between those two periods, from about 27.9 years on average to 29.4 years.Mr. Speaker, this five year review has shown that our average living standard has annually recorded an improvement in contrast to the average annual decline of the Sub-Saharan economies. I now turn to a review of last year's performance of the economy. In my analysis I will assume that hon. Members have already read their copies of this year’s Economic Survey which describes the performance of the economy during 1989 in detail.<HEADER>SECTORAL PERFORMANCE</HEADER>Mr. Speaker, last year the economy grew by 5.0%. This is the fifth consecutive year since 1985 that the economy has performed at about this level. I would now like to review last year's performance of the key sectors of the economy.The agricultural sector recorded a growth of 3.9% in 1989 and so continued to grow ahead of population. This growth was somewhat below the previous year's excellent result. However, the poor world price of coffee dampened the growth of both investment and income in this sector.Manufacturing production has continued its satisfactory performance, growing by 5.9%, only marginally below the 6.0% recorded in 1988. Even though investment in the sector fell in real terms by 3.5%, it was still a comfortable 21% above the 1987 level so showing a continuation of the rising trend. The rising cost of plant and machinery may well account for this decline from 1988.Mr. Speaker, the building and construction sector continued its improvement in 1989 when it recorded a growth rate of 5.4% compared with 4.3% in 1988. This is reflected in a welcome 24% increase in private sector investment in these areas, although there was a deceleration in public sector investment, largely due to the near completion of major Government construction projects.<HEADER>SAVING AND INVESTMENT</HEADER>Mr. Speaker, investment and savings were lower in 1989 than 1988. We invested 25.6% of G.D.P. of which 34.4% was financed from abroad. This compares with an investment of 25.3% the previous year with an external[The Vice-President and Minister for Finance]component of some 32.1%. In real terms, Gross Fixed Capital Formation grew by less than 2%, well below the 8.7% recorded in 1988, but this was not general since investment in the service sectors grew by 18.8% against contraction of just under 10% in 1988. These investment figures would be far higher were the Kenya Airways purchase of aircraft included.<HEADER>BALANCE OF PAYMENTS</HEADER>Mr. Speaker, our balance of payments position is an important indicator of the sustainability of our economic growth. For a number of years we have emphasized the need to restructure our industry away from production for import- substitution under the protection of high tariffs and quantitative restrictions, to production oriented towards the export market. It is too early to indicate how far this restructuring strategy has succeeded. In 1989 total value of imports including Government and special imports rose by 26.2% compared to the rise in the value of exports, of only 7.1%. Earnings from coffee exports declined in the wake of the collapse of the International Coffee Agreement, although part of the impact of the sharp price decline was absorbed by some rise in volume. Tea performed well as both price and volume rose, while the earning from tourism rose by 24%. The capital account registered a sharp growth including private long-term capital which registered a large net positive inflow, after registering a net outflow in 1988. The overall balance in the balance of payments recorded a surplus and our reserves stood at 12 weeks of normal merchandise imports compared to ten weeks at the end of the year.<HEADER>MONEY, CREDIT AND PRICES</HEADER>Mr. Speaker, I wish now to turn to money, credit and prices. From an exceptionally high level of 33% in 1986, the rate of growth of money supply decelerated to 8% in 1988, but this trend was reversed in 1989 when it registered a growth rate of 17.6%. The rate of inflation, as conventionally measured on a 12 month average, was marginally lower at 10.6% in 1989 compared to 10.7% recorded in 1988. The money supply increased due both to improvement in net foreign assets and expansion of domestic credit. High liquidity ratios prevailing in commercial banks in 1986 and 1987 declined in 1988 and averaged around 26% in 1989. During the year there was a decline in the share of domestic credit going to the Government from 35% in 1988 to 32% in 1989 and therefore the corresponding share going to the private sector increased. To achieve the objective of curtailing the growth in credit to the level enough to sustain economic activities within the private sector and to encourage savings by ensuring that interest levels are positive, the Government raised the minimum interest rate paid on deposits in two instalments during 1989 from 10% to 12.5%. The maximum rates charged on loans of various maturities were also raised during the year. This trend has continued as evidenced by further change in interest rates in April this year.<HEADER>PROGNOSIS</HEADER>Mr. Speaker, having taken stock of our economic performance last year, we should reflect on the prospects for1990. In 1989 our performance in economic management, stabilization and growth has been somewhat mixed. Real G.D.P. growth rate has been more-or-less on target and developments in external trade and balance of payments have been by and large, as anticipated. However, I must express concern in two crucial areas: the first is the Government budget deficit for the Financial Year 1989/90, which has exceeded the expected rate and the second is the growth in money supply and the domestic consumer price inflation, both of which have recorded higher than programmed rates.For the current year, the target for the rate of growth of G.D.P. is 5.1%. The balance of payments financing gap is anticipated to be very large and this has to be filled through new concessional borrowing. As far as Government Budget deficit is concerned, we plan to lower it as a percentage of G.D.P. from 4.2% in 1989/90 to 3.8% in 1990/91." The policy objective for inflation is to bring it down gradually to the average rate experienced by Kenya's major trading partners. The attainment of these targets and objectives would require enhanced structural adjustment and stronger macro-economic management policies. Although 1990 itself might not be an easy year. Mr. Speaker, I would like to emphasize that our economy has entered the decade of the nineties in better shape than it entered the eighties.<HEADER>THE POLICY FRAMEWORK</HEADER><I>(a) Introduction</I>Mr. Speaker, given the international and domestic developments that I have just outlined. I would now like to turn to the policy framework for the 1990/91 Budget, the theme of which is "Enhanced Economic Growth Through Export Promotion". The policy ideas behind this theme were discussed in the Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1986. Since then, we have gradually and systematically introduced policy measures to restructure the economy. Each Budget has been an installment in that process. This year's Budget, with its focus on export promotion, is therefore yet another building block in that long-term strategy.In our efforts to promote exports I am reassured by the historical evidence of international development patterns: It is those countries which have adopted an outward, export- oriented development strategy that have been successful in achieving growth and improving welfare. Those countries, on the other hand, which have based their policies on export pessimism and isolated themselves from the international economy have recorded stagnating or declining income levels.Kenya has followed a pragmatic development strategy, stressing the need for a dynamic private sector as a driving force in the economy. As a result, growth in production and incomes have been stimulated over the past five years. A more rapid and more diversified export expansion during the coming years will ensure a sustained growth in output and incomes; it will bring us more foreign exchange to use for needed imports: it will stimulate domestic industries which have to compete in international markets: and we expect that the open economic policies will also attract into Kenya know-how and risk capital. These will spur production in the modern sector and create employment opportunities.[The Vice-President and Minister for Finance]It is against this background that I will now discuss the fiscal, monetary and financial policies which we want to pursue a basis and framework for the export strategy. I will then turn to the centerpiece of this Budget, namely export policies. I will also discuss agricultural policies and rural urban balance, before I go on to the Budget outturns and specific proposals on taxation.<I>(b) Fiscal Policy</I>Mr. Speaker, fiscal policy can play an important role in supplementing and stimulating export growth. A restrictive fiscal policy is necessary now both in order to maintain stability in the domestic economy, and to release resources for the private sector, particularly for export production. Tax policy can also be used specifically to increase incentives for export production as I will illustrate later in my speech.I want to deal with four areas of fiscal policy: the budget deficit, the changing tax structure, the control and pattern of public expenditures, and problems relating to the finances of the parastatals.The need to contain the deficit in the Government's Budget is of paramount importance, if we are to achieve our economic goals of containing inflation and releasing resources for private sector growth, including more importantly, export growth. With great efforts we have managed to reduce the relative size of the deficit, from 6.6% in 1986/87 to an estimated 4.2% in 1989/90. However, progress in this area has been slow and the difficulty is entirely a reflection of rapidly rising demand for Government services. Revenues both from domestic sources and from foreign grants have been flowing in reasonably well.The increase in revenue is partly due to the introduction of VAT, and I expect increasing gains from that tax over the next few years. In this Budget, we will continue our efforts to shift the tax structure towards indirect taxation. At the same time we have continued and expanded the Tax Modernization programme in the Treasury, with the task of restructuring our tax system while also increasing efficiency of the tax administration. Later in my speech I will make a number of specific tax proposals, partly to carry the tax reform work forward, and partly to stimulate exports and trading in securities.Developing countries seldom manage to mobilize more than 20% of their Gross Domestic Product in tax. But as they progress they replace borrowed resources with revenues arising from their increased prosperity. I am pleased to inform the hon. Members that we have raised our tax revenue effort and are now approaching the target of 24% of G.D.P. stated in the Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1986. Unfortunately I must report that our endeavours to control the growth of expenditure have not been as successful and we are still well above the Sessional Paper goal of 28% of G.D.P. In part this has been a consequence of the need to provide recurrent expenditures so as to operationalize past development projects. This must continue to be a key area of concentration if we are to regain fiscal balance and release productive resources for export expansion.Mr. Speaker, in 1984 we went to great lengths to articulate a public expenditure strategy, in a document entitled Budget Rationalization Programme. I want to remind hon. Members of that policy. It remains as relevant today as it was-when it was published. A major aim in that Programme was to complete all on-going projects before starting new ones. Hon. Members have already received the Expenditure Estimates which clearly reflect a concentration of Government resources on the completion of on-going projects. We have to be much more restrictive in starting domestically financed projects. Such outlays will, depending on how they are financed, either add to inflationary pressures, or reduce the finance that is available for private sector investment.Another important issue discussed in the Budget Rationalization Programme concerns the balance between recurrent and capital expenditures. The continued increase in public sector employment and thus in its salary Bill has encroached on the funds needed for operational expenditures. Lack of funds for maintenance and repairs, and other recurrent expenses is resulting in a deterioration of existing infrastructure. I am determined to put tight limits on the wage and salary Bill in this and coming budgets in order to free resources for operational expenditures and to, improve the efficiency of Government services.The last area I want to discuss under the heading of fiscal policy is the finances of State Corporations, or parastatals. This is also an area of public sector finance that is causing me great concern. There is now a widespread lack of financial control and of discipline. For instance, it is not unusual that parastatals engage in new investments while they are falling behind, or are even in default on their obligations to the Treasury. In addition, there is another equally disturbing development. The Government, as guarantor of external loans by parastatals, is increasingly being called upon to honour parastatal debts to foreign lenders. The Treasury is then forced to divert funds from budgeted purposes to meet these obligations. As a consequence, the Budget becomes distorted and the deficit remains too high. These developments are totally unacceptable.I want to make it quite clear that the Treasury will no longer honour such parastatal debt obligations without a thorough investigation of the circumstances behind the payment default. Indeed, I will insist that appropriate corrective measures are taken before assuming any obligation.<I>(c) Monetary Policy</I>Mr. Speaker, turning now to monetary policy, its main task is to control the growth of credit and of money supply. The aim must be to ensure, on the one hand, that the economy is supplied with adequate amounts of finance for investment and other activities, and on the other, that credit and money is not so ample that it will fuel inflation. The correct balance is always hard to strike.Over the past several years, we have set ourselves targets for the maximum credit expansion and growth of money that we consider are consistent with financial stability. For the calendar year .1990, the target growth rate for domestic credit, which includes credit to both the private sector and to[The Vice-President and Minister for Finance]the Government, is about 15%. The target rate of growth in money supply is 10.5%. We believe that these targets should provide the economy with sufficient finance for its growth, while avoiding an acceleration in the rate of inflation.Mr. Speaker, the most important tool for controlling the supply of new credit and of money is the price of money, which is the interest rate. Since independence, the key interest rates, namely those for loans and deposits in the commercial banks, have been controlled by the Central Bank. For many years now, these interest rates have been kept at levels above the prevailing rate of inflation. In other words, our policy has been to have interest rates that are positive in real terms.One important effect of this policy has been to encourage savings. Various other ways are being tried, including the introduction of new deposit instruments. Bearer Certificates of Deposits, designed primarily for large depositors, were recently introduced as a new form of savings. These certificates have the advantage that they are negotiable, which means that they carry maximum "-liquidity. An additional instrument for enhancing savings which the Treasury and the Central Bank will introduce in the course of the next fiscal year, is the Foreign Exchange Bearer Certificate. These are primarily designed to attract foreign exchange from outside the banking system and their bearer nature will preserve the confidentiality of their owners names thereby enhancing their attraction. These new financial instruments will be tradable in the secondary market thus increasing their liquidity and inducing large investors to retain funds in Kenya rather than moving them abroad.Increased interest rates also have important effects on the lending side. Commercial banks and other financial institutions will increasingly allocate their loanable funds to projects which have high returns and which therefore will yield larger benefits to the economy as a whole. There is ample evidence from other countries that high and positive real interest rates do produce a more efficient capital stock in the country.In the process of raising the interest rates in the commercial banks, we have also virtually eliminated the differences in interest rate structure between banks and so called non-bank financial intermediaries, which means financial institutions whose activities resemble those of the commercial banks. The latter type of institutions are becoming increasingly similar to the commercial banks. This unification of the interest rate structures of the two systems will, I expect, lead to increased competition, which will benefit all those who use these institutions, depositors as well as borrowers.Mr. Speaker, as I informed the House in my Budget Speech last year, we have embarked on a process of reforming and strengthening our financial system.-On that occasion I tabled a revised Banking Bill, which was debated and passed by this House. That legislation has enabled us to restructure and consolidate weak institutions by ensuring that their capital base is adequate and that their lending practices are commercially sound. As honourable Members are aware, the Central Bank and the Treasury recently worked out a successful merger of ten financial institutions, including one commercial bank, to establish the Consolidated Bank of Kenya. This operation, backed by financial resources from the Deposit Protection Fund was undertaken in order to forestall problems which would otherwise have jeopardized confidence in the banking system. As we move into a situation of increased - competition in financial markets, it is essential that we have a strong financial system and that individual institutions are adequately capitalized. Over the next decade, a further consolidation of the banking system may be called for as competition is likely to increase during the process of financial reform.<I>(d) Capital Markets for Industrial Growth</I>Mr. Speaker, an important aspect of the financial reform programme is the expansion and deepening of the securities markets, particularly the stock market. In order to put these efforts in a proper framework, it is necessary to give a brief background. Kenyan companies, like those in most other developing countries have traditionally financed themselves either by borrowing from the commercial banking system or through retained earnings. The third alternative source of capital and expansion, the equity, or stock market, has not been used on any major scale in Kenya. That is a weakness in our financial structure. If companies finance themselves too much with borrowed funds from the banks, they are exposed to various risks, including the risk of higher interest rates. In addition, borrowed funds are short-term in nature, while the bulk of the financial needs of companies in the modern sector is of a long-term character. In brief, the debt/equity ratio in Kenya's modern sector is at present tilted too much towards debt. This entails an element of potential instability which we want to reduce and preferably remove.In order to redress this situation we have worked over the past few years to create a new and stable framework for the capital markets, which should be amenable to modern trading in securities. Last year, I tabled new legislation to establish a legal framework conducive to trading in securities, both private and public. This House passed that legislation in November, 1989. Following Presidential assent, the Capital Market Authority was established in January 1990. The Authority has strong representation from the private business sector and is now functioning on a regular basis. A major task of the Authority is to review the activities of the Stock Exchange in order to establish rules which will be conducive to a more active trading on the Exchange.In this Budget, I am taking further action to stimulate trading in securities by proposing several tax changes which will make it more profitable for companies to issue shares and for investors to hold them. I am proposing changes regarding the tax treatment of Unit Trusts. The Unit Trusts Act which was enacted in 1963.It has so far been dormant and today I am tabling the Unit Trusts (Amendment) Bill with changes in their regulatory framework. As has been shown in a number of other countries, Unit Trusts can serve a useful function as an investment intermediary for small domestic investors who do not have sufficient knowledge of individual companies. I am also opening the Unit Trusts for foreign investors and there, again, these[The Vice-President and Minister for Finance]trusts can function as a useful channel for foreign investors who want to put money into the stock market.1 am certain that the strengthening of the capital market that I envisage over the next few years will provide a stronger financial base for companies which want to expand their trade abroad. In that sense, the expansion of capital markets is an important part of our export strategy.<I>(e) Strategy to Promote Exports</I>Mr. Speaker, I now turn to the centrepiece of this Budget and its policy framework, the promotion of exports. In this Budget, I want to effect a major shift in the structure of incentives towards export production, and particularly towards production of industrial and other non-traditional exports. In this respect, I will introduce a series of new measures of which I will discuss the main ones here. These policy initiatives are to a large extent based on the development strategy outlined in Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1986, where industrial growth and export expansion were stated as crucial elements in a policy for creating jobs and strengthening the balance of payments.A fundamental requirement for a successful export strategy is the maintenance of a realistic exchange rate. There are many examples in Africa and elsewhere of the detrimental effects of a rigidly overvalued exchange rate. It becomes unprofitable to export and imports become so cheap as to kill all efforts to develop a domectic industry. The gradual and pragmatic adjustments in our exchange rate that we have made over the past several years have had the effect of making exports more profitable, while providing a stimulus to domestic production through higher import costs. We intend to continue with a flexible exchange rate policy as the basis for all our other export promoting policies.For export producers to respond to the various stimuli that we are introducing, it is essential that they have secure and easy access to imported inputs. Over the past few years, we have gradually been changing our import policy, relying less on quantitative restrictions and more on tariffs. In early 1989, we liberalized the import licence policy dramatically. We will continue with this reform and. at the same time, rationalize and modify the tariff structure of imports. With this Budget I am shifting a number of items from Schedule IIIC to IIIB. At the same time. I propose to lower the average tariff on all the items that were previously on Schedules other than IIIC by an average of about 5 percentage points. I will return shortly to the details of these proposals.An important stimulus to export production is to guarantee exporters unrestricted access to imported inputs at world market prices. One method of achieving this is the Export Compensation Scheme. This scheme will now be expanded and supplemented with an import duty exemption scheme. Later, this scheme will evolve into a duty-drawback system of a kind that has been applied successfully in many other developing countries. I will return to the details of these policies in the Finance Bill.Mr. Speaker, finance is critical to the success of any economic venture and export business is no exception. Well established export firms or manufacturing enterprisesreceive adequate pre-and-post shipment credit support from our financial institutions. However, they are known to be reluctant to finance small and new exporters whom they consider too risky. In order to encourage banks to extend facilities to such small exporters without collateral security, the Central Bank will make available a line of credit to be secured by way of export bills. This will enable commercial banks to extend pre-shipment credit secured bv export bills and to discount such bills at the Central Bank.Lastly. Mr. Speaker, in the Budget centrepiece. 1 want to discuss two specific export promotion schemes, one of which already is in operation, and one that I foreshadowed in my Budget Speech last year. The manufacturing under bond scheme has been in operation for sonic time now. It was- slow in catching on at first, hut interest is now increasing noticeably. I am hopeful that this scheme will become increasingly useful as a stimulus for export production.More important this year is the establishment of Export Processing Zones to attract foreign investment and to stimulate industrial growth and exports. We know from other developing countries which have tried such schenics that the results can be very encouraging. The main benefit lor the host country in the short run is the generation of employment, which can be quite sizeable. Over a longer time span. Kenya should also be able to reap other benefits from the E.P.Z.s. such as management knowledge and technical know-how as well as foreign exchange, once linkages to the domestic economy have been established.Mr. Speaker, last year, 1 announced that we would pursue this avenue to promote exports. Today, I am tabling a Bill establishing the legal and administrative framework for the Export Processing Zones. In this respcct we have already made considerable progress during 1989. We have completed an Export Processing Zone study and appointed international consultants to work on the design of the Athi River Zone: and we have had successful discussions with both the World Bank and the African Development Bank about the financing of infrastructure for the Nairobi and Mombasa sites. Three zones, one on aprivate site and two on Government sites, have already been identified. The specific package of incentives to be provided to firms operating in the zones will be competitive with those that are provided in comparable sites internationally. This will include a 100% write-off of investment costs, a ten year moratorium on income tax as well as duty and tax free access to inputs. We will publish a separate, detailed document presenting all the tax incentives.<I>(f) External Debt and the Need for Capital Inflows</I>Mr. Speaker. I now turn to the issue of external debt. We borrow capital from abroad as a supplement to our own savings. The rationale for this borrowing can be viewed from two angles. First, we need to borrow in order to finance the deficit we have in our trade and other current transactions with the rest of the world. If we did not borrow our foreign exchange reserves would rapidly be depleted. Second, foreign borrowing can also be seen as a supplement to our own savings and thus as a capital injections to raise investment in Kenya and thereby to sustain economic growth.[The Vice-President and Minister for Finance]Foreign borrowing has fluctuated over the years, mainly reflecting the fluctuations in the deficit in our current transactions with the rest of the world. After the second oil crisis in the late 1970s, we were forced to borrow large amounts abroad. As a consequence, our external debt increased rapidly. The debt service ratio, which measures the public and publicly guaranteed external debt as a percentage of export revenues, increased sharply through most of the 1980s and reached a peak of nearly 34% in 1987. I am glad to inform the House that in the past few years, this trend has been broken. The debt service ratio has begun to decline, the grant element in our debt is increasing, and interest rates on new loans are significantly lower than they were during the preceding ten years. The last two factors will make the debt less costly to service in the years to come.There are several reasons for the favourable trend in the past few years. First and foremost and as a result of initiatives taken by His Excellency the President, several donor countries have generously decided to convert their loans into grants. We are most grateful to all countries which have made this decision. We are also grateful to those donors who have all along extended support to us in the form of grants.Another explanation of the improved debt situation lies in the fact that we have been able to negotiate, on the basis of our economic policies, a number of large loans from the World Bank, extended on highly concessional terms, as well as low interest rate facilities from the I.M.F. Increasingly, bilateral donors are co-financing World Bank loans, thus increasing the size of capital inflows. I welcome this type of co-financing as it is flexible and quick disbursing and fits in with our own priorities and it is also administratively easier for us to handle than project financing, which due to Budget Rationalization, is constrained.The various positive developments in the past few years have led to a shift in our external debt profile away from commercial loans, which now account for only about 10% of the total debt, towards soft loans with long maturities. This debt is therefore less costly to service.However, even if the debt profile has improved in the past few years and the debt service ratio has declined from a peak of-nearly 34% in 1987 to an estimated 27.5% in 1990, it still remains a large external debt to be serviced. This means a major cost to the nation in several ways: it is a drain on the foreign exchange earnings, and it is a reduction in our disposable incomes as a nation, since part of those incomes will have to be set aside for repayments each year. It is therefore important to reduce the stock of debt further. And we are determined to do that rather than go to the Paris Club and reschedule our debt, thus jeopardizing our credit rating. On certain reasonable assumptions, the debt service ratio should be reduced to around 20% by the middle of this decade. The more successful our export policy is in raising export earnings, the more rapidly can we reduce the external debt. This is, therefore, another reason for concentrating our efforts on raising exports.Mr. Speaker, as I have already mentioned, the need for foreign capital is primarily determined by the deficit in our external trade and other current transactions. This deficit was large last year and is expected to remain so this year, reflecting low coffee prices and the leasing of planes for Kenya Airways. However, I expect the deficit in our current transactions to decline in the years ahead. Nevertheless, we will need continued and substantial financing for both the current account deficit and for repayments on earlier loans. External finance is also needed to sustain our policies of import liberalization and rapid economic growth. We have recently concluded negotiations for several loans on concessional terms from both the World Bank and the I.M.F., with co-financing from bilateral donors to assist in closing the gap.As a complement to the public funds that we borrow abroad, we also need an increased inflow of private capital. We will therefore continue to introduce measures to improve the climate for private investors in Kenya. The Investment Promotion Center will be strengthened in order to play an important role in co-ordinating public policy and private investment plans. These measures, including the development of the securities market, will, over, time attract foreign investors. Together with the capital they bring, they often come with technical expertise and management know-how, which can transform the Kenyan economy. For all these reasons, private capital inflows are highly welcome as an added source of growth.<HEADER>AGRICULTURE</HEADER>Mr. Speaker, agriculture and livestock continue to be the mainstay of our economy, accounting for about a third of Gross Domestic Product, employing about 70% of the working population and generating approximately 64% of total export earnings with coffee, tea and horticultural products contributing the largest share. Given its central role, it is important that we continue the sound policies which we have formulated to stimulate growth in these sectors, with a view to meeting the national objectives of maintaining food security, increasing income and employment opportunities, developing rural areas and small towns and raising foreign exchange earnings.Mr. Speaker, last year I announced reforms regarding the Kenya Meat Commission and the National Cereals and Produce Board. 1 now want to refer to the restructuring exercise for the Cotton Seed and Lint Marketing Board and the Agricultural Finance Corporation. The former which has been restructured is performing satisfactorily while the latter is being transformed into an Agricultural Development Bank, with a wider scope to extend credit to farmers.In the case of tea and coffee, committees have been appointed to make their administration more responsive to farmers needs particularly to ensure prompt payment. The expansion, rehabilitation and restructuring are underway in the sugar industry. No other major policy changes are envisaged in the agriculture and livestock sectors.Mr. Speaker, I now wish to elaborate on three areas: food security, cotton industry and fertilizer. Firstly, food security remains a major plank of our agricultural policy. In this respect measures have been taken to stimulate national food production by improving grain marketing system. Critical to this improvement has been steps to ensure timely and[The Vice-President and Minister for Finance]adequate payments to farmers. It is noteworthy that improved marketing has meant that these higher payments have not led to higher consumer prices. Furthermore, the Government will review the number of Licensed Buying Agents, to foster efficiency through competition.Secondly, cotton production has declined mainly as a result of the financial and liquidity problems of the Cotton Seed and Lint marketing board as well as an administered producer pricing system. In order to streamline the marketing system, an auction system similar to that used for coffee and tea will be introduced. Farmers will receive the first payment on delivery with a bonus payment depending on market conditions. Furthermore, in future the Board will concentrate its activities on regulation and administering the auctions and farmer payments. This means the ginneries will be restructured, and co-operatives and private individuals will be encouraged to own and operate them. These measures, I am sure will rejuvenate cotton industry and contribute to the welfare of cotton farmers and the prosperity of the textile industry.Finally, Mr. Speaker, fertilizer is the dominant farm input used in the country and the use of it is expected to rise rapidly in the current Plan period. In view of the central role that this input plays in increasing production, the Government decontrolled its prices. Thus the competitive environment should ensure efficient distribution. It is remarkable that prices of fertilizers decreased by 23% after price decontrol despite some farmers fears that they would not. In the decontrol process, co-operatives and indigenous businessmen are expected to play a leading role.<HEADER>RURAL URBAN BALANCE</HEADER>Mr. Speaker, I now wish to turn to the Government's Rural-Urban Balance Strategy. This strategy rests on the recognition that the key to stimulating agricultural production and creating jobs in rural areas is for the Government to adopt policies and finance investments, that enhance the effectiveness of the linkages, or webs of interchange, that exist between farms and the suppliers, manufacturers, businessmen and artisans in the towns. I wish to report to this House the progress made to date in supporting such linkages and the steps we plan to take over the coming year to reinforce that progress.Infrastructure is necessary to stimulate the development of productive enterprise in rural areas with untapped potential. This is being provided among other ways, through the Rural Trade and Production Centre (R.T.P.C.) programme. Construction, valued at some KSh. 150 million, is now being undertaken in 7 of the 8 towns selected for the programme's pilot round. A further nine R.T.P.C.s have been selected for target intervention. With this programme now established Government will energetically seek donor support for the District Development Fund to finance its expansion and speedy implementation. The Nyayo Shed programme, which provides shelter for Jua Kali artisans, has already constructed or is in the process of constructing such facilities in 38 towns in 23 Districts, to the value of over K£1 million. The programme is to be expanded, with all new facilities resulting from a very careful needs assessment.The Government's comprehensive programme for small-scale enterprise development had been launched and many initiatives are now starting with the objective of creating an enabling environment for the sector. These are to be implemented through a partnership of Government, the private sector and non-government organizations. An important contribution to the success for the programme is the initiative of H. E. the .President in establishing the Rural Enterprise Fund to provide loans to small-scale rural enterprises. The Fund, to be administered through every D.D.C. and with total initial capital of yet another KSh. 150 million, will provide a major boost- to the sector. Continuing Government support for youth polytechnics and other training institutions will ensure that the small-scale enterprise sector's need for artisans with appropriate skills with be met.Mr. Speaker, encouraging though this progress is our limited resources must be more exactly focused if Government interventions are to enhance the climate for employment generation. I am therefore, proposing and additional approach be introduced into the planning of support in this area. Using expertise drawn from both the public and private sectors, selected "webs of interchange" will be investigated and critical interventions identified. These webs of economics interactions or linkages run from raw material supplies to individual finished products, they extend between agricultural and industrial enterprises, formal and informal sectors, large and small producers and rural and urban areas. To spearhead and coordinate this initiative, a small highly professional secretariat will be established in the Ministry of Planning and National Development. It will be provided with the necessary funds to carry out the investigations and finance pilot follow-up actions. The conclusions of these studies will be used in the formulation of Government policy, the identification of needs for infrastructure and other support, establishing loan targets for the Rural Enterprise Fund and other investment programmes.Mr. Speaker, the Government is deeply conscious of the magnitude of the tasks ahead if employment opportunities are to be provided to the rapidly expanding labour force. However, our commitment to pursue these issues and problems was demonstrated by H. E. the President when he recently announced the establishment of a Presidential Commission on Employment to review the present situation thoroughly and to make recommendations upon future employment strategies. The conclusions of the Commission are eagerly awaited.The rural-urban balance strategy, as I have outlined it, will go far in addressing these problems. By encouraging small enterprise development outside the major urban centres and providing infrastructure and other inducements to increase the attractiveness of the smaller urban centres to investors and entrepreneurs, a more balanced national development will occur. Put simply, by brightening the prospects for prosperity in the smaller centres and rural areas we will turn down the brightness of the "big city lights" and so avoid compounding the problems already manifest in our largest cities.FINANCIAL OUT —TURN 1989/90<I>(a) Recurrent Revenue</I>Mr. Speaker, I would now like to turn to the 1989/90[The Vice-President and Minister for Finance]Budget out-turn. The recurrent revenue was expected to be K£2,040.9 million from ordinary revenues plus Appropriations-in-Aid ofK£125 million making a total of K£2,165.9 million. The ordinary revenues were to comprise of K£471.6 million from Customs and Excise; K£639.7 million from Income Tax; K£668.2 million from Sales Tax/VAT and the balance of K£261.4 million from other taxes, charges, dividends and fees. Mr. Speaker, revised estimates show that I may realize a total recurrent revenue of some K£2,080.4 million.There will be shortfalls in Income Tax and Sales Tax/VAT which will amount to approximately K£42 million and K£34'million respectively; while Customs and Excise will fall below the original target by K£29 million. These shortfalls are partly due to a slightly slower growth of the economy compared with expectations this time last year and partly to major changes in the tax system introduced in the form of the presumptive income tax and the value added tax. Collections under these new taxes were somewhat below estimates due to initial administrative delays as well as time lags involved in the tax laws. The collection of other taxes and revenue, on the other hand, is likely to exceed the target by over K£22 million.Therefore, I expect to raise K£442.8 million from Customs and Excise; K£ 598 million from Income Tax; K£634.6 million from Sales Tax/VAT and K£283.5 million from other taxes and revenue.<I>(b)  Recurrent Expenditure</I>The 1989/90 Printed Estimate of Recurrent Expenditure was K£1310.4 million, excluding Appropriations-in-Aid. Consolidated Fund Services were to take another K£977.8 million, making a total recurrent expenditure K£2288.2 million.As the House will recall, there were a number of reasons which forced the Government to seek Parliamentary approval for Recurrent Supplementary Appropriations amounting to K£64.5 million. The main considerations were the need to cater for increased expenditure on salaries for the defence forces, higher enrolment in universities and expenditures related to national security. I had also to finance Excess Votes and Under Issues amounting to about K£46.0 million. The expenditure on Consolidated Fund Services is also likely to go up by about K£ 3.7 million, mainly due to higher in interest rates on Government borrowing.Mr. Speaker, I have already mentioned the shortfall in revenue collections and our determination to keep the overall budget deficit under control. When confronted with these additional demands on resources, we had, therefore, to effect economies in other areas. I therefore, expect this year's gross recurrent expenditure including Appropriations-in-Aid to be K£2,472.9 million, compared to an expected total recurrent revenue of K£2,080.4 million. I will therefore, have no surplus in the Recurrent Account to transfer to the Development Exchequer.<I>(c)  Development Expenditure</I>This year's Printed Development Estimates projected gross expenditure of K£922.1 million, including Appropriations-in-Aid of K£552.7 million. Earlier this year hon. Members approved gross Development Supplementary Estimates of some K£88.3 million, to cater for additional capital expenditures in the education sector, in areas related to national security and for increased expenditures on a number of ongoing projects. There will also be Excess Votes and Under Issues in the Development Account amounting to K£28.9 million. Again I have had to-enforce cuts in some areas to accommodate these increases. Overall, I expect net issues for development to amount to about K£366.6 million during the current fiscal year.On the basis of these preliminary estimates. I expect the overall Budget deficit this fiscal year to be around 4.2% of G.D.P. I now turn to the forecast out-turn for 1990/91.<HEADER>FORECAST OUT—TURN 1990/91</HEADER><I>(a) Expenditure<I>Mr. Speaker, as hon. Members have already seen from their copies of the 1990/91 Printed Estimates, the Gross Recurrent Expenditure of Ministries is estimated at K£l,615.9 million. With Appropriations-in-Aid of K£172.4 million, giving a net expenditure of K£1.443.5 million. This will represent and increase of 12.6 percent over the 1989/90 revised recurrent expenditures, excluding Appropriations-in-Aid. I am happy to inform the hon. Members that local Appropriations-in-Aid to finance such expenditures will go up from a revised figure of K£93.5 million this year to K£ 104.2 million next "year. Consolidated Fund Services will take another K£l,283.9 million. Therefore, total Gross Recurrent Expenditure will amount to K£2,899.8 million in 1990/91.Development Estimates for 1990/91 call for a gross expenditure of K£970.6 million, including Appropriations- in-Aid of KX528.7 million. This development expenditure will amount to an increase of 14.7 percent compared to the revised estimates of the current year. This increase will allow us to further budget rationalization by absorbing external grants and soft loans in the Budget. It will also increase the inflow of external resources to support our balance of payments.Apart from all these expenditures, I shall also have to finance an additional K£89.4 million of Excess Votes and Under Issues relating to previous years.Mr. Speaker, I will not analyze further the details of either recurrent or development expenditure at this stage. I shall hold the matter in abeyance until we come to debate the spending allocations of the Ministries in the Committee of Supply.It suffices to note that I have to finance a total gross expenditure of some KX3.959.8 million. The rest of my speech will outline how I propose to do this.<I>(b) External Revenue</I>Mr. Speaker, I have indicated that the Government is committed to the Budget Rationalization Programme, this will improve the efficiency of public expenditures through the optimal utilization of existing capacity, it will also give priority to completing ongoing projects. Within theseCriteria and in the light of the sound economic policies and cordial international relationship which Kenya has been pursuing, foreign donors have pledged to assist us with an amount equivalent to K£l,03I.I million in the course of the- forthcoming fiscal year. Of these external inflows, about 40 percent will be in the form of grants and 60 percent in the form of project and programme loans. Mr. Speaker, these are indeed very large amounts and I would ask Hon. Members to join me in expressing our gratitude to those foreign governments as well as the bilateral and multilateral institutions which have consistently assisted Kenya. Thus I expect to finance about 26 percent of my total expenditure from external sources. As usual the main burden of financing Government expenditures will fall on Kenyans, and I now turn to how I intend to raise the balance of K£2,928.7 million.<I>(c) Domestic Borrowing</I>Mr. Speaker, I have already indicated my intention to reduce the growth in money supply. I have also indicated that, to achieve this reduction in money supply, I need to borrow more from non-bank sources. Given this position I propose to raise some K£ 500.7 million from local borrowing. This money will be raised by means of Treasury Bonds and Treasury Bills and will mainly come from non bank sources. Since I will be repaying K£323.3 million of maturing local debt in the course of I990/9I, the net internal borrowing will amount to only K£ I77.4 million.<I>(d) Internal Revenue</I>Mr. Speaker, my expectations regarding the economic outlook for I990/9I, suggests that the economy is likely to grow by approximately 5.2 percent next fiscal year. On the basis of this projection, I estimate that ordinary revenue, at present rates of taxation, will provide some K£2,256.6 million. Appropriations-in-Aid will provide another K£II8.0 million.Thus, I will raise a total of K£2,374.6 million from these sources. I have, therefore, a gap of K£53.4 million to finance from additional taxation. The rest of my Speech will outline the measures to obtain this extra revenue.<HEADER>TAXATION PROPOSALS</HEADER>Mr. Speaker, I have already outlined the performance of the world economy, the signs of positive growth of output and exports in Sub-Saharan Africa, the continued high growth of the Kenyan economy and the policy framework adopted to enhance economic growth through export promotion. Especially, I have emphasized the restructuring of the highly protected import substituting manufacturing sector, into a competitive export oriented one, which will stimulate an expansion of output and employment. I have just informed the House that I have to finance a gap of K£53.4 million. I now turn to the taxation proposals and as usual, I would ask, Mr. Speaker Sir, that the rest of my Speech be regarded as Notice of a Motion to be moved before the Committee of Ways and Means.<I>(a) Customs Tariff</I>Mr. Speaker, the Finance Bill published today contains some amendments to the Customs and Excise Act. I have classified these into two categories those with no direct revenue implications and those that have. Some of these amendments correct errors and omissions while others have rectified a few anomalies. I will deal initially with those changes which have no direct revenue implications.First, a major amendment proposed in the Bill is to section 43 of the Act. At present this section allows the transfer of goods between bonded warehouses and as the law stands now, there is no provision under which goods already imported and stored in bond can be utilized by bonded factories. This is a major omission because many bonded factories may require to procure raw materials urgently for manufacturing goods for export in order to meet the delivery orders on time. For these reasons I have proposed that the law be amended to authorize the transfer of goods from a bonded warehouse to a bonded factory.Second, under existing law if an importer fails to re-export transit goods within the stipulated time, such goods are deemed to be restricted or prohibited. This law was intended to ensure that people do not abuse transit facilities and enter the goods for home use. Unfortunately some people have found a loophole and are importing prohibited goods especially vehicles for home use by circumventing the transit provisions. Such people import goods on transit permits using the names of companies or persons from neighboring countries. Once goods reach Kenya, the Kenyan importer files a suit in High Court seeking to attach the goods in transit, for an unpaid debt purported to be owed by the neighboring country's importer. These importers do not then file any defense against the Court Order directing them to release the goods to the plaintiff. In other cases, these importers readily accept the liability and their goods are then attached. Since the plaintiff in such a case has the choice of auction, he appoints an auctioneer who in collusion with him sells these goods. He then uses the Court Order to obtain the letter of release. Hence in both cases the goods are entered for home consumption. I intend to plug this loophole Mr. Speaker, by proposing an amendment to section I6 of the Act. The amendment requires that such goods be purchased or sold only on condition that they will be re-exported within the transit period. Failure to comply with this provision will result in the goods being condemned.Third, in the case of imported goods seized as liable to forfeiture, section 202 requires the Commissioner, on receipt of a claim for restoration of seized goods to either restore the goods, or institute proceedings against the owner, or advise the claimant, in writing, to institute proceedings within two months. However, the Commissioner is not required to give any notice if the person is prosecuted within this period. Problems have arisen where the owner of the goods is prosecuted but the case is subsequently withdrawn. If two months have elapsed since the seizure of goods, the Commissioner has no alternative but to restore the goods even where the legality of importation of seized goods is in doubt. Consequently, this section has caused some operational problems. I am, therefore, proposing an amendment to section 202 of the Act to enable the Commissioner to require the owner to institute proceedings within two months from the date of withdrawal of such a case.[The Vice-President and Minister for Finance]Fourth, the practice of holding imported goods in bonded warehouses by importers for a period of I2 months, with a further extension of I2 months, is fairly widespread. In the past when the import licensing system was less automatic and more discretionary, such lengthy periods of bonding imported goods was justified. Now that this has become more efficient and transparent, there is no further need for holding such inventory in bond for long periods. In fact, many people have deliberately misused these facilities by merely holding goods in bond, for speculative purposes. This is a misuse of our foreign exchange with a view to obtaining higher prices for goods when released from bonds. To discourage this practice, I have reduced the period for holding such goods in bonded warehouses from I2 months to six months.Mr. Speaker, I would now like to turn to those amendments which have significant structural and revenue implications. As I have stated earlier, we are in the process of transforming our industrial sector towards a competitive and export oriented one. It is mainly with this in mind that I am proposing changes in the Customs Tariff.First, I would like to remind the Hon. Members of our policy of replacing quantitative restrictions by tariffs. The implementation of this policy has proved successful. Indeed we no longer receive complaints about delays in import licensing. In this Budget, I have taken yet another step in this area by moving a large number of Schedule IIIC items to IIIB while increasing their tariffs. This move will further enhance the transparency of our import licensing system.Second, I would like to recall that in my last Budget Speech, I lowered the import duty rates on raw materials and intermediate goods by an average of 5 percent as part of the process of rationalization of rates. In this Budget, I propose to lower the duty by yet another average of about 5 percentage points, on imported raw-material, intermediate goods and spare parts which at present are dutiable at rates ranging from I0 percent to I00 percent in Schedules I, II, IIIA and IIIB. This duty reduction of inputs should lower the cost of manufacturing and raise the competitiveness of local goods in the export market.Third, I have abolished the top rate of I35 percent on dutiable items and placed them on a category carrying a duty rate of I00 percent. This measure should reduce smuggling and other evasive activities and in the process raise revenue through compliance.Fourth, a number of imported goods whether assembled, partly assembled or unassembled still carry the same rate of duty, while others similarly classified have rate differentiation. Therefore, as part of the rationalization process, I am proposing to lower the duty rates on unassembled cooking appliances using gas and solid fuel from 80 percent to 55 percent while partly assembled or assembled ones from 80 to 75 percent. Similarly, for cooking appliances using liquid fuel, I am proposing to lower the duty from 50 percent to 35 percent for the unassembled ones and from 50 percent to 45 percent for assembled and partly assembled ones.Fifth, Mr. Speaker, as this House will recall, on a number of occasions His Excellency the President has expressed a lot of concern on issues relating to afforestation, science laboratories under the 8-4-4 system of education and accidents caused by vehicles on our roads. Therefore, in this Budget I would like to make proposals to support these three areas.Mr. Speaker, large scale afforestation is absolutely vital in order to arrest wide scale soil erosion and to maintain an ecological balance. In support of this programme, I am lowering the duty on imported wood pulp from 20 percent to I0 percent. Mr. Speaker, this reduction should lead to the protection of our forests from being decimated as our demand for paper products increases.To facilitate the promotion of well-equipped laboratories and encourage the teaching of science subjects under the 8-4-4 system of education, I am proposing the lowering of duty on ceramic ware for laboratory use from 25 percent to I5 percent.Our road vehicle drivers need to be cautioned regarding the speed with which they drive. To reduce the road carnage caused by vehicles travelling at very excessive speeds on our roads, I am proposing the removal of duty on the importation of speed governors for motor vehicles, to encourage their widespread usage.Sixth, since the theme of this Budget is export-led growth, a number of items with export potential need to be given special encouragement. One such item is raw hides and skins as inputs for the production of leather goods. In order to stimulate leather processing locally and also attract supply from neighboring countries, I am proposing the abolition of duty on raw hides and skins which at present are dutiable at I0 percent.Seventh, in furthering the harmonization of the duty structure for vehicle parts and accessories, I am proposing a reduction of duties on friction material to manufacture spare parts from 40 percent to 25 percent, while retaining the duties on shock absorbers, brake-linking’s, gearboxes, radiators etc., intact at 30 percent. This measure should encourage the local manufacture of such spare parts.Finally, duty on capital goods In I986 we introduced an import duty exemption on industrial machinery up to a maximum value of KSh 5 million for small-scale industries being located in rural areas. This value limit was doubled in I987 to KSh. I0 million. The value limit is obviously inadequate on account of rising prices of plant and machinery in industrialized countries. In order to maintain the level of incentive in real terms so that more small-scale industrial activities are attracted to rural areas, thereby promoting our rural urban balance strategy, I am proposing that the duty exemption on machinery value be doubled to KSh 20 million for rural investments.Mr. Speaker, the measures I have announced with respect to customs tariffs will cost the Exchequer some K£32 million in lost revenue.<I>(b) Excise Duty</I>Mr. Speaker, I would now like to turn to excise duty. As the hon. Members will recall in early April this year, I preempted the action of hoarders who stockpile cigarettes and tobacco in anticipation of increases in their prices. By[The Vice-President and Minister for Finance]raising the tax ahead of the Budget I prevented a loss of potential revenue. Another excisable item is beer. Kenyan beer still remains among the cheapest in the world. In order to increase revenue from this luxury item, I am proposing to levy an additional excise duty of 25 cents per half liter bottle for beer and stout and I5 cents for the smaller bottle like Export.These measures on excise duty will take effect from midnight tonight and. together with the measure taken in April, will provide the Exchequer with and additional welcome revenue of K£25.5 million.<I>(c) Value Added Tax (VAT) </I>Mr. Speaker, Hon. Members will recall that in the last Budget I introduced in Value Added Tax to replace the Sales Tax, because our economy had become more sophisticated. I would now like to inform the House that despite some initial problems, the VAT is now being administered fairly well. In this process we have discovered some loopholes which the measures I am proposing on VAT will correct. As is the practice, I would like to deal first with these amendments which have no direct revenue implications.Mr. Speaker, first under section 57(3) of the VAT Act any good exempt under the Third Schedule to the Customs and Excise Act, is deemed to be exempt from VAT. This provision was derived from the Sales Tax Act. However, it is inappropriate to tie the exemptions from VAT to the Customs and Excise Act because VAT covers services as well as goods. Furthermore, there are goods which are liable to VAT but are exempt from import duties. For these reasons I am proposing a Schedule of exempt institutions and the extent of exemption of goods and services under the VAT Act.Second, under the Sales Tax Act The missioner had powers to issue a registration certificate to a person who had not registered and who in his opinion should have done so. Under the VAT Act, this power for compulsory registration is not provided for and in order to force people to register for VAT. I am proposing an amendment to section 6 of the Act giving the Commissioner such powers.Third, since the VAT went into operation a major problem has surfaced in the treatment of taxable persons who also carry out some non-taxable activities. As the law now stands, a registered person is required to pay tax on all his activities, including those that are not taxable when carried out by non-registered persons. Consequently, a non- registered person has a competitive advantage. In order to remove this unfair competition, I am proposing an amendment to section 6 of the Act to provide for discretionary partial registration.Fourth, in order to avoid charging VAT a number of companies have resorted to supplying raw materials to a manufacturer, who provides a manufacturing service, to undertake production on their behalf. Currently manufacturing service is not taxable under VAT and therefore even registered manufacturers take advantage of this loophole and avoid paying VAT by contracting out the manufacture of taxable goods. I am therefore proposing that the supply of contract manufacturing service be made a taxable service, under the Third Schedule of the VAT Act.Fifth, the establishment of Export Processing Zone (EPZ) implies that enterprises operating within such a zone will have to be free of most taxes. The present VAT legislation does not have the relevant provisions. I have therefore introduced provisions in the VAT Act in order to treat trade between the EPZ and the rest of Kenya as export/import trade. Consequently, these enterprises will be exempt from VAT registration.Sixth, at present section 5 of the VAT Act is silent about Value Added Tax on the importation of services into Kenya. This omission implies that imported services have an advantage over suppliers of local services. In order to treat both these categories on a par I am proposing an amendment to correct this anomaly.Seventh I am also amending section 40 of the Act to provide for severe penalties against revenue officers who aid and abet in the avoidance of VAT.Mr. Speaker, I would now like to deal with those changes which have revenue implications. As we restructure our economy. By transforming our manufacturing sector from o highly protected import substitution to export orientation, the Value Added Tax will assume increased importance in terms of revenue, while import duties will be relegated to play a minor role. It is with this in mind that the following changes are being proposed in VAT.First, a major change in the Finance Bill relates to the rationalization of the VAT rate structure. The Government is committed to a rate structure which is easier to administer with fewer categories of rates and contains no excessively high rates with little or no revenue impact. Towards this objective for all items other than vehicles, I propose to reduce the current I5 categories of rates above I7 percent to 6 percent only. In the process, I have eliminated the following rates of 20 percent, 35 percent, 50 percent, 60 percent 65 percent. 75 percent, 85 percent, 120 percent and 210 percent. Mr. Speaker, this is a major reform which will have far reaching effect on trade and manufacturing.Second, the general rate of Sales Tax. The forerunners of present VAT. Has for a long time remained at I7 percent while cost per unit of public outlay has continued to escalate rapidly. I am therefore proposing a marginal increase to a level of I8 percent.Third, a number of VAT exempted goods will now be zero rated. This implies that any of the goods which constitute an input in the production of these zero rated goods will be eligible for a tax offset. When goods are zero rated, they are free of tax. Under the Fifth Schedule of the VAT Act, export goods are zero rated. My attention has been drawn to the fact that failure to zero rate services means such services will be taxable on the non-resident and since non-residents will object to such a tax. Kenyan professionals will become less competitive and therefore lose business.Fourth, currently under VAT a long list of goods are exempt. These exempted goods constitute raw materials and capital goods. In order to raise revenue which I have foregone by lowering import duties on the same categories of goods. I propose that some of these exempted goods [The Vice-President and Minister for Finance]should now attract a 5 percent VAT. As far as exports are concerned, this measure will not hinder their expansion because they are zero rated and therefore VAT claimable. This measure should require manufacturers to register for VAT and encourage the discipline of keeping proper accounts.Fifth, hon. Members will recall that last year. I lowered the sales tax on passenger cars with varying cylinder capacity and the combined duty and sales tax rates were reduced substantially. In addition I also abolished the I7 percent sales tax on assembled buses of over 25 passengers. However, because of the high cost of passenger cars and minibuses resulting from the appreciation of the currencies of our major trading partners and the prevailing high interest rales. I am proposing to lower further the VAT rates for a certain categories of cars. With effect from midnight tonight, he VAT rates proposed for cars are as follows:For I500 cc. and less 		—	from 20% to'I8%Over I500 cc. to I800 cc. 	—	from 35% to 30%Over IS00 cc. to 2000 cc. 	—	from 50% to 45%:Over 2000 cc. to 2250 cc.	—	from 120% to 100%:Cars exceeding 2250 cc. 	—	from 210% to 150%I am also proposing to lower the VAT rates for most categories of minibuses with the exception of I500 cc and less, which remains unchanged at 35 percent. The proposed VAT rate for minibuses is as follows:Over I500 cc to I800 cc. from 55% to 50%:Those exceeding I800 cc. to 2000 cc. from 70% to 50%:and those exceeding 2000 cc. from 85% to 80%.Mr. Speaker, the proposed measure is a substantial reduction which should be welcome.Sixth, another charge which has remained unchanged for a long time is the fee paid for the letter of release when importing a vehicle. I am therefore introducing progressive fees. Accordingly, with effect from midnight tonight, the charge for the letter of release will be increased for cars of 2000 cc from KSh. 5.000 to KSh. 20.000. while charges for all other vehicles and motor cycles will remain unchanged.Seventh I have received representation to the effect that the VAT rates are too high on milk and cream powder and other milk and cream concentrates specially prepared for infants. Consequently, prices of food prepared for infants remain very high. In order to ease this burden on the mothers. I am proposing to zero rate them. This measure will leave all other users taxable while at the same time maintaining low prices for infant foods.Eighth Mr. Speaker, our taxation policy must be aligned with our Rural-Urban Balance strategy. Therefore, in reviewing the VAT rates I have borne in mind the need to protect small-scale industry, especially Jua Kali, with a view to stimulating its competitiveness. Towards this end, I propose to abolish VAT on acetylene and bakery machinery and parts. The removal of VAT will encourage small scale Jua Kali enterprises to make widespread use of acetylene and produce bakery machinery and-parts at competitive prices.Ninth with our country's many hours of sunshine per day. Clothes-dryers are an obvious luxury in Kenya and are therefore the right items to be removed from the list of exempted items. I am therefore proposing a VAT rate of 18 percent on clothes-dryers.Tenth, I am proposing VAT exemption on several items including laboratory equipment, road and traffic signs and industrial compressors these are basic items for schools, road safety measures and for industrial purposes respectively. The important role which these goods play is evidenced by this proposal to make them duty free.The VAT measures I have announced today, together with those on beer announced in April which pre-empted the action of hoarders, will bring an additional K£52.2 million in revenue.<I>(d) Income Tax</I>Mr. Speaker. I would like to turn to income tax where I am proposing some major changes aimed at influencing the development of capital market, attracting investment, inducing additional exports, and enhancing revenue. As usual, I will deal first with reforms which have no revenue implications.As the House will recall, we have embarked on the development of the capital market through the expansion and the deepening of the securities markets and particularly the stock market. The capital market will enable Kenyan companies to raise funds through equity or the stock market rather than by borrowing from commercial banks and through retained earnings.One of the important investment intermediaries which will mobilize savings for investment in stocks, shares and securities is the Unit Trust. A Unit Trust is an investment fund in which individuals can purchase units or shares. The funds so raised by the Trust are invested broadly in the economy for the benefit of the unit holders. Hence Unit Trusts enable small domestic investors who do not have the necessary knowledge to enter the stock market to benefit from such investments.In order to expand the options for savings and investment for the average Kenyan. I am proposing amendments to both the unit Trust and Income Tax Acts. The amendments will make the use of unit trusts an attractive way for Kenyans to invest widely in the economy. I shall now detail the tax changes that will make Unit Trusts financially attractive. At the same time, however. I am introducing changes in the regulator) framework for Unit Trusts that will help ensure the security of the funds invested in them. These Unit Trusts will be licensed and supervised by the Central Bank.Mr. Speaker, I would now like to turn to those amendments relating to the capital market which have revenue implications.Firstly, the withholding tax of I5% on dividends paid to a resident will be made a final tax, thus reducing double taxation and encouraging wider share ownership. The with[The Vice-President and Minister for Finance]holding tax of I5% on dividends will also reduce double taxation on inter corporate dividends.Secondly, all dividend and interest income to Unit Trusts will be subject to withholding taxes of I5% and I0 percent respectively, which will be final and not subject to corporate tax. Consequently, Unit Trusts will receive all income flows tax paid.Thirdly, where dividend and interest income is received by tax exempt persons such as the pension plans, these will not be subject to withholding tax.Fourthly, stamp duties payable for retail share transactions quoted in the Stock Exchange, both for individuals and institutional investors will be abolished.Finally, legal fees and other costs of public issues of shares, debentures and bonds will be made a deductible expense so as to promote such public issues. I am confident that these reforms will make the Unit Trust an attractive vehicle for pooling investment funds of individuals.Mr. Speaker, as I have already informed the Hon. Members, we are establishing Export Processing Zones for the purpose of attracting investment, especially foreign investment, creating employment and earning foreign exchange. To attract such investments, I am proposing a number of income tax reforms. Firstly, a tax holiday for the first I0 years and thereafter only 25% income tax for the next I0 years, for all enterprises locating in the Export Processing Zones. Secondly payments from an EPZ enterprise. To non-residents will be exempt from withholding tax during the first I0 years. Finally tax accounts will be maintained in foreign currency subject to an agreement with the Governor of the Central Bank and the Commissioner of Income Tax. I am sure that such an attractive tax package will pay dividends.Mr. Speaker, I would now like to propose changes which are aimed at existing investors and individual tax payers. These measures will enhance equity and increase our tax revenue collections.Firstly, under existing law, a businessman is required to pay part of his tax on business income three months after the end of his accounting year and the bulk of the tax six months later. Consequently, this mode of payment allows him an interest free credit of 9 months. However an employed person is required to pay the whole of his tax on his monthly salary by PAYE. Thus there is considerable inequity in the tax treatment of income. I, therefore, propose to introduce a current payment system Tor business income, in order to remove this inequity. This system will require a business to pay 75% of its estimated tax for the year, at the end of the third quarter or the end of the ninth month of a firm's financial year. It will be phased-in over 5 years starting with I5% of the estimated tax in the first year, then 30% in the second year, 45% in the third year, 60% in the fourth year and 75% in the final year. It will commence in September, I990.Secondly, the Hon. Members will recall that last year I lowered the corporate tax rate from 45% to 42.5% in order to make Kenya an attractive location for investment. This year I am continuing this process by further lowering this tax rate from 42.5% to 40%. This is a major concession which should attract mobile international capital and it will also provide an offset to the measures I have just proposed on the current payment basis of corporate tax.Thirdly, under the current penalty system, late payment of income tax carries a flat rate penalty of I5% on< outstanding tax. Under this system, the penalty remains the same whether the taxpayer pays the arrears now or later and therefore there is no incentive to pay early. I am therefore proposing in the Finance Bill a penalty of I5% on all late and underestimated taxes plus an I.5% per month interest on all unpaid tax including penalties. In addition to these penalties, tax evasion is a criminal offence carrying a heavy fine and/or custodial sentence. I am directing the Commissioner of Income Tax to implement this provision without delay in his effort to collect taxes.Fourthly, many high income employees have been receiving much of their income in lightly taxed benefits. These benefits should be subject to full taxation. I am therefore proposing to continue to raise the values to be required to be included in income for benefits such as cars. In addition I intend to disallow the deductions of the cost of providing benefits such as vacation trips and club fees.Finally, Mr. Speaker I want to deal with the tax treatment of pension savings by Kenyans. Under the current system, pension contributions are not tax deductible and pension incomes are non-taxable. However, the time has come to start a gradual switch over, subject to limits, to a system where contributions will be deductible while pension income will be taxable. I therefore propose to introduce significant changes in this area.Starting in I990, contributions to registered pension plans and provident funds, made by employers or employees, will be deductible from taxable income subject to limits. The limits will start at low levels and will be increased over the years. Pensions will become taxable where they exceed the tax free pension limits. Mr. Speaker, I want to assure all Kenyans that when introducing the new system of taxing pensions, I have taken care to protect the tax free pensions of those Kenyans who have earned pensions based on non-deductible contributions. I am even going further today and am raising the tax free limit on pensions from its current level of K£5,000 a year to K£7,500.Mr. Speaker, the change I have proposed in the taxation of pensions will have far reaching implications. It will encourage companies to establish pension plans and to contribute savings to those plans thus increasing domestic savings, as well as mobilizing the capital needed for investment to create jobs. The development of pension plans will also help assure the financial security of a growing number of Kenyans in their retirement Mr. Speaker, we will continue to work in the coming years towards improvements in the legislative framework for tax- assisted pension savings, that will allow the pension plans to grow and make pension membership open to an ever increasing number of Kenyans.[The Vice-President and Minister for Finance]Mr. Speaker, I will raise some K£6 million from the proposed income tax measures.<I>(e) Miscellaneous Taxes/Fees</I>Mr. Speaker, along with the above tax reform. I have also reviewed miscellaneous taxes and fees and in this budget, I propose only three changes. These are increases in license fees under the Banking Act for banks and other financial institutions by I5% across the board, the raising of trade licensing fees by I0% and. in order to discourage the export of scrap metal; I propose to increase the export duty on it from I0% to 20%.Mr. Speaker. I intend to raise K£ I.7 million from these changes.<I>(f) Export Compensation and Duty Exemption</I>Mr. Speaker, turning now to the promotion of export of non-traditional or manufactured goods, I am proposing changes to improve the existing system of export compensation. I am also proposing new measures to ensure that exporters can purchase inputs at world prices to compete in the international markets, and claim compensation from the day the goods are exported. In the Finance Bill, I have extended the list of eligible items for export compensation. There will still be need to produce a bank guarantee; failure to remit foreign exchange within the permitted period, will carry a penalty, which will be double the amount of compensation plus interest and the culprit will be liable for prosecution under the Exchange Control Act.Mr. Speaker, finally I am proposing the introduction of a Duty Exemption Scheme. Under this scheme, exporters will have access to duty free imported inputs in order to obtain them at world prices. This scheme will operate in parallel with the existing export compensation scheme but these will be mutually exclusive. Exporters of horticultural products will be the first to be eligible to apply for duty exemption on their inputs including packages and containers used for their exports. Other exporting sectors will be made eligible in the future. In addition, a duty drawback programme will be designed and introduced in I99I. Mr. Speaker, all these measures should enhance our exports of non-traditional items.<HEADER>CONCLUSION</HEADER>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, in this Budget I have provided measures to continue the policies of structural adjustment as enunciated by our Sessional Paper No. I of I986; I have emphasized the goal of economic growth through export promotion; and I have outlined the measures towards its achievement.I have also reaffirmed the Government's commitment to control the budget deficit and to stress the manner in which it will be financed. Through taxation measures under Customs Duties. Value Added Tax, Income Tax etc. I have given the signals for the stimulation of the agricultural and manufacturing sectors towards export orientation. I have been generous in raising the value limit of industrial machinery eligible for import duty exemptions and thereby have made rural areas more attractive to small scale industries. I have adopted measures to encourage the rapid development of the capital market and the establishment of the Export Processing Zones. I have also introduced the duty exemption scheme while strengthening the existing export compensation scheme. Mr. Speaker, all these measures are aimed at encouraging exports, employment and growth.These actions will consolidate the achievements under our structural adjustment policies and will ensure the dynamism of the economy as we enter the decade of the nineties.Mr. Speaker.

Thereafter qualified candidates will be interviewed to determine the most suitable three or four names for onward transmission to my office for appointment of the best applicant. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MCHARO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I appreciate the Assistant Minister's answer but I would like to suggest that in future when a post of such a kind falls vacant due to suspension, it should not tgaöm take two and a half year—— </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is your question? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MCHARO: I am saying that's in future when a post of an assistant chief falls vacant due to, say, suspension, it should not take a period of two and a half years before it is filled up. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ONYANCHA: I agree, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. A.I.MOHAMED: On a point of order Sir. The hon. Member is saying that the assistant chief has been suspended while the Assistant Ministers saying that the post has been advertised. Which is which? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the assistant chief was originally suspended and dismissed later on. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MANG’OLI: Can the Assistant Minister give us the date and reference number of the letter which dismissed this assistant chief? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ONYANCHA: Sir, the assistant chief was dismissed in April, I989. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.KIILU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister tell us why they took so long before advertising this post? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ONYANCHA: Sir, after the assistant chief was dismissed the officer concerned inadvertently took time to process the filling of this post. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Next Question. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 224Upgrading of Eiilugho and Bura DispensariesMR. SALAT asked the Minister for Health the plans he have to upgrade Hulugho and Bura Dispensaries to health center.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur) : Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The hon. Member has requested my Ministry to upgrade two dispensaries in his constituency but unfortunately, we can only take one. Therefore, my Ministry has no plans at present to upgrade Hulugho Dispensary to a health center. On the other hand, my Ministry has plans to upgrade Bura Dispensary to a health center. This will be done in phases spreading over I990/9I and I99I/92 Financial Years. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SALAT: While appreciating the Assistant Minister's reply, I would like to say that Hblugho and Bura are big divisions which are served byMR. SALAT (Ctd.):dispensaries. These divisions are also about 300 kilometers away from the nearest hospital or health center." Therefore the need for a health center here is very evident. Would the Assistant Minister tell this House how much funds have heen allocated for the proposed Bura health center in the current financial year? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: I have just said that we do not have funds to upgrade the two dispensaries at a go. We have started with Bura dispensary and we have not yet allocated funds to it because the Budget was just read the other day. We will allocate funds to this project in I990/91 and I99I/92 Financial Years. Holugho dispensary will be considered at a later stage. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUTUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the issue here is not the construction of health centers but the upgrading of the existing facilities. When will the Ministry upgrade Holugho and Bura dispensaries to health centers to help the wananchi? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, a dispensary works to a limited capacity and for it to be upgraded to a full health center, we need a number of other facilities, such as, staff houses, toilets and staff. We just do not upgrade a dispensary without first of all taking into account how much money will be needed. We also know that construction of additional facilities takes time and money. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SALAT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the need to upgrade these two  dispensaries was realised a long time ago by the people, leaders and the DDC of the area. We know that a health center is bigger than a dispensary and will need additional structures. How much funds have been allocated by the Ministry for the expansion of these dispensaries? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I quite understand and agree that Hulugho and Bura dispensaries are far apart. The distance between one institution to another is not the major issue now because we realise the need to expand them. But the issue here now is that we do not have funds to carry out the construction and expansion of the two dispensaries, all at the same time. This is why we have chosen to begin with one; lonely Bura. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SALAT:Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the fact that the Ministry has realised the need to expand or upgrade at least one dispensary, when will the work of expansion or upgrading Bura Dispensary to a health center begin? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the upgrading will be done after the expansion. Structures have been built this will begin in I990/9I financial year and also/I99I/92.Immediately these essential structures are ready, we will dealwith the administratieve part of upgrading. This means visitationby the Ministry officials and the hon. Member will be informed. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.A.I.MOHAMED: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the answer from the Assistant Minister, can he assure the House that he will take a well qualified personnel to the dispensary, especially clinical officers, since wananchi are now being served by nurses so that they can get proper treatment? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, a dispensary is manned by nurses, but immediately we finish construction work and the upgrading part is done, we will definitely give proper staff, including a clinical officer. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. A.I. MOHAMED: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. This is not an ordinary dispensary but a special one. It is serving a whole division. Can the Assistant Minister assure us that he will post a clinical officer to that dispensary?<NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, at the moment, my Ministry is not aware that there is a need for yet another clinical officer in the same zone Bura. "We have not "been informed. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Next Question, Mr. Katana Ndzai. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 219N.S.S.F. Numbers for Magarini WorkersMR.

Kombe and M.O.

MANG'OLI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am wondering whether hon. Midika is Minister for Labour or Regional Development. While appreciating the idea of collective responsibility, it seems as if hon. Midika was not provided with an answer to this Question. Can he tell us how he arrived at that answer? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MIDIKA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I take this opportunity to advise or inform hon. Mang'oli, my friend, that Ministers act on collective responsibility and we have not failed! </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KUB0: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Question here is why the Ministry has not given N.S.S.F Numbers to these employees? So, whether they have failed or not, even if they have succeeded, that is not the issue. We want to know what success they have. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MIDIKA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is a more reasonable question and I beg to answer it reasonably.(laughter)MR.

MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: MR. MWAMZANDI, you are overruled. Let us have Mr. Falana's Question. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 195Protection of Saku Farmers from Wild AnimalsMR. FALANA asked the Minister for Tourism and Wildlife what immediate plans the Ministry has to protect the propert2 of Saku farmers from wild animals in view of the fact that farmers are no longer being compensated for their crops destroyed by wildlife.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND 7ILFLIFE (Mr. Gakunju) Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Government is committed to protecting the property of farmers from destruction by wildlife. In Marsabit, over and above the already existing vehicles, an aircraft has been posted to ensile that rangers have adequate mobility to protect wananchi fromTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILDLIFE (Mr. Gakunju) (CTD): wild animals the already existing moat will be extended to ensure that wildlife is contained in the park as soon as funds are available. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. FALANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, when we ask Questions in this august House we expect sincere and honest answers from Assistant Ministers and Ministers. Last week on Tuesday, I asked a similar and an Assistant Minister, hon. Awori, assured this House that no single vehicle is attached to that station. Now hon. Gakunju is talking of the "already existing vehicles". Would he tell this House how many vehicles are at that station, their make and registration numbers? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. GAKUNJU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not able to give the number of the vehicles because this was not part of the Question. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. P.G. G0DANA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to allege that there are vehicles at that station when the Member of Parliament for the area knows that there are no vehicles there? The Assistant Minister cannot even, give the necessary details to prove that the vehicles are there. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. GAKUIIJU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have not made an allegation. If I am given more time I will be able to give the registration numbers of the vehicles. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MANG'OLI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister would not have said in his reply that there are vehicles if he did a know what vehicles there are. Is he in order to continue misleading this House that there/vehicles when in actual fact they are not there? The problem here Ls that these replies are written by civil servants who are in Nairobi and who do not know what is happening in the field. Can the Assistant Minister withdraw hisMR. MANG'OLI (CTD):statement that there are vehicles in that station until he has found out whether those vehicles exist and reported hack to this House ? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. GAKUNJU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have already answered this question and said that the number of vehicles was not part of the original Question. I am prepared to bring the vehicles registration numbers if I am given more time. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. FALANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, with regard to the destruction caused by the wildlife cause this Ministry has to think ahead on what I do with these elephants. Right now the electric wires put round the fences to protect farms from the wildijfe are of no use. This is because the elephants cut the wire by throwing their small calves through it they also cover the moat with soil and then move across. This is why I am saying that the elephants have over taken the Ministry in thinking and that the Ministry can think ahead of these animals. Since the existing plans are not helpful, what other immediate plans does the Ministry have to protect the farmers from the wildlife? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. GAKUNJU: Mr. Chairman, I would like to protest the insinuation that the elephants––– </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MANGOLI: On a point, of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. It is completely out of order for Assistant Minister to refer "do you as "Mr. Chairman". Can he refer to you as "Mr. Deputy Speaker?" </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. GAKUNJU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to apologize for that. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. FALANA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister has not answered my supplementary question. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Gakunju, would like to respond to hon. Falana's supplementary question? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. GAKUNJU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is definite that we think ahead of the elephants and that is why we have taken the existing precautions. I would like to add that there are no resident wild animals in Saku other than baboons. Destruction of property is not widespread as it is caused by migrating animals in a small section. Animals migrate from the low lands to Marsabit National Reserve and vice versa. There is a game proof defense moat in Saku area, which helps in protecting people's property. Thank you, sir. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUTUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister cannot answer this Question properly because his Ministry values wild animals more than human, life. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Mutua, are I satisfied that that was a supplementary question? <NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUTUA: Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister cannot accept the animals are coming to people's farms because his Ministry values wildlife more than human life. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. GAKUNJU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, sir, with all due respect, we do not value wild animals more than human beings. That is why the Government is spending colossal sums of money in protecting human beings from wildlife. However, t would like to add here that since both wildlife and human beings belong to Kenya the two have to co-exist. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.P.G. GODAITA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the hon. Questioner has said that the methods employed by the Ministry to keep wildlife from people's farms have proved to be ineffective, could the Assistant Minister tell us what other measure he would now take to prevent wild animals from destaging crops? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. GAKUNJU: Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I have said, we are going to extend the fencing to ensure that this crossing of animals is reduced to the minimum. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. P.G. GODANA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is it again? We must move on; we are limited by time. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. P.G. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, my point of order is that the Assistant Minister has said that the fences have proved useless because they are not keeping the elephants away. What new measures is the Assistant Minister going to employ as an alternative? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. GAKUNJU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are not going to make 100 per cent perfection but, as I have said, we already have an aircraft patrolling the area in addition to the other existing measures. In addition to that, we are always continually looking for better and improved methods of protection. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. FALANA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is your point of order? We must go on. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. FALANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, my point of order is that the statement made by the Assistant Minister earlier on is very misleading and contradicting. The Assistant Minister is misleading the House when he says that the only wild animals that cause menace in Marsabit National Park are bamboons because there are elephants in that area. If the only animals in the national park are only bamboons, then why should the Ministry install electrical fences since the bamboons can always jump over? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. GAKUNJU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I stand by the statement I made. We are not talking of the whole Marsabit National Park; we are talking about Saku area alone. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. FALANA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Overruled! We must go on. Hon. Malebe, can you please ask your Question. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 168Implementation Officers for Rural Development FundMR. MALEBE asked the Ministér for Planning and National Development whether, in addition to the district development officer, he could set up a fully fledged staff complément to include a project manager/engineer to administer and implement Rural Development Fund (RDF) at the district level.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Ogle) Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Rural Development Fund (RDF) projects are: implemented by officers of operating Ministries. The district commissioner is the Authority to Incur Expenditure (AIE) holder for these projects and as the chairman of the DEC and DDC, he oversees the implementation of RDF projects. To perform this role effectively, the district commissioner is assisted by the district development officers, assistant district development officers and the provincial planning officers and the RDF engineer advisor. In addition, the implementation officers can seek the Professional guidance from the Ministry of Public Works at the district level.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the foregoing team of implementing officers was considered adequate some 16 years ago when the RDF was established and the number of projects financed under it was small. Recently, however, the number and complexity of projects financed under RDF have increased considerably and there is need to increase the number of implementing officers. In view of this, it has been deemed necessary to review the personnel requiremént of each district in relation to the number of projects being taken in the district. This exercise is being undertaken in consultation with the provincial administration and on completion, the number of implementing officers will be increased as necessary. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Assistant Minister for that obvious answer. I say so because for the last 16 years the officers he has named have been available at the district level. What has made the Ministry take so long to realize that projects are failing due to insufficient supervision by professional engineers? How long is the Exercise of posting professionalMR. MALEBE (ctd.):Engineers who will be project managers to implement these RDF projects in the districts? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGLE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, given the importance we attach to the exercise, It has to be in the very near future and as soon as the on-going exercise is completed. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, had the ministry not planned to start the exercise during the current financial year? The planning should be aimed at posting civil engineers and not administrative officers so that they can oversee and supervise construction of buildings, roads, cattle dips, dispensaries, school laboratories and other related projects. What does the assistant minister mean by the very near future? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGLE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, when I say "the very near future''.  I mean that the exercise is actually going on. As soon as the ongoing exercise is completed. Then appropriate measures will be taken. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.

We will leave his Question until the end then. Next Question. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 236Rehabilitation of Dandu DamMR. SALAT, on behalf of Mr. S.M. Amin, asked the minister for water development what steps he is taking to have Dandu Dam in Dandu Location, Mandera District, rehabilitated in view of the fact that it is completed silted.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Mwita): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.There is no money which has been allocated for scooping Dandu Dam this financial year. The scooping of the dam has been given second priority by the Mandeira District Development committee. Currently, the Ministry's Dam ConstructionTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Mwita) (Ctd.)unit is in tabaka in the hon. Member's constituency where one dam has already been constructed and another one is due to start as soon as money has been released. However, if the hon. Member would like the Dam Construction Unit to move to Dandu, he should raise the matter with the local district development committee so that the money which was to be used to construct a second dam at Takaba can be used to construct another one at Dandu. My Ministry is ready to follow the priorities of the local district development committee. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SALAT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the answer given by the Assistant Minister is quite strange because the need for a dam at Takaba has been realised by the local district development committee, and that is why a new dam is being constructed there. It is, therefore very strange for the Assistant Minister to suggest that the funds allocated for that particular dam at Takaba can be diverted to desilt Dandu Dam because both these dams are needed by the local communities. Can the Assistant Minister tell us what steps he is taking to rehabilitate or desilt this particular dam which is already silted and leave alone the on-going work of dam construction at Takaba? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWITA: There is nothing strange in this matter. The fact of the matter is that the dam that we were constructing is now complete. The second priority is another dam which we are about to start. Therefore, we follow the priorities of the district development committee (D.D.C) </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SALAT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the Assistant Minister is misleading this House, because Dandu is a Location in Takaba, and the people living in Dandu Location cannot go to fetch water from Takaba Dam. Therefore, the Takaba people need water and the people in Dandu Location also need water. What steps is the Assistant Minister taking so that he can provide water to the people living in Dandu Location, because Dandu Dam does not have any water? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWITA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the answer is as I had told him. If he wants me to out it in a simple language there is no money to work on that dam in this Financial Year. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 185Repair of Roads in Mombasa MunicipalityMR. KILIKU asked the Minister for Local Government when the second phase of repairing roads in Mombasa Municipality will be started and how many roads in Changamwe Constituency are included in that programme.<NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is there anybody from the Ministry of Local Government? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Mbori): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Phase two of road repair in Mombasa Municipality is scheduled to start in the next Financial Year. There are two roads which have been identified for re-carpeting in Changamwe Mans.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr.Mbori) (ctd.):With regard to Ring Road passing through Changamwe Housing Scheme, which is badly won out, the distance to be covered approximately kilometers that is 162 meters. The re-carpeting of that road will cost Kshs 1, 798, 500/-. The other road to be repaired Changamwe Constituency is Changamwe Road which is 1062 meters long. The Construction work will cost Kshs.1, 788, 500/-. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Sir, I raised that Question for the first time on Tuesday last week, but the Assistant Minister was not in the House to reply to it. However, I received a written reply to the effect that those roads would be repaired during the next Financial Year, Could he specify the Financial year that he is talking about^ is it the 1990/91 Financial Year or the 1991/92 Financial Year? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MBORI: The hon. M Questioner is very much aware what financial I year means during that time we were calling of the next financial year. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKKU: The Assistant Minister has talked about the Changamwe Repulling Housing Scheme Ring Road, xfci whose repair works shall cost Kshs.1, 798, 500.00. He has also talked about Changamwe Road which will cost Kshs 1, 788, 500. 00 this means that there is a difference of only Kshs.1, 000, 00. Could he now tell us where Changamwe Road because we do not have any road known as Changamwe Road we only have the Changamwe Repulling Housing Scheme Road, which is the other road that he has talked about? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MBORI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not understand what hon. Kiliku wants to know. He has asked how many roads in Changamwe Constituency are included in that repair programme, and I have given him an answer. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the Assistant Minister is misleading this House by telling us that there is a road known as Changamwe Road. We only have the Changamwe Repulling Housing Schemei Road. I would like him to elaborate further about Changamwe Road, but I do not think there is such a road. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Mbori, can you do something about that point of order? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MBORI: If the hon. Questioner thinks that the answer I have given him is unsatisfactory. I would request him to give me some more time so that I can go and check the facts. I did work on that Question the whole of last week and this morning. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KUBO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the concern of the Assistant Minister, I would also like to remind him that Mombasa is the second largest town in this country, but most of the roads there, especially the ones Mombasa West are right now impassable. They have got very many potholes, Can tied  Ministry therefore, do something about those other roads. Repairing only two roads in the whole of Mombasa town will not satisfy the residents of that town because right now all the roads are in very bad condition. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MBORI: I have taken into account the sentiments raised by the hon. Member, but I would like to inform him that there are other roads which are included in that programme.There is the Archbishop Marcarios Road which is 1095 meters which is estimated to cost Kshs.993,600.00 and the mwakitung while moi avenue from which is half a kilometer I which is estimated is to cost Kshs. 0.5 million. The other one is Koifhange Road is 1780 meters long. This road is in the Industrial Area. The total cost of repairingMR. MBORI ( Ctd.): Those roads will be in the region of Kshs.1, 640, 100.00.Question No. 210Reconstruction of Ndela BridgeMR. KIILU asked the Minister for Public Works since Ndela Bridge which serves the residents of Ndithini, Masinga Division is currently impassable, what urgent measures is the minister taking to have it reconstructed.<NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Mibei): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.My Ministry is planning to replace the deckings during the 1990/91 Financial Year, soon after July when funds for bridge works are expected to be released. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIILU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Since that bridge is very important, could the Minister therefore, tell this House when that work will be done? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MIBEI: I said that the Kim work will commence soon after the month of july, when funds for constructing bridges will be released. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: I would like to thank the Minister because he appears to have done his homework very well, but could he tell this House how much money will be released if the feasibility studies have already been done. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MIBEI: It will roughly cost K£900/- </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Can we now go on to Mr. Kyonda’s Questions. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 235Repair of Road E708<NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Kyonda not here? We will leave his Question until the end then.Can we now go back to Mr. Lotims Question for the second time?MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER (Ctd.):Mr. Lotim not here? We shall defer his Question then.Can Mr. Kyonda ask his Question for the second time? </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 235Repair of Road E708<NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Kyonda not not here? We shall defer his Question then.Next Order. </NEWSPEECH><HEADER>POINTS OF ORDER</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>MR. FALANA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. My point of order concerns The Kenya Times. On Wednesday last week, when I moved a Motion in this House, I was not correctly identified by The Kenya Times reporters. That was not the first time for them to give me the wrong identity. There was one time when they referred to me as the hon. Member for Favi and another time they referred to as the Member of for Galole. The third time they refined to me for Leisamis. On Wednesday, When I moved motion here, the following day. The Kenya Times to Member for Isiolo South hon. Jaldesa. Sir, that was not a Question? But when moving the Motion. I took the trouble to identify myself. But the recorders in the press galleries still made that mistake. How could they have done such a grave mistake.MR. FALANA  (Ctd.):Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is not the first time for the newspaper to mistake my name and I am tired of asking them to correct the mistake, because want to do anything they do not see about it. I think I have had enough of this and I am telling them for the last time that I am hon. J.J. Falana, I and I represent Saku Constituency. I have my own identity and do not resemble anybody else in this louse, why then should they mistake my identity? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I am sure there had heard you loud and clear hon. Falana. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Ogle) Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Naibu Spila, katika gazeti la Daily Nation, la tarehe II.6.90 ukurasa wa kwanza, kuliandikwa maneno ambayo kwa maoni yangu ninafikiri ni ya kulipotosha taifa hili Ilisema kwamba "Police Threaten to Prosecute Njenga". Kwa maoni yangu gazeti hili la Daily Nation, linatumiwa na watu wachache ambao wanataka kiihari-bu araani katika nchi hii.. Kaana ya kusema hivyo, Bw. Naibu Spika, ni kwa sababu inajulikana kwamba Askofu lljenga aliliambia taifa nzima kwacba kurta watu waiiare ambao waliuawa katika ghasia zilizotokea kule Muoroto. Baada ya polisi kuyasikia matamshi bayo, bila ahaka walikuwa na haki ya kwenda kumwona yule Askofu na kumuuliza awape habari ambayo inaweza kuwasaidia katika ule upelelezi wao. Kwa hivyo mimi nimeshindwa kujua ni akina nani walimtisha yule Askofu kama vile gazeti hili na Daily Nation lilivyosema. Sisi sote tunafahaxau kwamba polisi walikuwa katika ile ni&hamu yao ya kuchunguza kisa hiki.Isitoshe, Bw. ITaibu Spika, katika ukurasa wa nyuma gazeti hili liliandika maneno mengi yaliyosemwa na askofu kadhaa wengine na mambo hay a yanaonyesha madharau makubwa kwa Serikali ya Mtukufu Rais Daniel arap Moi. Ningetaka kusema kwamba Serikali hii imechukuwa jukumu la kuangalia maslahi ya walio wengi na kwa hivyo, hatuwezi kuwakubali watu wachache waendelee kuzungumza maneno machafu kuhusu Serikali yetu fukufu. Watu hawa wanaoqyesha madharau makubwa kwa uongozi wa nchi hii na ni lazima hatua ipasayo ichukuliwe kwa watu kama hao. Hili si jambo la siri kwa sababu tumewasikia watu fulani katika nchi hii wakitoa matamshi ambayo inatisha. amani yetu. Katika nchi hii, hatuna Rais wawilil Tuko na Rais rnnoja ambaye amechaguliwa kulingana na Katiba yetu. Sasa yule Askofu Njenga anasema kwamba hataomba msamaha kwa yale matamshi yake wakati tunafahamu waziTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Ogle) (ctd.): kwamba hatamshi hayo yalikuwa ya uwongo. Ni kweli kwamba chini ya sheria zetu, m_tu yeyote anayetoa maneno ya uwongo yanayoweza kusababisha hofu katika nchi," ni hatia kubwa. Ni kwa nini huyu askofu hawezi kushikwa na kupelekwa mahakamani? Juzi juzi Mtukufu Rais alisema kwamba wale walioomba pesa kutoka ng'anbo ili kuweza kueneza ghasia katika nchi hii, hawakubaliwa leseni za mikutano ya hadhara. Isitoshe, katika magazeti ya leo, tumesoma kwamba hawa watu wameooba leseni za mikutano ya hadhara. Si hayo ni madharau? Sisi kama viongozi hatuwezi kuangalia nchi yetu tukufu id: ikiharibiwa na watu wachache na kwa hivyo, ni lazima hatua ipasayo ichukuliwe kwai hawa watu wachache. Kwa wale wanaoomba leseni za mikutano, ningetaka kuwashauri wajihadhari sana kwa sababu wananchi wana hasira kubwa sana juu ya jambo hili kwa sababu hawataki hawa watu wapewe leseni </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.

I think the normal procedure when one wants to propose that the Mover be now called upon to reply, is to merely raise a point of order to move the closure. I notice that hon. Kubo did not do so in this particular case. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Oh yes! The point is taken and I will now give the floor to the Mover if the House decides so.

MWAMZANDI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to contribute to this Procedure Motion by raising a few points. You will remember, six, that on last Thursday when His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance was moving the Budget Speech, this House was fully packed and even diplomats and other dignitaries came here to listen to the Budget Speech. It is shocking to notice that today when this Motion is being moved, there are only a few MR. MWAMZANDI  ( Ctd.):officers from the Civil Service present here. We need the senior civil servants to be present here so that they can understand what we are talking about. Therefore, the Vice-President and Minister for Finance should make sure that these civil servants, particularly, the Accounting Officers are here in person so that they are able to know what we are complaining about.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Mr.KILIKU: Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think we are going to need more than 10 minutes each because the Budget Speech is very important. The Speech was delivered in two hours, and 10 minutes for each speaker is in my opinion, a very short time. Maybe, in future, we are going to move an amendment so that we may get more than 10 minutes each.I hope that hon. Members will avail themselves in the Chamber all the time so as to contribute to this Speech. Sometimes, we interrupted by lack of Quorum when we sire contributing to such important speeches as this one. You are going to witness this soon when most hon. Members are going to move out of the Chamber, leaving it with no Quorum.I support what has been said by the previous speaker, and this should be taken seriously. I hope that the Vice-President and Minister for Finance is going to take this issue very seriously in ensuring that we have, especially officials from the Ministry of Commerce available here. We do not want to have "mini-budgets", and these officials should be available here so as to know why we are complaining or supporting the Budget. The Minister also should be here to take down notes of what we are saying so that our complaints may be taken seriously. Our complaints here are those of wananchi.The Budget Speech was very good and, this being a procedural Motion, I beg to support it. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Seeing, as I do, that no further contribution seems to be forthcoming, I now call upon the Mover to reply. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR FINANCE (Prof. Saitoti): First of all, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me assure hon. Members that we have taken note of the fact that officials from the Treasury should be here. They will, indeed, be here in order to listen to hon. Members and take down notes on their contribution.(Applause)I am also sure that when we come to the Committee of Supply, officials from the relevant Ministries under discussion will definitely be here.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.(Question put and agreed to)<HEADER>COMMITTEE OF WAYS AND MEANS</HEADER>(Order for Committee read)<HEADER>MOTION</HEADER>THAT, Mr. Speaker do now leave the Chair:-(The Vice-President and Minister for Finance on 7.6.90)(Resumption of Debate interrupted on 7.6.90)(First Day of Budget Debate)<NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Nabwera): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to congratulate the Vice-President and Minister for Finance on having produced a very progressive Budget that has ensured that most of our people who are not able bodied have been exempted from a number of financial commitments. I would also like to say that the Vice-President and Minister for Finance has continued to ensure that our economy can progress and that we are in a position to meet most of our commitments.It has been possible to get this kind of Budget produced because of the peaceful conditions that have been in existence in this country since we attained Independence. This is why it is important that all of us in this House and elsewhere in the country do our best to ensure that we maintain peace and tranquility, which are necessary for the development of this country. It is very sad that a few people in this country want to rock the boat and put our development at stake.I was deeply touched by the matter raised by hon. Ogle about the reaction and behavior of a few irresponsible citizens of this country. There is no point in one or two individuals thinking that they can threaten this Government. The Kenya Government is fully in charge and control of the country, and the fact that nobody has so far been taken in is not a license for Individuals to behave abnormally or say things, even in bars, that are injurious to the good order in the country. Let me take this opportunity to warn the likes of Mr. Matiba that the Government will take very stern action against such individuals. I want to inform the House that the activities of these gentlemen are very well known to the Government, and so is what they have saidTHE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Nabwera) ( Ctd.):About the government and its leadership. Let them know that action will be taken. I also want to tell those who support them - foreigners - who think that this Government will not take action that they will see that action is taken.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are foreigners who want to tell us how we should run our affairs.(Mr. Deputy Speaker left the Chair)(The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mahihu) took the Chair)There is no single government in the world, no matter whether it is that of a superpower or not, that has a formula that can automatically be produced and given to other countries to copy so that they may be able to run their affairs. We, in Kenya, have been running our own affairs since 1963, and we will continue to do so. We are friends with all countries that respect Kenya, and we will continue to be friends with all countries that respect not only our country but also our institutions. Any country, however big or small, that does not respect this country will automatically find itself in opposition to Kenya. Let me say, therefore, that it is important to note this point.On a final note, let me warn a few clergymen who think that they can break the Laws of Kenya with impunity that they will find themselves in trouble. There is no point in somebody saying that people have died when they have not, or that somebody has been shot with an arrow and died when such a person can be produced. Why should a clergyman, in the name of God, continue to say that such a person died?THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Nabwera) (Ctd.):Enough is enough from now on action will be taken.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are two other matters which I wish to refer to very "briefly. The first one concerns the parastatals. "The managers of parastatals in this country must make". Sure that public interest is protected. They must also make sure that they work very hard to produce the Required profits. This is because these parastatals are a very big charge on the Exchequer; they spend a lot of public funds and public money must be well be spent. Therefore the chief executives and the boards of directors must make sure that that happens. Those parastatals that will fail to deliver the goods will have themselves to blame.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other point that I would like to raise hers regards the very generous  arrangements made by the Vice-President and Minister for Finance in his Budget Speech on the iraral industrialisation. I would like to congratulate the Vice-President and Minister for Finance and his team for producing a Budget that will ensure that any investor who goes to a rural area will be able to import machinery and other equipment up to the tune of EShs.20 million duty-free. This, to those of us who represent rural constituencies, is a very good gesture. We are therefore most grateful to the Vice-President and Minister for Finance. We hope that he will carry on like that so that rural areas can also be developed and be industrialized. This industrialization will help in decentralizing employment so that many of our youngsters do not have to come to the big towns and suffer in over-crowded conditions that are to be found in the urban areas.THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Nabwera) (Ctd.):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the most important thing for this country at the moment is to ensure that we have balanced development. We must make sure that areas like Mandera and lamu and Busia and Homa Bay are brought in line with the development that is taking place in other parts of the country. This is because in this way we shall be able to make head-way.Lastly, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask my colleagues in this House to stand up and be counted. We should all stand up to be counted. When, the country is being attacked from left, right and This question of the multi-party system is just a diversion. It is an excuse for those who wish to oppose Kanu to find a way of doing so. Let us be united; let forget tribalism; let us be united as a team. If the entire leadership in this country is united with the wananchi Those of us who have been to the public rallies that have been held by the President know- that the country is united. Nobody will shake Kenya; not even a superpower will make Kenya if we continue to remain united. So, let us forget about scoring little points about this tribe or that tribe. We are one tribe and let us stand together as one tribe and fight those enemies of Kenya unitedly and they will not succeed. Let us go out of this House loud and clear to all friends and enemies alike, that Kenya will not be shake .We shall move forward with the pragmatic programmes we have evolved since Independence, under the leadership of His Excellency the President Daniel Toroitich arap Moi.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MANG’OLI: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to thank, most sincerely, the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for presenting a very good Budget for this year. The Budget has "been praised all over the country. We urge the Vice-President and Minister for Finance to maintain the Budget at that level. He should make sure that "mini-budgets" do not crop up in the future. We also realize that circumstances "beyond his control may force him to accept "mini" budget "but I would like to request him to move cautiously and try to contain these "mini-budgets" which do disturb the common mwananchi. Let me assure the Vice-President and Minister for Finance that he presented a very good Budget. We hope that money will be available at the district level in order to enahance rural industrialisation in this country. Kanu members should take part in the operations of the Rural Development Fund. Eanu party members should be incorporated because the absence of Kanu officials and Members of Parliament civil servants may get the impression that they are the ones who are running this country. This country is run by Kanu under His Excellency the President. Kanu as party should be involved in all levels of national development and management.In his Speech, the Vice-President and Minister for Finance touched on projects that are going to be started. I would like to congratulate him for saying that construction of sugar factories in Busia District will become a reality. The implementation of those proposals should not take too long because the cost of implementation will indeed go up and affect the national Budget. The people of Busia are with the Government; they support the Nyayo Government.MR. MANG’OLI ( Ctd.):Regarding the on-going projects, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have the Muchi-Ehalsla Water Project in Webuye.This project has still not been completed and I urge the Ministry of Water Development to find out why this water project has not become a reality. There is a general outcry for water in Webuye. The Vice-President and Minister for Finance, should ask the Ministry of Water Development to ensure that there is adequate water in Webuye Town This will help us quite a lot.There are also the feeder roads which need to be improved and maintained. Since we have voted money for the Ministry of Public Works, the Minister for Public Works, who is here now, must make sure that the public does not go on complaining about the poor conditions of our roads. People complain as if His Excellency President himself is in charge of roads in this country. The ilinis of Public Works must make sure that all the roads are maintained. The Ministry should do its work. So that people stop blaming His Excellency the President unfairly. We also want to know why the road maintenance units in Webuye are not functioning. We want to know why the roads are not being repaired. Money has not been made available and ax I am sure that our roads will be properly maintained.MR. MANG’OLI (Ctd.):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, on the issue of Messrs. Rubia and Matiba, I would like to say, like the Minister has said, that time has come when these two are stopped from challenging the President every day. This challenge has reached a point where people are thinking that the position of these two is at par with the Government. What is happening? We want the officers who are charged with security to take the necessary action to ensure that we are safe. This is because we are being disturbed by these baseless talks. I am saying so because up to now we have not been told as to who is behind these two people. This is because they cannot be talking in a vacuum; they cannot just stand up one day and start asking for a license to hold a meeting. These two people know the law of this country. These are matters that we are all aware of one wonders why these two people cannot go away and leave this nation in peace. We want to be left alone to plant maize in Kitale where I have a farm and we also want to be left alone to manufacture paper in Webuye. We are not interested in listening to what Matiba and Rubia have to say every day. Why sure these two gentlemen still challenging the President even after he has turned down their request for a license? There must be some people behind these two people and if we want to know who they are, then we must first remove these two from the public. That is the only way of knowing who is supporting them. There must be somebody helping these two people.In fact, for all this time we are just dealing with these two people. In fact, I also tend to agree that this thing is tribal oriented because today viiile going round the streets of Nairobi and Mathare, and I hope that the security people know about this, I was surprised to hear every matatu playing music that is about the late President Kenyatta. Why are they doing this in River Road? What is going on? Why are they playing this kind of music? I played this music when the Mzee was in power and died. I even have a cassette of such music in my house. Why are they then playing this kind of music all over the streets? When this country gets into problems, it will not be the likes of Matiba who will be to blame but us. This is because they might have prepared themselvesMR. MANG’OLI (Ctd.):while we have not done.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I am talking here now I have no passport and I have never been outside this country since I was born. I am going to be here always because I am not on transit. I would like to ask this group of Matiba to spare me and my children. I am saying this loud and clear. The rest of Kenya and I would like to inform these people that their intentions are tribal because of what they are saying. This is a thing that we shall keep on saying without fear or intimadation. This is because we have had enough of this Matiba business. So, we are now requesting the security people to take action on Matiba and Rubia. Who are they after all? Who is advising them? Who are these lawyers who are supporting them? If the Government knows them why are they not being picked? Who are these so called consultants?I was not here in 1982 when so many things happened. During that time items like packets of flour disappeared from the shops within three hours. How about if something went wrong now? Should we wait until something goes wrong? I have also been told that during that time, although useful information was being sent to the President, some people somewhere withheld it until what happened happened. If such people are still there, withholding information and preventing it from reaching His Excellency the President to enable him to make a decision, they should know that we are tired of their actions and they should leave their offices and allow the information to flow to the President to enable him to take action so that the nation can have peace. The students who are in the Galleries now want peace to enable them to study and go to the university. The children of Matiba and Rubia are not in this country. They are studying outside Kenya.With those few remarks, I beg to support, although I wish I had more time to say more. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Biwott): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to the Debate on the Financial Statement which was presented to the House by the Vice-President and Minister for Finance on Thursday last week. That Statement was very stimulative,THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Biwott) ( Ctd.):development oriented and, therefore, employment conscious. During that occasion we were informed of the measures that the Government is carrying out at the moment to encourage production. Increased production means increased employment opportunities and the standard of living of our people.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to congratulate His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for encouraging and promoting the Export Processing Zones (EPZ) which will encourage investors who have alternative investment opportunities elsewhere to come to Kenya. He did this very ably and I do not need to repeat what he said on that occasion because we all heard what he said.The taxation measures that he also mentioned Eire also very encouraging especially the measures against tax defaulters. That will encourage industrialists to expand their investments in this country. This will also make our climate attractive for further investments from other sources be they local or otherwise. For example, the reduction of the Corporate Tax from 42-40 per cent will encourage investors very much. I hope that the Vice-President and Minister for Finance will continue to lower taxes in future to encourage more industrialists to invest in this country which will have the overall effect of increasing employment opportunities. I am stressing this point of employment very much because it is one critical factor that we must contend with in this country. It is something that we have to concentrate on and find ways and means of overcoming it.The other factor was on rural industrialization. In this sector he removed the tax on raw materials that are to be used in rural industries. This is also very encouraging.The reduction of tax on raw materials that are imported in the country for production purposes needs to mentioned. This will promote production in the country.I would also like to congratulate him for the way he formulated his Budget. I believe that for the last two or three years, the Budget has been completely secretive. In fact, I do not think that the speculators have beenTHE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Biwott) (Ctd.):able to anticipate what was going to be increased during the Budget. Because of this cases of hoarding have been more less bee curbed, which was the case in the past years. We ought all to congratulate him for this and encourage him to continue with that trend. This is because such a thing is for our country and it is also the best path for this country to follow to c with the employment pressures that affect the country at the moment.THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Biwott) (Ctd.):None, of these good efforts will succeed unless we have stability in this country. This is something which continues to elude Kenyan because say they have so much of it that they forget that what is sweet can sometimes turn sour. I am saying this because it is only those who have the peace that are eager to destroy it because they are fooled by such comfort and hence do not know what suffering means. I think we urging our people to be sensible I and to think about the consequences of their actions. More so, we should urge them to be responsible and to be accountable for their actions.This afternoon, we heard the point of order which was raised by hon. Ogle with regard to the provocation which some people are trying to create in this country. It is no amusement to anybody least of all to the Government. It is not because of lack of resolve on the part of Kenyans, and the Government that we are so tolerant. It is also not lack of ability on the part of all the other tribes in this country to face any challenge nor the inability of the others to create vain in the name of parties in order to create problems.Anybody can create problems. But what is the purpose 0f a problem. What is the purpose of creating a problem whose consequences are grave also for peace loving Kenyans. It is grave to those who are trying to be belligerent. I would like to say that those who are carrying out these should provocative actions think twice before leaping. They should not be fooled by a humble lion. This is because a friendly lion is still lion and one must not under-estimate what it can do.When we look at it, we find that the whole thing is becoming ridiculously tribal. It is not only tribal but Nairobism. It is those who have never suffered and who live in Nairobi who are trying to breed seeds discord which will eventually engulf them because it will never get to the rest of Kenyans. Kenyans will protect themselves before it is too late. Let those who axe fooling these people know that the people they are banking on.THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Biwott) (Ctd.):Will, not "be able to deliver the goods. They should also know that those they are banking on are also few and whose records leave a lot to be desired. I believe that those who are in the forefront have never suffered and if anything they may have been collaborating with those who had been masters of this country. These people are still carrying on with the same threat and theme of collaborating with outsiders thinking that the rest of Kenyans will be intimidated.I read in the Press today about somebody saying that he will not be intimidated. Who wants to intimidate him? That language is not for an ordinary Kenyan; that is sheer arrogance to show somebody else somewhere who is pulling the purse or string. We were told here the other day that those who are holding the purse and string will have to make us listen. We have said from the beginning that we will never accept aid that is tied to anything. If anybody wants to befriend this country, we want aid that has no strings and which is genuinely directed to helping Kenyans. Such aid should also promote mutual interests of both countries. Anybody who sings to the tune of somebody else is mistaken. I think it is time we called it a bluff.Sir it is true that somebody has said "I am not going to be he intimidated. Who wants to be intimidated? Whom does intimidate? If somebody says "We demand this one", let them demand it. I think it is time we called it a bluff. We should be watchful about these things because I think today, Kenyans are monitoring very closely to see what this thing is all about.I believe that, if it is necessary, we could, in fact, respond to the point of order which was raised by hon. Ogle tomorrow and discuss it in detail if it is the desire of this House.With these few remarks, I beg to support </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KUBO: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving one this opportunity to support this Motion. As other hon. Members who have spoken have said, we must make it very clear to the whole world that the Kenyan system is working and that we have President Moi who is leading this country and that everybody in Kenya has confidence in this. It should also be made clear that whoever thinks that he can have another system in this country is just day-dreaming.I am saying so because everybody is fully aware of our Constitution which says very clearly that if anybody wants to amend anything therein, he must get majority support in this House. As far as I know, no hon. Member of this House has ever supported the move of having many political parties. So, how do they start? That is why I am saying that they are dreaming to change the Constitution this is because unless they bring a Motion for discussion in this House and is passed, there will be no other way. They must, therefore, tell us what other means they want to use if not through this House. This is because any other means will be unlawful. We must understand ourselves and have confidence that what we are doing is right because we are following the Constitution. We will, therefore, not be worried about anybody whether in this country or outside.I would like to say that all of us here have confidence in the president and in what we are doing. We should, therefore, not be disturbed by foreigner or those within this country. He are clear on what we want in this country.Turning to the taxation measures which have been proposed, I would first of all like to congratulate the Vice-President and Minister for Finance. I would remind him that there was new measure which was introduced last year and which we hoped was going to be amended in the current Budget, but was, unfortunately, not done. This is with regard to taxing the farmers. Many people had talked about earlier on but it seems to have been forgotten that the farmers are being required to pay five per cent tax on their produce. This is very unfair because it is taxation on the gross income of the farmers and not on the net income as applicable to others.MR. KUBO (Ctd):We must also take into account that in this country, we are likely to face a crisis in the production of food and other essential commodities. I come from an area where cotton is grown. Despite the fact that cotton prices have been on the increase, the farmers are still complaining about this form of taxation. As far we are aware, we are still importing cotton in this country. If we are not going to give incentives to cotton farmers, we are likely to continue having that problem. I am requesting the Vice-President and Minister for finance to review this tax on farmers, particularly, with regard to cotton. We have to give farmers incentives so that they produce more.MR. KUBO (Ctd.):Sir, I also want to congratulate...the hon. Vice-President and Minister on Finance what he said about parastatal bodies we do not need to maintain these bodies if they are not soaking any profits at all. I would even say that they should all "be scrapped or their shares sold to the public because there is no need of trying to rehabilitate them all the time. If they have failed and they are still squandering public funds, there is no reason why we should maintain them. We should just scrap them and then give- an opportunity to other businessmen to carry on businesses similar to the ones that are undertaken by these parastatal bodies I do not see any reason why we should be missing drugs in some of cut hospitals because of shortage of funds at the same time, we have money being pumped into these dying parastatal bodies Mwananchi ought to be enjoying the fruits of his tax. So, I congratulate the hon. Vice-President and Minister for Finance for this wise warning that he gave to I hope that they are going to listen to him and hope that they are going to work harder so that they can maintain themselves and even make some profits.Sir, many hon. Members have spoken about what they term as mini-budgets, although I do not agree with that terminology. All that they are saying is that there are cases of increases of prices of certain commodities from time to time. These prices are not necessarily caused by the Government. The Government does not get any revenue out of these price£ increases. However, I think we are in this problem because recently, last year, we adopted a policy of decontrolling prices. So, since that time when we adopted that policy of decontrolling prices so that manufacturers, could charge whatever they wanted, we have been leaving that problem. Every other day you would find thatMR. KUBO (Ctd.):manufacturers are increasing prices and there is no watchdog. In the past, the Government was a watchdog, But now it is only a few commodities that are being controlled. So, my appeal is that we should review that policy to see whether it is really benefiting us; whether the decontrolling of prices is beneficial to wananchi or not. The way I see things now is that we are going haywire and prices are going up everyday. Wananchi are complaining and they think that it is the Government that is increasing those prices while we know that it is not the one manufacturers. Time has come when we should review that policy because it is not to the best interests of our country.Sir, another problem which is affecting us is the cost of building. It is becoming increasingly difficult for an ordinary mwananchi or even a rich mwananchi to build because the cost of building materials is too high. For instance sheets are now costing over KSh.200/- a bag of cement is also costing over KSh.115/- and perhaps transporting one lorry of sand is costing over KSh.1,000/-. Building stones are also very expensive and so is labour. So, I think, unless we are very serious about this issue of building materials, I see that we are heading nowhere. Sir I suggest to the hon. Vice-President and Minister for Finance that he should look seriously into the question of reducing tax, especially on building materials. Most wananchi now cannot afford to build a decent house at all. In fact, the building industry is going to come to a standstill unless these things are looked into very urgently.Another thing which is worrying the public a lot is the question of the interest rates, charged by banks and financial institutions. Right now, Urn financial institutions are charging up to 20 per cent and banks between 16 to 18MR. KUBO (Ctd.):Percent and because of those high interest rates, you find that most businesses are stagnating wanwchi cannot make ends meet .Can they afford to borrow money and when they, sell their products they do not realize enough. So, what we are finding. now is that most "businesses are closing down and in the long run, we are not going to have enough turn-over of whatever money is circulating in this country. So, this is something that should be looked into seriously so that we reduce our interest rates. I do not understand why banks and financial institutions are competing so much so that even the rate of interest paid to depositors is now up to about 15 per cent.. Although we want to encourage deposits so that money can circulate, it new appears as if it is very difficult to make ends meet even while somebody gets a loan from a bank, or financial institution.Sir, while contributing, I would also like to make a point about the area I represent because there is a road - class A road (A23), - which has always been talked about in this Parliament an which we have always been given, a promise that it was going to be when funds become available. According to the Development Estimates for the next five years, I see that the road is included in the next financial, year, 1991/92. Although I should not be focussing on what is to happen, I have seen what happened in the past. There may be a project which is earmarked but when the time comes, it is cancelled or deleted altogether from the list of projects to be done. So, I am appealing to the Minister that this time when this road has been proposed by the Ministry concerned, it should not be deleted as it has been the, case in the past. The road was supposed to have about macked 10 years ago but the plan was deleted. But we are hoping that when comes next year we are not going to hear this question of deletion.MR. KUBO (Ctd.):Sir, in conclusion, I would like to say something about ourselves as politicians and as leaders. Time has come when we should accept to be criticised. What I am saying is that we are too sensitive to criticism. There are times when we hear Just a single individual who has no position in the community at all and he merely drafts a Press statement and delivers it to the newspaper and once that statement appears in the papers, all of us rash to attack such individuals who do not represent anybody at all and "who have no position in community. Sometimes we make ourselves appear too cheap. We are belittling ourselves by arguing with people without any stand in the community at all. So, I am appeal lug to my fellow leaders to be more careful when handling such people who have no position at all in the community.Thank you. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ANASWA: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for offering me this chance this afternoon. Many people as we move around in the country, especially after the Budget presented by His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance, are very happy indeed with the Budget. They say that this is the only time the Government has increased only the price on beer, and nothing else. So, you find from .the general outlook that wananchi axe very, very happy with the Budget. They say, "It is only beer anyway, I do not take it. So, in fact, I am very happy with the Budget". So, I would like to thank His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance very much for that very good Budget. Also, for the Common man, when he learned that there was no increase the price of vehicles, he was very happy. Some say they would like to buy, say, a Honda, or a Mercedes Benz car and so on. I think they are quite happy with the Budget. That praise goes to His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for FinanceMR. ANASWA (Ctd.):for bringing us a very good Budget. People, by and large, are very happy with the 1909/91 Budget.While we are trying to celebrate this good Budget, it is very disappointing for some people to make the country lose that joy and begin thinking about what they have said What they have said is very nasty and poisonous to the public. So much has been said about them and I do not want to repeat it. But there is one thing which clergymen have said. In fact, last Sunday somebody was reading sermon in Nairobi and referred to King Nebuchadinezzar saying that" at one time he begun eating, grass and doing funny things and so on. He was trying to equate that to an incident that we have been talking about this morning under points of order: Muoroto. He was saying that, we must speak the truth, but this nation is not allowing people to speak the truth. He is a Preacher confirming that some people actually died in that incident and I was surprised to find from my friends that some of the people he was trying to quote as being dead are still very much alive. Some people had just died natural deaths. Yet here is a Christian preacher preaching on a Sunday and he says he is speaking the truth alone and he does not fear, and yet we find that the truth he is talking about is just fabricated. What kind of preacher is this one? It is surprising!MR. ANASWA (CTD):I wonder what kind of a reverend this one is. In fact, we should abhore and condemn vehemently some of these people who put on some funny robes and quote too much .from the Bible when they are telling lies.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, what amuses more is that we have many other christian denominations here, not to mention the Muslims, like the Catholics, the Quakers, the Seventh Day Adventists and so on, but you find that it is clergymen from one or two denominations that criticise the Government whenever there is crisis: You will only hear of Bishops Okullu, Gitari, Rey. Njenga or Archbishop Kuria. My question is: Is it only the church of the Province of Kenya that sees mistakes in Kenya. I am a christian member of the CPK but sometimes I feel very ashamed when I see some of my church leaders putting this country into problems by telling lies. We can look at people like Matiba and Rubia differently because they are not bishops. But I think it is completely funny for a reverend to lie that somebody was shot with an arrow when driving a bulldozer and mowing down villages at Muoroto. I think we have no time to waste blaming these people.I was happy about something regarding education in the Budget Speech. I note that the Ministry of Education was given a lot of money. This is very good because we need to ensure that our young generation is well educated; we have enough graduates in various professions and soon or later we will s eradicate the problem of illiterac5r from our country. However, as a Kenyan, I will have to point out something which happened recently. We seem to be putting too much emphasis on the sciences and rather overlooking the arts. As a professional and educationist I feel that we should look atMR.ANASWA (CTD):Each man as an individual and identify the abilities of each person. We have mechanical intelligence which goes very well with mathematics and the sciences and we have the verbal intelligence which goes very well with history, English, Kiswahili and so on. No two people can ever be same, and so you will find some people who are very good at arts and others at science. If we put too much emphasis on science at the expense of arts. we will destroy the hopes of those students who are not good in science because they believe that there is no future arts students. I am grateful to his Excellency the President for having lowered the university entry points for last years Form Six arts students from 2 to 0 because most those students will form the universities. However I do not know what will become of some people who got two principal passes and from six to nine points. This of Form Six leavers is worried about its future. I understand that the arts diploma courses in teaching have been discontinued and that only the ones in b the sciences will continue, and the general public, have to look: for ways group of about 2000 school leavers.I would also like to touch on the issue of pension. In this House some of us are retired workers while some of us are still young. When one is working happy; One gets promotions; salary goes up, and he retires at the age of 50 or 55 years expects to get some support. Love cannot do much for Oneself. This years Budget introduced an element of taxation on pension. Considering the standard of living has risen very, I would suggest that pensioners money be left untaxed. This is because pension is only about a third of one’s salary at the time of retirement. So, if the pension is taxed the pensioner will notMR. ANASWA (CTD):be able employ servant to take care of him in his old age. This point must looked into again and the tax waived so that retirees can get their their pensions without much problems.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, another very important point concerns: the establishment of industries in various areas of our country because of the remission of up to Shs.20 million. This was a very good move and I know many industrialists will setup industries in various places and this will help to solve the problem of unemployment. I am very happy indeed about this arrangement.Let me touch on provision of money for rural electrification. My constituency in Kakamega District is the only one which does have electricity. Surprisingly there are electricity wires passing through Malava Constituency. I am appealing to the Ministry of Energy, on behalf of my people, to ensure that the Shs.2 million provided in its forward budget for electrification in Malava is made use of as soon as is possible so that my people may enjoy the benefits of electricity. With electricity we can do a lot of things. In places where we have it, there are factories that are running very well.Lastly but not the least, we also need from the Ministryof public works in order to repair our broken bridges.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SALAT: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker for giving this opportunity to support this very important Motion. First of all, I would like to congratulate his Excellency the Vice president and Minister £or Finance for this very prepared Budget.In every country, the growth of economy depends of the countrys leadership, stability, peace and tranquility. We are thankful to God for giving us a peace-loving and God-fearing.MR. SAAT (CTD):	President, who is mindful of the welfare of the people of this country and also a contributor of peace in the whole world.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker this years Budget is an indication that Kenya is on the move. We do not know what a few people who are advocating for change of leadership, system and son on are up to.I wonder whether these multiparty proponents had a glance at this Budget document. If they had looked at it, I am sure soon after the Vice President and Minister for Finance had presenting the Budget the; would have come out and said that Kenya should continue being a one party state. This is because the state of a country’s economy should act as the instrument for gauging that country’s level of development. If a particular country’s economy is deteriorating, then somebody might say that there is need for change because there is something wrong somewhere. This is because politics cannot be separated from economic development.MR. SALAT ( Ctd.):We realise and we can see that Kenya has gone very far in being firm in controlling its economy and in bringing development to all corners of the country. Inflation rate has been reduced from 3 per cent to nine per cent as indicated in this document, and that is a very big achievement. Therefore, as Kenyans, we have to be proud and stand firm to defend the system that has brought this economic growth. Our economy has been growing by five per cent over the years and continues to grow, and we should be proud of our system and the leadership of this country. We leaders should be in the forefront in defending the system that currently governs us.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when we hear clergymen shouting around, we wonder who they represent. I stand here to challenge the Christians because I am a Muslim and I have not seen any Muslim clergyman trying to open his mouth wide saying that things are bad here. Muslims are satisfied with the leadership of this country, and when we speak as Muslims we speak in one voice. The Christian clergy-men are speaking with authority because they say that they have folk to look after. I challenge Christians to come out in the open and denounce these so called clergymen and tell that that they are not their? representatives and that they are expressing their own views and not those of the whole Christian community. That way, we shall know that the clergymen are speaking out their own feelings and not the feelings of the majority of Christians in this country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance has done well in introducing incentives for the existing and potential investors in this country. As we know, foreign investment creates job opportunities and contributes to the economy of a country. We are very grateful for that one to the Vice-President and Minister for Finance and the entire staff at the; Treasury. They have looked into ways and means of creating a conducive atmosphere for the economic growth of this country.Sir, taxation is some cither aspect about which something should be; done. I am talking about taxation in the context of Government revenue. It is this same revenue that brings development in all parts of the country; it is the same revenueMR. SALAT ( Ctd.):that builds hospitals, schools, roads and other projects. The Government is losing a lot of money in terms of revenue from taxation, and the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance should do all at its disposal to ensure that tax is collected appropriately. I would suggest that the Income Tax Department be decentralised to the district level so that taxes due in the districts can be collected very effectively.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, agriculture is the mainstay of the M economy of this country, and the Government should do all its best to improve the sector. In this country we have plenty of land to practise visible agriculture. For instance, in the North Eastern Province there is plenty of land which, if used properly, can produce a lot of food. The Government, in consultation with the Ministry of Reclamation and Development of Arid, SemiArid and Wastelands, should look for funds for promoting agriculture in the North Eastern Province.Sir, I would also like to congratulate the Government for the introduction of the Rural Trade and Production Centre to help the small scale entrepenueres so that they can be able to contribute effectively to the economy of this country.Lastly, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to congratulate the whole Kenyan community for realising the need to control birth rate because birth control is a very vital element in controlling the economy of a country. We were producing a lot of children that we were unable to cater for, but now the birth rate has now gone down to 3.1 percent, and I want to congratulate all Kenyans for contributing to the Government effort in reducing birth rate.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support their Motion. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. P.J. MASINDE: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this very important Budget Speech. I want to start off by congratulating His Excellency the Vice-President and Ministerial for Finance for putting forward such a progressing Budget Speech. This year Budget Speech has comforted many people.The people in thestreets, investor and exporters are very happy with the Budget Speech.MR. P.J. MASINDE (ctd.):	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the beautiful Budget Speech was brought about by the fact that the office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance did receive information from the various Ministries putting forward their needs for the new financial year.Sir, in order to attract investors to the rural areas where large remissions are being made on machineries for those who are opening industries there, we need electricity. As much as I would like to congratulate the Minister for Energy for the efforts he has put in, I think he still has to do more" to supply electricity in the rural areas so that investors can be attracted there. Last year we; had a wonderful Budget Speech which reduced the cost of electricity transformers, but I am not sure whether that has made any difference to an individual investor in the rural areas. Electricity is still too expensive for any individual investor wanting to make use of it. Indeed, electricity is almost beyond reach for the juakali entrepreneurs who would like to carry out their businesses.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when we are talking about rural areas we should not be talking of places like Kisumu, Kakamega and so on which have electricity; we should think of small markets such as Mudika and Murumba in my constituency so that we serve the people who live right in the countryside. That is where we should be encouraging investors to go.Sir, the roads leading to some of these rural areas where we are saying investors should go are impassable, and we should take into account the fact that investors want to make money and, therefore, they will not go to areas where there is no sufficient infrastructure. No investor will want to go to an area where roads are impassable because, if he does so, his transport costs will be raised and, therefore, he will not make any profits. The Ministry of Public Works and other relevant Ministries should provide the necessary infrastructure such a roads, water and the rest. If the roads cannot be tarmacked, then they can be gravelled and murramed to make them all-weather.MR. P.J. MASINDE (ctd.):The same thing should be done about the provision of water in the rural areas. We! do not have water in Busia and I wonder how one can think of taking an industry there. This must be considered, and I assume that the Ministries which submitted their budgets to the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance catered for everything so as to make the Budget Speech by the Vice-President and Minister for Finance more viable and practicable.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, right now we have a sugar short age in Busia District. One of the previous speakers mentioned the sugar factory at Nambale, and I think the Ministry of Agriculture and all other Government departments concerned should hasten up the, functioning of this factory so that enough sugar can be produced in the country and allow us to save the much foreign exchange" which is now being used in importing the Commodity.MR.MASINDE (ctd.): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that in today's newspapers, I was quoted as having said that today I would be visiting the molasses factory in Nambale. I was talking about sugar factory. I hope that the newspaper reporters know the difference between sugar factory and molasses factory. The newspapers also reported me as having said that a cotton factory would started at Matayus. I was talking about a tannery, and there is difference between a cotton factory and a tannery.Sir, His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance did a very good thing in raising the prices of beer. Sir, the number of people who consumer beer ha reduced due to the constant increase of beer prices. I would, therefore, request the Vice-President and Minister for Finance to think about those people who cannot afford to buy the bottled beer in bars, and probably, look for ways and means of allowing the wananchi to take their traditional beer which is normally made from millet, wimbi and some, other things, However drinking of traditional beer should be properly controlled so that It is not abused. Also licences should be issued for brewing and selling of that kind of drink so that Government can Collect more revenue from a wider population rather than revenue people who can afford to drink he bottled beer. Sir, I think many Kenyans have got their own ways of carrying out sacrifices and rituals, and therefore, I think we need our traditional liquors.Sir, I would like to thank His Excellency the President for eradicating the consumption of changaa. Our people have forgotten about changaa and they are now strong and healthyMR. P.J. MASINDE (ctd.):Our traditional beer which is made from wimbi and millet is very good. It is consumed as food as well as a drink. I would like request His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance to look into ways and means of regularizing the beginning of traditional beer. He should set aside the time when that Deer should be consumed, and issue licences to the sellers, so that" we can earn some more revenue from it. Sir, licencing of traditional beer might help us in eradicating the unemployment problems. While trying to attract investors and exporters so that they can help in creation of more the brewing and selling of traditional beer could also help us to reduce the unemployment problem which is facing this country.Sir, we have heard people talking about multi-parties in this country. There are those people who are for it while others are against it. The whole country has shown very clearly that we are not interested in multi-parties. I therefore feel that since this is the 30thanniversary the foundation of Kanu, everybody should go head log in the recruitment more member.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE (Mr. NDONG): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to contribute towards the Motion.First I would like to thank His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for giving the country a budget which is meant for wananchi; a budget which will encourage industrialists to open up industries in the rural areas, and also to create employment for the people.Sir, I think there are two or three issues which shouldTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE (Mr. Ndongt) (ctd.):be seriously looked into, one of them is on taxation. I do appreciate what the treasury has done in reducing taxation mostly on imported items. But, Sir, most of our vehicles are still overpriced. The vehicles that are being assembled locally are overpriced, just because the duty and have tried to lower it. The value added tax (VAT) is quite high, despite the fact that they will think our target should be armed at the Preferential Trade Area (P.T.A countries. We have enough personnel, proper infrastructure, We have the knowhow, and very many factories which are assembling vehicles locally. If we could lower: duty further on locally assembled vehicles, I think we export many vehicles to our neighbouring countries.Sir, while still on the taxation of vehicles and spare parts, I think most of the accidents that occur in this country are caused by two reasons. One, we have got too many old vehicles on our roads. That is because most of the people of cannot afford to buy new vehicles because they are very expensive If the tax level was lowered a bit, our people would be able to buy new vehicles and we would have fewer accidents on our roads.Sir, while still on the taxation measures which were the main theme in this year budget. We should look seriously into the quality of the products that we produce. Sir, from past experience, when an industry is started, the first items to Je produced are taken to the Kenya Bureau of Standards. They are checked in order to make sure that they are quality goods. After that nobody goes back to the factories to check whether the same industry is still producing quality goods .Consequently,THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE (Mr. Ndongt)(ctd.):a lot of the products that are manufactured in this country are below  standard, and therefore, we cannot sell them outside Kenya. I have in mind things like the brake linings. I am sure that most of the hon. Members know that if you put some of those brake linings in your car, they make a lot of noise end they get worn out within a very short time. That is just one example. We have to check on the quality of our products. If we are going to be export orientated, our goods must be competitive.Sir, I would like to thank the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for creating the export processing zones in this country. But Sir, we should have some very tight controls on those products, because many of them shall find their way into the local market as opposed to the international markets, and that will defeat the purpose for which those zones were intended.Sir, from time to time, before the main Budget is read there are some mini budgets, but I am happy because this time the essential goods were not affected. I would like to urge the Ministry not to increase the prices of things like sugar, bread, flour, edible oils and gas because they affect the wananchi directly. As we all know, the standard of living has gone up, and most of those people cannot afford to meet their basic needs.	THE ASSISTANT MINISTER F0R COMMERCE (Mr. Ndong ) (Ctd.):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have seen from the revenue estimate books to that part of the entries have not been charged in the coming financial year, that is 9909 and. as a result ,we are only "budgeting for about £300, 000 as opposed to £.6 million of last financial year. I wonder what has happened to the collection of past debts.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Local Government tendering system is" still centralized. You find that when the Eoma Bay County Council wants to build a sever or something like that, everything has to be started here in Nairobi and this is defeating the purpose for district focus for rural development programme. This is the only Ministry that is awarding tenders at the head office. I have one case in point which a contractor was awarded a tender to construct a market at Eoma Bay. This contractor ran away but he continued to be paid. I would there for suggest that the tendering system of the Ministry of Local Government be decentralized as soon as possible.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me now tm turn to the roads. As we are all aware, there are certain infrastructures which are vital in any economy, some and of these vital infrastructures are roads, water supply, electricity and so on. It is unfortunate that the state of roads in my constituency is very bad, particularly in a location known as Olkagan Location. When it rains, roads particular in this area are completely impassable. I would like the Ministry to consider in the improvement of Oyugis Kelungu Bay Road which has been in the Budget for the last ten years and also Kendu EomaBay road which has been tarrnacked during this financial year. There is a small stretch on this road which was left untarmacked and I would like to appeal to the Ministry to allocate the necessary funds to finish off the tarmacking of this road.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would now like to turn to what we have seen appearing in our dailies over a couple a months ago. I am surprised by what I have often read in our newspapers, particularly when I ponder over what His Excellency the President has done far this country over the years. We have very good roads in this country, not to mention other heights of development.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE (Mr. Ndong ) (Ctd. ):I would in particular like to refer to the utterances which have recently been made by the leaders of the so called C.P.K. If the followers of this church cannot do away with their present bishops, then I would suggest that this religious sect should be banned. Every time that we have a problem in this country, you find it is Bishop Kuria,3dnrrirs Bishop Gitari, Bishop Okullu, Bishop Muge and the like who are issuing statements. We have the S.D.A Church, the Catholic Church and the rest, but we have never heard the leaders of these churches making controversial statements. What we know now is that the C.P.K. has a become a sort of an opposition party and since this is an illegal opposition party, then the law should take its course. Why should a bishop from this church issue a statement saying that people died in Muoroto? We have had cases where foreign papers have written lies about Kenya, after they have been asked by these same leaders. If these bishop's do not change their attitude, then I think something ought to be done. I would request that Bishop Kuria to step down so that somebody else can take over the running of this church. If he does not do so, then I think this church should be banned here in Kenya.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LAND HOUSING ANDPHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Mutiso): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing to me to contribute to this very important debate. First of all, I would like to congratulate His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for the manner in which he presented this years Budget. This Budget has a lot to give to wananchi in the way of service and I will mention only a few things which I consider to be of great importance to us.Personally, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am greatly concerned just like every hon. Member has "been, about the number of road accidents that have been occurring on our roads. These accidents have been brought about by speeding matatu vehicles on our narrow roads due to greed for money. We have heard of cases where drivers have moved at excess speeds in order to make several trips on a journey in order to make a lot of money. I am pleased to note the removalTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER THE FOR LANDS HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Mutiso) (Ctd)of duty on speed governors. This is a very important step which will in turn benefit this country. Since this duty tan: has now been s± waived, I would like to urge the Government to make it mandatory for minibuses, buses, lorries and so on to be fitted with speed governors before they are sold by the dealers. In this way, we shall control the speeds of these vehicles on our roads so that accidents can be minimized. This is a very important point and we are all grateful to the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for having considered taking this step.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is one other important point I would like to raise, regarding the Ministry of Works. There is a particular road in my constituency which connects– – – </NEWSPEECH>	<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER EDUCATION (Mr. Omido): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it really in order for Hon. Karingi to cross the Floor right here instead of first walking to the Bar and bowing to the Chair before crossing the Floor? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mahihu): He is definitely out of order. I think he should go back the right way and cross the floor as is the normal procedure here. </NEWSPEECH>(Mr. Karingi went to the Bar, bowed to the Chair and crossed the Floor)<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Mutiso): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I hope that you will give me back my two minutes that have been consumed.I was saying that there is a road connecting Kenyatta Location and Katangi, in Yatta Constituency, which needs very emergency attention from the Ministry of Transport and Communication. It is my request that as soon as the money allocated to this particular Ministry comes, the Minister takes note of this road. There is also a borehole which serves as the life of that area. Certain gadgets in the borehole broke down and water cannot now come out. Therefore, I appeal to the Ministry concerned to find out how it can remove the broken down gadgets and get the water pump working so that people there may get water before we get into the drier periods of this season.Having said that, I would now like to touch on a very important matter that has been bewildering this country, that is the mode of democracy that Kenya has chosen to follow, and which is being criticised by certain friendly nations without coming out into the open. These nations say that they will extend their aid only to countries that practise the democracy of a multiparty system. I am sure that you know and that everybody sees what is happening in Africa with regard to the fact that those countries that have multiparty systems do not enjoy peace. However, since we chose to follow a one party system in 1965, even without legalising it the legalisation of our one party system was done only the other day we have been running this country well. We have already seen the problems that can be brewed by a multiparty system.I was present in the Old Chamber when the former Member for a certain constituency in Rift Valley, hon. Murgor, handed a whistle to the late President Kenyatta. Hon. Murgor said, "If trouble continues the way it is now, I am going to blow this whistle and all the Kikuyus and non-Kalenjins in Rift Valley will be driven off." However, because of the peace and tranquility that had come, he voluntarily came forward and handed the whistle to the President in the Old Chamber. Since that time, Kenya has continued to enjoy a lot of peace with people of all races and tribes enjoying free movement in the countryTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Mutiso) (Ctd.) because we are all children of one father, the Kanu Party. You can leave this place and go to Garissa, Wajir, Mombasa, Kisumu or any other corner of Kenya so long as you identify yourself as an African of Kenyan origin and a Kanu member, and you will enjoy peace there. There is no problem in this country.We have been running this country under the Kanu Party all these years, and we have achieved the height of development under Kanu. Many other nations envy us and they now want to stir up problems so that we may experience the difficulties that they themselves are facing. I want to ask Kenyans to be wise and see that we are being envied by many other nations, particularly those that manufacture weapons to sell to Africans so that they may slaughter themselves. Because there has been peace here, these countries wonder what miracle we have performed to continue to live peacefully for the last 27 years when some nations in this continent have not managed to govern themselves even for one solid year before a coup comes up. Once the first coup comes up, this trend continues endlessly. Blood has been shed and lives have lost in such coups, and we do not want to have such a situation in Kenya. We are satisfied with our one-party mode of democracy, which Kenyans themselves have chosen, and we do not want anybody else to choose for us what kind of democracy we should follow. It is said that one man's meat is another man's poison. So, if certain countries have their multiparty systems and they suit them, this does not mean that such a system will suit us too. To us, the one-party system is enough because we have achieved a lot under it. We do not want anybody to preach to us on this issue.With these remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL HERITAGE (Mr. Lalampaa): Ahsante, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipa nafasi hii. Ningependa kuichukua nafasi hii kumpongeza Mtukufu Makamu wa Rais na Waziri wa Fedha, kwanza, kwa jinsi alivyoyawasilisha Makisio ya Matumizi ya Pesa za Umma kati ya mwaka huu na mwaka ujao. Vile vile, ninampongeza kwa kuwa hakuongeza bei za vyakula. Wananchi wanaifurahia Bajeti hii kwa sababu bei za vyakulaTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL HERITAGE (Mr. Lalampaa) (Ctd.)hazikuongezwa, jambo ambalo lengemwumiza mwananchi. Makamu wa Rais na Waziri wa Fedha anastahili kupongezwa kwa kuwa hakuongeza bei ya petroli na diseli. Kama bei hii ingeongezwa, bila shaka, ingezilamisha bei za vitu vingine kuongezeka. Kwa hivyo, ninatoa pongezi na shukrani kwa Makamu wa Rais na Waziri wa Fedha kwa kumlinda mwananchi asiumie sana.Ningependa kugusia habari ya maendeleo yetu kwa vile sasa Bunge linatoa kibali ili pesa za umma zitumiwe katika miradi mbali mbali ya maendeleo katikanchi hii. Ningependa hasa kugusia habari ya maendeleo wilayani na kumpongeza Mtukufu Rais kwa kuleta wazo la kuanzisha kamati za maendeleo ya wilaya ambazo zinawawezesha watu kukaa chini na kushauriana juu ya mahitaji yao, kama vile maji, shule, hospitali na kadhalika. Kile ambacho ningependa kuwaambia watumishi wa umma ambao ni watekelezaji wa miradi mbali mbali, yaani implementing officers, ni kwamba hivi sasa wanapewa kibali cha kutumia pesa za umma na hivi karibuni kila Accounting Officer atatoe ruhusa ya kutumia pesa kwa kila Wilaya. Si vizuri kwa maofisa watekelezaji kupewa pesa na Bunge na Accounting Officers, halafu wanachelewachelewa kuitekeleza miradi ya maendeleo mpaka mwishowe wanarudisha pesa katika Hazina. Pana haja gani ya kurudisha pesa katika Hazina wakati ambapo wananchi wanahitaji maji, elimu, matibabu na vitu vingine?Ninakubali kwamba sisi Wabunge ni wainachama wa kamati za maendeleoya wilaya.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR H0ME AFFAIRSAND NATIONAL HERITAGE (MR.Lalampaa) (ctd);Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, sisi Wabunge si naofisa wa utekelezaji. Kazi yetu ni kutoa maoni na mapendekezo kwenye niiku.tano ya kamati za maendeleo wilayani. Eazi ya maofisa wa utekelezaji ni kuhakilcLsha kwamba hakuna peni liata moja ambalo linarudishwa kwenye Hazina ya Serikali. Hii ni kwa sababu wananchi wanahitaji hudumanani lazima pesahizi zitumiwekwa njia nzuri.Vile vile yafaa sisi sote tuwe wazalendo. Ni lezima kila mtu ayajali aaslahi ya mvenzake. Hii ni kwa sababu kila wakat Mtukufu Rais amekuwa akituliimiza kayajali maslahi wa wenzetu kote nchini.Pia ningependa kugusia juu ya mambo ambayo yanachapishwa kwenye magazeti humu nchini. Ni jambo la aibu natena la kusikitisha kwa viongozi wa kidini kushuhudia sambo ya uwongo. Hawa watu wanashuhudia manbo yasiyo ya kweli. Sitaki kulita neno "uwongo" kwa sababu halizrohusiwi katika Sunge hili.Hawa viongozi wa makanisa huhubiri makanisani kila Jumapilina haizai kusena mambo yasiyo ya kweli. Hii ni kva sababumoja ya zile Amri Sum za Liungu inasema “usimshuhudie Irani yako uwongo," Izibona sasa kiongozi wa kanisa na lias a askofuameanua kusema mambo yasiyo ya kweli? Hili ni jambo la kusikitisha Serikali ina njia za kuifanya uchunguzi kanili na imewahakikisiiiawananchi kwamba hakuna mtu aliyepoteza maisha yake wakati wa zileharakati za kubomoa vibanda pale Muoroto. Lakini jambo la kushangaza ni kwamba kiongozi fulani wa kidini ameanza kuwapotosha Wakenya na watu wa ulimwengu mzima aidsema kwamba kuna watuambao walifariki katika kisa hicho. Ukweli ni kwamba hakuna mtu ye yote ambaye alikufa siku hiyo. Bila shaka mtu huyo ana njama fulani. Bila shaka yeye anataka kuwafurahishaTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL HERITAGE (MR. lalanpaa) (ctd);wageni na vile vile kuiaibisha Serikali yetu tukufu. Hicho ni kitendo ciia aibu kubwa.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Mud a, mimi ni mfuasi wa kanisa la 4 Church of the Province of Kenya yaani C.P.K Eat a hivyo, mimi si mpumbavu kiasi cha kuweza kupotoshwa na mawazo ya vvageni. Kama mfuasi wa kanisa Iiili ningependa kuwaonba wale wanaoketi kwenye vikao vya Provincial Synod wahakikishe kwamba neno "Province" limeoniolewa kwenye jina la kanisa hilo ili libakie "Church of Kenya" peke yake. Hii ni kwa sababu Kenya si mkoa wa nclii yo yote katika dunia hii. Kwa hivyo ni lazima kanisa hili liarize koitwa "The Church of Kenya"." Kule Uingereza kanisa hilo hali julikani kama. The Church of the Province of England" bali lajulikana kama "The Church of England" Siva hivyo haifai kuziendeleza tabia ya mitindo ya kikoloni. They are not a province of any country in this world. Kenya ni nchi inayojitawala. Kwa hivy° yafaa jina la kanisa hilo libadilishwe ili liwe "The Church of Kenya" Ni matumaini yangu tzwamba Askofu LIkuu, Manasses Kuria pamoja na Provincial Synod yake, watahakikishe kwamba ile kasumba ya kikoloni ineondolewa kabisa.Bw. Naibu Spika wa LIuda, hivi majuzi tulisoma kwenye magazeti kwamba Askofu Alexander Muge aliitembelea Marekani na akakatazwa kuhubiri katika kanisa fulani la Kiangilikana. Hii ni kwa sababu alitisha kuilaani ile tabia ya ushoga yaani homosexuality na lesbianism. Yeye aliambiwa kwamba akilaani tabia hizo kanisa lake litakoma kupativwa misaada kutoka Amerika. Kwa utaona kwamba kanisa la C.P.K. lingali linapokea misaada kutoka nje ya nchi hii. Hata hivyo ningependa kumpongeza Askofu Muge kwa kusema kwamba akipata nafasi . atailaani tabia hiyo.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS AMD NATIONAL HERITAGE (Mr.: Lalarapaa) (ctd);Hii ni kwa sababu neiio lake Mwenye zi Mungu halikuabliani na nam to kama hayo. Huu ni ukweli mtupu. Eva hivyo ningewaomba viongozi wa kanisa la C.P.K. wajione kama Wakenya na si vibaraka vya wageni. Sisemi k.vamba viongozi wote wa kanisa hilo ni vibaraka wa wageni lakini kuna wengine ambao wameku_bali kotumiwa na wageni. Yafaa wafaiiamu kwamba ni jambo la aibu kukubali kutumiwa na wageni ili kuisaliti nchi hii. Ni lasima sisi sote tuipende nchi hii navile vile koitumikia vilivyo. Hii ni kwa sababu Kenya ni mama yetu. Hata kama mama yako ana sura mbaya au ni kiwete bado yeye ni mama yako. Huwezi kumchukua mwanamke zrwingine mrembo na kusema kwamba yeye ndiye mama yako. Hilo ni jambo ambalo haliwezekani. Eva hivyo hakuna nchi nyingine mbali na Kenya ambayo inaweza katufaa sisi Wakenya. Sisi tumezaliwa hapa Kenya; tunelelewa hapa Kenya na tutakufa na kuzikwa katika nchi hii. Kwa hivyo ni lazima tuitumikie nchi yetu visuri.Eva hayo machache, naunga mkono. <NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Dr. Onyonka) : Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for according me an opportunity to add my voice to the voices of the other hon. Members who have expressed support for the Budget recently presented to the House by the Vice-President and Minister for Finance. I would like to congratulate him for the emphasis he placed on incentives to producers and exporters. This is because this is in line with our stated policy of restructuring the economy so that instead of proceeding on the previous path on the basis of the policy of import substitution, we would like to see more export promotion in order to build a stronger balance of payments for this country which as you mi know is a major constraint with respectTHE MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (CTD) :to the necessary resources that we raise for development.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will limit remarks to just a few points. I am very much in support of the suggestion or the proposal by His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance that investment in the rural areas to the tune of KShs.20 million, will receive exemption from tax. This is because given the depreciation of our currency and the fact that we also need even a larger size of these projects in the rural areas, I do hope that both local and external investors will take advantage of this provision.THE MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (ctd.):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other point that I would like to touch on briefly relates to the fact that we must not view the Budget proposals as the only elements in the whole equation. What His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance has done is to provide guidance with one facet or aspect of the whole exercise of trying to promote development. People sometimes speak as if these proposals are the only critical elements in the equation. A great deal also hinges on what we are doing elsewhere. For instance, one could have all these incentives but have problems if the roads are impassable, pricing for commodities is not right, if the education system is not functioning properly and if the general management is deficient. So it is, therefore, important in my view, to look at the Budget proposals in their proper perspective because what it has done is to shed light on what needs to be done in certain areas that we consider important at the moment. We need to ensure that the other elements in the equation are fulfilled otherwise we are going to have frustrated development irrespective of the incentives that we have. It is in this connection that I hope that we shall have as wider participation as possible in the implementation of our policies in order to achieve our goals.Admitably we have realized a growth rate of 5 per cent over the recent past. This is no mean achievement for this country when put in the context of the African Continent. We are also not complacent about it. It is important therefore to note that we have beenunablesustain the rate of our national development. All the same we are upagainst many obstacles some of which are pretty wellknown to hon. Members which I do not need to dwell on. It is important to ensure that we have.:an economic system that works. This means that each sub sector has to do its fair share of what needs to be done otherwise we shall not meet our future targets.In this connection and in the context of the current debate about multiparties, I would like to emphasise the fact that, there is going to be a tendency for people to underplay the difficulty of resolving some of our problems. The most obvious example of this is unemployment. There is noTHE MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (ctd.):panacea for this problem and I was amazed, to hear this being mentioned by some of them. The truth of the matter is that no one has the magic ward to enable him to create jobs for people. We have to save, invest and make the economy of the country to grow to achieve this otherwise it is mere propaganda to say that one can create jobs. The truth of the matter is that when we look at history, since and I have had the chance to observe and visit the majority of our African states under the Preferential Trade Area (PTA), I can say frankly what the situation is in most of these African countries, I Although we have done our best there is plenty of scope for us to improve. But it is going to be dangerous propaganda if we are going to tell wananchi: "If I will be there tomorrow, I will create all the jobs that you are all expecting to get the following morning." That is dangerous and we have to caution against it. Such a thing is not possible in the immediate short term. In any case, Africa is replete with examples of guys who came in yesterday and said that those who were there before	did nothing and they are the miracle performers on the spot. Such people would further say; "Give us a chance and you will see the miracles taking place.” What happens after that Disaster, misery and bitterness. So it is my opinion that it would be dangerous for us to sit idle and let people say any gabbage that comes into their heads – I am sorry to have had to use that Un-parliamentary word.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are some issues which are not readily amenable to simplistic solutions. Given our population structure, the number of young people entering the labour force is very large. The number of them going through the education system is large; but this is also the index of our success; for education is a right. One cannot entirely say: "Only if you are going to employ all of them, should you allow them to get higher education." Some of them would like to get it on their own right as citizens of this country and as human beings. But I would like to caution that in the course of the ongoing debate, we should not engage in deluding ourselves that we have a magic ward or panacea that multiple parties are going to create jobs forus in Kisii, Mombasa Nairobiv Kalcamega and whenever you want to have them.THE MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (ctd.):		Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like to emphasise the fact that when we talk about multiple parties, they do not have to be national parties. Hon. Chesire or hon. Ogle can start their own parties in their villages tomorrow in the morning. We are not talking of one, two or three parties, but even of I00 parties. But the consequences of such parties are obvious chaos, confusion and so on. In my view, the critical factor in this connection is what his Excellency the President has restated many times over. At this particular juncture and time, I do not believe that this country is ready for a chain of parties. There is a possibility that those saying so, although they are Kenyans and live amongst us live in ivory towers totally out of touch with the realities that are confronting this country at this time. Although these people are experienced and well educated, they live in a world of fantasy. That is what I fear is happening. There are outsiders prepared to lecture us the way they have done for decades and centuries. They are trying to tell us what is good for us irrespective of what our own experiences have imparted on us. This is not a question of personalities, because I know most of the people who are playing the game now because I have worked with most of them over the last 20years. The truth of the matter is, although some of us have been given responsibilities and while some have delivered the goods while others have not, we must focus on one thing the national interest. As individuals we are not (indispensable. Dr. Onyonka is here today, tomorrow he is out; but Kenya continues. That is what is vital and critical that we must establish viable institutions– </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mahihu): Order! I think your time is over, Dr. Onyonka. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Dr. Onyonka): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KITELE: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving a minute or two to air my views on the debate on the Financial Statement. First of all, I would like to thank the father of this nation forMR. KITELE (ctd.):leading this nation very well and for initiating a lot of development projects like the Nyayo Wards, schools and so on.MR. KITELE (ctd):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are very grateful to the father of this nation because he has led this country very well. We are also satisfied with, the leadership of the ruling party Kanu. Since the multiparty debate is a hot issue, I think I should comment on it.We are satisfied with Kanu and we do not want an outsider to come and tell us "This is good for you and this is what we have done in several countries". We are satisfied with the way we are leading our nation and we have no interest in multi-parties. Let those people go and preach that in other countries because here in Kenya we have decided that we are not interested.In my constituency, Kathiani, we met the other day and passed a vote of no confidence in those who want several parties in this country. We also affirmed our confidence in the President and the ruling party Kanu. The people of Machakos District do not want to hear anything about multiparties; they only read about it in the local newspapers and when they come to Nairobi.I do not think that those who are talking about multiparties are normal. It is the high tine they were taken to Mathari Mental Hospital and be examined thoroughly.I would now like to comment on the Muoroto issue. The residents of Muoroto have said that nobody died in Muoroto and yet somebody is insisting that several people died. Who knows better? Is it the residents of the village or an outsider? We are surprised to hear this. I thought that the work of religious leaders was to preach the good word of Jesus Christ. Their work is to convert non-christians to Christianity but not to be involved in other matters.We are satisfied with the leadership of our Government and we do not want to be given an alternative. We are happy with one party and if we allow the formation of several political parties, we shall be encouragingMR. KITELE (ctd):tribalism. For example, the Naasai people will have their own political party and so will the Kamba, Luo, Kikuyu, the Coast Province people and so on and the whole country will be thrown into zchaos. We are doing very well in the development of this nation and we want to be left alone.Turning now to this year's Budget, I would like to thank the Vice President and Minister for Finance for the good work he did. This year's Budget was a very good one and the wananchi are very happy with it because the prices of essential commodities were not raised at all. The only prices of commodities which were increased touched on luxuries, such as, cigarettes, beer and so on. Taking into account what the wananchi have said, I think this is one of the best Budgets we have ever had in this country.Let me now turn to the Ministry of Health. As I am talking now ,there is no X-ray equipment in Machakos General Hospital. Patients are now going to private hospitals in Machakos and Nairobi for X-ray services. Since funds are going to be allocated to the Ministry, it should look into that and provide an X-ray machine to Machakos General Hospital. Machakos is a big district with I0 constituencies and the people who are about 2 million depend on this hospital.The other thing is with regard to the state of roads in Machakos District. When the Ministry of Public Works gets its share of funds, it should look into the state of roads. For example, the roads in my constituency, Kathiani, are impassable. Machakos is a big district and the two tractors which the Ministry gave us are not enough. We should be given more tractors to cater for roads in this area. 2oads get damaged during the heavy rains and the Ministry should see to it that all roads in the country are attended to.Turning to research, I would like to say that since Kenya is an agricultural country, research is paramount. The Ministry of Reclamation and Development of Arid, Semi-Arid and Wasteland should work in collaborationMR. KITELE (ctd):	with the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology in order to carryout research on food crops which can be grown in dry areas. For example, some parts of Machakos District are dry and we would like to know the type of crops which can he cultivated there and also harvested within a few months. If research is done,a we will be able to harvest plenty of food with little rain.The other thing which I would like to comment on is industry. Most industries are situated in Nairobi whereas none are in Kathiani. Athi River is a suitable area for the cultivation of sugarcane and if this venture is undertaken, we can even have a sugar factory there to supplement other sugar industries in the country. I urge the Ministry of Agriculture to consider this recommendation.Electricity should also be extended to the rural areas so that population industries can be established there. If this is not done, the rate of population growth in major towns will continue to rise and we may not be able to accommodate the people. If industries can be established in the rural areas, people will move and settle there.With these few remarks, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr.Chesire): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to contribute to the Budget Debate.First of all, I must congratulate the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for giving us a Budget that is progressive, a Budget that is forward looking and are that is full of many challenges.We all know that in many parts of the developing world it is very difficult to produce Budgets. In fact, in some places they only produce one page piece of paper and then they say it is the Budget for the whole nation. However, here we have a Budget that is efficient and forward looking, and I must congratulate his Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for the very hard work he did along with his officials in the Treasury to give us such a Budget.Sir, we all know this is a developing country. We are all growing. We are all going through our 27 years of Independence, and there is a lot that we have achieved. There is a lot also that we desire to achieve. These things can only he achieved through peace and stability. Without peace and stability we shall be unable to achieve the great strides that we have made. We also know that where., we have strives and competition we are unable to do the development that we have set ourselves to do.Sir, we have heard a lot from the advocates of the multi-party systems and we have also given them our answers. All we know is that they have never told us anything or they have never given us an alternative that they think can help this country to develop any better than we have done. All that we know is that those who are advocating for multiparty systems are people who are selfish, jealous of the development and the great strides that we have done. They think that they can do better but, course, they cannot do it.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK: DEVELOPMENT (Mr.Chesire ) (Ctd.):In fact, I was listening to the British Broadcasting Corporation this morning and they said that one country in Africa that decided to go for multiparty the Zaire to mention one is having very serious trouble and problems at the moment.  They are now seriously thinking of going back to their unity party where people can think together, it is the same thing here. The minute we say that we are going to have many parties it will be parties of tribes, sections and so on. Those of us who know what happened before Independence, and even after Independence, we must think twice before we move to cause chaos for ourselves.Sir, going by the Budget, as the Vice-President and Minister for Finance mentioned, agriculture is still the prime mover of the economy of this country. The majority of the population of this country is in the rural areas and they are employed in agriculture. I know over the years this Government has taken various measures that have gone a long way towards improving life in the rural areas. I must, congratulate the Government for doing that but, at the same time, I would like to say that in order to provide more roller employment and also stop the rural/urban migration, we have to seriously consider many more activities to be carried out by the rural folk.In this respect, Sir, I am glad to note that his Excellency .The Vice-President and Minister for Finance is giving sorts of incentives for investment in the rural areas. The only problem we have is that the people I the rural areas do not understand anything about these investment opportunities. I would, therefore, like to urge the office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance as well as the Ministries of Commerce and Industry to go out of their ways and to have field officers, through the Industrial Promotion Services, going out and actually educating the rural people about the investment opportunities in the rural areas.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr.Chesire) (Ctd.)I say so because I am sure many people would be very much interested to invest, to set up factories and to run big shops in the rural areas, but what they lack is the know-how. I would like to see us spending a bit of money this financial year in going out to the people and start educating them, showing them exactly what can be done. Also, there are prospective investors or rather financiers who are willing to go to the rural areas. The Industrial Promotion Services should also assist to connect these people the financiers to the rural people who are also willing to invest alongside them so that we can also boost business development in the rural areas.Sir, while I am on that issue, I would also like to touch on growing of certain crops. I know we have now achieved self sufficiency in maize growing. I would like to urge that everything possible be done to boost wheat production in the country because it is a major drain of foreign exchange of this country at the moment. I would like to urge that instead of us importing wheat from America year in year out, we should actually import equipment, machinery, tractors and so on from them and we go out to cultivate the high potential areas of Narok, Uasin Gishu, Nanyuki and try to maximize on the production of wheat so that we can become self sufficient in wheat..Sir, I would like also to mention about one serious disease that has cropped up in my area, particularly in the Eldoret North Constituency. This is malaria. To us, malaria was very strange coin the highlands. We knew malaria was found at the coast, lower areas and also in Kisumu areas. But now we have malaria in Uasin Gishu and already very Many people have died from this disease. For instance, last week alone we had nearly 30 people who died from the disease, and many more are dying. I must congratulateTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER POR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Chesire) (Ctd. ):the Ministry of Health for the action it has taken very quickly to go and stop the further spread of the disease. But I would also like to take this opportunity to urge the Ministry to put up more dispensaries in those areas. At the moment, dispensaries are far apart and it is difficult for people to get to the treatment centres easily. I would, therefore, like to Health to seriously consider putting up dispensaries in places like Chesaita, Turbo, Mailo I3, Sugoi, Matunda at Moi's Bridge and Barsombe in Moiben. This will help a lot in alleviating the outbreak of malaria that is causing a lot of deaths at the moment.Sir, I would also like to request the Treasury to consider in future putting more funds through district development committees At the moment, the allocation of between KSh.3 to KSh.4 million per district is not enough. Prom what we know and also from experience, it is actually from the D.D.C. funds that we see tangible development taking place in all areas. When we are talking of, say, dispensaries, equipping schools with science equipment and so on, it is usually the D.D.C funds that do that, including rural roads. Therefore, in order to develop the rural areas more and better, we double the allocations to districts. I am sure that in doing that we should be able to double also the rate of physical development in the districts.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MIINISTER F0R EDUCATION (Mr. Onido):  Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to join my colleagues in congratulating his Excellency the Vice President and Minister for finance for the very reasonable Budget that he, presented to this House the other day. If you went to rural areas and asked the people there what they wanted, they would tell you that they want water for irrigation "because those living in arid areas would like to grow food; the farmers in our rural areas will tell u that they want better roads so that they can transport their produce fee fairly cheaply to the buying centres. The rural folk, and everybody in this country, will tell you that they would like to have cheaper medicines and better homes.The Budget was fair, but today we have people who would like to detract our move toward progress to provision of water for irrigation, better roads, cheaper fertilizers and so on for our people. Time and again the people's representatives have said in this House that they would like public funds to be utilised for the purposes for which they are intended. Let me take this opportunity to call upon the Minister responsible for finance to ensure that those who divert public funds to other uses are adequately brought to book. Every time public money is improperly spent, the public suffer; every time money is diverted to personal use the public suffer in that that money would have provided the services I have enumerated above to our people.I would like our people to know that multiparty advocates do not know what they are saying. My colleagues have said enough about this, but I was in Uganda in I972 before the overthrow of that country's Government and I saw how that country was. If you go there today, you will regret about what you will see. I was also In Nigeria before the overthrow of that country's Government and I saw what was happening. I have been there once again and I haveASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Omido) (CTD):seen what is happening. I was in Ghana and saw what was going on; I have "been there again and have seen what has been going on.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the enemies of Africa do not want Africa to progress; the enemies, of Africa have brought progressive Governments in Africa down; the enemies of Africa have got their eyes on our country because we are determined to move forward. Our people would like to have the pride of producing their own car, but our enemies do not want that because they want us to be their market. I could continue saying what we want to do. We want our universities to be in the forefront in inventing medicines that will help to improve the health of our people; our detractors would like us to buy cheap second hand medicines from them, which means no more than dumping it in our country. I have been to heard international conferences and have heard condemnation of people who dumped medicines in our country, which have gone a long way in eliminating our babies; it is sad that our detractors would not like us to improve this situation.Thus the multiparty advocates are only diverting our attention from development issues. I would, therefore, like to join my colleagues, like hon. Kubo, in saying that we should not be seen to be panicking when people who do not know what they are saying talk. By reacting to what they are saying we seem to be building them; it seems as if we are afraid of them; it seems as if we are crying wolf. So let them talk but we should not be swayed; let our attention not be diverted from the match forward to progress and prosperity.As a christian I fell very ashamed because of seeing whole bishops and archbishops telling a lot of lies and misleading our people. As a christian I feel that maybe these people have forsaken God and the truth and have now decided to be theTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Omido) (CTD): hypocrites that we read of in the Holy Book. Now, where are we going? This is sad. It is written in the Bible that the Gentiles will come and in-herit the Kingdom of God because those who profess to be christians have backlided. I think this is the time for our people to open their eyes. It is the duty of every Kenyan to know that we have these detractors; it is the duty and responsibility us of every Kenyan to know that this is the time for us to run solidlyrally behind our President, who, together with his Government, is doing a good job. As hon. Dr. Onyonka said earlier, no miracle will come about and solve our problems. We have been to these big countries, which are preaching to us about multiparties, and we the have seen that they have same problems of unemployment that we have. A multiparty system is not going to bring miracles to this country.Mr. temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, those who are talking are doing no more than singing their master’s tune. Everybody in this country knows that when Mr. Rubia was the mayor of Nairobi the he wanted to equate himself with the late president Kenyatta; he is wants never satisfied. He always to be at the top even if people have not put him there. I always liken people like Mm to lucifer, about whom we read in the Bible. Lucifer also wanted to form another "party" in the Kingdom of God in heaven, but God refused to allow a "twoparty" system and dropped Lucifer out of heaven. We are not going to be intimidated. If there are Lucifers among us, then they must be he dealt with just the way God dealt with Lucifer. The Bible tells us that those who do not follow Ms commandments will inherit the everlasting fire.Now people are asking why those who are telling lies cannot be prosecuted. They keep on repeating blatant lies and defying authority. We know Muoroto well because we have always been there; we know that nobody died.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Omido) (ctd.):But somebody comes up and tells blattant lies to the country and the world because he want to become a matyre. You cannot become a matyre by telling blattant lies in the name of Christianity. What that clergyman said is very sad.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MIRUKA-OWUOR: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to make one or two observations regarding the Budget Speech delivered last week by the Vice-President and Minister for Finance. I wish to join my colleagues in congratulating His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for presenting a well thought out and well reasoned Budget, which is intended to foster development in all areas of this Republic.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the theme of the Budget is "Enhanced Economic Growth Through Export Promotion", and it is in this regard that I wish to make a few observations. The intention of the Budget is to put into action the policies enunciated in Sessional Paper No.l of I986, where the Government promulgated policies intended for economic management for renewed growth. It is a known fact that the economy of this country is based on agriculture; agriculture is by far the greatest foreign exchange earner and, for this Budget and the policy to succeed, much needs to be done to encourage the farming community.Sir, the farming community have certain problems which should be removed. First and foremost, the state of roads serving the farming areas must be improved because such roads pose great problems to the farmers during rains. It is important that roads in farming areas be attended to seriously so that farmers are able to reach their farms and carry out their farming activities. That will also ensure that farmers are able to remove their crops to market centres. This will be a great incentive that will increase production, and there will be the possibility of sufficient food being produced to serve: the country and also for export. That will be in furtherance I of the aims envisaged in this Budget.MR. MIRUKA0WU0R (ctd.):At the same time, better marketing facilities should be provided to the farmers so that when crops are ready they are ferried to the marketing centres without delay. There should also be arrangements to pay the farmer's on delivery of their crops. Many farmers have often been frustrated because they deliver their crop to the1 market centres and they are not paid on time.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, another appeal which I would like to make on behalf of farmers is the provision of domestic credits or loans in order to encourage faster economic growth. At the moment there is a need to review the position of domestic credit facilities so that loans are made available to all Kenyans on easy terms.(MR.MIRUKA OWUORC) (Ctd.):This will not only help the farmers, but the community at large. The wananchi should be given loans with easy repayment terms, and low interest rates so that they can help in the development of this country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the interest rates charged on loans have in recent years become very high, and that inhibits the incentives of the farmers to take the loans and help in the development of this country. Sir, there are also some Government parastatals which default in meeting their obligations to the Government and even the foreign lenders. During the Budget, I noted that the Treasury has often come to the aid of such parastatals, by paying their loans when those parastatals default. There have been cases where some parastatals have defaulted to pay ordinary wananchi. For example, with regard to of pounds wananchi took sugar cane worth millions to that parastatal but it defaulted, but the Treasury did not come to the aid of the appeal to wananchi. Therefore, I would like to the Minister to consider looking into that case where The wananchi took their sugar cane to the Miwani Sugar Mills, and the parastatal defaulted, and therefore, they are still owed millions of tax pounds by that parastatal. I would appeal to the Minister into ways to look into way of compensating those poor wananchi who were frustrated by that parastatal.Sir, I would like to say something with regard to the five percent tax which was imposed last year on agricultural produce. That tax is charged on the gross income of the produce of the farmer. That tax has hit sugar cane farmers seriously and many are now thinking of discontinuing production. I would, therefore, appeal toMR. MIRUXAOWUOR (ctd.):the Minister to consider revising that tax. Maybe, he can give a specific level at which that tax can be imposed or removed it completely. I think the Minister should not impose tax on the gross income, instead he should impose it on net income. Sir, since Independence, we have achieved a lot of progress due to the peace and stability that is prevailing in this country. That is why we have decided to support His Excellency the President always, and also the ruling Parity Kanu. When we were got our Independence, all Kenyans raised their fingers showing that they to slow that they wanted to be united under one political party.MR. MIMKA-OWUOR (Ctd.):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, any diversion from this practice is likely "to disturb" peace and stability in this country and I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to all hon. Members of this House and. wananchi as a whole, to continue in their support to the Government and the ruling Party Kanu. Our Government is run by a single party and we are all united as brothers and sisters and this is a very ideal system for better progress and improvement of the living standards of our people.As I pointed out earlier, this Budget is putting into action the policies Envisaged in Sessional tax Paper No".1 of 1986. I hope that the Minister that will ensure that the effect of this is felt particularly in the rural areas where the rate of development is rather slow. I have, for example, been appealing for loans for farmers, particularly the rice farmers. Last year I brought a Motion to this House and the Government agreed to increase the producer price of rice and I am grateful that they have already done so. However, I would like to appeal to the Ministry to make more loans available to rice fax and cotton growers to that they can maximize their production. This would enable I us to have enough rice and cotton for domestic consumption and for export.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKHAHU: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my colleagues in thanking and congratulating His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for the Budget Speech which he presented to this House on Thursday last week. One cardinal issue that the Vice-President and Minister for Finance touched on in his Safe Budget Speech was the political stability in this country and the need for us leaders to enhance that political stability for faster development in all areas of our planning. Disregarding the most ambitious plans that we may have in our future development in this country, we cannot achieve much in these plans, if there is no peace in this country. We cannot achieve anything for our people if there is no peace in the country and therefore, it is incumbent upon us leaders in this country to ensure that there is an ideal climate for political stability.MR.MAKHANU (CTD.):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I remember it was in 1983 when this August House passed a resolution that there shall be only one party running this Government. This was passed after holding various leaders conferences where discussions were carried out and ideas exchanged. Experiences over the years have clearly indicated that the only survival for this country is a one party system of Government. This is because; it is through a system of this nature that we can able to coordinate our development and political activities. From 1983 up to this time, it is only about seven years and this is a very short leader’s period for leaders to forget the reasons why we decided to have a one party system of Government. We have all enjoyed the fruits of political stability in this country and it is unfortunate that some of us leaders have now started advocating for a two party system of Government. We in this House have rejected this move and I am sure that most Kenyans support us in this. We must all try to work together as one team for the benefit of our nation. If we are not united, we are soon going to fall.MR. MAKHANU (CTD.):So it is upon us to call upon all those who have somehow been derailed to come back into the fold and join us in building this country through our political party, Kanu, under the wise leadership of our President, His Excellency Daniel arap Moi. We do not want to see chaos here, and each of us wants to eat, see his children go to school and have good roads, water and all other necessary basic needs, which are very cardinal to our lives. However, we cannot get these things if we advocate many parties.In the same way, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, that Parliament passed a resolution in 1962 that the country should be a one party state, it is upon us, as a Parliament, at this stage in our life as a country, to think further in political terms and enhance that resolution. I suggest that we should start thinking of making our President not in too long a time to come Life President so that people should not start thinking that there is a vacancy in the Presidency. We should think along this line because His Excellency the President has led us very well and done a lot of good things for this country. The only way in which we can thank him is by making him Life President so that he may continue to lead this country until God himself takes him away.Having said this, let me confirm that what we know in Bungoma is that the question of two or more parties here does not arise. So, we propose that the President be made Life President to lead us into greater development. Coming back to what His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance said, the theme of this year’s Budget is to enhance economic growth through export promotion. As far as I am concerned, this calls for a general mobilisation of our resources in order that we may grow more and attain economic growth which can enable us to export more and earn more foreign exchange. In mobilizing our resources, we should remember that one of our most vital of these resources is finance. We have various financial institutions, both private and Government owned, and I call upon our banking institutions to have an open minded policy when it comes to the development of the agricultural sector of this country. In some districts, such as Bungoma, banks have not been forthright;MR.MAKHANU (CTD.):they have rather been a little discriminative in issuing loans to farmers, always hiding behind the policy that certain farmers have no credibility. We, as a Government, have to come up and ensure that the farmer gets credit when it is due because unless we assist the farmer to get the necessary credit, we are not going to achieve much in our agricultural sector.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there glaring examples in our history to show that whenever there is a little drought or some simple political instability, we always get a shortage in food supply. It is now time for us to back to our old food policy to ensure that we have adequate food for the people of this country. For how long are we going to keep on importing food when we have the necessary financial resources, people and very arable land? Even arid land can be converted to produce more food.MR. MAKHANU (CTD);So, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let us put a little more of our financial resources into food production "because if we leave that sector as it is now, I am afraid that any little drought in this country will put is in a very precarious situation It will put us in a situation where we will "be forced to go round "begging all over the world for food supplies. So, I am calling upon the leaders and the Government to ensure that mobilization of financial resources is enhanced and the farmer is assisted.I would have expected that during the Budget Speech His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for finance should have reviewed once more––––––THE ASSISTANT MINISTER F0R PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Ogle): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the hon. Member on the Floor is making a very constructive contribution and he should be heard in absolute silence. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>AN HON MEMBER: You are the chairman of the noise makers. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.MAKHANU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, what I am saying is that I would have ejected His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance to have reviewed that tax which we imposed on the farmers last year. It should have been removed because the farmer is already paying cess to local authorities and other bodies. This tax is a burden to the farmer. I think in the course of the year, this tax should be reviewed with a view to doing away with it completely.MR.MAKHANU (CTD.):What I am talking about is increased food production in this Country. This is because we have been having food shortages and. every tine have these shortages we end up asking for food from other countries.I also wish to call upon our public sector officials to be fully accountable for the funds that we are going to allocate to our Ministries. They should account for these funds fully. We do not want to read about misuse of funds in the Public Accounts Committee Reports. These funds should be used to improve the agricultural sector and other sectors.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. NDZAI: Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, nimi nami ningependa kuitinga mkono Hotuba ya . Bajeti iliyotolewa na na Makanu wa Rais na asiri wa Feaha.Kwanza ningependa kuomba pesa hizi tunazojadili hapa zipelekwe kwenye wilaya ara moja. Hili ni jambo ameale litawawezesha maofisa wa utekelesaji kununua vifaa vinavyo hi t ajika . ili kuwesa kuikamilisha miradi waliyonayo na kowafaidi wananchi. Mwa mfano, kule Magarini kuna mradi wa maji	na Xamati ya Maendeleo ya TTilaya imetoa KShs.760,000/. Lakini utaona tx kwamba tangu mwesi Julai, 1939, hadi leo ununuzi wa vifaa haujamalizika. Mradi huu unajulikana kama M jana Heri katika kata ya Fundiissa. Ijapokuwa mradi huu umepatiwa KShs.760,000/ na kamati ya maendelo . utaona kwamba ofisa anayehusika anachelewesha kununua vifaa vinavyohitajika na hali bei ya vifaa hivi inazidi kwenda juu kila siku. Era hivyo ni lazima maofisa wanaohusika wahakikishe kwamba pesa wanazopewa zinatumika wakati unaofaa. </NEWSPEECH>MR.NDZAI (CTD.);	Bw.Naiba Spika Kwa Muda tunaishukuru Serikali yetu kutokan na usalama tulionao hapa nchini. Lakini utaona kaamba sehemu fulani fulani 2 za nchi Mi bado zinakabiliwa na shida ya kushaabuliwa na majaiigili wenye silaha. Hawa majangili hupiga na kuwaua watu. Visa vya ugaidi viinewahi .Irutokea katika seheinu za rldakacha, Adu na Eanagoni. Kwa hivyo tunaioioba Ofisi ya Rais ihakikishe kwasba konejengwa vituo vya polisi katika seheura laizo ili watu wa huko wawe na usalama wa kutosha.MR. NDZAI (CTD.):Tunaoraba vifaa vya shule vipelekwe wakati pesa zitakapopatikana. Vifaa hivyo pia vinafaa vipelekwe wakati unaofaa. Pia wakaguzi wa shule wanapata taabu sana kwani hawana magari na wakati mwingi hubidika kutumia mabas na matatu. Hii ina maana kuwa hawawezi kuwahudumia wananchi vizuri. Kwa hivyo, ingekuwa bora kama maofisa hawa wangepewa magari au pikipiki ili waweze kuzihudumia vizuri shule za huko ili watoto wetu waweze kufanya vizuri zaidi katika mitihani yao.Bw. Spika wa Muda, watu wengi wa mashambani hutegemea kilimo kwa mahitaji yao. Ingawa ni hivyo, barabara nyingi za huko ni mbaya sana. Kwa mfano, watu wa Magharini huishi kando kando ya barabara ya kutoka Marekebuni, Bate, Gharashi hadi Baricho. Ingawa barabara hii ina cheo cha D555, lakini bado haija-feia murram. Kama barabara hii ingetengenezwa watu wa huko wangeweza kuyapeleka mavuno yao huko mijini.Nakumbuka vizuri sana hapo mwaka wa 1986, Serikali ilitangaza kwamba ile ardhi ya Serikali iliyoko Kilifi itagawanywa na kupewa maskwata walioko huko. Tungependa kuiomba Wizara ya Ardhi, Nyumba iwapeleke" wapimaji wa mashamba huko ili kazi hii iweze kukamilika. Sote tunajua kuwa The Land Act inasema kuwa Mkenya yeyote anaweza kuomba ardhi na kupewa katika sehemu yoyote ya nchi hii. Hii ina maana kama Wizara haitaigawanya ardhi hii basi Mkenya yeyote anaweza kuiomba ardhi hiyo na kupewa ambako watu wa Kilifi watabaki maskwata. Kwa hivyo, ningependa kusisitiza kuwa ardhi inafaa kupimwa na kugawanywa haraka ^wezgkanayo vj ili watu wa Magharini wapewe ardhi hiyo.Watu wengi huhamia mijini kwa sababu ya usalama, maji, kazi na barabara nzuri. Nafikiri wakati umefika ambako serikali inahitajika kutumia pesa huko mashambani ili kuanzishwe viwanda—— </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mahihu): Order, hon.

The House is therefore adjourned until tomorrow, Wednesday, 13th June, at 9.00 a.m. </NEWSPEECH>The House rose at thirty minutes past Six o'clock.MR. MWAMZANDI (Ctd):sababu wananchi wenyewe walimsikia Mtukufu Rais akitoa amri hiyo ya utengenezaji wa barabara lakini hakuna chochote kinachofanywa. Tumaiaibisha Serikali.Tunavyoomba hapa ni kwamba barabara ya Kinango iwekwe hiyo lami kama ilivyoamrishwa na Mtukufu Rais. Ingefaa lami hiyo iwekwe kupitia kwenye hosspitali hadi kwenye kituo cha polisi, kama tulivyopitisha, na kutoka Kidimu hadi Shimoni. Kwa njia hii itaonekana kuwa angalau tumepata lami kidogo huko Kwale. Ugawa-nyaji wa mkate wa taifa haufanyiki kwa haki kwa sababu sehemu nyingine nchini zina maili na maili za barabara za lami.Leo, Bw. Spika wa Muda, ukitaka kwenda Ndavaya, utafikiri mara saba kabla ya kuianzisha safari hiyo, na ni lazima utafute vipuli vya gari lako ndipo uweze kusafiri kwenye barabara hiyo. Kwa kusema kweli Wizara inayohusika imeshindwa na kazi yake. Hii ndiyo sababu ninauliza ni lini barabara ya kwenda Mangwee kutoka Majoreni itatengenezwa. Hii, ni-ibarabara ,fupi sana, ni. kazi ya zile zinazojulikana kama secondary roads. Waziri anaye husika anasema lcwamba kamati ya maendeleo wilayani haijaketi na kulipitisha jambo hilo. Je, hata urekebishaji wa barabara unahitaji kupitishwa kwenye kamati za maendeleo wilayani? Sote tunajua kuwa ni barabara mpya tu ambazo ni lazima zifikiriwe na kamati hizi. Ikiwa Waziri mzima atasimama hapa na kusema kwamba barabara fulani haiwezi kurekebishwa kwa sababu kamati ya maendeleo wilayani haija-kutana na kujadiliana kuhusu jambo kama hilo, basi ameshindwa na kazi yake.Tumeletewa matrakta mawili mapya lakini hayana trailers za kubeba murrum. Hata siku hizi hayacnekani kwa kuwa kila mara ina-semekana hakuna petroli ya kuyaendesha. Je, tunatakikana tusisafiri tukae tu, kwa sababu Waziri Mibei ameshindwa kazi yake? Hii ni aibu moja kubwa. Huwezi kutembea na gari dogo huko Kwale; ni lazima uwe na gari kubwa kama vile Land-Rover? Hii ni kwa sababu gani?THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (CTD.):production under both irrigation and rain-fed conditions.

Under the project, 21, 600 hectares will be put under rice production.This spreads from Busia, Siaya, Bungoma and South Myanza District. The project started in the year 1989/90 financial year and it is expected to be implemented over a period of six years. The following activities are planned for the year 1990/91 financial year.
