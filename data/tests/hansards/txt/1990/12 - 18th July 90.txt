HANSARD Thursday, 12th July, 1990, The House met at thirty minutes past Two oclock	Speaker in the ChairPRAYERS<Header>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</Header>Question No. 360	Payment of Death Gratuity to Moetyanes Kin<Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Ekidor is not here? Let us have Mr. Mureithis Question.</Newspeech>Question No. 348Completion of Endarasha Power Programme<Newspeech>MR. MUREITHI asked the Canister for. Energy what is delaying the completion of Endarasha Rural Electrification Programme.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Moturi): Mr. Sir, I beg to reply. Lack of funds towards the end of the last financial delayed the completion of this programme. However, work has no resumed.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>Mr. MUREITHI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Assists Minister for his straightforward answer. I am also aware that commenced on this project one week ago. But since usually war asked to organise themselves and raise funds towards projects like this and considering that this Ministry has no officers in the divis is it possible for the Assistant Minister to tell us who should explain to wananchi the procedure and when the rural electrification is being implemented?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MOTURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, projects like this a normally go through the district development committees (DDCs), hon. Member is a member of the DEC in his district.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUREITHI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know that these projects are approved by the DDCs. But at the project implementation stage wananchi are told to organise themselves into small groups to raise, funds and even open "bank accounts. Some people like in my constituency, are told to raise Shs.2,500/ per person; and others are asked to raise bigger amounts. Can	Assistant Minister explain to the House the procedure wananchi are supposed to follow in forming themselves into groups and how much they are supposed to contribute per person in order to benefit from the project?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MOTURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, such organisation of wananchi does not emanate from our office. May be such organisation is done by Members of Parliament and so we do not come in. MR. MANGOLI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the hon. Assistant Minister is not getting what the hon. Member wants. Hon. Mureithi wants the Assistant Minister to tell us how much the Ministry expects wananchi to contribute towards a rural electrification project. The Assistant Minister should desist from using the DDC as an excuse to evade answering the question. The Assistant Minister should, for the benefit of the House and the nation, be specific and say how much wananchi should contribute for electrification programme to become a reality.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MOTURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue of figures amounts to a different Question. Hon. Mureithi wanted to know people who want to get electricity should organise themselves, and I have said that is not our duty; perhaps it is the duty of the hon. Member.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANGOLI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. This Question is clear, but the Assistant Minister is trying to mislead this House by saying that the hon. Member wanted to know how people should be organised. Can an hon. Member raise a Question here on how to organise his people in order to get rural electrification? Can he read the Question properly and give this House a satisfactory reply?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MOTURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Question clearly seeks the reason for the delay in the completion of Endarasha Rural Electrification Programme. I did say that the delay was due to lack of funds and that work on the project resumed on 2nd July, 1990.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR, MANGOLI: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, .Sir, for allowing me to continue asking the Assistant Minister supplementary questions, We want him to be very clear. He has said that the Ministry has no money. Since the Ministrys Vote is going to be passed can the Assistant Minister tell us when they will move into that Constituency and start implementing the Rural Electrifi¬cation Programme?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MOTURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the sake of the hon. Member, I would like to say that work started on 2.7.90, As I am talking here now. one transformer has already been installed at Endarasha.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI : Mr. Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the answer from the Assistant Minister the question wa3, once a project like this one is recommended by the D.D.C„ and approved for implementation how does the Ministry or the agents of the Ministry go about, technically, organising the electrification programmes in the rural areas? It is not correct to say that Members of Parliament and councillors should organize the people where technical matters are involved. How does the Ministry do this? Do they call barazas? Do they delegate some duties to the chiefs?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MOTURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is a different question. Our work was to construct two main lines in the Division.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANGOLI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MOTURI: I need your protection, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am responding to a point of order. We were to construct two main lines, that is from Muiga to Endarasha and from Muiga again to Amboni, Those lines are about to be completed. As I have already mentioned during this financial year, the Ministry has allocated KShs.4 million for the completion of the project.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANGOLT: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister says that he has been asked a different question yet it is a suitable supplementary question, we seek the guidance of the Chair here regarding this matter. The Assistant Minister is likely to mislead this House I have asked a supplement any question relating to rural electrification but the Assistant Minister says that that is a different question. The Ministers and Assistant Ministers should read the Standing Orders so that they are conversant with what goes on here. This is because we are allowed to ask as many questions as possible.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: That was your point of order?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANGOLI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, is it in order for the Assistant Minister to imply that . the point of order put to him by hon. Dr. Misoi raised a different question?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MOTURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I see no reason why hon. Mangoli had to stand on a point of order when I was responding to another point of order. MR. MUREITHI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am grateful to the Ministry for making a provision of KShs.4 million towards the completion of this project. Is this amount for the completion of the Endarasha Project or does it also include Muiga and Amboni power line?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MOTURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the project was for Kieni West Division. So, I think the amount allocated is adequate to complete, the project in the Division.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Momanyis Question.</Newspeech>Question No.351 Cash Payment Centres for Tea Farmers in Kitutu Masaba MR. A.H.O. MOMANYI asked the Minister for<Newspeech>MR. A.H.O. M0MAI7YI asked the Minister for Agriculture whether in order to reduce unnecessary . expenses incurred by small scale tea farmers in Kitutu Masaba he could . instruct K.T.D.A, to establish cash payment centres to serve all farmers earning less than one thousand shillings.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Anyone here from the Ministry of Agriculture? Next Question.</Newspeech>Question No.326Sacking of Mr. Chigulu by Kenya Breweries LimitedMR. BIDU asked, the Minister for Labour why the services of Mr. Juma Suleiman Chigulu P/No.7836 were terminated by the Management of Kenya Breweries Limited on 29th April, 1989.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. D.M. Amir.) Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Mr. Juma Suleiman Chigulu, P/NO.7836 was dismissed by Kenya Breweries Limited on 29th April, 1989, for desertion. However, further investigation following his reappearance at his place of work revealed that Mr. Chigulu was a very sick man and as a result the doctor recommended that he be retired on medical grounds. The Company accepted the doctors recommendations and changed Mr. Chigulus dismissal for desertion to termination on medical grounds with effect from the date of dismissal, that is, 29th April, 1989.He was therefore, paid Ms full termination benefits amounting to K3hs,25,974.40 less Companys loan and income tax amounting to KShs.5,608.00 leaving a balance of Shs.20,366.40.MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this man was sacked as a deserter. When he reappeared carrying a letter, from a doctor showing that he had been sick. It is not true to say that this man. was retired on medical grounds. They had already sacked him even before he produced what letter."I suspect the Minister has been given a: fabricated reply, I know that this man was not retired on medical grounds.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, my reply is not aI fabrication. I have a letter from the doctor and I am laying it on the Table, because what I am saying is quite true.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Sema ahsante, mhe, Bidu,</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR, BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I cannot say thank you, I also have a letter from a doctor which proved to the Company that this man had been sick, I do not know whether the Assistant Minister received that letter before or after I had asked this Question, Could the Ministry order the Company to reinstate this man</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M.AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will lay this letter on the Table and the hon. Member should also lay his letter on the Table too.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANGOLI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in view of the fact that the services of this Kenyan were terminated on medical grounds and .lines the Company discovered that he had been sick, could the Ministry direct the Company to pay this man all his benefits from the day they sacked him, Kenya Breweries is a very rich company,</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M, AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said that the man has already been paid by Cheque No.353412.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANGOLI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.It appears that the Assistant Minister is not listening to me. This man was sacked and remained out of employment for one year before he was paid his terminal benefits. Since the Ministry has discovered that the man was terminated wrongly could they order the Company to pay him all his money?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Hr. Speaker, Sir, the man was paid all his dues for all the time he was away, and tie payment was in one cheque.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are arguing technically here, that this man was retired after he produced a letter from a doctor. Therefore, he was not a deserter. His dismissal we converted to retirement. If this man showed up at the Kenya Breweries and it was discovered that he had not deserted but, actually, had been sick, was it right for him to have been retired on medical grounds?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, we shall investigate the matter further. However, what I know now is that we have a letter from a doctor.</Newspeech>Question No. 345Payment of Retirement Benefits to Mr. Khasiani<Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU asked the Minister for Labour why the Secretary General of Transport and Allied Workers Union has not complied with the Bungoma District Labour Officers letters: Re. No. HL/TU.4/V0L III of 11th July, 1989, and ML/TU.4/V0L III . of 15th September, 1989, concerning the retirement benefits of Mr. Thomas Khasiani, of P.O. Box 194, Bungoma.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. D.M. Amin): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. The Secretary General of Transport and allied Workers Union could not comply with the Bungoma District Labour Officers letters because Mr. Khasiani was on commission,but not on regular employment. When the district labour officer met the Union and Mr. Khasiani on 17th October, 1987, he realised that his letter to the Union could not be enforced under the Labour Act because Mr. Khasiani was being paid KShs.300/ per month for recruiting members and had been doing so ably since 1982 purely on verbal agreement. At this meeting, it was agreed that Mr. Khasiani be. paid KShs.3,405/ as token of appreciation for the services he had rendered to the Union.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I understood the Assistant Minister well that Mr. Khasiani had to be paid over KShs.3000/, has he been paid as of now? what evidence is there that he has been paid the money?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M: AMIN: I am sorry, Mr. Speakers Sir, but I did not get the question from the hon. Member. Could he kindly repeat it?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU:. Mr. Speaker, Sir, unfortunately I do not have the written reply, but if I heard the Assistant Minister well, he did say that as a result of a meeting in 1987, it was agreed that Mr. Khasiani be paid slightly over KShs.3000/. Has he now been paid that money?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Yes, he has been paid, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. If Mr. Khasiani has been paid his dues, can the Assistant Minister give us the cheque number and lay the relevant payment voucher on the Table so that we can be satisfied that the money has been paid?</Newspeech>	 <Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: You can come to my office and we will give you the cheque number.</Newspeech>	 <Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We need your protection here. We want the Assistant Minister to give this House evidence to the effect that this niwananchi has been paid his dues. Is it in order for the Assistant Minister to stand up and say that if we want the cheque number he can give it to us when, in fact, I have asked him to lay the evidence on the Table? Can he give us the cheque number and the payment voucher number? KShs.3000/ is very important to this man.	MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not have the cheque number. here but if it is the wish of the hon. Member that I give it to the House, I can do so " any time.</Newspeech>Question No. 367Loan Schemes for Overseas University Students 	  MR. WAMBUA asked the Minister for Education whether, in order to assist those students who may obtain admission in overseas universities and are unable to raise the required tuition and boarding fees, he could establish a loan scheme, in similar terms with the one! applicable to our local universities, to finance those students who may need help.	  <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. Due to financial constraints, my Ministry is unable to establish a loan scheme similar to the one applicable to our local universities for the students who may obtain admission in overseas universities. Currently we have 12,000 Kenyan students studying in overseas universities. Fees paid in overseas universities for tution and boarding are not standardized and they range from KShs.40,000/ in India to KShs.350,000/ in United Kingdom or in the United States of America. It is, therefore, very expensive to maintain students in overseas universities.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, considering that students who go to pursue education in overseas universities do so after the Ministry of Education has been satisfied that such students are able to pursue studies overseas, I do not see the difference between the students who pursue university studies locally and those who get admission to overseas universities because they come back and serve in the same capacities. Therefore, inspite of the answer here that there are some financial constraints in the Ministry, I still think that these people should be treated the same. There must be a machinery whereby students who go to study in overseas universities can be treated the same as those who attend local universities.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, before the Ministry of education clears students to go for studies overseas, their parents have to sign an affidavit indicating that they will be able1 to support their children while overseas. In any case, the parents are aware of the high fees charged in overseas universities. It is the Government policy to reduce the budget on education from the present 40 per cent to about 30 per cent. So, thinking of giving loans to overseas students would deny other developments in the Ministry of Education the money that they require.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KY0NDA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we appreciate the problems cited by the Assistant Minister that in some country university fees are very high. Could the Ministry not take? it upon itself to identify universities which are reasonablycheap overseas? After all, the Ministry also appreciates that we do not have enough places in our local universities and that it is its duty to assist our children who need education. Can the? Ministry not do something to help these students who get admissions to overseas universities?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already said that parents who take their children to overseas universities are aware of the! cost of education wherever those children may go to study. It is difficult for the Ministry to ask for more money from the Government when the Ministry is thinking of reducing its budget from 40 pet cent to 30 per cent.For instance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the 1990/91 Financial Year, money allocated to the Ministry of Education for Development Expenditure is K£61,740,00010, out of which university education will take? KShs. 57,086,00046. During the same year, money required for Recurrent Expenditure by the Ministry is K£509,510,490, out of which university education will take K£98,744,772.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Text Question.</Newspeech>Question :No. 357Number of Social Workers in <district>Wajir District</district>MR. MAKEANU on "behalf of Mr. I. Mohamed, asked the Minister for Culture and Social Services How any Community Development Assistants are there in Wajir District and in which divisions they are stationed.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER TEE FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mr. MakAnyengo) Mr. Speaker, 3± Sir, "before I answer this Question, I wish to inform the Questioner that this category of employees are now called Social Development Assistants and not Community Development Assistants. So, in short, they are called S.D.As.Having made that minor correct, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I "beg to reply. Currently, there are no Social Development Assistants stationed in any of the divisions in Wajir District. He used to have sic S.D.As. in all the six divisions in Wajir District up to 1935, but they were all laid off. by the County Council because there were no funds to pay their salaries. How that the financial situation of the County Council in question has improved, it has promised to reemploy them at the last District Development Committee Meeting held on 26th June, 1990. They will start "by employing three Social Development Assistants at three divisions of Central Hahaswein ana Griftu. These three divisions will get S.D.As from 1st July, 1990 the other three remaining divisions will also be considered as the financial state of the could continues to improve.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKEATU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant Ministers reply, could he tell the House what is the policy of the Government regarding the employment of these Social Development Assistants. Are they supposed to be employees of the county councils or the Ministry of Culture and Social Services. If the Ministry does employ this category of officers, would the Assistant Minister tell this 3cuse why the Ministry does not employ some officers for wajir District.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAkANYENGO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a long history because, as you remember, there were certain services at Independence Which used to "be under the Ministry of Local s Government such as dispensaries, certain roads and so forth. After some time, these services were taken over "by the Central Government, "but these Social Development Assistants have all along remained, employees of the local authorities, and our Ministry only supervises their work and directs them accordingly.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Ekidor, asked the Minister of State, Office of the President when the family of Late Mr. Jacob Moetyanae, P/NO.203199 who died on 24th July, 1980 in Turkana District, will be paid gratuity and his other benefits.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT ( Mr. Xamursn) Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. The family of the last Jacob Moetyarae fill be paid his death an benefits as soon as they agree on the beneficiary.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASIKENDOMBI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, would the Assistant Minister explain what he means by saying that the family of the deceased will be paid his death gratuity as soon. as they agree or. the beneficiary? The family has already sent the relevant documents to the office of the Public Trustee, including the death certificate.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAMURZN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the benefit of the hon. Member, I would like to give the following additional information regarding this particular question. The matter of death gratuity and the other benefits of Jacob Moetyanae, has unfortunately taken far too long to conclude of two main factors. The first reason is delay in getting the death certificate andsecondly, the inability of the family of the deceased to agree on the "beneficiary. The death certificate which we have now received" is 116.213994 and was issued recently. The late Jacob Moetyanae Personal No.203199, indicates that the deceased was employed as an administrative policeman on 13th "arch, 1977 and that he died on the night of 24th July, 1990 at his home in Turkar.a District while off duty for prolonged couching. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the deceased died having served the Government for three years, four months and eight days, and his next of kin .rill receive a death gratuity equivalent to his one year salary which is Shs.5,760/.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

MISOI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. while I do agree with the Minister that he was answering the Question, out lie was not doing so on my behalf. The Question is asked or. behalf of those people, and it is in order for them to know the answer. Even if that will has take it is two years from now, it is good for them to know which month and the year. That is simple.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Mr. Kyonda.</Newspeech><Header>QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE</Header>Selection of Kenya national Youth Team<Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Culture and Social Services the following Question by Private Notice. Since the national Youth Sports meeting held in Kyanyo National Stadium on 30th June, 1990, (sponsored by East African. Industries Limited) was to select a Kenya national Youth Teen (under 19 years) to represent Kenya in the forthcoming inter-national youth sports meeting next August, which provincial primary schools sports teams participated?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mr. Njima): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. All provincial primary schools sports teams except North / Eastern participated at the National Youth Sports meeting at Nyayo that and Stadium from 29th to 3Oth June, 1590. The provincial teams came as a mixture of primary and secondary schools children of ages 19 .years and below. This was because the maximum. age require¬ment was 19 years and most children of that age are in secondary schools, and they had to mix up with a few good ones from primary schools. The Rift Valley Province, however, brought two teams, one of which was composed of primary schools at that time in residential training for annual provincial triangular meeting for schools. The team in camp sought special entry in the National Youth Sports meeting as part of training, and was allowed to do so.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from the Ministersanswer, could he give us a breakdown, particularly of the names of children from the primary schools who participated from all the provinces?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NJIRU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure the hon. Member will agree with me that it would be difficult for me to give the breakdown of names of individual children who participated in the sports because they were very many. It is a big exercise that would require me days to prepare.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: Mr. Speaker,Sir, why is it difficult for the Minister to do that? It is only Rift Valley Province that was 	represented in this meeting, "but the rest of the provinces were not represented. Yet we are talking of national events selecting a national team to represent Kenya. Why were the other provinces not invited to participate? I was present myself and I witnessed this, and that is why it is difficult for the Minister to give us a breakdown.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANGOLI: On a point of order. Mr. Speaker. Sir. Arising from that information, is it right for the Minister to come here with a misleading answer? He said that all provinces were represented at the meeting while they were not. He is hiding under the pretext that the list of names of participants is too long. He should give us a breakdown of the schools. MR. NJIRU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had not completed my answer. So, my good friend should have waited to hear what I was going to say.Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a fact, that all provinces except North/Eastern Province did participate in the meeting. As I said, Rift Valley province big as it is with 13 districts, compared with Central Province with only five districts, brought two teams and it would have been unfair for us to turn away those children,having come all that way. Again, the children were very much interested in sports.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for hon. Kyonda to allege that it was only Rift Valley Province that participated in the meeting when the Minister has told us that all provinces except North/Eastern Province?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the answer from the Minister himself, he said it was only Rift Valley Province that had two teams. This is what I am saying. I come from the Eastern Province myself. I remember the coordinator of sports for primary schools from Eastern Province came to Nairobi to check whether they were bringing a team or not He got no answer. I was present in Nyayo national Stadium on that day, but there was no other province represented except the Rift Valley Province. Yet we are talking about a Kenya team to represent Kenya in an international meeting. So, the Minister is misleading the House. If he has fact he can he give us the breakdown of those who participated?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NJIRU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can give a breakdown of a few teams. For instance, there was a team from Nyansa Province another one from Eastern Province, Central Province and so on.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Could the Minister name the teams or schools (primary schools) that participated in the meeting?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NJIRU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said earlier on, thenumber of primary schools that, participated in the meeting are many, but given time I would lay on the Table here the list of the primary schools that participated in the sports.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We are being told that these were provincial teams which had been selected from schools. So, they represent Rift Valley Province and so on.Is it in order for the hon. Member to demand that he be given thenames of the schools? The schools represent provinces!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to say that theMinister is misleading the House. I was in Nyayo National Stadium and I was very unhappy to find a teacher from Meru who, on learningthat his provincial primary school team was not coming, had to payfor one boy to bring him here to participate in the sports, from Another teachers from Embu also did the same. So, these were not provincialteams, as alleged by the Minister. Therefore, can the Minister summon allthe provincial primary schools teams again to select a Kenya team before they go to the meeting?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAMUYU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Since the Minister has continued to mislead the House for lack of relevant information on the Question and since he has requested for more time to give the House the proper statistics of the selection, could we know from him how much time he requires to do that? Could he also give us the specific day and date when he is going to do that?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NJIRU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will do that next week.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: When?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NJIRU: On Thursday, Mr. Speaker, Sir,</Newspeech>(applause)<Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Next Order.</Newspeech><Header>POINTS OF ORDER</Header><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. On Tuesday I asked a Question in this House when Mr. Tuva was in the Chair. In that Question I had asked the Minister for Cooperative Development about inefficiency at Iten Kenya Cooperative Creameries (KCC) Plant. In the Question I pointed out that the Manager of that Plant was not efficient. In his reply, the Assistant Minister who answered that Question asked me to provide the House with evidence showing that that was so.

This was attributed to hon. Mwamzandi. The story reads sis follows:"On 4th July, 1990, the Member of Parliament for Msambweni, hon. Kassim Mwamzandi, on a point of order made wild allegations in the House to the effect that Kshs.300 million charged to patients last year in Government hospitals was eaten up by officials of the ministry at the Headquarters." That is my Ministry at Afya House.Hon. Mwarzandi went on to say:"It is useless for the Ministry to have introduced the policy if it was not prepared to give reasonable accounting for the money derived. That is tantamount to milking the snail people only for the big shots to feed well."The following is the position of the matter:Cost sharing in Government hospitals and health centres was effected on 1st December, 1989. As such, there, is no way the Ministry could have collected all that money, amounting to kshs.300 from the user charge in a months time. As at March 15th 1990, an amount of kshs.20 million had been collected.Since this text is long, I will lay it on the Table. But I would like to say thatall the money that we have collected so far, we has been have sub divided accordingly and sent back to the districts including the newly born district known as Nyamira. All the 42 districts in Kenya received the cost sharing money.This proves to the House that no money was eaten. Therefore, there is no need to allege anything against civil servants who are loyal, hard working, good and effective.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mwanzandi is fully aware thatsome areas of Coast Province believe in witchcraft.

Istand to support it and to ask the House to authorise the amountthe Minister is requesting for the running of ± his Ministry.The Minister has asked for sufficient money to carry out various projects which, if put into operation, will make treme¬ndous change to the economic growth in this country. The Ministry of Regional development is charged with specific performances in specific areas. One of these areas is that which is covered under the Lake Basin Development Authority. This area is pretty large as it spreads into the Rift Valley, Western and Nyanza Provinces. This is a highly populated area and a little development here can change the course of Kenyas economy. This is the reason why I support this Motion.I believe that the Minister has included, in his Development Estimates, the amount required to reclaim the land which has been by River Yala. River Yala has a very wide delta which covers more than 20,000 hectares. This .is a lot of land which is nearly 50,000 acres. Terrific development could be done on such land. For instance, Sir, you could carry out resettlement of the landless. For instance, if each family got five to 10 acres, you would have settled about 3,000 families. I hope that the Minister has included sufficient funds for this project in his Development Estimates.I know that the Government has looked at this project and recommended it for implementation. It is now time for someone to work out the details of this project. For instance, if we said that the Yala Delta would only deal with the pro¬duction of rice, we would have more rice than Kenya needs and I export the surplus.The Ministry should now work out a detailed project either for two sugar factories in the area or for rice production. This is a feasible project and I can assure you, Sir, that it would be more economic than trying to irrigate elsewhere. Why do I say so? This is because the question here is how to divert the flow of water. This area will be irrigated by gravity which is the cheapest form of irrigation. This thing can work and I hope that the officials of the Ministry who are here are hearing me. What is required now is to work out a detailed project acre by acre square foot by square foot; kilometre by kilometre; kilowatt by kilowatt and make it certain that so many tons of seeds are required so many tractors are required; so many canals are required; so much water will be required and in so many months. We want such a detailed study on the reclamation of the Yala Delta.This is not just a question of drainage but of reclaiming the land that the River Yala has stolen from the people. This is because the river bring sediments from up country and deposits them on the bed where the land is flat.(Mr. Speaker left the Chair) (The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kagwima) took the Chair))As that happens, the river bed rises and as the river rises, since the same volume of water is still coming in, it flows laterally. So, the delta expands daily. In fact, as I am addressing this House now, this awful delta is growing at about a millimeter a day. By the end of the year, it will have increased by 300 millimeters and by the end of 10 years, it will have increased by, say, a kilometre. This is a very serious concern, and this is why I stand here to support the Minister in requesting for these funds. In doing so, I also request the Ministry officials to work out a detailed programme including all the experts they want, who are available in Kenya. Probably, the only thing we need from foreigners is equipment because there is already a lot of labour in the area, in Nairobi and in Kenya as a whole, which can move there and carry out this project. Provided that we have some equipment to assist us, we can do the work at a very low cost and produce rice.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, people in the area are already used to the difficulties involved in the production of rice. So, the Ministry would not be introducing a new crop there, but simply extending the existing knowledge on a wider commercial scale that will benefit the whole of Kenya and produce enough funds to assist in all social affairs of the country. The money we would earn from rice would help in the development of roads, not only in the area but throughout Kenya. After all, the demand for rice in the world is fantastically big, and we could export a lot of it. So, I urge the Minister once more to make sure that he has a ready project because there are a number of donors who will pounce on it. I would say that some of the foreign missions that are giving us trouble today could, instead of going round giving out money to thugs and thieves in the streets, contribute to a project like thisChat same money and it would do a lot of work for us. These missions should not give us headaches and other problems, thereby disturbing our economy. Why should they waste money in the streets when there are project which could benefit from that money? Are they merely interested in giving us trouble and disturbing our economy? Instead of degenerating to the level of the gutters that they have degenerated, or stooping so low as to disturb a stable country and its stable economy, these missions could use their money to improve this economy.This country is moving forward very fast. You just have to look at Nairobi to see how many sky scrapers are being built every day, and yet when you go to many other big cities, you do not see this kind of construction there. Our economy is alive and active because our leadership is active and alive, too. Our leadership is conscious to the needs of our people and, as long as the leadership of President Moi is active and conscious to what Kenyans want, we will continue to support the President in spite of whatever foreigners want. These foreigners tell us of a two term President, but we do not need this; we need four crops of rice in River Yala Basin. We will elect our President as often as we want him to run the country. If some other people want a twoterm president in their own country, they are free to have him, but we will elect our President as often as we want, because he meets the requirements of this nation.Kenya is like a house with many rooms, and one of these "rooms" is Nairobi and another is Central Province. If there is trouble in one of the "rooms", we will go and quench the fire where the trouble is. However, it is not for foreigners to tell us what we should do because we ourselves know it. All we can ask them todo is to help us in projects like this one.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAHIHU: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to join my colleagues in support, of the Estimates of the Ministry of Regional Development. I have been listening very carefully when my friend, the Minister for Regional Development was moving this Motion. Let me make some observations here. To start with, I feel that this Ministry has a clear duty of creating employment. However, it is not only this Ministry that has this duty.Let me offer my congratulations to His Excellency the President for creating stability in Kenya and continuing to work for the welfare of Kenyans from all corners of the country. I am very concerned about the employment of graduates from the university both local and foreign. Let me also join the Minister for Labour who has just said that we no longer need expatriates in this country. We have to be very selective in what we need to import . We now have more than four univesities, and the graduates who are coming out of these universities need to be assured of employment.I want to mention that the Minister for Labour has said a lot relating to the Lake Basin. He talked about establishing a headquarters in Kisumu where all the staff of the Lake Basin Development Authority will be stationed, but I have a different opinion here. For how long are we going to keep on stationing officers in cities while they are supposed to be looking after rural projects? It is high time officers responsible for Bura Irrigation Scheme, who are at the moment stationed in Nairobi, were stationed in Bura because that is where they belong. They should be stationed in Bura so that they may become acclimitised withthat particular rural project. Imagine that the Managing Director of Bura Irragaion Scheme stays in Nairobi whereas he is supposed to visit Tana River in which case, he has to fly or use other means of transport. It is high time officers in town used horses instead of Land Rovers and walk around rural projects. They should also not be housed in high rise buildings, but in tents. I used to live in a tent when I was a cadet. There is no magic in an officer living in a tent when supervising a rural project. If we house all our officers in high rise buildings in rural areas, the fixing of lifts in these buildings would create a lot of employment. What I am suggesting to the Ministry of Regional Development is that it should become regional and rural so that rural projects may be implemented fast enough. The money that we vote here should not used just in the construction of very expensive buildings. I am pleased that most of the Ministries officials are here. Some of them have been in the field and they know what I am talking about. When it comes Co spending money, this should be done wisely. However, our experience has been that we have come here and voted money for the construction of a building at Shs.100 million whereas this money could have been used to create many jobs for school leavers. As a country, we have the challenge of creating employment for school leavers.We have a duty to create employment in the rural areas so that people do not have to go and look for employment in towns like Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu. In fact, we should not be importing rice, which is a very popular commodity with our people, because the Ministry can produce enough for us.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have had and continue to have a very stable Government. Let me say that we condemn the hooliganism and the misguided young people were responsible for the recent disturbances. We condemn any forces that have come here to distabilise our beloved Government. Kenya has developed a tremedously favourable image worldwide and people are envious of what our President has achieved in Kenya in the last 12 years.Since Independence we have never seen the kind of disturbances we witnessed recently. All of us must condemn the event and ensure that it will not be repeated. This is because without peace and stability we cannot move about discuss Estimates of Expenditure as we are now doing. We must not give our enemies a chance to come and distabilise our Government.Water and roads are major issues; we can develop Tana River Irrigation Scheme without good roads. I want to suggest that theMinistry of Regional Development, in conjunction with other Ministries, should in that road construction projects which must employ labour and not machinery. Machinery is important, but it is not necessary in such projects; all access can be done using labour because we have many jobless "people and many mouths to feed.I also feel that it is shameful for this nation to continueimporting cotton when we know that with our good soil we can grow all the cotton that we need. Let the Ministry take advantage of our good climate and prepare a programme that will enable us to produceSufficient cotton.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to ask all state corporations and Ministries to prepare annual employment creation programmes. I "believe that this House should he told the number of jobs each Ministry created at the end of each financial year. This is important because all these young men aged between 15 and 25 years, are losing direction because they are unemployed. Considering that we five million pupils in primary schools, 500,000: "students secondary schools and, possibly, about 40,000 in our universities, must realise that we are faced with a great challenge to create jobs. We should therefore come together and see how s we can help these young people. If we do this we will continue enjoying stability, otherwise unemployment remains very big. problem that we must overcome. If each Ministry includes in its annual Estimates a sum for job creation, this, in my view will go a long way in giving young Kenyans a greater hope. At the moment we vote money to the Ministries but nothing new is created. Even the existing infrastructure like roads and buildings are not being maintained or repaired. With those few remarks, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE (Mr. Ndong): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chance to contribute to this Motion. First of all I would like to thank his Excellency the President for creating the Ministry of Regional Development. This is a very important Ministry because its aim is to diversify employment in rural areas.I would also like to thank the Lake Basins DevelopmentAuthority (IBDA) for the wonderful work it has done in. the region then  very short period. Yesterday one hon. Member blamed the Authority but I disagree with him and say that this as Authority has done verywell within a very short time with minimal resources that it receivesfrom the Treasury.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker I think we have to make full use of our rivers in Western Kenya, or in the Lake region. We have not made proper use of take Victoria, which is the second largest fresh water lake in the world. But as I am talking here a lot of people around the do not have water in their homes. Giving these people clean water should he a top priority of the Authority and the Ministry of Water Development.Let me now move on to fish, which is a very important commodity in Nyanza. A lot of our fish is finding its way to Nairobi where we have fish industries. Lorries travel to Kisumu, Homa Bay, Mbita and Karungu Bay to collect fish and bring it to Nairobi for processing. These lorries destroy many of our roads and as I am talking now many roads in the lake region are completely spoiled. I am sure hon. Nyakiamo will agree with me that you cannot travel from Mbita to Homa Bay because of these lorries. I want tosuggest these fish factories which are based in Nairobi shouldbe moved to Homa Bay, Kendu Bay, Muhuru Bay and Mbita so thata one save our roads by transporting by railway and that up create employment for our people. At the moment these industries are based in Nairobi and only Nairobi people are benefiting from them, which is not fair.The other thing is pricing of fish; our people are being paid peanuts as opposed to what the middlemen get in Nairobi: The middlemen pay between Shs.2/- and Shs.6/- per. kilogramme while they get Shs.30/- per kilogramme in Nairobi. There is no business where a person gets over 300 per cent profit.This Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, means that our people exploited. So, if industries are established around the Lake Region, then the employment created by these industries would subsidise the meagre incomes of the fishermen. While going through the Estimates for the Ministry of Regional Development, I notice that Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority and kerio Valley Development Authority do not appear under the Ministry of Regional Development. 1 do not know whether this was an oversight or not. But that should be investigated. There are these two Authorities? Are they under the Ministry of Energy and why is that so?Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, one area that we have not touched on is the question of opening up tourism in Western Kenya. There is tourism at the Coast; a long time ago they were plans to develop tourism in Western Kenya to cater for the Western Circuit starting from Maasai Mara to Muhuru Bay, Kisum Kendu Bay and up to Mt. Elgon. We have some of the best beaches in Muhuru Bay where we have clean sand. If the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife and the Lake Basin Development Authority could try to develop tourism in that area I think we would extend the tourism period in Kenya by half. This is because at the moment the tourism period runs from November up to March. These tourists could be moved from Mombasa to Western Kenya and the tourism period would be extended from March to August. Consequently the earnings from tourism would multiply by two. So, I am suggesting that the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife in collaboration with the L.B.D.A. should now channel some of their funds towards the development of tourism in Western Kenya.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have a lot of rice and cotton and groundnuts growing in Nyansa Province. I would like to congratulate the Government for having increased the prices of cotton recently but still there is a problem. This is because the extension officers are not going round to tell the farmers when to plant and what type of seed they should plant. This is important because in Nyansa stopped growing cotton because of poor prices. It is now up to the Ministry of Agriculture to send out extension officers to educate the people; to tell the "This is the right time, please plant the crop."Let me also touch on the question of floods in Nyansa Province. As you know we had a lot of floods in Nyansa recently. Consequent to this we do foresee famine in that area. This is because all the crops were washed into the lake by floods. The Office of the President should make provision for food supplies to the people of Nyansa particularly to those areas which were affected by floods this year. This is because I can foresee a famine in Nyansa in the year to come. Secondly the traps which were placed by ICIPE and the L.B.D.A. to catch the tsetse flies were swept away by floods. As I am talking here, we have a lot of tsetse flies in Kagan, Karachuonyo, Oyugis and parts of Kochiel Kanyada. I would plead with the Government to send some more traps so that the tsetse menace is eradicated.Recently, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we haddisturbances in Nairobi and a lot of people have spoken about this.But I would like to add one word; this is the time for us to re think and find out where we have gone wrong and why people aredissatisfied with us. I would also like to say that it is important that we do not unnecessarily" attack foreign countries particularlythe Super Powers. We have to be extremely careful when dealing with these powered countries. This is because these people are giving us money and on top of that they could be knowing something. So, what I think we should do is to call them sit down at a would talk and discuss our problem. We have to think back and find out where we have gone wrong. I think the problem lies with unemployment. Our youths are not employed: whey have nothing to do. Now they are talking about next Saturday; on 14th July, which is next Saturday , they are coming out again. What will happen if they come out again we should think twice. The time has come when we have to think that and see what we have done and where we have gone wrong.With these few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech>PARAGRAPH NOT READABLE PAGE NO: 37THIS PAGE NOT READABLE PAGE NO: 38<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Muturia): Ukitaka kuwa na ngoinbe ni lazi.na uanze kumlisha akiwa nda.ua hadi akuwe ngonibe inkubwa, na chakula atakachokuwa amekula ni kingi sana.

Naibu Spika wa Muda, tuaieona nchi fulani zikipigana vita na nyingine juu ya uvuvi. Unasikia nchi fulani na nyingine ziaetangaza vita kwa sababu ya watu kwenda kuvua saraaki katika nchi fulani. Kwa sababu bei ya saniaki ni ya juu na dunia nzi.ua inahitaji samaki, tungetaka Wizara ya Maendeleo ya Mikoa ijikaze sana kuona kwamba pesa za kigeni zinazopatikana kutokana na saniaki zimeshinda zile zinazo patikana kutokana na kahawa, rnajani chai, mboga na hata utalii. Saniaki wanahitajika sana duniani, na Serikali nyingi katika ulimwengu zjjnetilia uleaji wa saniaki .uaanani sana. Tumeambiwa hapa kwamba kuna sehemu nyingine hapa nchini ambako wananchi wanauza saniaki KShs.2 kwa kilo moja, na wale wanunuaji hutoka hapa Nairobi. Unaweza kuona Mhindi mmoja akiwa na malori 36 na kazi yake ni kwenda kila mahali akiokota saniaki, hasa wakati wa saa kumi hivi wakati wauzaji wamechoka. Wakati huo Mhindi huyo anaweza hata kununua saniaki kwa KShs.l kwa kilo. Hiyo ndiyo sababu tunahimiza kwamba ni lazima Wizara ihakikishe kwamba watu wanaotaka kuweka rasilmali yao hapa Kenya wanajenga viwanda vya kuhifadhia saniaki karibu na Ziwa Victoria, kutoka ropaka wa Kenya na Tanzania hadi mpaka wa Kenya na Uganda ili wananchi wakivua saniaki wao wawe na mahali pa kuwahifadhia. Ikiwezekana, Waziri na maofisa wake wapaswa kuhakikisha kwamba hakutolewi leseni ya kiwanda cha samaki kujengwa hapa Nairobi. Yule anayetaka kufanya biashara ya saniaki aambiwe aende karibu na Ziwa Victoria ili wananchi wafaiaike. Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, wafadhili wanaotaka kutusaidia wanaweza kucupatiamitumbwi ili tuweze kuvua samaki wengi. Katika upande wa Uaso Ngiro, nataka kuihimiza Wizara itilie mkazo sana jambo la ufugaji wa wanyama. Kuna sehemu hizo ambako tukifanya bidii tunaweza kupata nya.ua kutokana na ngombe, mbuzi na hata ngamia. Xitu kinachotakikana ni MKmaji, na tunaweza kutumia .uito inayotoka Mlima Kenya kusambaza maji katika sehemu hizo. Tukifanya hivyo, tunaweza hata kuhifadhi maji ya mvua ili yatumike wakati wa ukaaie. wizara hii inapaswa kushughulikia mito yote ili tuweze kuona ni kitu gani tunachoweza kupata kutoka huko. Najua kwamba mboga na matunda ni baadhi ya aimea inayoweza kukuzwa huko kwa wingi kuwanufaisha watu wa Tharaka, Tigania, Chuka na Enibu.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kuna mmea minoja hapa nchini unaoitwa acacia kwa Kiingereza, ambao unapendwa sana na mbuzi. Mmea huo pia una gum ambayo ina faida nyingi sana katika ulimwengu. Hutumiwa hasa kutengeneza glue, na tungetaka uchunguzi ufanywe kuhusu mmea huu ili tuweze kufaidika nao. Mti mmoja .unaweza kutoa kilo tatu za gum kwa mwaka. Kwa hivyo, Wizara ya Maendeleo ya Mikoa yafaa ifanye kila inavyoweza kuukuza mmea huo.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ninawashukuru watu wa Japan kwa vile wamekuja sasa kutusaidia katika mpango wa ili wa Mwea. Watu hao wameanza kazi na wanataka kunyunyizia maji mashamba ya e"kari myingi sana. Hata Waziri wa Maendeleo ya Mikoa hivi majuzi alienda kuanzisha kazi hiyo, na hivyo ni kuonyesha kwamba mchele utakuwa mwingi katika sehemu za Mwea." Pia, tungetaka uchunguzi ufanywe katika maeneo ya Ahero na Tana River ili tuweze kukuza mchele kwa wingi. Tukitilia .nkazo mambo ya kunyinyizia maji mashamba, tutaweza kukuza mimea mingi sana. Hivi majuzi Mtukufu Rais alifungua kiwanda cha matunda katika Mkoa wa Pwani, lakini kiwanda hicho peke yake hakitoshi. Tvinataka viwanda vingine vifunguliwe katika wilaya ya Lamu na Pwani ya Kusini ili wananchi wapatiwe1 motisha zaidi kukuza matunda kwa wingi zaidi. Hivyo, tunaweza kupata pesa za kigeni kwa wingi. Watu kama wa Japan ndio marafiki wetu wa kweli kwa sababu wanakuja hapa na tunafanya kazi pamoja. Ningependa kutoa mwito kwa nchi za kigeni, badala ya kuleta uchochezi, zilete pesa ili tuweze kuitengeneza nchi hii yetu. Kwa hayo macnache, Bw.

MANG'OLI: Lakini hajasimama!</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mrs. Ogot): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to air my views on this very important Ministry. It is not fair for hon. Mang'oli to complain because. I have been shooting up and down since the debate started.Having said that, Sir, I would like to thank the Minister for Regional Development for the way in which he introduced his Ministry's Vote. The money that the Minister has requested is very small indeed, and I am asking the Minister to seize' the earliest opportunity to ask for more funds in order to enable the Ministry to do the important task ahead of it. When His Excellency the President spoke to the Nyanza people soon after elections of the Presidency, he told them, "I will be giving you the Lake Basin Development Authority which will change your foturnes". Because of the little money which is voted for the whole Ministry, it is not possible to cater for all the areas under the Lake Basin A Development Authority. The money does not cover all the parts which fall under the Ministry of Regional Development. Considering that the Ministry has only K£7.5 million, I am asking the Minister, while looking for other source's of funds, to cut his cloth according to the material he has. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the basic thing abound Lake Victoria which can change our lives is water which we have in plenty in Lake Victoria, and the second important thing is the fist which we also have in plenty in the same lake. The third important aspect is Livestock Development which would go along way to assist us particularly because Siaya and Homa Bay Districts have a high potential for livestock development. It is also in these two districts where we have the highest infant motality rate in this country. In these areas also, there is a high potential for rice and groundnuts, cotton and sugar cane production. Therefore, Sir, I am asking the Director of the Lake Basin Development .Authority who is here with his staff to choose one of these areas where they will spend their money that would be allocated to the Lake Basin Development Authority. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like on that note to thank the Director of the Lake Basin Development Authority for the good work that he has done in Yala Division in particular regarding to the construction of shallow wells arid boreholes. I am saying this because they are working under very difficult situation in that they do not have enough funds to acquire the necessary equipment. That is why I am saying that under the circumstances in which they are operating, they have done really wonderfully well and I think they should be congratulated for that. However, there are many areas in Yala Division, such as Rarienda, Bondo, and in niboro where we have plenty of water which is not harnessed. If half of the money how being allocated to the Lake Basin Development Authority went to the supply and conservation of water, this would drastically change our lives. I am saying this because quite a number of illnesses which affect our people in these areas, come about due to lack of clean drinking water.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also suggest that the Lake Basin Development Authority should use their institute of science and technology as a training venue for water technicians so that they can learn how to manufacture hand pumps and other implements which are used to pump and supply of water from boreholes and shallow wells. They could also use the same institute to give proper training to those who service and maintain these shallow wells and holes so that wananchi themselves can lean to do this work without the Authority getting experts to do the work.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would now like to move into the area of fish. I have noticed that under cold storage, they have given an allocation 	of only £4,000. I do not know whether this cold storage is for fish or something else. However, I remember when the former Minister for Regional Development hon.Okwanyo was moving this Ministry's Vote in this House he did mention that the Ministry was going to instal facilities for a cold storage around the Lake starting from Mohuru Bay, Homa Bay and so on. It is for this reason I am wondering what the Director of the lake Basin Development Authority is supposed to do with £4,000. I would have expected the Minister to have asked more money for the development of fish industry. This would have stopped the exploitation of our people by the big fish who come all the way from Nairobi, Eldoret, Nakuru and Kisumu to buy the fish at a throw away. price of Shs.2/- or Shs.3/- per fish. I would like to urge the Minister to establish these cold storage facilities so that our people can store their fish and sell it at a reasonable price.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, with regard to filletin, I would like to appeal to the Authority to look for an able entrepreneur to start a filleting industry in Kisumu. At the moment, our people have a lot of experience and have now come off age to own and run a filleting industry so that people from If Nairobi do not have to come all the way to buy fish directly from us. They should give us a chance to do the filleting and bring it to them here in Nairobi so that we can enjoy doing what God gave us freely.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the area of livestock development, I am amazed to note that there is a dash against this item in the book. At the moment, everybody is crying for milk. People in Kisumu and in Homa Bay, are today relying on milk supplied from . Eldoret, and we are still buying cattle for beef from all the way from Nakuru. We want this Authority to embark seriously on the development of livestock in this area so that we can be getting milk and meat at home. At the moment, Kisumu Municipality has a very large cooling plant and I do not know why we continue to rely on milk supply from Nyanra Province. We would like this Authority to start research station for live development, not to produce bulls, but to produce grade cattle so that our can be self relient on. milk. As I speak now, Yala Division is starting multiplication centre and I hope that the Lake Basin Development Authority be part and parcel of this new development so that we can produce enough and meat for ourselves.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, time does not allow me to so much about sugar cane growing. For three times now, the production of which sugar in Yala has collapsed and I am looking forward to a time when the put of white sugar in Yala would start once more. I am glad to note that we are negotiations with the owner of the factory, as well as with I.C.D.D with a view to starting the production of white sugar in Yala again I am hoping that the Lake Basin Development Authority will come to our aid because they have well trained people, We hope too that they will us both in terms of manpower and finance. I am glad that the hon. Minister here to hear what we are saying. He happens to be one of the people have done a lot towards the re-opening of miwani white sugar factory ana I he will also take the sugar factory in Yala under his wing so that by end of this year, we may start ±s once again to enjoy white sugar. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opport to thank the Lake Basin Development Authority for always attending the is Development Committee Meetings. This has enabled us to put questions to for which they have always given us answers. However, we note that the more given to the Lake Basin Development Authority is too little to really anything and therefore, if we blame them for not doing enough, I do not the we shall be fair to them.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, sir, for allowing me time to contribute to this very important Vote. I would is to say straightaway that the Mover of the Vote has given us a lot of hope wananchi. As we speak now, most of the wananchi axe more concerned about employment and we are grateful to have a Ministry like this which is going to create employment for our people. We know that if the Minister and his officer are serious enough, this Ministry would be able to create employment opportunities to our "boys and girls who are now. learning in the streets looking for employment. Therefore, it is important' for the Minister to note that the task before him is very noble and we would like him to know that he has the support of this Eouse. As hon. Mrs. Grace Ogot has said, enough funds should be allocated to the Lake Basin Development Authority so that its operations can become a reality.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Regional Development answers the call for the district focus for rural development and we are grateful to note that its main objective is to create employment for the rural people.This is going to create employment in terms of irrigation using both rain and river water. I" hope in their noble task, I believe they are incorporating the thinking of wananchi. This is very important that they should realise that the task ahead is very important. I hope that the Minister has not come to move the Motion here for the purposes of requesting funds for salariesalone. If this, is the reason why he has brought this Motion to this House, then he has got it wrong. We are not going to approve this Vote unless he assures us that this money is going to develop and create employment. This was the purpose of setting up the Ministry of Regional Development, and I hope it is taken seriously. It is a very vital Ministry. It is a Ministry that is going to create employment through irrigation using both rain and river water.Above all, Sir, I am surprised to find that the Kerio Valley Development Authority does not fall under the Ministry of Regional Development. I do not know why that should be the case. I moved a Motion here some time back to construct hydro electric power in Webuye,and the Ministry of Energy was the one that was concerned. Yet the Lake Basin Develop¬ment Authority did the feasibility studies. I say so because the Kerio Valley Development Authority is in charge of the new hydro¬electric power station. Then I am wondering what the Lake Basin Development Authority is in charge if it is not in charge of electricity and the hydro electric power we are talking of? Then it is an authority that eventually will have no meaning. As far as we are concerned, the Lake Basin Development Authority is supposed to be in charge of all authorities falling under that region. For instance, Uaso Nyiro, Kerio Valley and so on.It is very important to mention this. Then why move in another authority there and leave out this one? So, they, are just there to employ their own brothers and sisters. Yet the purpose of the authority is not to employ to people. First of all, they must create employment by opening up new areas. This is the first duty of any authority.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think hon. Mang'oli has just made a very serious to the effect that the personnel in the Ministry were employing their brothers and sisters. Can be substantiate?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: I think hon. Kirwa is still in Trans Nzoia. We are talking about Lake Basin Development Authority. I have not implied in any way that the personnel in the Ministry were employ¬ing their own brothers and sisters. I know the hon. Ministers went to the Ministry only the other day and I respect his. He would not consider employing his own brothers.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KERWA: On a point of order, Sir. I think hon. Mang'oli is evading the question. I am very clear about it. I did hear him say that they are employing their own brothers and sisters. So, he should tell us whether that is true, or withdraw the remark, if it is not true at all.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Sir, I want you to protect me from hon. Kirwa here who is just seated next to me. What I have said here is in line to create employment. I have said that if employment is created, we would not like a situation whereby brothers and sisters are employed in the same area. Maybe that is what he is referring to as an issue. But if he wants some mother evidence which I am still yet to give, then let him wait until I say so.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Order! Are you agreeing with what he is saying, or are you saying some¬thing different?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Sir, I did not say that the officials of the Ministry are. employing their own "brothers and sisters. In fact, I did not say that the Minister was employing his own "brothers and sisters. The Minister is here and he would have stood on a point of order. So, I do not need hon. Kirwa to stand on a point of order on behalf of the Minister. I do not know any brother of the Minister. If he wishes that I withdraw remarks that, are far-fetched, that is a different matter. With your permission, Sir, may I continue.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: On a point of order, Sir. We do not want to spend a lot of hon. Mang'oli's time. I am not standing here on behalf of the Minister., but as an hon. Member for Cherangani That is another serious allegation he is making.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MANG'OLI: Sir, I withdraw the remark that he was standing on behalf of the Minister.It is important for us to remember that the Minister for Regional Development moved this particular Motion here last year. I pointed out that there was a fish project in Maturo area in Webuye costing some KSh.12 million. It was due to delays that the project became obsolete and also due to the amount of money involved. The money might be there in books but there is no project at Webuye, and I am very concerned about this, people keep on asking what is happening. The Minister promised the people of Webuye that that project would be implemented and I am sure that is going to be done.Sir, I will talk about the Lake Basin Development Authority when move a Bill on at. That is why I avoided to answer my hon. friend deliberately. I will talk about the Lake Basin DevelopmentAuthority in detail when we" come to the" Bill "because it is importantto know what it is. We would not like to see a toothless authoritywhich is not serving any useful purpose at all.Employment will be created by the Ministry of Regional.Development. Let the Minister harness water from heaven to makesure that we produce more food, and I am sure with enough food even"the Americans will not be able to talk the way they are doing how.Poor is power and we request the Ministry of Regional Development to identify those projects.With those few remarks, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KERWA: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker meSir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this very important Motion.First of all, the 7Ministry of Regional Development is very important in the sense that it is going to handle a problem within a confined area. So, we urge the personnel in that Ministry to understand the areas they are dealing in, particularly the Lake Basin Development Authority which over the area I represent in this august House.It is important for the personnel to understand the problems of the people in those areas, formulate solutions having in mind the aspirations of the people in those particular areas. We would like to urge the Government to ensure that in future these authorities, like the Tana/Atni River Development Authority the Uasin Nyiro North and South Development Authorities .and the Kerio Valley Development Authority are given adequate funds. But as the funding is now, it is lopsided whereby some of these development authorities seem to be benefiting more than the others. This is why we have fragmented into particular management units and it the reason for the existence of the authorities. So, we would like the Government to look into the funding issue. This is because there is no area that does not need developments.I would, also like, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, to urge the Ministry's personnel, through their Minister, to look into the problems the areas they are supposed to serve. This is because our problem is not the make of the care that the director of such an authority drives but what is important is the problem that exists and needs a solution in an area. We know that some of these cars are capable of handling rough terrains in our country. For example, a Toyota car can go anywhere in this country. We realise that when an authority it set up the first thing that is thought of is the importation of very big expensive and unmanageable cars. Some of these vehicles are sold off after two or three years. This is how we lose a lot of funds. What we need to do is tighten up our belts. This is because the important is what is and should be done for the people of Cherangani and not the type of car that the managing director drives to Cherangani.We would also like to urge the Ministry to consider whether all the meetings that are always held are necessary and whether the allowances drawn for such meetings are comparable to the money that an authority has in its kitty. It is important that we manage our finances properly. This is because as we have always said here, that our problem is not money, but how we manage the little money that we manage to get. This is a very important point which the Minister has to take note of.The way I look at a development authority may be different from the way the Ministry looks at it. My view is that an authority has to look at the master plan for a given area, the road structures and electricity provision so that some of the major centres in that area are provided with electricity. This will ensure that when the other plans are set up in the authority, they will fit like a jigsawpuzzle. This is the only through which we can ensure that an area gets total development.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is also important that the Ministry looks for employment opportunities. For example, if it is the Lake Basin Development Authority (LBDA), while we do not question the integrity of the people employed there, we would like to see some kind of fair personnel distri¬bution. This is because we know the areas that the LBDA, TARDA and the others cover. They should ensure that the personnel are distributed according to the areas involved. We cannot^ at the moment say that we do not have qualified personnel in this country from a particular community because all Kenyans are fairly educated. This is the situation we want in our Kenya and one that the authorities have to consider seriously.Once that has been done, then there should be accountability. This is a very important aspect of any developing country. If accountability does not exist, then we might talk in this House and vote as many times as possible for funds for a particular authority without having anything done. We know that the Minister has the power and we have the powers to prosecute any person who . misuses public funds. We are urging the Minister to use these powers. This is because that is the only honourable thing to do for our country. This is the only way of instilling faith in the people whose areas are supposed to be served by the development authorities. This is also the way we can ensure that all Kenyas realise that the Government is doing something for them.While I do not want to put the cart before the horse, it is important for us Kenyans to realise one thing, once an authority is set up it is for the benefit of the entire population and not for a particular individual. It suffices to say that in the past we have seen and had a situation. where some personnel in some of these authorities have taken a chunk of the money and used it to develop their own districts. This is a serious situation that the Minister has to look into critically. If there is, for example, a rice mill that is supposed to be set up in Cherangani, let it be set up there. Such a thing will encourage the people of Cherangani to grow more rice. If on the other hand there is something that can be done to enhance the development of maize in my Constituency, let it be done there.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I trust that the Minister is going note our views and give them the seriousness that they deserve. This is because we do not want a situation where an authority is going to be looked at as one for, say, the Rift Valley Province, Nyanza Province or, if you may allow me, as for the Luo. What is important is that when an authority is set up to serve a region, let the entire region benefit from it and let the people see that there is something being done by the" authority for them.As I have already said, these authorities have to be given enough funds. When they have been given these funds, it is important that they liaise with the district development committees (DDC). Although I have realised that they are doing that, I would like to emphasise that they should liaise more with the DDCs so that if there is a certain project that has been set up by the DDC, they do not end up with a similar project. They should not set up a project that is going to be a duplication of the same when another project is set up it should be one that will compliment the fforts of the DDC or the ones that have already been set up by other organisations. It is important also for these authorities to liaise with Non Governmental organisations to ensure that they know of the projects that have been set up there.I would like to reiterate that these authorities must understand the situation of a given area, the feelings of the people and what the people want in that area. That way when they will be implementing projects they will be doing so according to the demands and needs of the people in that area. The best way of achieving is. that is by ensuring that the board of directors is composedof people from every region that is concerned. Every region must have a directorsitting on that board. That is the only way of knowing the people's feelings. It is also the only way of ensuring that their feelings are being taken care of by the authority.With those remarks, I support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUREITIII: Thank you, Sir, for giving me this opportunityto contribute to this Motion. First of all, I wish to thank theMinister for ably moving his Ministry's Vote.I would like to talk on the Ewaso Nyiro North Development Authority. In the printed Estimates, I do not see anywhere where funds are provided for this authority. The Ewaso Nyiro South Development Authority has a provision of about K£400,000. I would like the Minister to rectify this situation because both Bills on the Authorities were passed at the same time.IN any case, if you give an authority K£400,000 for feas¬ibility study to cover one year, I wonder into what kind of use that money would be put. This is because this is very little money. I had the opportunity of listening to various contributors to this Motion, particularly with regard to the Lake Basin development Authority. It would appear that one of the major problems facing our authorities is finance. Unless these authorities have enough finance, they cannot do much.I will, therefore, join my colleagues in calling upon the Ministry of Regional Development to provide adequate finance for various authorities so that they can become effective in the areas of their operation. One of our main diseases is to allocate the available funds to feasibility studies. Even the money given by foreign donors is spent on feasibility studies. For instance, a particular area can have five feasibility studies being carried on water,. This is because everybody who is interested in a certain area wants to carry out his own feasibility study as they do not want to- rely on what has been before.My constituency is one of the main sources of Ewaso Nyiro River. Also flowing from that area are such river as, Naro Moru and Embagori which drain into Ewaso Nyiro River. Also from the Aberdares flow two major rivers into Ewaso Nviro River.It would be better for the Ministry to allocated my even Kshs.20,000/- to assist in the implementation of a water project or a cattle dip instead of spending that money on feas¬ibility studies. Once the Ewaso Nyiro that Development Authority takes off the ground, its headquarters should be put up within its area of jurisdiction and not in the major towns'In this way, the authority will serve the residents of those areas, in the best possible way.For example, irrigation is very important especially in my constituency. This is because unless we use the little that we have for irrigation, then we shall not have enough food. As one speaker said, we have come to a situation where those friends who have been helping us have started threatening our integrity by saying that they will with old aid. When I read in the newspapers this week, I was surprised that somebody said that they will withhold all aid to Kenya except for peace corps and on food.		Time has come when we should be in a position to generate enough food for our consumption. They think that if they withdraw food aid, we might all die. That is the catch. These authorities should make sure that the whole country has enough food not only for our consumption but also for export to our neighbouring countries This is because unless we are self sufficient, we can be threatened at any time by those who allege to be our friends. This Ministry should liaise with the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Livestock Development and the Ministry of Water Development as far as food production is concerned.Sir, we would like to know the co-ordination that exists between the Ministry of Regional Development and the Ministry of Water Development because we have heard that the lake Victoria region has so much water which is not put into any use because of lackof facilities. Likewise, although there is less water in my constituency, has not been put into proper use. It, therefore, flows all the way into the Indian Ocean. We should have dams at various stages of these rivers so that it the water can be preserved for use during the dry spell and also to be used it for irrigation. If we control our water resources, we shall be in a position to boost our food production.	 In the Development Estimates, I note that there are various sub votes under boat purchases. I do not know whether a factory or it has the Ministry has loaned people money to construct boat factories. If these boats are to be purchased from outside, I think the time has come when we should have an industry that will be devoted to the manufacture of all kinds of coats. In this way, we shall have an integrated development within fish farming areas. The various authorities under this Ministry should also support doing farming.It is upon the Ministry to tell us the areas they are ready tosupport.		Development matters have now been switched to the district where  various recommendations are made with regard to how the local people can be assisted. This Ministry should look into the priorities of various districts so that these authorities can incorporate the areas they are likely to take up.Further, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Regional Development should consider how it can raise funds locally and support its projects until they are self supporting, instead of looking for donor who may not be able to support all the projects we have. We should have projects that are self  supporting so that with the funds generated by a project in one area, we may start another project in a different area.With these few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Because it is now five o'clock, we will call upon the Mover, to reply.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I wish to reply to all the questions raised by hon. Members in this august House. Perhaps, before I look at then one by one, I would take this opportunity to thank hon." Members for their very contribution and criticism which I have taken very seriously. One particularaspect that I would like to mention from the outset is that most hon. Members noted that the Ministry has had very little money, indeed. I think the circumstances leading to this are well known because we know the situation in  which we are in the country. As a Government, we cannot withhold development money if it is available Most hon. Members noted that water management hasgenerally been neglected, not because we could not manage water, not because we do not have the necessary experts and not because some people are  eluctant, but because of lack of funds. I entirely agree with the hon. Member  I think it was hon. Kubo who said that Masinga and Kamburu Dams should be used in fish development. This goes without saying because it is obvious that there are fishin thees dams and, if managed properly we are likely to get morefish that we are getting now in an haphazard manner. I am particularly very happy for having heard from hon. Member that Lake Basin Development. Authority, has not done what it fought to do because there has been no money. This point came out clearly and it ,goes deeper in helping us to explain why the Managing Director of Lake Basin Development^ Authority: must not be blamed. If he had the money and had not used, it, we would tell him "You had Sh.1 billion here but you did not use it but the hon. Members from whose region these developments are supposed to take place have confirmed that there has been no money.I do not want to confess that I am new in the Ministry and that is why I Cannot do, something’s. I take full responsibility for everything that happens in my Ministry. I do this as a Government Minister but I want to appeal to hon. Members to give me time to study some of the issues they raised. I want to study them very carefully so that in future, however little money we get, we ensure that it is used exactly for. the benefit of the area it is meant for. I also noted very carefully that hon. Ogur decried the necessity to: improve Nyatika and I agree with him that this place is indeed very backward. I promise, the hon. Member that, as soon as funds are available we will take particular interest in Nyatike The roads there especially the one from Rod Kopany down to Karungu, are not good. Hon. Ogur was right in saying that most of the fish that is transported to Nairobi and elsewhere come from that particular area.  I thinks hon. Member spoke more on fish than anything else They talked about, fish development, marketing, preservation,exportation, and so on. I want to take this opportunity to warn "the exploiters of the small man both in Mombasa and Kisumu who have "taken the authority of using their big money to marginalise the" small man.  I will not hesitate to cancel forthwith the" licence of any fishmonger whom we deem to be doing things contrary to the benefit of the small man. I know for sues that some fishmongers" and processors from Nairobi and elsewhere have gone to the lake and cheated the small man. When it comes to the sale of. the famous mbuta, they wait until four o'clock when the fish has changed  colour slightly and then tell the sales ladies there, "Your fish i:s  bad  and we are not going to buy it unless you want "to sell it at "50 cents.  This fish is still fresh, and when it is" brought to Nairobi it is sold for more than Shs.50/   That will no longer happen if I am still the Minister for Regional Development because I will never allow it.	 I know that some of these people have used their money to threaten my officers, saying, "If you do this and that, I will 'do this because I am a friend of So-and so." However, I am not threat enable and I hope that this people know that  Of all the people you cannot threaten is Midika, because I have gone through the rough and the smooth of life. I will not tolerate any fish merchant who threatens my officers or the small man at the lake or at sea. I premies this House that that will not happen.I also noted that some hon. Members may not know that whereas it is true that we should not over-fish or destroy all the fish, you can actually harm the fishing in Lake Victoria if you use the wrong gear. My Ministry will henceforth watch such gears. If you use a certain type of net, you might fish out all the fish   that are needed and if you use certain machinery, you might killsome of the fish. I have experts in the Ministry who are ready to work to ensure that we preserve our fish. As some hon. Members have, said fish is the only resource that is easy to manage, and we are. not going to destroy this natural resource.	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it was alleged in the past  that Japan and  other nations have fished in high seas and got to Mombasa  Port  This may have been true in one way or another, but we  have a boundary in the sea beyond which any non Kenyan is not allowed to  fish.  So, we have taken  it upon ourselves to ensure  that this  does not happen. We will encourage the local fishermen  in  Mombasa to  register companies so that they may fish the fish that  are presently  being disturbed by foreigners from afar.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I listened to hon. Omino very carefully when he suggested in this House that in future all the development authorities  he did not refer to the Lake Basin Development Authority only  should not commercialise some of the projects they undertake  some of projects should "benefit the local people for whom they are meant. We have studied this matter very carefully and we will try to implement it.Hon. Boy dramatised in this House how fishermen are being harrased in Mombasa by my officers. I want to say that this is not supposed to happen. My officers are humane careful and senior Government agents. If anybody was harassed in Mombasa, or anything unacceptable happened, we have noted it and will take corrective measures  immediately.I want to ask the hon.; Members who contributed to this debate to realise that nobody will take us that we are hungry, or parts of our bodies are. itching and we should scratch them. We should tell them that we shall develop Kenya by ourselves. This is the acre reason  we should know that whenever we" contribute to any debate, either in this Houses or elsewhere, we are talking about ourselves and for Kenyans. It is thus important for us to know that whatever we do, be it good or bad, affects us and not  somebody from outside the country. It is, therefore, pointless for us to blame so and so without  suggesting what should be done. That is why I am saying that most hon. Members contributed well because they suggested what we must we do. This is why I have referred to Ominos suggestion that we must not commercialise projects meant to benefit our people and agreed with him and promised that his suggestion will be put into action.I also realise that there are people who want to pick personal quarrels with others. I know for sure there are people whohave, perhaps, been wanting to sell machinery to the LBDA, or other authorities  and  when they fail  to do so, they   single out certain personality in the authority for blame. This is wrong and we should he mature enough to know that if our ship sinks, all of 0 us will drown; we must not he self centred. I will not allow self centredness in all the development authorities under my Ministry.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the people from the lake  have been brought up with the philosophy of fairness. I want to assure anybody who might think that if the authorities are headed by local people there might be favouritism that we will continue to be fair and consider everybody as a Kenyan and not as somebody from a certain tribe. we do not believe in tribalism because any form of tribalism can destroy this country very fast. This is why we must not allow it in our national  institutions.A certain hon. Member asked where all the money given to LBDA went. I wish he was here for me to ask him which money it  was  how much it was and what project it was for. All the little the Ministry received was used in the area for which it was meant.Hon. Aworv. talked about the usage of water this is where I say that we should talk innovatively. Hon. Awori from the mouth of the lake and I am sure he knows chat with very chlorine and a small pump the people of that area can draw water from the lake. We must expect the Government to do everything for us. People can do a few things on their own. If we   wait for the LBDA to dig a latrine for everybody, we are surely not serious.  We can also do .other things for ourselves like irrigation on a small scale for flower, trees and vegetable growing. It is. wrong for hon. Kirwa to wait for LBDA to take water to Cherangani so that he can grow vegetables.We know countries which we can emulate; those of us who have travelled to Israel and Japan will tell you that the only naturalresource Japan has are the Japanese. We have good, energetic,honest  and sincere Kenyans of "better brains and we must behave like other people. For example one hon. Member said unemployment is our biggest problem. But being an hon. Member like any other, I know  what some of our school leavers do; there an young men who do not assist their parents at homa  at all. In Israel one bottle of water irrigate land for grouping of cabbages which will yield Shs.40/. We   should at least  take a Few things seriously in this country. I am not saying that we are not going to look into unemployment, but our young men mast know the  resources we have and how much we can achieve. As a trade unionist by profession, I know how serious the unemployment problem in this country is. But we must borrow other peoples ideas and marry them with ours so that we may solve the problem, Nevertheless  we honestly need serious discipline in. this country,  especially, among our youth, but the youth will not have discipline if the old do not set a good example for them. This is why I, insist that we should do things that can be copied by the youth. For example, how many Kenyan Asians line up at the labour employment bureaus? None. This is because Kenyan Asian children are taught to be business as they  grow up. If you are a farmer and your children cannot follow in your footsteps, then there is something wrong with that family; If you are a cattle breeder and your children ignore your occupation then, there is  something wrong.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also want to mention something which came up during this debate, which I consider to bevery important.	  MR. Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir, we have all the written documents for implementation  for all the Authorities. I noted very carefully when hon. Mang’oli and others  asked why certain   Authorities are not under my Ministry. I am still new in the Ministry and I also want to know why these Authorities do not fall under my Ministry; hut not know.  I must he given time to study this matter and find out why those Authorities are not in my Ministry. I would not want to rush and say things that might he wrong. I also want to know why they are not there. This is  because if Authorities are going to he under my Ministry I would wish to prove  my worth by doing work for all of them so that when I fail people will   know that I have failed.Hon. Grace Ogot used a famous English saying that we must cut our cloth  according to our sizes. I precisely want to agree with her. The L.B.D.A. did what it did because it had that much money; it could not do more. So, she made the point for us and I am grateful to her for having reminded us that we should only cut our cloth according to the sise of our bodies. The L.B.D.A. cut its cloth in accordance with the money it had and that was all. If they had more, like it was wrongly reported by The Kenya Times issue of today  I am not blaming the newspaper because I know that they did not do  that deliberately. The paper reported that I was asking for K£557 million for my Ministry.  If I had that money, I can assure you that within one week  all the regions would flow with development. It is not that kind, of money; in fact that is Kenya Shillings and not pounds. I hope that correction will be made because the outside world might think that my Ministry was given so much money and it was wasted.  It is indeed true that there is another saying that if wishes were   horse You all know what the "beggars would do. Some of the allegations that I heard here were just mere wishes. If wishes were horses all the beggars would be jumping around. I know that I. am not a beggar; I am a rider; I  will ride the small, horse or the phoney that I have.  There are  a few remarks about the L.B.D.A. which I took seriously because this is the biggest Authority.   The L.B.D.A. if under properly, and I repeat if funded properly But hon.Members would surely ask say "But you are the Minister, why do  you not look for the funds." I promise that I will not sleep every night  every evening or every afternoon because I will be looking for funds to run the L.B.D.A. Such funds will be guaranteed through this House. The hon. Members must help us. . You should not leave the Minister alone to do the .job, Any hon. Member with suggestions, or ideas and information that might lead us to get more money is welcome.I also want to touch on the National Irrigation Board. This is because that is also an important area or my Ministry. I know that we have had problems in Kola and Bura Irrigation, schemes and I am sure that hon. Members from that area are wondering what is happening. We are doing our best and if they have looked at the printed Estimates they will see that some money, not much, has been provided to arrest the situation. We will continue with the  little money we have to ensure that our people do not suffer unnecessarily. 3o, we axe interested in Bura and Hola irrigation schemes. I will personally be visiting these areas to see for myself what is happening there so that the supervision of work is and done not only by the officers on the ground but by every member ofMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also want to assure this House that my Ministry is a Ministry in the field and not a Ministry in the offices, It is a Ministry that will move to the field. As some hon. Members pointed out, indeed it is a Ministry that touches the very heart of the rural person. I will do my best to ensure that the rural man benefits  from the little the "Ministry can do.Once again I want to thank hon. Members. If the hon. Members have confirmed, as indeed they did, that the money given to the Ministry is little, surely there is no more I can do but to use the little I have. Also in order to answer one hon. Member who was wondering why the Uaso Nyiro North and South Development Authorities were not given money The K£400,000 was meant for both of them for study. But discussions are going on now between us and the  Office of the vice president and Ministry of Finance to determine how much money we want to   injection in both Authorities. There are also other findings that might be done externally and could not have been included in our Estimates.  But when this money becomes available, we will ensure that every region in Henya is looked after and particularly the Nyatike .area where we have people who have never seen a train or an aeroplane. I am sure the hon. Member for Nyatike is very happy because he knows that when I say I will do something   I do it. He should be careful because if I visit that area and I do not find him there, I might withdraw some of the things that I have decided to do for the area.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also want to assure hon. Kirwa and hon. Mang’oli and hon. Okondo that the only way I can confirm what they were saying is for me to visit those areas personally and tour the areas and see for myself what the needs are. Like one hon. Member was saying even if we have only KShs.20,000/- let us use it on something that people will see. I can assure hon. Kirwa that young as he is and new as he is in this House, I was very, very pleased with his contribution. I never thought that such a young man like Kirwa could have done so wonderfully in this House being new as he is,I also want to re assure the House that I have   noted very carefully  all the remarks that, were   made about rain fed rice,  The a rain fed rice project was delayed not by the L.B.D.A. but by the  funding sources; the money was delayed and it is through this House that we can stop such delays. If you study a project carefully and find out why certain things have not been  done and raise it here, it would help us to speed up the implementation of the project. A project may be delayed not because somebody wants to delay it. Since hon. Kirwa has  come back into the Chamber I want to repeat what I had already said about him. Hon. Kirwa. should  not worry whether the L.B.D.A. or any  other Authority is run by a Luo, a Kikuyu or a Kalenjin. If it is being run by a Luo he should know that Luos are bom with the  philosophy of fairness; they  are very fair.I beg to move.</Newspeech>  (Question, that Mr. Speaker do now leave the Chair put and agreed to)The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kagvrima) left the Chair<Header>IN THE COMMITTEE</Header><Header>The Temporary Chairman (Mr. Wabuge) took the chair</Header>Vote 46 - Ministry of Regional Development<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): Mr. Temporary Chairman, I beg to move:-THAT, a sum not exceeding K£7,876,265 be issued from the Consolidated Fund to complete the sum necessary to meet expenditure during the year ending 30th June, 1991, in respect of Vote 46 - Ministry of Regional Development.</Newspeech>(Question proposed)RECURRENT ESTIMATESub-Vote 460 - General Administration and Planning (head 700 agreed to)(Sub-Vote 460 agreed to)Sub-Vote 461 - Regional Development(Heads 701, 715, 716 and 717 agreed to)(Sub-Vote 461 agreed to)Sub-Vote 462 - Fisheries Department (Heads 718, 720, 743, 747, 74S and 753 agreed to) (Sub-Vote 462 agreed to)Sub-Vote 463 - Irrigation Department(Heads 757 and 758 agreed to)(Sub-Vote 463 agreed to)(Vote R46 agreed to)DEVELOPMENT ESTIMATESSub-Vote 460 - General Administration and Planning (Head 700 agreed to) (Sub-Vote 460 agreed to) Sub Vote 461 Regional Development (Heads 701 and 707 agreed to)Head 715 Lake Basin Development Authority <Newspeech>MR.

EKIDOR, on behalf of Mr. Makhanu, asked the Minister of State, Office of the President in how many districts, so far, hon. Members of Parliament attend District Executive Committee and District Tender Board meetings.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Onyancha): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. In accordance with the District Focus for Rural Development strategy, the District Executive Committee comprises of the following. The district commi¬ssioner as the chairman, a district development committee secretary, departmental heads from all Ministries represented in the districts, clerks of the local autho¬rities, representatives of development-related parastatal bodies. Members ofParliament are not, therefore, members of the DECs. However, they are members of the district development committees, which are the foundation of the strategy. The district executive committee is technically a subcommittee of the district development committee and its main function is to provide technical support to the district development committee activities, including preparation of plans, management and implementation of projects within the guiding directives of the district development committees.Sir, the district tender boards are comprised of the district commisioner, as the chairman, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Public Works, the Ministry of Home Affairs and National Heritage, the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Transport and Communications, district development officers, district accountant's and the district supplies officers, who are normally the secretaries. Any district departmental head who may not be included in the list I have already read may attend the district tender board meetings during deliber¬ations on purchase applications on his department. In order to facilitate wider representation and to enhance efficiency of the district tender board, the Govern¬ment on 20th March, 1990 directed that in every district one hon. Member of Parlia¬ment, elected by the other members in the district should be a member of the district tender board. The district commissioners of all districts have informed hon. Members about this requirement and the position at present is as follows.According to the information we have received, in the Rift Valley Province, the hon. Members of Parliament in all the 13 districts have nominated one member in each district to be their member in the district tender board. Central Province has done so with all the five districts. In North - Eastern Province, the hon. Members in all the three districts have already nominated one of them to sit in the meetings. The same applies to Eastern Province. In Western Province the same applies, except for Busia. Hon. Members from Busia District have been invited to notify the Busia District Commissioner of their nomination of one of the hon. Members to sit on the board. The Coast Province has made its nomination. South Nyanza, Kisii and Siaya have nominated one hon. Member, but the other districts have not done so. They have been requested to do so and forward the nomination to their district commissioner for transmission to headquarters.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Coast Province is not a district, but a province and he was asked about districts.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Onyancha): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the hon. Member was not listening to me. I said all the Coast Province districts have made their nomination.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EDKID0R: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for that brief reply, will he promise this House that in future the Government will review this Blue Book to include Members of Parliament in the district executive committees?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. 0NYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the district executive committee usually sits and prepares agenda and material ready for discussion and direction during the district development committee meetings. It. is only supposed to be a smaller committee of the district development committee. If, therefore, we allow all hon. Members of Parliament to sit in this committee, then it will become too big to carry out its duties. I think it is a wise decision that the district executive committee remains the way it is today.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from the: reply by the Assistant Minister, is he aware that we have not had any information from the provincial administration that we could effect this and that? The district commissioners have not had anything in writing from the Permanent Secretary, Office of the President and, therefore, they have nothing to go by. Can the Assistant Minister inform the House under what Gazette Notice this matter is contained? That way, an hon. Member who may be chased away from either a district executive committee meeting or a district tender board meeting can produce his evidence.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. 0NYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sorry I am not aware of that kind of tendency the hon. Member is referring to. I am not aware of it and I do not think I need to answer a generalised question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. What I have said is what is happening all over the country. It has even been said in public rallies that provided the district commissioner or the provincial administration is not given any directive in writing from the Permanent Secretary, Office of the President, nothing will be followed. Is the Assistant Minister in order to say that he is not aware of this tendency when, in fact, it is something known countrywide?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. 0NYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am still not aware of what the hon. Member is saying. He has to be a little bit more specific; right now he is generalise everything.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is always said by the administration that they have not received specific instructions in writing so that when they are questioned they can produce the written directives they have followed. Does the Assistant Minister mean that whatever is said in the country, over the radio or in the newspapers is followed, rather than channel information through a document written by his Permanent Secretary Why does he say that he does not understand the tendency I have referred to.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member says that "it is always said and I am saying that I am not aware of that. Can he come out clearly and say when a permanent secretary said that he needed something in writing or some¬thing like that.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. What the Assistant Minister is saying is misleading, and he should take Members of Parliament very seriously. I cannot remember having selected or elected anybody to represent the hon. Member from Mombasa in the district tender board. Can the Assistant Minister name the representative of the Mombasa Members of Parliament in the district tender board He: should take us seriously.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this directive was communicated to every district commissioner in the country, who were supposed to get in touch with Members of Parliament of their respective districts so that they could sit down together and choose one1 of them to represent the others in the district tender boards. If the hon. Member may not have been in this particular meeting, then I do not know what to say. The information we have is that they did sit.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. When the hon. Assistant Minister was challenged by hon. Kiliku to name the Mombasa District Member of Parliament elected to represent the others in the district tender board, he: said that he did not know what to say. Can he then withdraw his earlier reply to the Question and seek the indulgence of the House so that he can give a proper reply later on Even in Kwale District we have not selected any one Member of Parliament to represent us in the district tender Board. He should not generalise everything.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. 0NYANCHA: Mr. Speaker Sir, I believe that the  hon. Member stay need to consult with his district commissioner to find out when the  other hon. Members from his district sat and selected one of the in as their representative in the  district  tender board, and I am sure  he  will get that information.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASike NDOMBI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The  Assistant Minister is misleading this House. If he is serious with his answer, can he tell us who, out of the Nyamira District Members of Parliament, is the  representative  in the district tender board?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, when I gave  the earlier answer, I clearly indicated that some two districts in Nyanza Province have not chosen their represent¬atives to the tender board, and I went ahead and indicated that they have been requested to choose their representatives. Nyamira District is one of those two.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I have  said that the Assistant Minister should take  hon. Members very seriously. We cannot go by what he1 is saying. There is no official communication from the authorities as to who have been seelected. Could the Assistant Minister go back and come with a better reply since he: cannot substantiate  what he is saying? He is out of order because  you cannot make an allegation in this House which you cannot substantiate.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pre pare d to go back and bring to this House the: toted, list. But, as I have1 already indicated, the hon. Member should contact his district commissioner and find out who has been selected to represent them in the  district tender board.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. JALDESSA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister, in his unsatisfactory reply, has categorically said that the  Office of the President has instructed all district commissioners to have one Member of Parlia¬ment in every district elected to the district tender board, and he has gone further to mention all the provinces. I come from Eastern Province , particularly Isiolo District, and I am not aware of any selections that have been done . Can he go back and organise  so that a fair Election is being done since we have  no knowledge of what he  is telling us?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have taken a serious note of that.MR. JALANGO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the questions being asked by hon. Members and the subsequent replies by the  Assistant Minister, it is evident that the information from the Assistant Minister is not right. There is no single  district where? a Member of Parliament has been elected to represent his counterparts in the district tender board.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: Ziko! Ziko!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. JALANG O: Can the Assistant Minister then  give us those districts? I come  from Siaya District and I know that there has not been any elections of a Member of Parliament from the district to represent his counterparts in the district tender board. Can he1 give  us the list?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was a very big exercise, where I had to get in touch with every district commissioner to get the information. As I have indicated, the list is being drawn and I am prepared to submit it to the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: On a point of information, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I want to inform my fellow hon. Members that I am one of those Members of Parliament who have been elected as representative s to the  district tender board in my district. So, the  Assistant Minister is telling the  truth. If your district commissioner has not given you a letter, then you can go and ask him.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question.,</Newspeech>  Question No.352Late Payment of Teachers  Salaries in KwaleMR. MIDU asked the Minister for Education why the salaries of teachers from Kwale District axe being paid late, that is, on the 10th of every month, since January, 1989 to date.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. I am not aware that the teachers salaries in Kwale District are paid late. The truth of the matter i3 that teachers in Kwale District  always have their salaries submitted on time. I have a list of dates here with me which show that teachers salaries were, submitted through registered mail from  January, 1989 up to date from this list it is and clearly shown that these salaries have been delivered on 30th of every month. In June this year, the salaries were delivered on 29th of June.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant Ministers reply that he is not aware that teachers s±z salaries in Kwale District have been paid late, I would like to inform  now that the teachers from Kwale District do not receive their salaries on time. Having now made him aware of this, could he tell this House what action his Ministry is going to take to stop further delay in the payment of teachers salaries in Kwale District?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have already indicated, I have a list of dates here which clearly show that salaries for teachers in Kwale District are always submitted well before the end of the month through a registered cheque. In fact, in February this year, these salaries were delivered on the 24Jh under a parcel No .132584 which was delivered through the Akamba Bus Service. Therefore, it is true to state here that on many occasions, these salaries get to the bank before the end of the month. However, the Ministry is investigating to find out why, after issuing the cheques, the teachers do not seem to be getting their salaries on time.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKG'QLI: Mr0 Speaker, Sir, arising from the answer earlier given by the Assistant  Minister that he is not aware that the teachers in Kwale District axe getting their salaries very late, now that he has been made aware by the hon. Questioner, could he tell this House what action his Ministry is going to take to stop these delays. As we all are aware, matters touching on the welfare  of teachers are very sensitive and it is important therefore, for the Ministry to take this matter very seriously. Could he assure this House that these teachers, including others all over the country, are going to receive their salaries on time? Let him tell this House the specific action they are going to take because it appears to us that this particular Ministry is not taking things seriously,  We would like to caution the Assistant Minister that a matter like this can cause a  very serious problem and therefore, we would like to hear an assurance from him that these teachers are from now onwards going to receive their salaries on time.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARADRI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to inform this House and the hon. Member, that my Ministry takes the views of hon. Members in this House very seriously and we are going to take the necessary action to ensure that   teachers get their salaries on time. However, in this particular case, we are investigating to find out why teachers in Kwale District do not seem  to be getting their salaries on time although the cheques axe delivered well before the end of the month.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. TEBER: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the answer given by the  Assistant Minister, would he agree with me that it is i a fact that teachers in Kwale District do not receive salaries in time, if the cheques axe delivered on 30th of the month. This means that the cheques take another week before they are processed by the banks. What I am requesting the Ministry to do is to be sending these cheques by 25th of every month so that the banks have time to process the teachers salaries before the month ends. So, could he assure the House that he is going to take the necessary action so that teachers can be getting their salaries   in time?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, maybe what I can do is to appeal to the banks to make sure that they process these cheques immediately they receive them so that teachers   could be receiving   their salaries on time. I am saying this because I know there are certain  banks that take so much time to make entries into their books after receiving these cheques, that they  are not able to pay the teachers their salaries immediately after the end of the month. Therefore, these banks could assist the teachers a great deal if they could be paying teachers promptly after receiving the cheques and then do their entries into the books later. I am saying this because there  appears to be a problem with the banks themselves.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question.

No.269868 has been earning the correct salary for a PI teacher since she graduated from Highridge Teachers College in May, 19880 However, she applied for hardship allowance in August, 1989 and was paid the same for the period between 9/5/88 and 30/9/89.

EKIDOR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for his answer, could he tell this House for how long underpayment and delay of teachers salaries and allowances is going to continue.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no question of underpayment here. The   teacher in question was not being paid hardship allowance because she had not applied for, but when she did apply this particular allowance, her claim was processed and was paid to her including her right  salary.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE SPEAKER: Next Question.</Newspeech> 	 	Question No. 368Replacement for N.S.S.F.

Consequently, we cancelled the cheque on 13th July, 1989 and a replacement cheque No.l39077 was submitted to the claimant, on 16th July, 1990.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.JALANG'O: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this cheque was 3 issued only yesterday and I am asking the Assistant Minister to tell this House why it took the N.S.S.F.  14 months to issue a replacement cheque. This is a very straight forward question.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, before we can make a replacement cheque, we do some investigation to find out why the original cheque was returned. After  the investigation are concluded, we then cancel  the cheque and then  submit a new cheque and send it to the claimant.</Newspeech>Question No. 355 Recruitment of Game Hanger TraineesMR. I. MOHAMED asked, the Minister for Tourism and  wildlife how many Game Ranger Trainees were recruited during the recent countrywide recruitment programme and how many of them are from Wajir District.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER F0R TOURISM AND WILDLIFE (Mr.Awori):Mr. Speaker, Sir, I "beg to reply.211 Game Ranger Trainees were recruited during the period in question of which two were from Wajir District.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. I. MOHAHED: Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister tell the House what criteria they used when employing those two trainees from Wajir District?	</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AWORI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the criteria used for opening employment in the Kenya Wildlife Service is that  the man must be at least 18 years old and he must have an identity card of the country.  Finally he must be physically fit.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. I. MOHAMED: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the answer given by the Assistant Minister is shocking because out of the 211 trainees only two have been recruited from Wajir District, Does it mean that there were only two people who were physically fit, over 18 years and had. identity cards out of the 211 people from Wajir District?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AWORI: Yes, Mr. Speaker.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister serious in his reply? I am sure there are so many physically fit people in Wajir District who are over 18 years old. This is why this Question has been brought here. If so,what is he going to do if there are more people to  found there?Can he now recruit them? I am sure we can find more than, twopeople from Wajir District who are physically fit.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. AWORI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am quite serious in my reply. In fact I do not know whether  the hon. Member for Webuye knows the  member of candidates who presented themselves for the interview. Supposing there were only three candidates and only two were physically fit? We took two. On a point of order,</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. I. MOHAMED: On a point of order,Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Assistant Minister is misleading the House because when a recruitment takes place, there must be an  advertisement and also a centre for the recruitment. As far as I am concerned, there was no recruitment. Can the Assistants Minister, therefore, tell us where they picked those two he is talking about us?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Mohamed, that is not a point of order  but a supplementary question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. I. MOHAMED: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister is misleading the House. His Ministry has never conducted any recruitment in Wajir District.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: That is your point of view, Mr. Mohamed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SALAT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the benefit of the House, can the Assistant Minister give us the breakdown of the 211 trainees who have been recruited? Can he give us the breakdown on a district basis, When was the recruitment done?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AWORI: With pleasure,  Mr.  Speaker. Wajir had two people  Marsabit 69, Lemu eight, 'Tana River 20, Narok eight, Turkana 25, Sanburu 32, Laikipia 34, Kajiado 11 and Isiolo three.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZAITDI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister has been asked to give a countrywide break¬down, but he has only given a breakdown of five districts. that should  countrywide representation.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. AW0RI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, that should countrywide representation and it simply means that we did not recruit anybody from Busia, Bungoma, Mombasa and so on!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. I. MOHAMED: Mr. Speaker, Sir, what criteria were they using in the recruitment?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AWORI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already replied to that question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR; On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Does it mean that there were no people who applied for recruit¬ment from the whole of Wajir District?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: That is not a point of order but a supple-mentary question, Mr. Kipkorir. Next Question, Mr. Mureithi.</Newspeech>Question No. 349Outstanding Wildlife Compensation Claims for KieniMR. MUREITHI asked the Minister for Tourism and Wildlife how much money, in terms of wildlife compen-sation claims, is outstanding to date with the Ministry in respect of Kieni Constituency and when the Ministry will settle those claims.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILDLIFE (Mr. Awori) Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The minutes of the wildlife compensation awards made by the Nyeri District Committee do not give a breakdown in accorded with constituencies and it is, therefore, not possible to tell how much wildlife compensation was paid to the farmers in Kieni Constituency. However, the total amount of money outstanding I respect of Nyeri District as a whole is Ksh.9,532,341.75. The claims will be settled as and when funds become available.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUREITHI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not think that is a proper answer. Can the Assistant Minister tell us during this financial year 1990/91, how much of the funds will go to settle claims in Nyeri District?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AW0RI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I cannot give that reply. Money was only  been made available 14 days ago and we are now   working out to see how much will go to each district.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIILU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister tell us which method the Ministry is using to pay these claims because there are very many in the Republic?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AW0RI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, priority is given to loss of life. Secondly, if there is a farmer who owes money to a bank and that bank is about to be dispossess that fanner of his farm, and he has compensation claims pending, he, too, is given priority.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUREITHI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the  Assistant Minister tell the House how much money his Ministry has asked for as compensation for the whole country during the current financial year?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AW0RI: Regrettably very little. We have asked for KShs.20 million for the  whole country.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUREITHI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the1 Ministry has only KShs.20 million to settle compensation claims in the whole  country and we  can see here that we: have one district that is owed KShs.9 million, when doe s the; Assistant Minister think that he will be reasonably be" able  to settle the claims in Nyeri District?</Newspeech>MR. AW0RI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in all sincerity, that is not possible. We are , however, doing everything possible  to look for funds, but it looks as if it is going to take  a long time before we can settle the KShs.9 million in Nyeri District and other districts. As it is known, there  is an outstanding amount of KShs.200 million throughout the  country. When that money will be settled, I cannot give  any idea.</Newspeech>Question No. 378Delay in Sub-division of L.R. 8452/2MR. MWAMZANDI, on behalf of Dr. Misoi, asked the Minister for Lands, Housing and Physical Planning what has delayed the  sub-division of L.R. 8452/2 in eldorect into 42 agricultural sub-plots.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Bomett): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. My Ministry has received no request to sub divide  L.R. 8452/2 into Eldorect into 42 agricultural sub-plots as suggested by the hon. Member.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZAND: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member who asked the  Question is aware of the  request and the  Assistant Minister says that, he is not aware  of any such request. Can he check what has happened to this request at the  Ministry headquarters or from his district lands officers?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. B0METT: Mr. Speaker  Sir, for such a request to come to us, it has to come  through the1 local district officer, who should have sat with the members concerned to agree  on the  sub division. L.R, 8452/2 belongs to many people and it is them who can request such a sub division through the  local district officer. If they do that, the n the  request will certainly be  granted.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, did the  Assistant Minister take  the trouble  to find out, from the  district lands officer, what is delaying the request since it is obvious that it has not reached the Ministry headquarters?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. B0METT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said that we have not received any request to sub divide  L.R. 8452/2.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, since  I am sure that the  request was made  did the Assistant Minister, after receiving this Question, take trouble to find out from the  district lands officer why the request is being delayed?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. B0METT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we  never go round soliciting requests of this nature from people .</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Whenever a Question is asked here, it is normal that the  Ministry concerned seeks information from its officers at the  grassroots. Is the Assistant Minister in order to say here  that it is not his duty to solicit for information? How can the  headquarters have all the  information required from the districts if information is not sought from the  districts? That reply is not in line with the  Government policy.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. B0METT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it should be  borne! in mind that this plot belongs to many people  and not to the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Physical Planning. As such, we cannot dictates to the owners of the plot as to whether to sub divide their plot or not. For sure , we know what is going on at the ground. My Ministry is run efficiently.</Newspeech>Question No. 365Service Charge" Collected from Teachers in MwalaMR. WAMBUA asked the Minister for Local Government how much money has so far been collected as service charge from teachers in all the primary and secondary schools in Mwala Constituency and how this money has been utilised.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Wagura): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.A total of KShs.1,138,000 has been collected from all teachers in primary and secondary schools in Mwala Constituency. All the! money which has been collected is kept by the concerned local authority, in this case, Machaskos County Council. Therefore, it is not possible to tell the hon. Member how the money has been utilised.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am grateful that the Assistant Minister has given an adequate answer to the Question. However, I would like the Ministry to please allow the money that has been collected from teachers to be used to buy some text books or reference books for teachers. Could the Assistant Minister allow that expenditure?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, that should have been a special request. All the mone!y collected as service charge should go towards development. I would like the hon. Member to know that some the money which has b£eh collected has been utilised properly. Machakos County Council has bought a lorry worth KShs.938,000 and a Land Rover worth KShs.789,000. As for text books, reference! books for teachers and other materials, unless it is a special request, the Ministry will not allow that.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KY0NDA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant Minister s answer that this money is supposed to be used for development, and taking into account that buying books for schools is a very important exercise, can he not consider that expenditure since it is also geared towards development?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the Machakos County Council so wishes, it can request for authority from the Ministry to purchase books using service   charge money. Other Wise, the money must go towards development.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, lorries bought by the county council can be used by individuals if supervision is not effective*. But when you buy reference books for teachers, that means that the books will be used to teach pupils, which is a specific exercise of development. Can the Ministry not consider buying books and not vehicles because books will not be misused but vehicles can be misused if supervision is not effective?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAGURA: What I am saying is that a special request must be processed by the Minister accordingly.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Next Order.</Newspeech><Header>QUESTIONS BY PRIVATE NOTICE</Header>Posting Cancellations of Teachers to Masinga<Newspeech>MR. KITLU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Education the following Question by Private Notice:Why did the Ministry cancel the posting of the three trained teachers that were recently posted to Ekalakala Educational Zone, Masinga Division, and yet the schools in this zone are understaffed?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.My Ministry posted six qualified teachers to Ekalakala Educational Zone, Masinga. Division, in May this year. However, teacher Catherine N. Mbithifs posting to Ekalakala Primary School  was cancelled because she produced an affidavit to the effect that she was married. She was consequently reposted to Iluvya Primary School, Muvuti Zone, Central Division. Teacher Joyce K. Kivondos posting to Ikaatiani Primary School was also cancelled on medical grounds. She was re-posted to Kathithiainaa Primary School, Kangundo Division. My Ministry is making arrangements to deploy additional teachers to Ekalakala Educational Zone.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIILU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I appreciate the Assistant Ministers reply, why did the Ministry not post other teachers upon the cancellation of the postings in question?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir,  we are aware that this zone is understaffed by nine teachers and my Ministry is going to post qualified teachers as soon as possible.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, since there is under staffing  in the  whole division, What is the Ministry doing to rectify the situation?</Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will handle the situation properly because Machakos District is overstaffed and it is just the question of the district education officer deploying teachers to the affected areas.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, under staffing of teachers properin schools means that no proper teaching takes place. If there is no proper teaching, pupils cannot do well in examinations. The Member and the local people have of Parliament nothing to do with the question of redundant teachers in Machakos District. It is the business of the Ministry to make sure that all schools are adequately staffed. Although it is "late, when are these schools going to be staffed because the final examinations are very close?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Sir, I have given the assurance that we are going to post teachers there as soon as possible.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIILU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it seems the Assistant Minister was not given correct information. In my Question, I mentioned three teachers but the Assistant Minister only talked about two teachers. What about the third one?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not know what we are quarreling about. I have accepted that this zone is under¬staffed. I have also accepted that certain teachers who were posted there were re-posted elsewhere for the reasons I gave given. I have also assured the hon. Member that we are going to post more teachers to the zone.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a serious matter for the Assistant Minister to accept that there over staffing of teachers in Machakos District schools when this particular division is understaffed. Can he tell us when teachers will be sent to that zone?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there will be adequate  teachers in that zone next term.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTUA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister tell us why the posting of these three teachers was cancelled?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: I have already given reasons for that, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question.</Newspeech>Increase in Examination Fee for Graft Courses<Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Education the following Question by Private Notice:In view of the fact that the Secretary of the Kenya National Examinations Council by his   circular dated 8th June, 1990, has increased Craft and Technician Courses' examination fees for times higher than last year, and realising that most of the students are unable to meet this unexpected increase, could the Minister cancel this increase forthwith?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): Mr.  Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The examination fees for Craft and Technician examinations have been increased by the Kenya National Examinations Council as follows:-1.	Basic fees from Kshs. 200.-00 to Kshs. 500.00 with an additional of Kshs.200.00 per practical subject.2.	Craft I courses from Kshs.100.00 per subject to Kshs.52 5.00 per subject.3.	Craft II courses from Kshs. 125.00 per subject to Kshs.525.00 per subject.4.	Craft III courses from Kshs. 150.00 per subject to Kshs. 525.00 per subject.5.	Technician I courses from Kahs.125.00 per subject toKshs. 575.00 per subject.	 6.	Technician II course from Kshs.150.00 per subject to 				Kshs .575. 00 per subject.	7.	Technician III courses from Kshs.175-00 per subject toKshs.575.00 per subject.The new fees are effective from 1st July, 1990.	The increases are in  keeping with the Government policy of cost sharing. The examination fees were raised to cover only  the expenditure on preparation, administration and processing of the respective examinations. Hitherto, technical examinations created a shortfall in the" Council expenditure to the tune of Kshs.20.75 million per year.It should be noted that the fees charged do not even cover the total unit cost of the examinations. For example, the unit cost for Craft I is Kshs.3,502.20 while the examination fees will be Kshs.2,600.00. It is hoped that the Government will provide grants to the Council to cover the difference of Kshs.962.20 per candidate.I have already approved these fees increases because of the necessity to ensure nearly adequate funding of the conduct of the technical examinations. In doing so, I have acted within the Government policy of cost  sharing between the beneficiaries of services provided by the Government on one hand and the Government itself on the other. I, therefore, do not intend to change this decision.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we fully agree to cost sharing, I wonder why these fees were increased from Shs.l50/ to Shs.500/. Furthermore, the announcement relating to this increase was made only last June. Where were these people who were supposed to have announced this increase last November or December? If this had been done, we would have known of the increase in January and the parents with children who are going to sit examinations this year would have been prepared to pay these new fees. From where are parents going to get Shs.6,000/ instead of Shs.1,500/ We are not refusing to share costs, but we want to know why the planners concerned did not alert parents long before last June. What are parents going to do about their children?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question here is not where the planners of this cost sharing were. The fact is that the problem here has been identified, and this is the way in which we are trying to solve the problem. The parents concerned have already been informed of the new fees. In any case, there has always been a shortfall of nearly Shs.21 million annually when the Government has offered these examinations.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is more serious than it has ever been before. Even new salaries take time to be implemented. These fees were reviewed only last June, and the deadline for paying them is 31st July, 1990. From where will poor parents get these new examination fees?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not in a position to tell parents where they will get this money from.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are very serious in this matter because we know that there are poor parents who cannot pay these new fees. The circular announcing these new fees went out in June, 1990, and the deadline involved is 31st July, 1990. We are more serious than the Assistant Minister thinks. Could he tell this House where a poor parent is going to get the extra money from between June and July, 1990?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member says that he is very serious, in which case, he knows that I cannot tell him where parents will get money from. I have explained why there was necessity to increase the fees in order to cover the shortfall that the Government has been realising. The Government does not have the extra money required.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a very serious matter as it touches on a lot of money that parents are required to pay. If parents had known all along that they would be required to pay, not Shs. 1,500/= but Shs.6,000/= this would have been understandable, but they have been given too short a notice. Is this reasonable? We represent many people, including poor ones. Could the Assistant Minister not wait to implement these new fees next time? This matter is serious, and the decision involved should be shelved.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: No, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are not going to wait until next time because of shortage of funds. We do not have enough money to fund these examinations, and this is why we are asking parents to share the burden.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: No, Mr. Mang'oli, we are running short of time.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: We are going to bring up a Motion on this Ministry.Measures to Curb Spread of Malaria in Wajir</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.I. MOHAMED: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Health the following Question by Private Notice.Since there is an outbreak of malaria in Wajir District, and noting that this disease has claimed many lives, what urgent steps is the Ministry taking to post medical personnel and provide mobile clinics in all the locations of the district in order to contain the spread of this disease?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. There has been an increase in malaria cases reported in Wajir District after the rainy season, and malaria control committees have been  formed in the district to deal with mosquito and malaria problems. The community has been mobilised to remove any mosquito breeding sites and receptacles, under the guidance of health personnel in the affected areas. I am happy to inform the hon. Member that currently, there are five public health technicians and one public health officer stationed in Wajir West, and two additional public health technicians have already been posted there to specifically strengthen the malaria control exercise as a result of the recent increase of malaria cases. Mobile clinics will be used to treat cases of malaria, in addition to the treatment being given in health centres and dispensaries in the affected areas. The case is under control, and let me inform the House that there is no cause for alarm whatsoever in that district.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.I. MOHAMED: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I appreciate the answer from the Assistant Minister. According to him, the health personnel he mentioned is sufficient, but in Wajir West alone, we have 14 locations. The Assistant Minister says that there are already seven public health technicians in Wajir West, and this means that a half of the locations in Wajir West have no such technicians to cater for them. From one location to another is a distance of about 300 miles and there are no medical facilities in between. Could the Assistant Minister assure this House that proper vehicles are deployed in that district for use as mobile clinics?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am very sorry that the distance from one health centre to the next one in this particular district is big. I am equally sorry that the number of people in the area is small. The malaria cases reported in these institutions is very small. Hence, the number of technicians there is now seven. These technicians and one public health officer are, for the time being, enough to deal with the cases so far reported, in view of the fact that the number of serious cases reported and proved is going down. So, we hope that things will be all right. However, if the hon. Member reports to this House that things are not going well, my Ministry will review the matter and see what can be done as soon as possible, because my Ministry is there to look after the welfare of the people.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. JALDESSA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, categorically said that there is no cause for alarm, whereas the hon. Member for the area said that there has been an outbreak of malaria there. Could the Assistant Minister justify his claim that there is no cause for alarm?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as far as I am concerned, the number of malaria cases reported and dealt with has been going down. In view of the fact that we have sent the district more health technicians and mobile clinic work is going on there, this is why I say that there is no cause for alarm.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SALAT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, malaria is dangerous, and we know that Wajir has a lot of stagnant water. What plans does the Ministry have to completely eradicate mosquitoes in the area so that they do not spread malaria to the people?MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have already posted our staff there  and we are also, going to expand Wjir District. So, more staff will be added immediately the expansion work is complete.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO: Mr., Speaker, Sir, I would like to know from  the Assistant Minister what technicians are supposed to do in the eradication of malaria in Wajir District when they have no drugs.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker. Sir, I am surprised that Dr. Wameyo is asking me what technicians do eradicating malaria. I did not know that he did know that. However, let me inform  him that as somebody who was once an Assistant Minister for Health knows that technicians</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Instead of the Assistant Minister being very verbose, could he tell us what technicians are supposed to do in the eradication of malaria if they have no drugs?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was already beginning to answer  Dr. Wameyo is interrupting me because he fears that I will tell him that I am surprised that he does not know what he is asking. The technicians look for stagnant water snots, which are the breeding  grounds for mosquitoes, and pour medicine in that water to destroy the mosquito larvae. I thought Dr. Wameyo knew this</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. I.A. MOHAMED: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has said that there is no cause for alarm. Can he tell the House how many people have died of malaria in Wajir District?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir,  deaths at home   were not reported, but only three people died in hospitals of malaria. The cases reported, treated and discharged were as follows: Health Centre	  Month	  No.Thuna	March	172Imbuade	March	138Thuna	Apcril	134Imbunde	April	205Thuna	May	280Imbunde	May	192By June, our officer had effectively handled 499 cases.</Newspeech><Header>POINTS OF ORDER</Header> <Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I riseon a point of order in connection with misporting by the Daily Nationof what transpired in this House when my last weeks Questionregarding the selection of a youth team to represent Kenya in theInternational Youth Sports was being answered. The Daily NationOf 13th July, 1990 reported:-"The House went into an uproar yesterday following revelations that only teams from the Rift Valley Province will represent Kenya during the forthcoming International Youth Sports as other provincial teams had not been invited. Mr. Kyonda said he was at the Nyayo National Stadium during the meeting and noticed that it was only schools from the Rift Valley Province that fielded teams. Mr. Kyonda said no teams from outside the Rift Valley were invited". Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue was distorted to an extent that those who read the newspaper could not even know what it was all about. I find it unfortunate that serious business in this House misported like this. The issue I raised here was of great concern to me and other hon. Members I was at the Nyayo National Stadium on the day of the selection and noticed that all provinces were represented by secondary school teams. I asked how many provincial primary school teams had been invited. In reply, the Minister for Culture and Social Services rightly said that only those from Rift Valley Province were invited.	I then askedwhy the other provinces were not represented. But the Daily Nationreporter decided to report that only teams from Rift Valley Province participated and are going to represent Kenya.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: Order, Mr.Kyonda, I think they have heard and are going to correct the impression they created.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANGOLI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.I riseto respond to Mt. G.G. Kariukis reaction to what I said here, whichwas reported by the Sunday Nation.

SPEAKER: Mr. Mangoli, you are not making a point of order now, but a speech. <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Dr. B.A. Godana):On a point oforder, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I rise to seek your indulgence, and that of the House,to moue a Motion, under Standing Orders No. 20, on a matter of State security, namely, the disturbances, hooliganism and thuggery that took place about one week ago. If I may, with your indulgence, refresh the mind of my hon. colleagues, Standing Order No. 20 reads as follows, and I quote:-"If any Member rising in his place at any time shall propose to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgentnational importance, and if Mr. Speaker rules that the matter is a definite matter of national importance and not less than 15 Members rise in their places in support, Mr. Speaker shall nominate a time on the same day at which such Motion may be moved."  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am now asking your permission to move for the Adjournment of the House so that the House discusses the matter of national    importance; namely the disturbances, hooliganism and thuggery which engulfed this City and a few other towns in the Republic some two weeks, or so, ago.</Newspeech>(Hon. Members stood in their places) <Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER:	All right. Be seated, hon. Members.	There is no doubtin anybodys mind that what has been raised by Dr. Godana is of urgent national importance. So, I will give you, hon. Members, the whole day to discuss the Motion.</Newspeech>(applause) <Newspeech>THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR FINANCE 	(Prof. Saitoti): 	Mr. Speaker Sir, I beg to move that the House do now adjourn.</Newspeech>(applause) <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH 	(Dr. B.A. Godana): 	Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said, I stand under Standing Order No. 20 to move a Motion of national importance, as you have rightly ruled in respect of the disturbances, hooliganism and thuggery that took place about two weeks ago in this City and a few other areas of our country. Sir, hon. Members are, no doubt, aware that we did, in fact have a similar Motion a week ago, which was moved by hon. Musyoka and seconded by me.	Some hon. Members may, therefore, wonder why I have deemed it necessaryto raise this matter again. Since then, fresh information has come to light,as I understand, and it is at times such as this that this august House, Parliament as the most cherished institution in a constitutional set up - should take the initiative in affirming the legitimacy of established institutions of State and its procedures and, further, in leading the nation in affirming the confidence of the nation in its own legal constitution and procedures. Sir, I do not have to dwell at length on the nature of the thuggery and lawlessness which we witnessed; I think a lot was said in this House last time and, what is more, it seems that leaders in various parts of the country are still continuing to educate the public on the seriousness of that matter and to condemn it. However, as we said in this House and I remember personally  doing so we were treated to what appeared like an agitation for multi-parties. As some of us contended, there was never really an issue for multi-parties. Those who were fanning incitement against the established order were in reality not agitating for multi-parties, but were seeking to chart a strategy for ultimate take-over of power by means other than those envisaged in our Constitution. 	(applause)It is obvious, Sir, that the youth who took to the streets, definitely, do not appreciate the issues of multi-parties, or single parties, or for that matter, democracy as was claimed. 	The strategy, then, seems to have been to provoke and induce hooliganism and thuggery so that to cause a general breakdown of law and order, culminating in peoples as they hoped kneeling down in the streets in masses so that in the ensuing confusion, people would then seize power. Evidence of this is seen in the fact that we still read, as recently as yesterday and today that some of those who have been fanning those kinds of incitement are making atrocious calls, in effect for the abrogation of the Constitution for the sweeping away of the established order. We are told that Parliament should be dissolved and an interim government of national unity be established. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we know from practice that interim governments of national unity are talked about only in situations of serious civil strife where, actually, the central authority has broken down. That is not the case here. So, it would seem that those who are preaching that do not want to acknowledge the Constitution under which this country is still governing. They are, in effect, telling us to disregard the Constitution; to throw it overboard and go for something else. These kind of attitudes and I am talking very seriously - open defiance and disregard for the Constitution, the rule of law and established procedures, especially by very educated people, senior members of the clergy and definitely very educated people who should know the difference between a situation governed by the rule of law and a situation where there is general  breakdown of law and order, are the stuff of which potential tyrants and dictators are made. This is because the message they are giving us is that if they had the opportunity, they would not be governing according to the established rules, but that they would be departing from or dismissing those rules at whim.I think this is something which all leaders and responsiblecitizens should really reflect upon.That, really, is the message of thosecalling for the bypassing of the established constitutional procedures. Sir, we have been very lucky, as a country, in a troubled region of the world, the Continent of Africa, for in the short history of 25 years. charted civil Government, peace and stability and of Parliamentary democracy, when so many of our sister states in this Continent have fallen by the wayside and not one can be said to have been able to extricate itself from the disasters that have befallen them. The House will reflect in 1971 when the democratically elected Government of Milton Obote was overthrown in Uganda.	Ugandans took to theStreets in droves to demonstrate; they were short-sighted. We would like to tell those who are fanning incitement and seeking changes by means other than those envisaged in the Constitution, that they should bear that lesson in mind. (applause) It is important, therefore, that we safeguard what we have; and what we have isan admirable constitutional set-up, modeled on the Western Parliamentary System,on the separation of powers between the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the independence of the Judiciary means a system ofImpartial courts independent of interference of control by the Legislature and byIndividuals. The tenure we have established for those manning the courts and theterms of service we have given them are all designed to promote and ensure thatkind of impartiality. All individuals, natural and corporate, companies or naturalpersons have equal access to our courts and restrained unlimited access. What ismore, it is important for us to remember that even the Government comes down fromits pedestal when it comes to dealing with disputes between it and other citizens.The Government, too, is an equal person to the individual and corporate citizensbefore the courts. The Government can be sued like any individual and it can sue.What is more, we do know that almost on a daily basis, in one or two courts,decisions are being handed down against the Government itself in favor of aggrievedindividuals who have sought redress through the court system which the Constitutionhas guaranteed. Awards, very often heavy ones, are being given against the State.That is evident that the Government recognizes and abides by the decisions of theimpartial court systems.Likewise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Executive, too, is a separate arm ofthe Government. It administers laws only when they have been properly enactedby Parliament. This House, therefore, is the source of all laws; the source ofall legal authority within this country. The courts of law have been empowered even to censure the decisions of Parliament and the decisions of the administrative  acts of the Executive. Administrative acts in the sense that when individuals feel  aggrieved about particular administrative actions, they have access to the courts. The courts have power to censure even Acts of Parliament. For example, if an Act of Parliament passed by this House is seen to be derogatory to the fundamental      rights enshrined in the Constitution or any provision of the Constitution, the courts have the power to rule the Act as ultra virus. That has happened quite a number of times in the history of this country. There have been times when even Acts of Parliament have been struck out because the courts, which are independent and impartial, felt that the House had exceeded its powers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, the Legislature is an independent body. It is this House that is the most cherished institution in our set-up. The most important thing is that after every five years the people of this country call the shorts; in fact, sometimes in less than five years because in our Constitution it is provided that the Head of State may, at a time, call for national elections. We know from history that, in fact, the people of this country cherish that freedom as evidenced by the relatively very high turnout that we witness at our general elections. Relative, that is, to countries in our own situation and in our region. 	It is also evident from the last four or five general elections that we have had, that not only do voters turn out in high numbers but, the electorate has always handed down a casualty rate of 50 per cent or more to sitting Members of Parliament. That is definitely evidence of the peoples participation in the process and evidence of the constitutional system working. In view of all this, Sir, it is really sad that there should still be a few citizens among us, including fairly well informed people, who would wish to openly call for a disregard of such an elaborate machinery, mechanism and procedures for introducing changes or for seeking redress to grievances in societal organizations and fanning what definitely amounts to incitement against law and order. It is even more saddening that we find even clerics not all who we are told that their profession calls for preaching harmony, peace, love, tolerance and respect for Caesar by giving to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, actually calling for open disobedience and encouraging people who want t6 bring down the established order. It is not all derides who are doing this but it is quite clear that there is a clear spate in the opinion of such leaders on this matter.  	Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not want to give a lecture in history, but I think it is really unfortunate that people tend And when I was a student I was told that this is one of the main lessons of history that people tend not to learn. I would like to remind those who have bent minds that chaos and civil strifes set in society not because people positively what to have them; it is only that people clamor for certain things which, in certain sets of circumstances, Implicate them in chaos and civil strife, as Ugandans have learned, to their peril, to date. What these bishops are seeking, flouting the law and calling for bypassing of established constitutional procedure, is bound to definitely lead us to disaster. Sir, I sometimes wonder why, all of a sudden, in addition to all what I have said what people seek if not multi-party politics. I have said it before, and this is something that I believe in very firmly, that the state is the property of all groups that populate it. The problem with those African countries which have landed in disaster has been precisely that the leadership has failed to appreciate that. We are lucky that in this country, and particularly under the leadership of His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi, every community in Kenya has been brought into the main fold. I think this is something which people mustappreciate. There is no. time, in our past history, when the profile of the public	,service was more representative of all the cultural groups that populate this land than it is today. This is a fact. And there is not a point in our past history when even those marginalized communities, for historical reasons, have felt that they are a part of the whole as they are feeling now. It would seem therefore, those who want to call for a change and who, in fact, want to institute unconstitutional means, are dissatisfied about the equity which is permeating all spheres of life. If we do not accept this kind of equity, if we do not accept that somebody from Turkana District, Mars bit, Mombasa or Kisumu has equal rights in the obligations of all citizens as any other, then I am afraid that we are not really serious about constituting one nation.  	Mr. Speaker, Sir, the foundation of nationhood is the feeling that the individual at one corner of the Republic is as important as everybody else and that he has the right to hold any public office and to have access to the natural resources of the land and to have equal opportunities in employment and so on. This is a matter that we as national leaders have a special responsibility to instill into the minds of our people, otherwise, we still risk if we continue with the present sectionalism attitude. By doing this, we risk following the path that has been taken by other African countries which Have not been as fortunate as ourselves. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we support His Excellency the President because of the firm manner in which he has introduced equity into the style of his administration. My personal daily prayer is that he continues that way without wavering since he is indeed a leader. I Would like to emphasize toleaders on the value of law and order. Law and order as I said before, is like an everyday miracle and for this reason, people do not seem to appreciate it. However, when it comes down, the consequences are distrous and I think as Parliamentarians, we have a responsibility, to not only condemn lawlessness, provocation and so on, but to also go cut of our way to educate our People of the risk they run if they seek to rock the boat of law and Order.Finally, when these things happen, it is futile to try and point out to a particular community. We have to avoid this Pitfall, but there is no doubt that when these problems arise in our areas, we as leaders in those areas, we as leaders in those areas,have a responsibility to educate our constituents on how to condemn these malpractices and hooliganism. with those few remarks, I beg to second.</Newspeech>(question proposed) <Newspeech>The ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mak Anyengo):Thank you very much, Mr.Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chance to contributeto this very important Motion, which is dealing with a matter of nationalimportance. I would like first of all, to issue a word of cautionto those who seen to think that their sole responsibility is to preach chaos and disorder. I would like to tell these people that they Should think 	twice before they leap. They should remember that that is being discussed today 	in this House is a matter of national importance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, not long time ago, some people made statements under the guise of advocates for multi-party system of Government. If my memory servesme well what the	Bishop of	Maseno South stated on Sunday is moat exactly whatMatiba and Rubia stated when they called their first Press Conference. The statement in short gives the impression that they are demanding that there be anachy and chaos lawlessness. These people seem to be advocating for the law of the jungle. I am saying this because When somebody as learned as Bishop Okullu stands up in a Cathedral and demands that the Government of Kanu is scrapped. It is not bad to ask the President to dissolve Parliament, because that would be a different thing altogether since there still would he a Government to conduct the election for a new Parliament. However, when somebody stands UD and says that the Government should be ca scrapped and an interim-Government formed, and a national convention is appointed to draft another constitution, he means to say that there is complete chaos and lawlessness in this country and there is no control in this country since there is no Government. Is this thesituation in Kenya? I would like to say no and I think this is just a dream onpart of the Bishop of Maseno South. I have a lot of la respect for Bishopokullu as a Person.	I am saying this because even the	Bible itself says thatWhen somebody is annointed leader and then goes astray, no one should raise his hand against him. This is clearly shown in the However, this does not mean that Bishop  Story of David and king Soul.Okulla is right, in fact, he is totally wrong and I compare him with one of the prophets Called Prophet Barum who disobeyed god and this made his donkey to speak to him. He had gone the wrong way and was stopped by the Angel of the Lord with a burning sword and his donkey refused to move further and when he continued to beat it, it talked to him saying, "Master, do you not see a man right in front of us with a burning sword?" This Prophet was so blind that he could not see the dangerright in front of him and I Compare him to Bishop Okullu. His The masters that he is serving have made him so blind that he does not seem to know what he is talking about. For anyone to call what happened last week a rebellion is madness because there was not rebellion. What happened is that there were thugs who were prepared to loot Shops and perhaps it is because Bishop Okullu was not in Nairobi to see what was happening here, he is talking like this. If he show what was happening here in Nairobi, he would know what was really happening. He is just like the others who are asking for a new 	 convention. We struggled for Uhuru and from 1963 when the first African elected Members came to this House, they kept on negotiating with the Sri ash Government to have a constitution that we have today. Where we have felt need to change the Constitution, we have done so and therefore, if these people wanted a change in the constitution, they could have approached the President and I am sure he would have given them a hearing. Why could they not have made such an approach if they were not serving their outside masters. To make the matters worse, this 	Bishop has gone ahead to praise certain countries.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 	I am sorry for this Bishop and i am also praying for him because satan has 	gone into his mind. that Jesus told his disciples is that "Go ye into the world and preach the word of God, and convert everybody". Do you convert people to create chaos and thuggery? Jesus is known as "The Prince of Peace". Can okulla tell us that he is the Prince of Peace? Can he say that when he has such arrogant way of disrespecting the presidency, the	Institution that reflects oneness of this nation? Sometimesthey forget so soon. After only some few weeks, they Come up andsay "Oh, we shall protect the Presidency" after abusing that verypost!Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a very serious matter and we		should not take this churchman lightly.	I am a Christian myself is family. My family believers in Christianity.	I have kids that I would like to grow upand enjoy the fruits of this country.But because some people have been fed with outside money, I think, it is high time some of these churchman were asked to declare	their wealthbecause I understand that some of them own financialinstitutions. It is high time they were asked to tell us where 	they got this money because the money we give them is not enough.where do they get the rest of the money? With those few remarks, Sir, I beg to support.</Newspeech> W  <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT(Mr. Keen):Mr.Speaker, Sir, I would like to second the Motion, but beforedoing so, I would like hon. Members to go back and look at the history of Africa for the last 25 years.	The history of Africa has been  Pretty and ugly for the last 25 years.For the past 25 years, there have been several political upheavals in this continent of ours. More than 5 million Africans  Have pershed or killed either by their own government or killed in course of internal steves more than 5 million refugees. I think Africa todayHas the highest number of refugees in the world are seattered all over the world due to problems that have been created by us in Africa. Then we cannot compare the number of Africans killed by their own governments compared with the number of Africans killed by combined colonial powers over the last 70 years. Even if we were to take into consideration the killings of the Hotentots of the South west Africa the Red Rubber Plantations of the Congo and the Vita ya Maji Maji in Tanzania we would have that Africa has suffered a lot overThe Last 25 years. This is the situation some people want to create in this country today, and it is something we are not going to accept atall under any circumstances. It is very fortunate, Mr. Speaker, Sir that out of the 5 million refugees we do not have any from this country, apart from thoseWho have decided to run away on their own accord. Throughout our history for the last 27 years, no Kenyan has been killed either by the Kenya government or by the loyal people. We have lived here as one nation for the last 27 years. We do not went this unity tranquility and progress that we have achiened over the last 27 years to be destroyed by a bunch of self seekers. This is something that we are not going to accept under any circumstances. The Kenya Government has been more or less tried over the last 20 years. We had an attempted coup in 1971 to overthrow the legally constituted Government of Kenya that failed. We had another one in 1982 which was somehow sponsored by the Kenya Air Force fellowsand that equally failed. This one was not simple riot. People may say it was a simple stonning of cars, burning of buses and so on. But it was a full-scale rebellion which must also be treated on the same footing.   Mr. Speaker sir, the Kenya Government and the people of Kenya have established good realations with foreign countries for the last 27 years. It is not our intention to break those realations with our friendly nations. But one thing that we are not going to agree with is to be dictated to wither by the North Pole or by the South Pole! We have our own situations. We are master of our own country and we are not going to be a pppet of anybody. We are not going to break off our relations just because of cowardly running away lawyers. We would like to maintain and continue to maintain and establish the best possible relations with our western friends as before. But we are not going to allow to be dictated to by anybody. We are our own masters.We are in our own country and we are not going to accept that. Secondly, it must also be understand that President Moi is not for sale. He is not either for trading in. There is no amount of dollars or pounds that will make us abandon President Moi. This is because we believe that President Moi has brought about the kind of unity that this nation so desires. He has also brought progress, peace and stability with regard to those who want us to change, what kind of change are they advocating? Will it be possible over night to get jobs, have money amd so on just because there has been a change of faces? I think we have to consider seriously what these gentleman were up to. Mr. Speaker, sir, I have always said that we will not compromise With security in this country because it is paramount to everything else. And it does not matter who, however big he maybe because we shall deal with him according to the law.   	 We have sometimes taken into account some historical facts. All Kenyans haverejected all forms of colonialism and foreign powers right from the beginning. Had it not been for the presence of the Maasai people, all of you would have been carried into slavery in the last Century. I say this because a journalist wrote the other day and described people from Kajiado and Narok as marginal people who not matter a hoot. He fails to understand that we held his forefathers toransom for 400 years.	Amesahau kabisa vile tulivyowafanyia miaka mingine. I donot want to go to that extent, but it is bitter if somebody would describe us, just because of numerical numbers, as people who do not matter a hoot in this country. We are the sons of this country and we will livd here. We take into consideration pieces of history. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 1895 the Maasai people killed a caravan of 900 in Rift ValleY Province. In	1904-1980, there was the Nandi War which more or lessbrought the railway work to a standstill. In	1922 we had Harry Thuku and in 1929the people of Central Province objected to foreign coulture - the circumcision ofwomen and we had the Mau Mau issue too. All these forces combined, they are forceswhich objected to colonialism. So, nobody should today say that they are the onlyones who brought certain issues here. we are all here in this country and we willhave to live here, and the only way we can live here is by working peacefully. A house divided can never stand. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said, this was not throwing stones; it was a highly orchestrated and organised situation to overthrow the legally constituted Government of this Republic. A cabinet has already been formed; a constitution drawn up.	Anybody who imagines that</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS:	Toboa!

I may  ,  say here that the Kenya Government is extremely lenient because, elsewhere, people who plot to or imagine the overthrow of a legally constituted government are normally summarily executed by firing squad.	What we have don here--	We have just placedthem in safe custody so that the public can be protected from their mischieveousdeeds and, maybe, when they reform they will be back to their wives. We saw inSudan 90 people being executed in Sudan. That has happened in many other Africancountries, but we have not executed anybody here and it is not our intention to do so. 	If one goes beyond reason, then, of course, he will be dealt with. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Kenya Police for what they have done during the past three days during this situat-ion.

But as I said, investigations are being carried out and will continue and no stone will be left unturned to stem out this evil situation. I think it is also inthe interest of this nation Oh! I have forgotten onenotable name. Under the Presidential Press Secretary, we haveGeorge Mbugguss. As I said, all these are doomed to fail. It faileIn 1971 and in 1982.	This one will equally fail. The name of the President has not been mentioned and Iwill leave it to the wise judgement of this House to tell who would have taken that seat.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>AN HON.

I am surprised tohear my name being mentioned because I do not know any of thosepeople.	I think this could be something which has been put onme politically. I would like to assure this House that I have noconnection with such things and I know nothing about it.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>AN HON. MMBER: Condemn them.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR.

SPEAKER: Order!	Mr. Kitele, your views have beenheard.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT	(Mr. Keen):On a point of order, Sir. I skipped the name of the Minister forSupplies and that is Emmanuel Karisa Maitha.The Minister forEnvironment and Natural Resources was to be Ahmed Ogle.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Ogle): Jambo la nidhamu, Bev. Soika. Jina langu ni Noor Abdi Ogle na si Ahmed Ogle.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS 	(Mr. Kamotho): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank uu you for giving me this oonortunity to also give my views on the current Motion in the House. We have read and heard a lot of things. In addition we have heard about the pseudo cabinet of the crooks who have been 	 undermining the authority of this country and that of the democracticall: elected Government of President Moi. I would like to join my colleagues in this House in calling upon tps those who have been undermining this country, the Government, the President and the Party. I would like to call upon our good Government to takeany appropriate action against all those who are concerned including their godfathers. Last week, we had a Motion in this House where we restrained ourselves from involving any foreign country in what is going on in this country. Those who listened to BBC news this morning heardvery shocking new. I did not listen but those who did heard one of the foreign diplomats in this country being.mentioned by name. He was more or less using the same language as that one Used by Bishop Okullu in yesterdays newspapers. I think it is time our good Government Put enough diplomatic pressure	and ask for the withdrawal of that diplomat from thiscountry.	That is not tantamount to severing our diplomaticrelations with that country. But we, as Kenyans, are disatisfiedwith that man. Therefore, it is only good and fair that such a man should terminate his services as a diplomat in this country.</Newspeech>  																		<Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER:	Name him.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS 	(Mr. Kamotho): I do not have to name him because we all know him and have read about him in the Press. I do not fear naming him. He is the	Ambassador of the United States of America. He has demonstratedbeyond any doubt that he is not a dillomat. The man is journalistwho spends his time loitering around Nairobi and eating meat in	Nariokor and Mathare. As	a man who represents a country ofsuch standing in world politics, it is only fair that theGovernment withdraws him and gives us another person. I do notwant to say more on that.On Bishop	Okullu, I would like to say that he has provedbeyond any doubt that he has no respect to this nation.  	He is a traitor because a man who calls for the resignation of a popularlyelected Government of the Republic of Kenya shows beyond any doubt that he isunpatriotic. As we have always said, it is wrong for any church man to use,thepulpit to "vomit" the kind of language that Bishop Okullu "vomitted" yesterday.We have heard here that Bishop Okullu is one of those who have beenappointed by the traitors of this country who form the Mwakenya movement ontheir cabinet.	What the bishop said yesterday was very much in support of thehooliganism and vandalism that we witnessed a week ago.	Therefore, the Churchof the Province of Kenya should be asked by this House to disciline Bishop Okullu;otherwise, he should resign his post and join politics.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Kamotho.	Let me refer you, hon. Members,to Standing Order No.73	(1) and kindly request you to take note of the contentsof this Standing Order. It says:-"Neither the personal conduct of the President, nor any conduct of Mr. Speaker or of any judge, nor the judicial conduct of any other person performing judicial functions, nor any conduct of the ruler or the government or the representative in Kenya of anyfriendly country shall be referred to adversely except  upon a specific substantive Motion moved for thatpurpose."</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Kamotho):	Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.. We will respect that Standing Order.Going back to what I was saying, we have, in recent weeks</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WABUGE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.	While I am notdisputing your ruling nor arguing about Standing Order No. 73, my owninterpretation and opinion is that if a country treats Kenya nicely and in afriendly manner, this Parliament cannot go out of its way to say anythingagainst the country or its representative. However, in view of the fact thatthe behaviour of a country, whose representative is in Kenya, is not good, canwe keep quiet and continue to listen to this representative debasing the nameof this country just because of this Standing Order?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Our Standing Orders are very clear.	I quoted the  fact that if you want to discuss such a representative, you have to raise a substantive Motion.	At the moment, we are discussing a completely differentMotion.</Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY(Mr. Biwott): On a point of order, Mr.Speaker, Sir. I think the hon. House should stick to its Standing Orders.Today, we are dealing with a substantive Motion relating to the chaos, confusion and diversion that detractors of Kenya have been brought about in order to mislead Kenyans into believing that Kenyans want a multi-party system when, in fact, they are perpetuating a coup. We have already heard the namesof those who will form the new cabinet. So, let us not move away from thatfocal point. Instead, let us focus on the real issue that was moved by hon.Dr. Godana and avoid dragging in direct the name concerned. We know thatKenyans are completely disgusted by those who have shown themselves up. If wewant to mention the names involved, we will have to move another substantive Motion dealing with that subject. For the time being, I think we had better concentrate on the Motion as has been moved.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We maytable a Motion to discuss a certain embassy in the Republic. However, indebating the present Motion, we might just mention a few things here and there in passing without making the embassy involved a subject matter in whatever we say. Instead of discussing the embassy in detail, we can just pass over it, because I think the Standing Orders will not forbid us to--</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER:Order, Mr. Mwamzandi.	You can only pass over the-Motion before the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Kamotho):Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in recent days, we have heard a lot about the plansof, our detractors. We are all aware that some of, us were victims of thisparticular situation, being told that we have been selling out Kikuyu. I donot know whether there is any market where Kikuyus are sold at all. If thereis any such market, I call upon those people to take Kikuyus and sell them to  make money. It is very wrong to allow this kind of loose talk in the country.When we went upcountry over the weekend, we heard of some people saying thatthey will be appointed to positions such as district officer, districtcommissioner, and so on in the country when their fake government comes topower. As hon. Biwott said, the purpose of the recent chaos was not to createa multi-party system but to take over the Government of this country by thosecrooks. In the last three months, there has been too much circulation ofMwakenya papers, which have been sent to every household in this country. Theevents which occurred in the last one week were more or less directed by thosecrooks through Mwakenya papers. As Kanu said, which is what this House is alsosaying, all those who have not been picked up should be brought to book so thateverybody may know that the Government of this country, under President Moi, isfully in control.Wananchi in the country, particularly in Central Province, aretotally behind President Mois Government and the Party.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY(Mr. Biwott):	Thank you very much, Mr.Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this debate.	Iwould like to plead with the House to consider this Motion as very seriousbecause it touches on a security matter. This is a grave security matter, andnot a laughing matter. This matter deals with people who have committedthemselves and sworn to undermine our Government. As we have been told, theywant to overthrow the Government and form theirs. Therefore, the issue hereis to focus the matter where it belongs without being detracted into believingthat all that is wanted is a multi-party system.The Press has played a big role in propagating multi-partyism,referring to every incident as being perpetuated by multi-party opponents.I think we 	should say it loudly in this House that those who have been disturbing this country are not multi party proponents but	are criminals and tribalists who are bent on destroying our Government by violent means.	These	people have	only chosen to hide	behind multi-partyism,the	church,	rumour-mongering	and accusing individuals	1ike hon.Mwerje and hon.	Kamotho of being traitors.	We should come	out 	and condemn unreservedly those who	are	bent on destroying the security and peace  in this country.	In the same token we should condemn all the external forceswho have been supporting our enemies.	we will not name these external forces because we have agreed not todo so. We must however say they are representatives 	of friendly countries who are betraying the trust Put in them by working behind us to undermine	our country.While we should not spare them, we should respect the rulingOf Mr.	Speaker and our Standing Orders.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I	say this is a bunch of criminals	andNot of multi-party proponents, first of all because	of their language.They have called for dissolution of the	elected Government of thisCountry Parliament	and	abolition of Kamu so that the Country can go back to the colonial status where we will need a convention todecide	the	form of government	the	country shall have. These peopleare	not only agents of colonialism but are practising puppets of colonialism. They are people who have never actually shed the colonial mentality; they will only listen to outsiders. It is thus no wonder that archbishem Kuria said in one of his statement that the Church of the Province of Kenya is not a state. Indeed, he was right because CPM is only a Provincial church of a foreign country it is a provincial church of this country. In this case there is not state church in this country because we treat all churches equally. when we believe their legitimacy to be theaunthentic channel through which we communicate with God, be itIslam, or CPK for that matter, or Catholicism we accept all of them to beEqual and we have enshrined them in our Consitution. So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the aim of this House and our journalists -if they are nationalists like us; if they are committed to the welfare, security and integrity of this country must be to Point out that we are not dealing with people who for agitating for multi-parties but	we, are dealing with people who for a long time have been wanting to overthrow this Government. These people tried to overthrow the Government and failed in 1964, 1971, 1982 and recently. Now it time for Kenyans to be alert; it is high time when	every Kenyans protected this country from these revolution  minded people, or from outside perpetrators.	Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is strange for Bishop okullu to call for the removal of this government which was elected by thepeople while he himself was elected by a group of churchmen whorepresented a small diocese. He had the audacity to say that because there is somebody he is counting on - he could not do it on his own.	I think we better warn those who are supporting these people that we are doing injustice to this country; that they will be blamed for all the blood that will be shed in this country. This is because the things they are	 preaching could destroy this country. It is only after a coup delay you hear of thesuspension of the Constitution, the dissolution of Parliament and setting up of a provisional government; yet we are being asked to take all these measures. We now know who these people are,why they have been struggling the way they have been doing and why they have abandoned Preaching the word of God and started preaching rebellion like what Bishop Okullu Preached the other day: All that he preached had nothing Godly; it was not a sermon from the 	Bible but something Preached in an illegal political meeting to destroy this Country. T hi s is what Kenyans should take note of. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Problems Bishop OKullu talked about	 have been known for a long time. This is why our President has committees and commissions to look into_ways and means of providing employment. Why have these people - if they are genuine in their complaints 	- not come out with solutions. If there ar e Potholes in our roads, as Bishop Okullu says, why does he not repair then. we have been told many times how good non-governmental organisations, of which Bishop Okullu is a member, are. So, why does he not go and repair those roads, or tell us exactly how the repairing should be done because that is what a genuine Person will do. Actually, these people have not-been looking for solutions tothese problems, but haveben inciting wananchi cause of rebellion.Thank God that Kenyans believe in President Moi, love him dearly and will die with him. It is, therefore, senseless for any Government,or any representative of a friendly country in this country, to imagine that a tiny Minority can represent a tribe and can overthrow this Government and rule this country; that is sheer fartasy and thesooner they learn that the better; the sooner also Kenyans understand that there are enemies who are co-operating with outsiders the soonerthey will be prepared to counteract by all any tendency to that effect.I think we should confirm in this House that we are to defend our Constitution, territorial integrity what we have andnot to succumb to any amount of money. We have been told that if wedo not behave we will not be given money. But we are not Children. It is only a child that you tell, "If you do not behave I will not buy a shirt". We said from the beginning that Kenya is a sovereign state; that Kenya is equal to any other state and our Parliament is equal to any other Parliament, including the Congress, in terms of jurisdiction.   We have our Constitution, just as they have theirs. Any other parliament in the world is equal to ours and, therefore, we will only accept assistance and aid that is given without strings. However, any aid that is given with strings or as an inducement to do evil, or even destroy our own country, will not be accepted by Kenyans. That is not the kind of aid we want. With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Nabwera): Thank you for giving me this opportunity to say a few words on the Motion before us. I would just like to underscore the fact that the Government of this country is fully in charge and that even those who have tried to organise and form diffferent governments should know that the Government knows all that is happening.	The hon. John Keen, on behalf of the Government, gave some information to the House.	I want to assure the House that that list is not exhaustive.The Government is continuing with its investigations and the people who are found to have flouted the law are going to be punished. Nobody is above the law, except His Excellency the President, and whether we are outsiders, traders and whatever we are, or chuchmen for that matter, the Government will deal with such individuals very firmly. This is why I would like to congratulate the hon. Members from Nyanza Province. I think we are trying to make Bishop Okullu a lion that he is not. When an individual starts by saying, "if they want to detain me, let them do so", we should tell Bishop Okullu that this Government can detain him today, if that decision is made.	So, he should not behave as if being a bishop is so unique that he can say anything he likes.	I would like to take this opportunity to join my hon. colleagues from Nyanza in warning Bishop Okullu.	Speaking from this august House, let me tell Bishop Okullu that action will be taken against any Kenyan, including him, if he continues to subvert the system of Government here. Sir, I think what Bishop Okullu says shows us the forces that have been at work against this Government. Let me, in the same breathe, say that all friendly countries with embassies in Nairobi should continue to respect this Government, and that the Kenyan Government will not allow any embassy, big or small, however powerful, to try and subvert the Republic of Kenya and its institutions. (applause) We know that these riots, thuggery and looting was supposed to be a prelude to changing our Government. I want to thank the residents of Limuru who helped the police when some of these thugs were trying to burn a bus that was carrying innocent passengers. I want to appeal to all Kenyans to imitate the residents of Limuru area.	Our Constitution talks about the sanctity of life and property rights. 	So, every Kenyan, so that we may end this hooliganism once and for all and so that we can dissuade those who are dreaming of becoming this or that in their "Government" we should stand together and defeat them. From the list of names read out by hon. John Keen, you can note that the "Office of the President" has no candidate. I invite hon. Members of this House to try and guess who may have been preparing to fill in that post. We have seen that all the proposed offices, starting with a "Prime Minister" have been filled in, apart from that of the "President", which is conveniently missing.	We know about that, and we are looking into that.	I am sure the Government will soon catch up with whoever is the candidate for that "Presidency" and the country will be told in due course.Let me say that we, in the country, have three institutions that wemust try to safeguard as a nation. As the Mover of this Motion stated, we havethe Parliament of Kenya as the sovereign institution and is supreme. We alsohave the Judiciary which, in all matters of law, has to make sure that justice is metted out. Lastly, we have the Executive, headed by our beloved Presidentwhose work is to implement the laws and to make sure that the country is administered fully. Sir, it is the question of the Presidency that has been the subject of remarks from some of our clergymen. I would not like to condemn the clergy wholesale, and not even the clergy in the Church of the Province of Kenya. The clergy of the CPK in Siaya, Western Province and the Coast Province have not been involved in this unbecoming behaviour. We should direct our remarks to the clergymen in the CPK who have taken it upon themselves to behave as if they are an alternative "Government." They can never be and they are subject to the laws of this country. I know that they would like to see themselves treated as martyrs. Those of us who know Bishop Okullu and his friends understand very well that they cannot be martyrs; they are subject to the ordinary problems that face ordinary citizens in this country. 	So, being ordinary human beings, let them behave like the rest of us, knowing that there is a Government that must be respected. Finally, I would like to appeal to my friends that we conduct the debate on this Motion in the spirit within which the Motion, itself, was moved so that this House can go out united and all of us, as hon. Members of Parliament, and the people we represent, can remain united and help in the running of this country. With those few remarks, Sir, I beg to support.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CO-OPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT(Mr. Karume):AhsantEsana, Bw. Spika, kwa kunipatia nafasi hii. Kuna wakati wa mchdzo na.wakati usiowa mchdzo. Hawa watu wamdenda zaidi; wamtudharau, wamdidharau nchi yew, watotowetu na Sdrikali yetu. Nikiangalia, hii ni kama vile mtu anawdza kuja katika nyuMba yako na kukwambia, ""Ondoka nataka kulala hapa leo"". Hivyo, utakufia hapo; huwezikuondoka.Watu kwenda kuandika majina na kusema kwamba wako na Sdrikali ni kupangaSdrikali nyingind ile hali tuna Serikali ya maana sana inayoongozwa na Mtukuru Rais Danidle arap Moi, ambayo imdtufanyia kila kitu. Serikali ya Rais Moi imdwasaidiawatoto wote na imdangalia kila kona ya nchi hii. Hakuna kdna ya nchi hii MtukufuRais hadndi. Ansema kwamba hataki ukabila na anaonydsha hivyo kwa vitendo. Kwa hivyo, ni vibaya sana watu kufikiria kuwa na Sdrikali nyingind.  Bw. Spika, wakati mambo ya kuwa na vyama viwili au vingi vya siasa, wengi wetu tulisimama na tukasdma haifai. Wakati wa kuwa na vyama vingi vya siasahaujafika bado; hatuna nafasi ya vyama vingi kwa sababu watu watauana. Ni hivimajuzi tuambapo tulijionda kwa macho. Kwa mfano, huko kwdtu Kiambu vijana walijaakatika kituo cha biashara bila kuwa na mawazo mabaya hata kidogo wakati wa asubuhi. Ilipofika saa saba hivi, tunasikia waliletewa changaa na bangi na walipokunywa na kuvuta wakaanza kupigana. Hawa watu wanataka Serikali ya aina hiyo. Jd, hiyoni Serikali ya kuongoza nani? Ukiangalia majina tuliyosomdwa hapa, wengi wa watuhawa walipewa kazi kubwa kubwa wakati wakati wa Hayati Mzee Jomo Kenyatta na hatawakati wa Mtukufu Rais Moi na wakashindwa kuitekeldza. Wamdjaribiwa katikaSerikali hii na wamdshindwa. Hata wamejaribu wakiwa ndani ya Serikali ili waendewakaunde serikali yao. wataunda serikali waongoze nani? Wananchi wa Kdnyahawawdzi kukubali hata kidogo. Tumetoshdka na Sdrikali yetu na uongdzi tulio naohapa wa Mtukufu Rais unatutosha. Wananchi wotd hawataki serikali nyingine na hatahawataki vyama vingine vya siasa. Bw. Spika, kwa vile tumeona majina yaliyopangwa yako namna gani, huu ni wakati wetu, tukiwa Wand. Wabungd, wa kuwa pamoja kabisa na kumsaidia Mtukufu Rais pamoja na Serikali na nchi yetu iii watoto waendeled. Tangu mambo ya vyamaviwili au vingi vya siasa, mipango ya maenddldo ya Kenya imeenda chini. Hatufanyi Harambee na kazi haifanyiki, na hivyo ndivyo walivyokuwa waicitafuta. Kwa hivyo, mimi nasimama hapa kuwalaani na kuilaani serikali yao. Serikali ya kunyang!anya watu mali inakuja kutusaidia namna gani? Hata kama mtu ni wa kanisa, yafaa ajue kwamba yeY6 ni mtu binafsi na kama anaharibu mambo, akirukiwa tusiambiwd kwamba tunaharibu makanisa.Wdngind wetu tutamwona Mungu mbeld ya hao watu wanaoitwawa makanisa. Hakuna mtu anaydjua. Kwa hivyo, hata ikiwa mtu anaongoza kanisa,tunataka kuona vitehdo vyakd vizuri. Mtu anatwambia Bun& livunjwd na Sdrikaliya Kanu iondokd ndipo tuachwe na serikali gani? Hatutaki Sdrikali nyingind. Tangutulipompiga Mzungu akaondoka hapa na tUkajitawala, hatujataka kuwa na serikali nyingind bali na ya Kanu ambayo tumeona mdngi iliyofanya. Kwa hivyo, ijulikane wazi kabisa kwamba hatutaki kuwa na serikali nyingind na hatuwezi kuiunga mkono. Bw. Spika, hata ikiwa ni ndugu yangu au bibi yangu anayesdma kwamba anataka kuleta serikali nyingind, nitamwambia adnde peke yakd kwa sababu ninajua ni taabu gani inayowdza kupatikana. Je, tunataka serikali nyingind tupate kitugani? Kitu tunachotaka ni umoja tulio nao. Kama ilivyotajwa na mwdnyd kuiwasilishaHoja hii, tumeona serikali nyingi karibu kwdtuhapa. Watu hao walifikiri ni mchezo.Lakini sasa, baada ya kuona vile tulivyoenddlda, wanajaribu kurudisha serikali yao kwa barabara. Lakini yafaa watambud kwamba gari la moshi likitoka kwa relikurudi si kitu rahisi. Serikali ikiharibika kuirekebisha ni mambo mdngine. Watuwanaovunja maduka na kupiga magari maw bila hata kufikiria linawdza kuwa limeMbebamkwd ni watu wa aina gani? Hata mimi nakubali kwamba wale waliofanya mambo hayayotd ni wakora. Ni watu ambao wanafanya kazi ya wizi usiku ambao walitumiwa nawald waliowatumia iii wapige watu na kuwanyanganya mali. Yafaa wajud kwambaMungu anaipenda Kehya kwa sababu sisi hatuna matata. Sijui ni sababu gani watufulani wa nchi za nje wanatuingilia, ild half sisi hatujaingilia nchi hata moja; hata hatutaji kijua vild wanavyolala au vild wanavyodnddsha nchi zao. Yafaa tuachwe. tufanyd vile tunavyotaka na nchi ydtu. Sisi ndio tunaojua uzuri na ubaya kwetu. Bw. Spika, ni lazima tudlewd kwamba hawa wagdni ndio watafanya mambo mdngi sana ya kutugawanya kwa sababu wanajua njia ya divide and rule, iliyokuwa lkitumiwa na wabebdru. Ni lazima tuchungd sana kusijd kukatupwa kitu kati yetu   halafu tuanze kukosana. Mtu akifanya makosa, hata kama anatoka katika kabila lako au katika ukoo wako, ni lazima ujue kwamba yeye ni adui wako kwa sababu hajui uta-fanywa namna gani vitu vikitokea. Kwa hivyo, ni lazima tuamue kuilinda Serikaliydtu. Sasa tuanze vita na hawa watu waliotuingilia bila kuwaheshimu. Tumechaguliwana wananchi na kutuleta katika Bunge hili na hao watu wengine wanataka-kuleta serikali nyingie ambayo haijachaguliwa na wananchi. Hata wengine wao wamekataliwa na wananchi, na hakuna kitu kingind wanachotaka isipokuwa kuwadharau wananchi. Wanataka kufanya mambo yao kwa nguvu, na katika Kenya hatuna nafasi ya mtu anaye-taka kufanya mambo kwa nguvu. Hivyci ndiyo sababu tulipigana na wabeb4ru kwa vilewalitaka kututawala kwa nguvu. Ni juu ydtu kuulinda uchumi wetu na kuyaangaliamambo yetu kwa njia nzuri, na hiyo ndiyo sababu tumeendelda. Hakuna watu wengineambao wana shule nyingi kutushinda; zile tumejenga kwa njia ya Harambed na zild tulizojengewa na Serikali. Bw. Spika, letuni kumwombea Mtukufu Rais awe na nguvu na aendeled na he ima aliyo nayo ya kutuongoza hapa. Yule anayekudanganya vingine, basi ujud kwamba ni adui wako. Tangu tujitawale, sijashangaa kama leo. Mwaka wa 1971 watufulani walijaribu kupindua Serikali na wengine wakarudia kitendo hicho mwaka wa1982, lakini hatukuletewa orodha ya serikali mpya. Je, hiyo serikali inakujakutawala nani? Hatutakufa na hatutakubali. To engine kama sisi, hata ikifanyikanini, hatutakuwa wakimbizi. Afadhali kufa na kuzikwa hapa Kenya kuliko kuwawakimbizi katika nchi nyingine. Hayo mambo ndiyo tunayotafutiwa na ndiyo tunayo-kataa, na tutayakataa milele. Hatuwezi kukubali mambo hayo hata kidogo. Hatawananchi wengine warneanza kulegea toka wiki iliyopita. Wananchi wanajiuliza kamaserikali waliyokuwa wakiletewa ni hiyo ya kupiga watu kwa mawe. Hata isipokuwaSerikali yetu ni nzuri, watu wengine wangdfutwa kazi. Wakati matatu na basiwalipokataa kubeba watu, walikuwa wawnaogopa kupigwa mawe na watu wengi sana wangepotdza kazi katika Serikali kwa sababu hakunmtu angetembea kutoka kwake. hivyo, wananchi waliona mambo hayo na wanajiuliza watawezaji kukubali serikaliya aina hiyo. kuota ndotoo Tungetaka watu hawa wafahamu wazi kwamba wanacheza na moto na tungetaka kuwashaur iafanye kazi ya kuwasomesha za watoto wao na kuja u kuishi kwa wa niaMba ya watu wa Kiambaa aMbao ninawakilisha katika unge hili,ningetaka kusema kwamba tunawalaPri vikali hawa watu wanaosema juu ya kuanzishwa kwa Serikali nyingine.SisM hatutaki kusikia maneno ya serikali nyineine kwasababu tayari qerikali yetu ya Kanu ambayo inacngozwa na xxickx kioneozi wa maana sana ambaye anamfLkiria kila mtu. Yeye ni kiongozi aMbaye anawahurumia wananchi na mwenye kuwapenda watoto sana na kwa hivyo, sisi hati.na haja ya kuwa na kiongozi mwineine. Wakati hayati Mzee Jcmo Kenyatta alimchagua w.

This is the list we got this    afternoon and we do not need anything more. It has been very clearly declared here that these are traitors. What remains therefore, now is to move positively against this bunch of traitors.    Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to that on the name of the of the list we can see who are the next one of in order of merit. The time has come to move and clean and clear our hours. Mr. Speaker, Sir we know that what from has happened over the last few days, the destruction of the government was the purpose and still remains so. What do we do? Do we stay here debating all the time? No! We must take some action. Right now, we have been asked by a self appointed leader of this country called, okullu that all hon. Members here were not electrd by people. We do not represent anybody and we have been asked to wind up. But I must ask in this house whether there is anyone who really wants to wind up parliament so that okullu may take over that is nonsense. If okullu has not read history, he can hear about it. You fight Parliament, but you will never win a war against Parliament. This has never happened in the history of parliament and this parliament will not be the first one and okullu has already lost the battle. The Only thing that remains for him is to go somewhere. This is because okullu belongs to that group of people which has extended into some hidden corners. His group is extendent. They are in the group of the Dodo that is dead. Mr. Speaker Sir nobody in this country has the power to dissolve parliaments and the constitution says so. It is noly the president who can dissolve Parliament. So he just stands up and saying that he wants to dissolve Parliament and calling himself he does not even call himself a Kenyan and Anglican. So, with regard to this Angelican who is not a Kenyan wants to dissolve Parliaments we can only say that he is singing his Angelican masters voice. He has been sent to do that. I will not hesitate to say that word reduces his initials to “H.A.M.V”.This character should be eliminated. We should not have him around to cause trouble. He has to go. Now we know very well that characters like this one cannot be standing amidst us on their own. Since they are abviously supported by some outside powers, we should tackle those outside powers as well. It is not just enough to say that we clear this rubbish because if during the time there was the hoolinganism in Nairobi people were seen in diplomatic car number plates  dishing out money. That conduct is so undiplomatio that we cannot be inhibited in tracing those kind of friends. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the people who were doing that were doing so on the understanding that they are very good friends of Kenya. If you have such a friend who wants you to behind so that he can you from the back do you really need such a friend? Do you really need enemies when you have a friend like that one? We cannot be held back. We must say to that ambassador should withdrawn because he is doing more harm than good to the relationship between Kenya and his country. So, why leave him here? The people of Kenya will not accept that. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this country holds elections. During the elections we elect President Moi. Now, if these gentleman wants to challenge the president, as they are trying to do, let  Then wait for the 1993 elections and see how many votes they will get. Most of them will only see their dogs and chickens following them, but they will not get any votes.How can we be here believing and thinking that these kind of characters can alsoRun the country if they are already committing crimes even before, they have had the opportunity to run the country? This can only create chaos in Kenya and if we do allow that we shall be loomed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, all of us have been elected into this House to run the Government, and the Head of State has also been elected to head that Government.He has also appointed his minister and all the other people to support him. The cowards that think they can take over the leadership by force must be warmed now that we here to govern ourselves democratically and firmly. There is no one who is going to give in to any one of those characters who think that they too can destroy the country. If they can, how come that they are already threatening us in advance?We are behind the president; we support him and, in fact, we tell him he does not have to bother. We are here ready to crash the characters in advance. When the President gives on order they will not be seen anymore. We are behind the Government and so we stand. Mr. Speaker, Sir we know very well that the organaisation of all these characters is not only in Nairobi. The list has now been read but the agents of these characters organized by foreigners are all over the world. They are in different places. They want to come and help on a specified date to cause disturbance. They tried to do that and most of them found that the firepower was too much. They found out that the biggest power we have the unity of Kenyans, that they did not move us even one inch. This is our biggest weapon. Kenyans are united, be they Emos, Mamba, nandi and so on. We are spealing with one voice.  With those few remarks, Sir, I beg to support.</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION:Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity. First of all, I would like to thank the Deputy Leader of Government Business for defining the purpose of our debate this afternoon; namely, that we are trying to say very emphatically that in the last few weeks there has been an attempt to undermine and, if possible, to overthrow, the legally-elected Government of the Republic of Kenya. That is the simple fact which nobody should confuse with any political debate. Let me start off by assuring my hon. colleagues that as far as the foreign affairs of this nation are concerned, our relations with foreign governments represented here in Nairobi, and even those which are not represented here, are first-class. This is because our foreign policy is based on one simple fact - and this is the foreign policy of His Excellency the President simply peace. We have the desire to have peace in this nation, in our neighbourhood and through-out the world. We also desire to have non-interference with any other nation onearth.I had the privilege last week to represent His Excellency the Presidentat the Summit Meeting of the Organisation of African Unitys Heads of States andGovernments. I found a desire, love and respect that all those heads of stateshave for His Excellency President Moi. What is mate important is that you shouldhave such an amount of respect for His Excellency the President and leader of this nation. We have confidence, respect and love for our leader and so do otherleaders in this African Continent. Those governments that are represented inthis country are represented for the simple reason that they recognise the legally elected Government of Kenya under the leadership of President Daniel crap Moi; it is as simple as that. However, Sir, as I have always said before, and would want to repeat it here, in every community, whether it is a community of diplomats, churchmen or anybody else, there are rogue elephants. You find rogue elephants in everycommunity.	Let me say this. In our relations with all the governments that are represented in this country, we have no complaints and you will hear from His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance, who has to deal with these governments at a most critical level; namely, that of economic co-operation. He will tell you, as he has told you before, that all governments are dealing with us, in Kenya, on the basis of respect; on the basis of recognition of our system and on the basis that we have a strong and loved leader. There have been some careless statements by some people overseas, and even here, that Kenya might not receive some aid or grants because we do not have this, or the other. All our relationships with all governments arebusiness. We are in business with all governments that are represented here.(applause) You do not have to fall in love with anybody to do business; you will do it if it is good business and it is good sense to do business with Kenya and every government knows that. We do not have to kneel down to anybody to do business with them, because we have a stable Government; a peaceful and lovely country, and above all, a most educated work-force. That kind of country willdo business with anybody in the world. So, we do not have to fall in love withanybody so as to do business with them. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not think hon. Members should be cheated that there is anybody who is going to withdraw any help, grant or business from us because we are not doing this, or that. 	First of all, we will never tolerate that; we will never accept dictatorship from one person or another. We will never accept that our President, Daniel arap Moi, can be dictated to, because that has never happened before and I do not think it is going to start. He is too much of an experienced leader to start "selling" the interests of this country for any rupees, dollars or for anything. I know that for a fact, and I am sure, all hon. Members do, too. (applause)  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wanted to assure hon. Members that as far as our relations with other countries in the world are concerned, we are on sound footing and we have friends. Hon. Members have mentioned cases here and therewhere rogue elephants may have misbehaved by talking here and there. I onlysay, as I have done before, that we will have these people in our society, but I want to make this statement, which is so obvious to all the diplomats who are accredited to Kenya. They are accredited to Kenya because of the fact that theyrecognisi and respect the Government of Kenya. This is so elemental it shouldnot be said, but I am saying it because there have been cases where, because of bad manners and lack of integrity and sheer roguishness, that point has been ignored in one or two cases. As a Kenyan who has, for the time being, beenentrusted by His Excellency the President to run the Ministry of ForeignAffairs and International Co-Operation, I want to assure all ambassadors and high commissioners in this country that we will give them maximum co-operation to this extent only; that they, in turn, give us maximum co-operation. (applause) That is the civil contract that we have with them and it is the basis on which governments operate and do business with each other. We must never allow - and I want to plead with all hon. Members here - any impression to be created that we are worried about anything; we are not worried. There is no crisis between us and anybody, because we are confident of our insti-tutions; we are confident of our Party, our Government and our own people. (applause) There is no reason on earth why we should panic. 	However, let us send a word, clear and sound, that this nation is not about to give up any of its institutions because of pressure from outside; never. If we have to change anything in Kanu, or in our Government, we will do it from this House and from the institutions of the Party. We will never do it from any otherforum or capital in the world. I know that and I am sure other hon. Members would want to do it in that same manner. On this subject, let me pay tribute to our ambassadors and high commissioners, particulaly as hon. Members may have heard our London High Commissioner and all our other ambassadors behaving with utmost nationalism; they have faced a storm, wherever it has occurred and have answered back liketrue Kenyans and given the facts. We will continue to do so because weare basingour operations on the simple fact that His Excellency the President would like to see peace between us and everybody else in the world. However, we are not going to have peace at any price and not, at any rate, at the price of integrity of this nation. Finally, I want to say one thing. Hon. Biwott said thatthese people wanted to overthrow the Government and it is not aQuestion of multi-party politics. That is true. We have some people who call themselves churchmen, and those of us who werebrought up reading the Bible know of people who were calledPharisees high churchmen. we have a situation where an employeeof the church, like the one I have in Maseno South, is assumingthe responsibility over the whole church. These are thePharisees. They have nothing to do with God and religion but aresinful employees making a good living from the church. Let usplace them where they belong. They have no business in politicsbecause politics is too serious to belong to churchmen. Let ustake this matter much more seriously than we are doing at the moment. On Saturday last week during news time,and I want my hon. friend the Minister for information and Broadcasting, to find outhow it happened that when news was being broadcast in kiswahili,there was a conversation going on in Luo Language. It means that whatwe are calling multi-party debate is much more serious than we are regarding it. It was an elaborate attemnt to overthrow theGovernment and confuse the people. Let us provide thepeople with proper leadership through Kanu and the Government.I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING(Mr.Kaparo):First and foremost, I would like to thank Dr. Godana formoving this Motion. There has been a lot of Pretence in creatingProblems in this country. A lot of People have been talking aboutthe rule of law, human rights, the Constitution, justice and so on.  Those people are Kenyans Who are trained as lawyers. IHappen to have been trained in Kenya as a lawyer and Dr. Godanaand myself were in the same classroom with them. We, therefore, understand these things very well. Y ou cannot talk of justice in a vacuum; there must be a machinery that can guarantee that justice. You cannot talk about cure rights without talking about obligations that are naturally coupled with every right. Let somebody tell 	me today of any single right that is absolute and one without a duty to go with. You have a right to live, Sir, and at the same time you Have duty not to kill me. This is because if you do, you tooforbid . your right and you will also be condmned to death as bylaw prescribed. That is the law in Kenya. You also have a rightto talk. people have talked too much. You have a right to talk.but you have no right to say something that is untrue of me because that would libel or slander depending on the circumstances. you are guilty of these things, you will not go to the court of law and say: Your Lordship, it is in the Constitution of Kenya that I have a right to slander others”. You do not do that. You havea right to talk so long as your mouth does not endanger thewhole society.For example, Sir, some people are making political capitalout of the detentions of those undesirable persons. I read in oneof the newspapers that the American Embassy is very concerned about a few Kenyans who were detained. But I never read a single statement to the effect that they were concerned about the looting that took place by those thugs. They were also not concerned about the people who lost their lives as a result of that thugger. Why is it that two or three people are more valuable than 22 Million Kenyans? Why they look at them as if they were more special than others? We do not have to put honey on top ofcow dung so that it becomes sweet. The fact is this: Those peoplewho were detained were under a mission of a particular embassyand that is why they were concerned that their mission was goingto abort as it did.We are all Kenyans and if there is trouble as was thecase for a while, it is us who felt the pinch. The matatuswhich were burnt belonged to ordinary law abiding Kenyans who had sweated a lot buy them by, say, taking loans which they were Prepared to repay from the proceeds of their businesses. It is clear that insurance companies cannot compensate such victims. Mr. Matiba and the rioters cannot pay. Why can they not be madeto pay for all the property that was destroyed.I understand something which is called the law of causation.Who caused the event to happen. If you cause something tohappen, then you must be responsible for the necessary consequencesof your act. Since they caused this event, I think they owe it toKenyans. As a national Assembly here, we should demand that theymade to pay for what was destroyed. If they do not want to payvoluntarily, their proerty should be sold to pay for that.I am aware that these reporters from the Press will write in tomorrows newspapers that has no respect for private property.  What about those looters? Did they have respect for private property? Whatprivate person are we talking about? Are there private and non-private people in this country? Are there any people whose property should be protected and others whose property should not be protected? One observation I have made of late is that the word of God has been given a back seat in the Church while politics has gone to the front. The second thing is that there is an open defiance of authority by some church leaders. When these leaders say that this Government should be scrapped irrespective of the provisions of the Constitution of Kenya, what is that if not an open call to rebellion? Does it matter in the end who is guilty of treason? Does it matter whether it is a thief, a church man, a wealthy man or a bishop so long as he is guilty of treason? I am informed of the Laws of Kenya, and my information is that no person or group of persons, whatever their religion, is exempt from the provisions of the Penal Code of Kenya. (Applause) In this case, the proVisions of the Penal Code must be used immediately and without discrimination because any person who incites people to rebel against the Government should be dealt with accordingly. There is a provision for this,and we have the police. Why do they not get these fellows and apply the law?If Okullu, for example, wants to be detained, why not detain him? He hasalready committed so many crimes against this country. Put him in jail ndipokama kondoo atazaa mbuzi, azae. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to appeal to all Kenyans to note that we have already seen the tip of the iceberg. Supposing the recent chaoswent on for three or four days, what would have happened? Those of you who are sitting on the fence should change their ways? Let me say it absolutelyclearly here and now that there were very many of you sitting on the fence. Yousaw what happened and you knew what was likely to come.If you keep on sittingon the fence, you will face the wrath of the Kenyan people because they will never shy away. We will fight to the last man and the last drop of our blood  to make sure that we have a country that is soverein and which is not a playground for every Tom, Dick and Harry. With these few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE 	(Mr. Mwangale): 	Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will take a much shorter time than other hon. Members because I think what has already been said by our colleagues here expresses the feelings of every distinguished member of Parliament here. All I can do is to remind this House that we have a mausoleum of the late President Mzee Jomo Kenyatta beside where this Parliament stands today. I would like to remind those who were present when the decision was made that that mausoleum would be built in Parliament of two or three very major points. I say this because I want to refer to what my colleaugue, hon. ole Kaparo, has said about thoes of us who are in the Front and Back Benches. That mausoleum is there not simply as an ornament; it is there in order to remind us of two things. Firstly, Kenyans loved our founding Fatherof the Nation. We respected him and fought at every stage to ensure that hisGovernment stayed in power. I recall further that in 1971, when there was anattempted coup, some of these senior old men who are here now and I walked all the way from Solidarity House up to Uhuru Park. We condemned the coup plotters, saying, ""Take those people, detain them and sack them"" and that is exactly what the late President Kenyatta did. That is what that mausoleum reminds us of.If you look into the history of that old man, you get inspiration. I would like Odinga, in particular, to come here and get his inspiration at the gate of the mausoleum because I do not think he understands it. At the foundation of that monument, we avowed as Kenyans to remain united because we have shed blood.	Let me tell you that if you face power with your unbridled ambition, you get crushed.	There are people who are going to be crushed because Kenyans will not allow anything bad to happen to this country.	If there is anybody in this House who thinks or imagines that he is going to take over from this President of ours, using all these machinations, should go and  stand near that monument to get inspiration because that will be a lesson for him to remember. I remember that when the late Mzee Kenyatta died, Chrles Rubia, my friend, said just outside this House over there, "The bugger is dead." The same man was a Cabinet Minister because Mzee wanted to forgive and give a chance to everybody. He gave a chance to many of us here. President Moi has given achance to many of us sitting here. Let me say that we were born only once, andwe will die only once. Somebody once told me, ""We will finish you"" and I toldhim, ""Finish me. You are a damn coward.	Try to."	Even if I were assassinatedtoday, I am only one person out of 22 million Kenyans who are determined to see this country remain united and peaceful under the leadership of our President. I agree with hon. Karume that the late Mzee had the opportunity and the power to decide who would inherit his seat from him.  This is because had assured him that he would remain in that seat until death. Many other tribes went begging to the late Kenyntta  but after looking around he decided in his own wisdom, as hon. Kerumesaid, that the man who could Kenyans after him was President Moi.But attempts have been made, even from the Front-bench, against President Moi. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 1983 I stood here and told my then colleague, hon. Njonjo, it has always been my practice to tell anybody who tries to make a direct attempt not to do it - that he could not make it and so he should not try. I want to tell my fellow front-benchers here that no matter which province of Kenya somebody comes from if he thinks that he can mobilise Kenyans against the President, we will crush him and everybody had better know that. I do not want to talk about some of these church leaders. Last night I was watching the KTN cable news; when I was in LondonI also watched cable news. They kept on repeating a film about theSecond world war which shows what the Germans did to the Jews. InLondon they kept on showing how power hungry elements anywhere candestroy a nation - they showed how London and other places were bombed. why have they always repeated showing this film? They do so because they want remind their young generation where they came from and the dangers involved in this type of adventure. We speak in this way because we are united. In fact, when I saw the statement the sons of the late Kenyatta. Mooya and Argwings-Kodhek issued the other day, I said. ""God bless us"". These are people born with diamond spoons in their mouths but they know that our founding fathers, some of whom are here, suffered for them.  If we can teach our sons to be bold enough as to go to our constituents and tell them ""you know where we came from!"" whatever other country  tries to interfere will not succeed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, today is very critical day because in the corridors and in this Sitting there appears to be somebody Who believes that somebody from outside can interefere with this countryyou get the impression that an external Dower has assured them of continued support. But let me tell you if we decide to throw one ambassador out of this country,.as my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation correctly said, he will go no matter which superpower he represents. I am telling today that we will not mince our words and allow insecurity in this country because of one person. Thank you, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT LIINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE 	( Mr. Kones): On a point of order, Speaker, Sir. In view of the importance of the Motion we are discussing I would request that the Chair this discussion by one hour?</Newspeech><Newspeech>Me.

When the kind of situation we have today,we as leaders of this nation ore expected to show unity and alsospeak with one voice. While I agree with all the sentiments expressed by my colleagues, I would like to start off with one very important point. If I were to be very blunt I would, perhaps, be out of order by infringing on the Standing Orders of this House. However, we have ambassadors in this country and it should not be taken that every  embassy and ambassador is friendly to us. There is one ambassador  and he may not be alone - who is on a specific mission to cause chaos in this country so that the Government may be overthrown. He is trying to influence other embassies and ambassadors here and outside so that the Government of Kenya is removed. This happens to have been very clearly shown. Furthermore, the country representedby this ambassador is also busy in other world capitals trying to.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Kones):	On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The hon. Minister is	making a very important point but there is a lot of noice in the House.	Couldwe, please, hear the Minister in absolute silence?</Newspeech>(applause)<Newspeech>THE MINISTER F0R COMMERCE (Mr. Magugu): Thank you,Speaker, Sir. I was saying that the country represented by thisambassador here is also busy trying to campaign and convince other countries in the world to have the same attitude towards Kenya. Theyalso have used their stooges here, some of whom are in detentionand others are at large, and they have assured them that our Governmentwill last until December. Now, the question is whether in this House, in our offices and in our constituencies we are talking withone voice or whether we have one leg here and the other leg elsewhere. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I say that because, as recently as when we had the riots and hooliganism, I noticed that people as high as in the ranks of Cabihet Ministers, hon. Members and the business community who claim to be followers of the Nyayo Government when you look at their activities during the last seven days, or so, youwill be surprised that they have been involved, and very deeply so, in openly supporting these very, very activities in the country, particularly in Nairobi, Githunguri, Kiambu and so on. The question is how to deal with these types of people who happen to be using the very authority they have been bestowed to indicate that they are credible and with the people to destabilise the Government by being used by this particular ambassador?</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON.

I would wish to request hon.Members to be patient as the Government moves. If there are hon. Members ofthe Back bench who are involved, they will be exposed and, if there are Cabinet Members involved, they will also be involved. Even members of the public whoare involved will be exposed.

Therefore, time has come for hon. Members and all the Kenyan community to stand up and be counted.	There are others who think that these things are very clear and that the Government may "go" at any time and therefore, they will stand by the roadside.

We have dangerous people in this country today, some of whom have been detained while others have been picked up for questioning. However, I would like to take this opportunity to say that those few people in the churches who have taken up the issue and are now carrying on with it are the most dangerous people in this country. These people believe that they can never be reached. They wait for every Sunday to go to their respective churches and attack the Government in the belief that they cannot be reached. The saddest thing about this is that these are the same people who have been inciting people, for the last several weeks. They have been inciting the jobless people and some of them were used to dish out money. When the hooligans started looting and were confronted by the police and some shot, the first group to come out and cry foul, as well as visit the hospitails, were the clergy. It is sad to hear the same clergy calling for the release of those who have been detained	by the Government. They are only worried of akina Matiba and the others who have been detained; they do not care about the lives of many innocent people who were shot dead. The time has come when these people should be met properly and be made responsible for what they say. Mr. Speaker, Sir, thd strength of our nation today is the people themselves.	Every weekend we, as electdd Membdrs of Parliament, go back to our people and hold develoment meetings with them. We have their mandate to come to thisHouse and say what we are saying here today. But it is surprising that a fewclerics now believe that they have more power to talk in this nation than the elected Membdrs of this House. They have come out to state that the Members of this House are a rubber stamp. We know that they could not dare that if theydid not believe that they cannot be touched. This House can never be a rubberstamp. This is Parliament, made of pdople elected by the people from the grass-roots. The strength of this nation, which comes from those people, is the onewhich supports the peopld who form this House and will continue to give themstrength as long they have the mandate from those people. Another point that I would like to put across is this, that we, in this House, have stated categorically that we support our President. We support him,we will follow him and we will always love himn. When we speak that way, we knowthat we are speakng for our people at the grassroots at home. It can never, there-fore, be true that these few clerics, five or 10, can be able to say that they have the mandate of the people in this country more than we have. All I can say now is this, that last week whdn we met to give a statement from Nyamira and Kisii districts, we. gave a statement which was never even published in the newspapers at all although it was on radio and television. We asked Members of Parliament to go back home to their constituehcies, each one of them, either individually or through the districts, and explain to the people what happehed last weekend but one because many of our people do not seem to understand what is really happening. They know that they like the Prdsident and that they are following him; they do  not really understand what is happening. The only way we can explain to them whatis happening is for us to go back home and explain to them what happened and solidif the already existing support and loyalty to His Excellency the President. The truth remains as it has already been stated, that there is nothing that can happen here in this country if the people all over the country, as they do, support the Government, the party and the President. There is nothing that can happen, and our strength lies there. Indeed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the strength and the power of our beloved President does not seem to rely in those papers we call the Constitution. The power and the strength of our President in this country lies with the people themselves. The papers of the Constitution have only put down what exists with the people. If these people who are talking of changing the Constitution wanted to do it and they respected the Constitution as they always claim, they only way they would do it is to persuade the people and we, in this Parliaemnt, who have the power to amend the Constitution. They should have sought to persuade this House to change the Constitution in the manner we would think fit. Today, there is no way at allthat these people can come to this House and that is why they fear the House. Theycall us rubber stamps because they cannot manage to do anything that. We, in this House, know our rights and Our loyalty goes to the President, the Governemnt and the party. They know that we are not going to change; we are not going toremove ourselves from the Presdient whom we love and follow. That is why they areafraid and that is why they are calling us rubber stamps. We are going to remainfirm, and we are going to tell our people, as they know, that there is no better alternative to what we have today in this country. (Several hon. Members stood up in their places) Sir, my time is still on. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I want to finish with is this, that the danger today lies with those people in the church, and we should never take them for granted. We have to think on how to face. them. If they go to church every 	 Sunday, we should go to the people ourselves.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR FINANCE(Prof. Saitoti): Mr. Speaker,Sir, it is my pleasure to be associated with this very important Motion. Last week,in my contribution to another Motion which was also touching on very fundamental aspects on the stability of this nation, I did draw the attention of the House to the fact that there have been hooligans. These crooks have stolen a lot of property, destroyed business premises and, unfortunately, human life has been lost. I went on to expound a theory which, of course, today has been consolidated. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did say that the thuggery and hooliganism that we had seen was but a means to an end. I do not think I minced my words because Iwas very clear. I am sure, also, that hon. Members were very clear. I said thatthere was a conspiracy which had been worked out, whose ultimate aim was none other than to destabilise this nation, destroy the constitutionally elected Government of this nation and replace it with an illegal government of thugs, a government of traitors. In short, treason was being committed. Sir, let me go back to the same thing, namely, that this conspiracy, whose part result we saw last week, was hatched quite a while ago. It has been going on and on, and I think we should not kid ourselves in the belief that it is all gond. I think we should take note of the fact that this is a serious matter.We should understand that some of the criminals at large are still at work. I onlywant to say one thing which is important, that the Government will hunt down each and everyone of those criminals. (Applause) No stone will be left unturned until we do get right down to that machine. I have do doubt, and I am confident, that the Government will totally destroy that machine. Mr. Speaker, Sir, peace has brought about a lot of development in this country and wananchi are not ready to sacrifice that peace and have their children 	or themselves killed. The wananchi in this country, and I would like to repeat this, that wananchi all over the Republic of Kenya and Here I would, like to say wananchi of all ethnic groups are solidly behind our beloved President and the Government and our Ruling Party Kanu. If this was not so, they would havecome cut and mined with those criminals. The masterminds of this chaos anddisorder had in their minds that the moment they use these hooligans, crocks,thugs and the like, they would have achieved a trigger point which would have made the wananchi to join and support them in their lawlessness and hooligariam.	However, because the wananchi in this country are patriotic enough and becausethey love, peace, their President and this country, they refused to come and Jointhese hooligans. The only people who were engaged in this lawlessness were thecriminals and therefore, I salute the wananchi of this country far their stand.Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I salute wananchi in this country, I must say thatthere are other organisations in this country which allowed themselves to bemanipulated. These organizations offered themselves to be at the disposal of theconspirators. Here, I would particularly like to refer to a very unfortunateaspect of a certain church in Kenya. We believe there is one Particular damination whose conduct has been abominable and I think this Particular church leavesa lot a to be desired. I do not know what we can say about this particular church.This church started its campaign quite a while age and at that time, we started wonderingwhat is wrong with some of its Clergymen. This afternoon, Mr. Speaker, Sir,you have heard for yourself the sentiments of hon. members regarding, this particular church. There has been	a time when some people in this country have been carrying the banner of multi-party or pluralism and claiming that there is going to be a debate. These people said that they wanted this Parliament to be disbanded immediatelyand elections held. Some of us cannot belive that this would have beendebate worth its salt and we never fell pray to this. This is because intellectually we know what is a debate and what is not a debate. A debate begins by invitation letters saying, “Let us come together and talk amicably so that we can debate on ideas. However, this is not what it was; what was given was an ultimatum and we know that this ultimatum was intennel to restle with the machinery of this Government  and you saw the results last week. Fortunately, the enemies of the people did not succeed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, no sooner that things are starting to settle down, than one senior clergyrmen repeats the same ultimatum. 	We cannot understand by this particular clergyman chose to say what be said at this Particular moment in time. However, many of us here who have suscribed. To Christianity believe that the church is supposed to pray for the peace of a nation. The Church is not supposed to do or utter anything that could lead to chaos and disorder because that would lead to bloodshed. However, we find a leader of a certain church now repeating the same ultimatum that was issued by these hooligans so that more bloodshed can take place in this country.	They are issuing the same ultimatum so that there can be more destruction of -property in this country. 	Th e only conclusion that we can arrive at is that either we are dealing 	with an individual who 	is mentally deranged or for that matter, we are dealing with an enemy of the people   of Kenya and therefore, whatever is the case, we must condemn those atturances in the strongest possible terms.Therefore Mr.Speaker Sir, my appeal to this august House is tolisten to what I have said and I would like to repeat it, namely that we muststand to be counted. Above all, during this time of many trials and tribuations,this House must stand united for our unity is our strength. We must demcstratethis to the world and to our own People that we are united. We must demostrateto everybody here and abroad that we love our President and our nation, and Iwould like to take this opportunity to pay trihute to those foreign countries who have all along been our friends and who have made an economic contribution to this to this country. These countries have continued to be partners in our development and I would therefore like to take this opportunity to assured them that we will continue to reciprocate in the same way. However we must also remind them that Kenya is a Sovereign State. We are an Independent Nation and the blood of our people was ehsd to attain this Independence, so that we can be in a position to   determine the destiny of this nation and to decide which institutions are  good for the development of this country. we want to continue in this trend and therefore, we must let our friends to know that we repect them and we expect them to respect us too. We believe that this is fundamental to peace and stability in this country.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the most disturbing thing that has happened is what one might call a clear manifestation of lack of patriotism on part of a number of Kenyans. I am saying this because there are a certain people in this country who are prepared to sell this country to foreigners. These people are prepared to turn Kenya into a new colony and we must reject that with all our might. Any Kenyan who goes arround seeking the advice, assistance or support from these foreigners could distabilize this country so that more Kenyans are killed and all our azmia development efforts that we have made in the past 27 years brought to nothing. These are	the	Biggest traitors of this nation and we must reject their ideas totally.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to leave that impression with hon. Members: That we are dealing with a complicated issue. We are dealing with an issue which was an attempt to destabilise the Government. Wames have been given and it is clear that it is a combination of very strange names. It is a laughable issue to me because I do not believe that bunch of elements were the ones to run this Government or country, I do net see how they would be able to solve the problems that this country is facing today. I cannot believe it. Look at each one of them who has actually been brought here. I do not believe they have the ability to solve the problems of this country. The problems of develop¬ment, problems of unemployment, and so on, cannot be solved in a midst of chaos. Those problems can only be solved in an atmosphere of stability. If we have the political stability, then we can be able to address ourselves to the solutions. Investments will flow; industries will move; our farmers will continue to grow food; tourism will grow and so on. But we are not going to have those tenents of development taking place in the midst of chaos.I think we as leaders of this nation Kenya population look upon us. we must stand firm, as I said, and above all, we must demonstrate our vigilance. We must tell the people the truth and we must warn the people so that another attempt should not come. We can all together and collectively with the Government and with the people deal effectively with that challenge. That is very important ana it behoves everyone or us here to stand from. This is not time to waver, but it is time to stand from.I think we must say again what was still celive that they can mess up this country and that they can take over the reigns of Government through illegal means, let them take the following heed: That we shall fight. We are not afraid and we are not cowards .  Let those who keep on preaching that they are going to kill people, that they are going to murder people and so on, they should know that he who lives by the word also dies by the sword. That is very important for then to know. It aces not help then to go around threatening people and saying that they are going to kill So and So. That does it matter? Even if you kill Saitoti today, another Saitoti will come up or if you kill somebody else here like Elijah, others will come. and you can never be able to gang people by killing them.(applause)Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to say one thing: We have a model of a nation in Africa. Me have had a nation that has been respected internationally. These criminals, in the last few days, have wrecked havoc in a number of things. we must now try to rebuild this nation and we can do so as long as we remain together and continue to support the efforts of His Excellency the President and the Government. On this core, there should be no room for hypocrisy. Leaders must learn to speak the truth always. But as I said I want us to remain together in this House because this battle we are dealing with can only be won as long as we deal with it effectively and together. Let us isolate the enemies of develop¬ment and let us deal effectively with them.With those few remarks Sir, I beg to move.</Newspeech>(applause)<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY(Mr. Ctieno): Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.I would like to call a spade a spade today because we are all admitting that we are going through a crisis for which we need an urgent solution. I would like to answer a question which was raised by Paul Muite in the newspapers. Paul Muite had the audacity to put it in writing that it is possible to be loyal to the Constitution and not to the head of State. I would like to answer this question because it seems to be the premises from which most of the advocates of these sub¬versive activities are acting. They are saying that they are loyal to the Constitution. They think that is right and that they do not need to be loyal to the Mead of State.Mr. Speaker, Sir, to be able to answer, we must first ask ourselves: That is really the objective of loyalty, in the first place? Why do we need to be loyal to the Constitution or to the State? I submit that loyalty to the State is because you need stability in the country. The moment you accept that you need stability in the country and that is the reason why you should be loyal to the country. Then you answer the question: That the moment you say you are not loyal to the Head of State then you are creating instability and you are also ruining the very objective of loyalty, in the first place.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to state that we have both covert and overt actions of disloyalty. .That we are witnessing and dealing with today are the covert actions of people who have come out to say that they do not want this Government. They are going to undermine it. They are exploiting the good qualities if President Moi, in the first place.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the covert activities are more difficult to understand, and I would like to submit that undemining the Government of Kenya today starts with us leaders undermining each other on a small scale and graduating into larger scale until you reach a point when you have no point when you have no choice but to face the President. If we are going to lead our country in peace. Love and unity, then each of us should re-examine their own personal ambitions. If personally I say I am going to undermine this Minister until I bring him down , when you do with one, it maybe okay. But when you take two, three, four Ministers and so on, by the time you reach one-third of the Cabinet, then you are undermining the Government of President Moi.Mr. Speaker, Sir. I would like to submit that anybody at this stage who thinks he can bring down the Government of President Moi is cheated. He is cheated in daylight because President Moi has performed faithfully and reached the level where all the Kenyans are saying that is the Head of State and that is our President,(applause)President Moi did not as to be President. He came through by serving Kenyans faithfully and. organising then for production until his turn cane and Kenyatta said "Let Moi be my son. I want to submit that this country has such a solid foundation and a history of capability of eliminating all covert and overt subversives one after the other. If there was anybody who would have maneuvered himself into power into this country, it was the person who formed KPU. there was anybody who could have succeeded to maneuvered himself into . power, it was one person who was one time Secretary General of Kanu. If there as anybody who would have succeeded to be President of this country through covert and overt maneuvers, it was somebody when we toppled, in 1983. If there were people who would think they would use money and foreigners and maneuver their way into power in this country. We eliminated one of them in 1989.Right now all the heat that we are trying to handle and I sought the permission of the House to call a spade a spade, is a conflict of personal ambitions, people undermining one another and now it has gone to such a large scale until President Moi has to handle it. People have been undermining each other in our Government by taking advantage of the peace and stability that President Moi has worked so hard for over 35 years. They have taken advantage of his tolerance, his ability to list to all characters and all shades of opinion and his ability to give each of us a chance to say a word or two to him.The conflict we have now is one of personal ambitions or smaller men who say that after 10 years, President Moi will be about to hand over power. I would like to tell them, that he will hand power to nobody until he either dies or decides personally to leave. Not because there are any individual who will be maneuvers.  one by one to take over from him. To solve "this crisis we leaders must go back and say that we are ruining a country that has had a good foundation and one which needs to continue to develop. Let us. all go back and serve our people genuinely and organise them for production.I do not know anybody because for we to say anything, I must have the evidence. But there would not be the political heat because we do not have any production heat here. what we have is a political heat generated by people trying to bring down others and. raise others. That is what I call politics. You know each other and we are all here we should go back and say that President Moi deserves his position and Kenya deserves its rate and let us.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Chesir): 	On a point of order, Sir.

I rise to support this Motion alongside the others who have done 30. In so doing, I would like to express my disgust at sore of chose things that I heard this afternoon to the effect that there are some people who, behind the Constitution and the people of Kenya, are trying to form a government of their own. They have not even been elected. For you to be in the Government you must first of all be elected. They are not elected. Their names have come up, secretly formed and unknown by the peoples of Kenya. We must stand and say not.There are some people who have a feeling that there are foreign powers which love then. Let we tell them that they are very wrong and mistaken. Those people are Kenyans like us here and no foreign powers is going to love you more than the other man. Me are all Kenyans. Let me say that in those countries, be they in Europe or in North America, have their black people. If they loved black people like these people think that they are loved by those people, they should have elected a black man astheir President or a leader of capacity in their own countries.If they have not done it, how are they going to come for there and love you and give you a position when they do not give it to their own black people. Let them first all to it and then we will believe them.We elected President Moi Constitutionally. It we who elected him. He was not brought to us by a foreigner. He was not imposed on us. The people of Kenya should be left to decide who will lead them. we have decided that for now it is President Moi and he is going to continue leading us. It is time that we showed our colors and stand firmly. When a country is faced with a crisis like this one either from outside or inside, 	we must decide where we stand. All of us must come forward and be counted and stand with President Moi as our leader whom we have chosen. When other countries are faced with a crisis, they resolved, it right there or forget it and immediately stand behind their leader because it is their security that is threatened we are is elected by the people from every constituency in Kenya so as to guard their security and promote their interest.We must assure all Kenyans that the Government is intact under President Moi. The Government will ,therefore, protect them and take care of their security. They should not fear anything. Those voices which are being heard here and there, are not going to make any difference because there is a Government that cares for the people.  \tThe person who is leading this Government is a man we love. He loves children and cares for his people. He goes to the people, and does not rule from an ivory tower. Therefore, we must support him without wavering. We must show our unity today. All of us, being together as we are and without trying to undermine one another, must go back to the people because we are the ones with that mandate, having been elected by them. We should assure our people that we stand united and that we are not going to let anybody to bring any differences among us.It is today that all of us should stand to be counted. Every peace- loving person in this country must stand to be counted. We saw what happened a week ago. Hooligans roamed the streets, throwing stones, stealing and raping. Christians themselves suffered along with everybody else. They were beaten up. We have seen what those people can do, and we must tell church leaders that they must deny violence unconditionally because, as people who preach the word of God to us, they must preach the peace of God. If they hesitate to do this, they will be very questionable. I myself have talked to many church people, including those from the Church of the Province of Kenya (C.P.K.), and they were disgusted by the violence that occurred. They are waiting for their leaders to denounce that violence because they themselves are not part and parcel of it. When a bishop speaks as a leader of the C.P.K., he should know that he does not carry all the Christians in the C.P.K. and that he only speaks for himself and his interests because his people do not want chaos in this country.President Moi has appointed a commission to look into unemployment and before this commission has even gone half way into its task, church men are up in arms inciting the people. They must know that it is not an easy job to run a nation. President Moi, his Government and this Parliament are doing the best they can for the people of Kenya, and they are not waiting for any other Government or President to come and help in running this country. We are not going to get any better President. This was recognised a long time ago, and this is why we must stand solidly united with President Moi. There should beno hesitation; we must announce- it to our people that we stand with President Moi. Let all Kenyans and foreigners know this. So long as 23 million people stand with their President, nobody from outside or within can come and change the course of things here in Kenya. It is only we, our people and the Government who can do that. Therefore, we must show our unity.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TECHNICAL TRAINING AND APPLIED TECHNOLOGY (Prof. Ongeri): Mr. Speaker, Sir, history is very vivid in our minds. In 1940, during the Second World War, Prime Minister Churchill stood up and told the whole nation of England, "We shall never, never, never surrender. Never, never again. Why did he say so? For the dignity of Britain. In 1962, when there was a blockade of Cuba by President Kennedy, he said, "America will never succumb to external threats. This is history. In the entire American nation, the youth have never seen communism and they do not know it, but they have grown up to be taught to know that communism is a dangerous tool. So, you now see them standing up saying, "Communism is a bad thing." In 1953, the founding Father of this nation, along with President Moi institutionalised democracy in this country. They gave us the institution of parliamentary democracy, and it was accepted by Kenyans that if there were issues of a diverse nature, they would be discussed in this august House and the truth found thereof.The chastity of this Parliament has never interfered with any other parliamentary democracy elsewhere in the world. The American Congress would stand up and speak up their minds about what is good and what is bad for them in their country. We, too, would like to be left to discuss what is good and what is bad for this nation. The youth of this nation are growing up to be bequethed peace and tranquility, and our own President is in the fore front to ensure that this tranquility exists in our midst. However, we now find that there are people who have flouted the institution of Parliament and hijacked its debates to some other quarters where some other matters are supposed to be discussed.  I have a constituency and I would like to see a clergyman come to me and tell me, "Prof. Ongeri, from Nyaribari Masaba, we have an issue for you to raise in Parliament. That is the essence of democracy and representation by Parliament. Why would you like to leave aside this institution of Parliament, saying that you want to dissolve it? Who are you to dissolve the institution of the people? What powers on earth do you have? We have an organised society, and we want to maintain peace and see prosperity in this land. I have just come back from West Germany. The honorary Chairman asked me, "Why are you Kenyans destroying your future? You have worked so well. You are a united people and your progress is good. Why do you allow a few individuals to smear your country? The dignity of a nation cannot be bought with dollars, pounds, deutsche marks or yen. So, the dignity of this nation will be maintained. I would like to pay tribute to His Excellency the President for having taken the necessary steps to ensure that the dignity of Kenyans is in good order. Therefore, each one of us has a duty to maintain that dignity.</Newspeech><Header>ADJOURNMENT</Header><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Hon. Members, it is now time for the interruption of business. The House is, therefore, adjourned until tomorrow, Wednesday, 18th July at 9.00 a.m.</Newspeech>The House rose at thirty minutes past Seven oclock.HANSARDWednesday, 18th July, 1990 The house met at 9.00 oclock.Mr. Deputy Speaker in the Chair<Header>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</Header> Question No. 380 Sub-Division of Milalani Sub-locationMR. MWAMZANDI asked the Minister of State, Office of the President, when Milalani Sub-location of Msanibwetai Location of Kwale District will be divided and additional assistant chiefs appointed as recommended by the Kwale D.D.C.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Kamuren): Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir, I beg to reply.The question of the sub-division of Mialalani Sub location in Msambweni Location of Kwale District has already been brought to my office and is receiving consideration this financial year along recommendations from other areas in the country. The appointment of additional assistant chiefs will depend on the outcome of this consideration.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question here is when the sub-location will be divided and additional assistant chiefs appointed. Can the Assistant Minister reply to that question alone?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thought I made it very clear that the recommendation has already been received in my office and that it is receiving attention. I said that we have already told the officers concerned to look in it. As soon as the exercise is completed, we will allow the; sub-division and then see what next thing to be done on the appointment of additional assistant chiefs.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Assistant Minister for that encouraging answer. But, because of the problems the people of that area are facing administratively, can he suggest as to how long the exercise will take?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, I thought that question was quite satisfactorily replied to because, as I have said, the issue is being considered. Those considerations are already in the hands of the Office! of the President, and we will do what we can to give these people an assistant chief.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the local district development committee has recommended for an additional assistant chief and suggested the administrative boundaries for that assistant chief. What other recommendations are being awaited? Further, when the Assistant Minister talks of this financial year, does he mean that the assistant chief will be appointed during the current financial year? Can he make that clear?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, to give some supplementary information on this particular Question, the Kwale District Development Committee, at its meet¬ing of 9th March, 1990, recommended the sub-division of Milalani Sub—location into Milalani Sub-location, comprising an area of 60 square kilometres and a population of 6,000 people? and Masisini Sub-location, comprising an area of 90 square kilometres and a population of 9,000 people. The letter on the recommendation came to the Office of the: President through the district development committee. After that, the officers concerned with this work were requested to meet and submit a paper, which was submitted with recommendations from the Office of the President. So, the question of sub-dividing the! sub-location has already been accepted. The only thing is the financial year, and I do not want to say anything more than that. I would only request the hon. Member to allow the Office of the President time to do its utmost to ensure that this exercise is undertaken to his satisfaction.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, the question of financial year still perturbs me. What has that financial year to do with the Question? Is the recommendation going to be approved during this financial year? Can the Assistant Minister make it clear as to what he means when he? mentions financial year?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is not the only sub-location that is being considered. There are 11 divisions in this Republic with 165 locations and 523 sub-locations to be considered along with this particular one. Therefore,Sir, you can see that we are not talking of only one sub location there are many others.</Newspeech>Question No. 364Payment of Pensioners in MwalaMR. WAMBUA asked the VicePresident and Mini¬ster for Finance whether he could, since Messrs. Nthakyo Nzoka, APN/PC 33284, and Julius Syano Ndonye, APN/PC 24459 of Mwala Constituency receive their monthly pensions after the 10th of every month, direct that pensioners in Mwala Constituency be .paid their pensions at their chiefs offices in order to facili¬tate this process.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICEPRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.It is not possible for me to direct that pensioners in Mwala Constituency be; paid their pensions at their chiefs offices as each pensioner is paid his pension in accordance with his particular written instructions.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Not pursuing much the question of pensioners being paid through the chiefs offices, is the Assistant Minister aware that pensioners receive their dues very late? As indicated in my Question, some pensioners receive their cheques after the 10th of each month. The! day beffore1 yesterday I went with these two pensioners to the post office and they opened their boxes only to find that there were no cheques. Could the1 Ministry devise a method whereby pensioners can be paid quite on time since" they are suffering. Those1 in my constituency have! not been paid for last month. Since these are the people who structured the Civil Serve during the difficult colonial times, they should be honoured by being paid on time. What method is the Office of the Vice President and Ministry of Finance going to devise so that pensioners can get their dues on time"?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEAH: Mr. Deputy Speaker,Sir, I fully acknowledge and appreciate the sentiments expressed by the hon. Member,, and I agree with hi m fully that, pensioners should get their pensions on tine. The procedure that we have does ensure that the majority of pensioners receive their, pension on tine. Let me just give hon. Nasbua more information to indicate to bin what actually; happened so that he can understand the situation. The pensions payroll gets to the Pensions Department about 25th of every month and there are about 50,000 pension cheques in total for pensioners throughout the country at the memento These cheques are usually signed by a cheque signing machine, but unfortunately, ever the last few months, this machine has broken down. However, we have placed an order: for another machine and when it comes it will speed up the natter. I would like to assure a hon. Members that the cheque signing machine is marely a devise to speed up the processing of the 50,000 cheques after the necessary scrutiny has, in fact, made and the necessary checking made to ensure that payments are being made to the correct, people. Therefore, hon. Members should Is not be scared by the mention of the cheque-signing machine.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure hon. Mambua that there is already a very good system within the Pensions Department of the Treasury and it is regrettable that these two pensioners have net received their cheques. However, I would like to advise the pensioners to issue pensions instructions as to where the cheques should be sent. Some of these cheques are sent through the district commissioner -and later on cent to the chiefs and so on. Other pensioners require that their cheques he sent through their own private box number and whatever happens at the post office once we post the cheques is not really something that we can control. So, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the choise of receipt is that cf the pensioner himself.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant Ministers reply, would he agree with me that pensioners do not get these cheques on time? One thing that is evident is that these cheques are normally sent late. If these cheques are sent on 10th or 15th from the Pensions Department here in Treasury, how does the Assistant Minister expect them to get to the pensioners on time? These pensioners receive the cheques very late and we would like to hear from the Assistant Minister what procedure he is going to adept in order to speed up the payment of pensions. We would like the pensioners to be getting their pensions on tine just like the civil servants receive their salaries on tine.</Newspeech>MR. KEAH: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the procedure we use is that one of posting the cheques and as I did say, it is the pensioners own choice to have his cheques posted, to whatever address he gives, what happens after we have posted those cheques is not really something that I can explain. However, I would like to assure hon. Manbua that the necessary action is going to be taken to stop unnecessary delays in signing the cheques. At the moment, the delay in signing the cheques has been "brought about by the volume of the 50,000 cheques that have to he signed every month. As I have already indicate in my answer above, having posted the cheques, I am not in control of the situation in so far as what happens at the post office.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Can we move on to Mr. Mureithis Question.</Newspeech>Question No.350 Opening of Embaringo Dispensary MR. MUREITHI asked the Minister for Health when the Ministry will open the Embaringo Dispensary since the wananchi have completed the buildings as required by the Ministry.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Godara): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.My Minister does not have any immediate plans to take over the Embaringo Dis[ensary. However the Minister will consider taking over this dispensary along with others when the Nyeri District Development Committee place it is their priority list. It present all the health facilities which are run by the Ministry appear in the districts five year Development Plan and Embaringo so not one of them.	</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUREITHI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am surprised by theanswer given by the Assistant Minister. Last year, I took the Members of Embaringo Dispensary Committee to see the Medical Officer of Health who assured us that as con as we complete the buildings, this- dispensary is going to be taken over by the Ministry. Secondly, this year, the Ministry of Health installed electricity wires in these premises. Under these circumstances, how can they say that this dispensary has net been incorporated in the five-year Development Plan?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. GODAKA Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the Ministry assisted in installing electricity mires in the premises, this must have been done through Harambee basis from the local health office. I am saying this because as far as the Ministry Headquarters is concerned, this project does net seem to appeal in the priority list of Nyeri District Development Committee which has been supplied to us. Perhaps the hon. Member could, assist us by asking the Kyeri District Development Committee to put this dispensary on their priority list. If we were given this information, we would act very fast indeed.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KURZTTHI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am wondering from where the Assistant Minister obtained this information . He is now saying that they do not have this information at their headquarters. Could he tell this House whether they have contacted the people on the ground in Hyeri to find cut exactly what is happening? I am asking this because those people who are manning the district officer should be in a position to advice the Ministry what is happening.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. GODANA: Mr. Deputy speaker, Sir, the information we attain at the Ministrys headquarters is gathered from the grassroots.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MI SOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do sympathise with the hon. Member who asked this question because it is quits apparent that the Assistant is giving a reply to the wrong Question. -This Question is asking the Ministry to open the Embaringo Dispensary since wananchi have completed the buildings as required by the Ministry. Therefore, how can the Assistant Minister get an answer from the Ministry headquarters Which does not seem to be answering, the Question. The hon. Questioner has told this House that the local health office at the district level has installed electricity wires in the premises of this dispensary. How can this he done without the knowledge of the Assistant Minister? He should now that the answer he has given to this How is absolutely unsatisfactory and we need your guidance, Mr. Deputy Speaker, as to whether we should accept this answer. I am saying this because it is net at all related to the practical situation at Embaringo Dispensary.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. GCDANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the hon. Masher must have been asleep when I was answering this Questions and if not, he must be somewhat confused. I am completely at a loss when he says that I have been answering the wrong Question. I have been answering Question No. 350 as asked by the hon. Mureithi.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MURDITHI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Mr. Misoi is quite right in what he said. I am saying this because the Assistant Minister himself has told this House that the information that he has obtained from the Ministry Headquarters clearly indicates that Embaringo Dispensary is not included in the current five year Development plan. What I would like to inform the Assistant Minister is that the ministry installed electricity wires in the premises of this dispensary -and that this dispensary now complete and I have personally gone to see the Medical officer of Health Nyeri and be has assured us that the Ministery is going to open this dispensary. We have in turn held harambee on several occasions be raise funds so that this dispensary can be completed. could the assistant minister tell us why the efforts of wananchi should be wasted if this dispensary has not been incorporates, in the current five year development plan?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir I would like to assure the hon. Member that the efforts of wananchi have not beer, wasted. This Ministry has always given a promise to waranchi that if they contribute their resources to put up health facilities, the Ministry would take ever these facilities. However, the Ministry take over these facilities according to one laid down plans? because we have to have seme order in doing so, All the same, we cannot afford to take over all the health facilities in the countrysay, within a period of one year and that is why we have to ask for priorities from the district development committees. The district development committee in question may have given first priority to this particular dispensary for construction hut we have not been informed about it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LUREITHI: Mr. Deputy speaker, Sir, every districtis a member of the D.D.C. We also attend the D.D.C. meetings This is a matter that has been discussed by the D.D.C. Therefore it would appear that the Assistant Minister does not have the correct information. The way he is answering the Question is totally misleading. The Nyeri D.D.C. has approved this project. I do not know whether this information has reached the Ministry headquarters. But the position is that this matter had already been considered by the D.D.C. ever before wananchi started the construction of the dispensary. This is a project that has been going on for the last two and half years. Under the circumstance could the Assistant Minister go back and get proper information from the Medical officer of Health (M.O.H.) Nyeri so that he can give a satisfactory reply to this House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. the answer I have given to the House on this Question is the proper one. However I assure the hon. Member that with regard to any further information that he me need from our side we shall get it and supply to him.	</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Very well. Next Question, Mr. Tridom.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir, I think it is a custom of this House that when you ask a Question, you are given a written reply in advance on wondering now why I have received a written reply to my Question.</Newspeech>Question No. 353Delay in Paying Mr. Meriken's N.S.S.F. DuesMR. EKIDOR asked the Minister for labour what has delayed the payment of N.S.S.F. benefits to Mr. L.H. Meriker Membership No. 0210 141 75.Mr. Deputy Speaker left the ChairThe Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mureithi) took the Chair <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR( Mr. D.M. Amin): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The payment of N.S.S.F. benefits for Mr. D.M. Meriken I has been delayed because of the schedule of contribution forms sent to his former employer Pishermen Co-operative Society Lodward have not been received by the Fund. Mr. Meriken will be paid as soon as the Fund receives the schedule of contribution forms duly completed by his former employer.MR. EKIDOR: Sir, the Assistant Minister is misleading the House. It is not true that the schedule of contribution formshave not been sent to the Ministry. I have the copies of the forms here with me sent to the Ministry in January, 1990. Why should the Assistant Minister mislead the House now?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Sir, what I have said is quite true. The hon. Member has used unparliamentarily language and he should apologise to the House. Furthermore, as soon as we get copies of the forms he has, we shall pay the claimant.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Sir, it is the Assistant Minister who is supposed to apologise for misleading the House. I have all the documentary evidence here with me. In fact, I have a copy of letter sent to his Ministry. Why does he want me to apologise while he is the one misleading the House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Sir, I said we do not have that particular record with the hon. Member. Let him supply that information to us and then we shall pay the claimant his money.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. PALANA: Sir, I think we need your guidance hers. The hon. Questioner says that he has documentary evidence with him which the Assistant Minister says has not reached the office. We are confused who do are believe.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Sir, I said that we are here to help the claimant get his money. How, in our records, we do not have thatparticular copy with the hon. Member. Let him supply that information to us and we shall pay the claimant his dues.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASIKE-NDONBI: Sir, how cone that these forms which hon. Ekidor have are not with the head office yet they were processed through this office in Kitale? If they are lost, then it is the officer in Kitale who should be held responsible.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Sir, the Ministry is ready to help anybody with a problem and we are ready to help any claimant because the records he has, we are ready to pay this money even today. There¬fore, let him give us that particular copy since we do not have any record.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Sir, here is yet another Strange way of answer¬ing supplementary questions. The hon. Member has documentary evidence, which indie at that they have been signed and stamped in a relevant office. Therefore the Assistant Minister cannot just tell us that they do not have that particular document. It would appear that they never consulted that particular office where these documents were processed. There must be co-ordination between the headquaters and the district office so that we get right answers. Why is that not the case here?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Sir, I said that we are supposed to pay the money to anybody who is in a problem. But I said that we do not have this particular information in our office. If the hon. Member has a copy of this information, let him supply it to us and we shall the claimant.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Sir, can the Assistant Minister assure the House that immediately he receives this form, he will personally give me a cheque to take to the oldman?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Sir, we shall not give the cheque to the hon. Member, but to the claimant.</Newspeech>Question No. 379	Sale of L.R.No. 11130 	 	DR. MISOI asked the Minister for Co-operativeDevelopment when the farm L.R. 11130 in Uasin Gishu District was bought by the Wendani Bayette Co-operative Societies and how many acres each co-operative society will be allocated. 	 	 <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CO-OPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT (Mr.Ejore): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. The farm L.R. No. 11130 in the Uasin Gishu District was I 	bought by the Wendani Bayette Co-operative Societies in 1964.As this is a 555 acre farm, it is supposed to be sub divided by the two societies in the following manner:-The Bayette Co-operative Society is supposed to get 335 	acres while the Wendani Co-operative Society is supposed to get 320 acres. The Bayette and Wendani Co-operative Societies have not yet agreed on how the farm, should be divided.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Sir, I thank the Assistant Minister for the reply. But tills particular farm has a very long dispute which has gone to court. People have fought and some people have been hospitalised. Can the Assistant Minister explain the House why this issue has taken so long to be resolved? Even at the moment, the case is still pending and people have resulted into violence.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EJORE: Sir, I would like to give the hon. Member further information. In 1973, the Commissioner for Co-operative Development appointed an arbitrator to arbitrate on the disputed boundary and the award was delivered in favour of the Bayette Co-operative society. 	As soon as this award was awarded, the Bayette members who were the Wendani portion of land moved to their side while these Wendani members who were on the Bayette portion of land refused to move to their side. The dispute between the two societies was referred to a law court in 1976. Judgement was delivered in 1977, but the Wendani Cooperative Society was not happy with the judgement. Therefore, the Society appealed against it. The appeal was, however, rejected by the Court of Appeal on the grounds that it was time barred.Although the Lands Department proceeded and issued a Deed Planto the Bayette Co-operative Society after the 1977 ruling, the Wendani Co-operative Society is still opposed to the sub division of this farm.Sir, the two societies have an equal number of members 115 each. The Wendani Co-operative Society contributed Ksh.50,000/- while the Bayette Co-operative Society contributed Ksh.20,000/-. Therefore, the Bayette Co-operative Society is supposed to refund the Wendani Co-operative Society some Ksh.15,000/— so that each society will have contributed Ksh.35,000/- towards the purcse of this. farm. This is why the Provincial Co-operative Officer decided that the farm should be sub-divided into two equal parts.Therefore, the farm was sub divided into two equal parts by the Ministry of Agriculture. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, although the acreage is different, the two parts are equal when one takes into account the arable land in each part. Therefore, the Bayette Co—Operative Society is supposed to get 335 acres while the Wendani society is supposed to get 320 acres. Only nine Wendani members have refused to move to their side from the Bayette side. The nine Wendani members could be evicted for defying a court order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MIS0I: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has given an elaborate answer and I appreciate it. Perhaps the issue of the appeal case being time-barred is beyond the Assistant Minister's responsibility, but what was the agreement between these two societies? If there was an agreement, then this conflict would not have arisen. I am talking about people who are even ready to fight and others who have been injured. This is a very serious matter. Could the Ministry come out with a permanent solution that will satisfy these people and also protect those who may be further injured?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EJORE: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry tried its best to ensure that the two societies agreed on the acreage allocated to each of them. The Ministry also tried to ensure that that agreement was upheld by these two groups. Up to now, our co-operative officer in Uasin Gishu District, and even the Provincial Co-operative Officer are assisting. I believe even the hon. Member can also work in conjunction with our Ministry so that another good meeting can be convened for the two groups to discuss the issue and settle it. However, there is some politics involved and I am appealing to the hon. Member to assist us so that that element is removed and the matter settled peacefully.</Newspeech>Question No. 369 Repair of Fish Banda/OfficeMR. JALANGO asked the Minister for Regional Development in view of the reluctance of SVR Holdings Limited to repair the Fish Banda/ Office (damaged by their vehicles) belonging to the Luanda Kotieno Fisheries Co-Operative Society, whether he could , intervene and order the company to repair the premises immediately.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Okwara): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Ministry has already taken appropriate action whereby the SVR Holdings Limited was directed to repair the building immediately. The material for Fish Banda/Office has already been dispatched to the site and the repair work is expected to start soon.I would like to clarify that the company was not reluctant to carry out the repairs. What happened is that some material which was sent to the landing site disappeared under some mysterious circumstances. That is why the company took time to supply fresh material for repair. We, in the Ministry, are therefore satisfied that the repair work is now in the process of being carried out.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. JALANGO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, just for general information, the SVR Holdings is a company owned by very unscrupulous and very ungrateful businessmen who, apart from exploiting the fishermen in the area, do not even have the interests of Kenyans at heart. That is why late last year, when they knocked down the fish banda belonging to the Luanda Kotieno FishermenCO-OPERATIVE Society which was in October despite persistent requests including personal visits, they flatly refused to repair it until the Ministry of Health has now closed the offices of the: Society, whose membership is about 300.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: What is your question?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. JALANG'O: You are not the Speaker and I am giving background information. The' Society has 300 members who have over 3,000 dependants. Can the Assistant Minister tell us when the materials were actually delivered on sight because I was there on Tuesday, this week and nothing had been delivered?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. 0KWARA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as soon as we got information that this was the case, the Ministry took up the matter with this particular company. We were informed that the materials were being move as at the beginning of this week.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am happy that the Assistant Minister has directed those concerned to repair this particular facility However, could he tell us why the Ministry could not do that until a question was raised in this House? Who was negligent? Can we be told what action will be taken against those people who never act, like in this instance, on time?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. 0KWARA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the information had not reached us but, as soon as that information was passed on to our office, we took action.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.I. MOHAMMED: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, to avoid unnecessary suffering to those who we're using the office, can the Ministry direct those who damaged it to put up a temporary building, while they are repairing the old one?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKWARA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if that is found to be necessary, I do not see any problem with complying.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to just assume? He is putting a condition.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKWARA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, my answer to hon. A.I. Mohammed's supplementary question was in the affirmative.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. JALANG'O: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I seek your guidance. According to the official reply given by the Assistant Minister, the material has already been dispatched to the site. As far as. I have concerned I came from the constituency only last Tuesday there is no material on site. Whom do we believe between the Assistant Minister and me? If I am to be believed, the Assistant Minister should withdraw his reply.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKWARA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I cannot stand here to give a reply for the sake of it. We directed the company concerned to repair this particular shed, and it informed the Ministry that it has taken the material in question to the site, and we believed that. If the hon. Member</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. FALANA: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister says that he did not stand here to give a reply just for the sake of it. However, I sympathies with our Front Bench colleagues because they are given some answers by their officers, and then they come and contradict themselves here. In his earlier reply, as the hon. Member says, he said that he had been informed that these things are on site. Later on, however, he turned back to contradict himself by saying that he has been informed that the material will be there as from the beginning of this week. Which is which? Could he be very specific and tell this House whether these things have been delivered or not? If they are not there, could he make a follow up? If he does not know what he is saying-he should tell the House, Unfortunately, I am sorry I do not know what I am saying.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKWARA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the unfortunate thing here is that some hon. Members do not listen when we reply to Questions here. Instead, they keep on talking to themselves. I gave a very clear answer and, as of now, I just ask the hon. Member to check over the weekend whether the material is not on site and let us know. In any case, the material is there.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. JALANG'O: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in order to sort out this issue, could the Assistant Minister be kind enough to send his fisheries officer to the site? I was there myself and did not find the said material on site. We are here to help one another. Could he telephone the Siaya DistrictFisheries Officer to visit the site and brief him fully? This would help this House more than mere arguing.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKWARA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will certainly contact my officer in Kisumu to find out whether the material has not been delivered as promised.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Assistant Minister because he is now coming up with the right answer. Could he tell us when this work will begin?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mureithi): Mr. Okwara, what the hon. Member wants to know is when you are going to come here with information as to whether the material has been delivered to the site or not.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKWARA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the fact is that we were assured that the material has arrived on site and that work was to start immediately but, because the hon. Member for the area insisted that he did not see the material on site last week, I said that I will have to telephone my officer and if the material is not there, we will instruct</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEWA: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister does not seem it know which officer he is going to refer to. The hon. Member is talking about an officer in Siaya while the Assistant Minister is talking about an officer in Kisumu. Could he be specific and tell us who the officer he is going to contact is?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKWARA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Siaya falls under Kisumu Provincial Office.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I was beginning to praise my friend, but it now seems that he has not given us the correct answer. We are of the opinion that once he contacts his officer in Kisumu, the Assistant Minister would bring the correct answer here. However, he has said that this will be done immediately. The word "immediately" has no definition in the dictionary. What does he mean? We want to know when we are going to get the correct answer.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mureithi): Mr. Okwara, I think you should assure hon.

I promise to come back here with the reply next Thursday.</Newspeech>Question No. 351Cash Payment Centres for Tea Farmers in Kitutu MasabaMR. A.H.O. M0MANYI asked the Agriculture whether he could instruct the Kenya Tea Development Authority (K.T.D.A.) to establish cash payment centres to serve all farmers earning less than Shs.1,000/- in order to reduce unnecessary expenses incurred by small scale farmers in Kitutu Masaba Constituency.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Kones): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.My Ministry has no plans of increasing cash payments from Shs.500/- to Shs.1,000/- for small scale tea growers.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.H.O. M0MANYI: That is a very serious reply, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, because my tea farmers at home aire given Shs.500/- in cash, and they have to go to the bank for any payment above this amount. Transport costs are very high. From my place to Kisii Town costs Shs.120/-, and when you deduct this amount from Shs.500/-, you remain with Shs.380/- and this is not enough. Since the President increased the rate of payment from Shs.1.90 to Shs.3/- per kilogramme of tea, could the Assistant Minister be kind enough to ask the K.T.D.A. to double its rate of cash payment to Shs.1,000/-?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KONES: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, while I share the views of the hon. Member, there is a lot of risk involved in carrying cash with no security. This constituency in particular brought a Question here sometime in 1987 asking the K.T.D.A. to increase cash payments from Shs.200/- to Shs.500/ and this was done, with a view to farmers doing everything to open bank accounts. What the hon. Member should now be asking is simply to get the Kenya Commercial Bank or any other banks to open a branch in Nyamira Town to facilitate easy transport for farmers. If we increase this amount from Shs.500/- to Shs.1,000/- the next time, the hon. member will come here and ask for another increase fromShs.1,000/- to Shs.2,000/-, and we will continue to ay cash. This is not the idea; the idea is to try to encourage farmers as much as possible to open bank accounts.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the point here is to help these farmers who earn so little money to reduce unnecessary expenses that they incur every month going to collect so little money. The hon. Member asks whether the K.T.D.A. could increase cash payments to Shs.1,000/=. The risk involved in carrying Shs.500/= and Shs.1,000/= is the same. Could the Assistant Minister instruct the K.T.D.A. to find a way of increasing this amount of money or using the Kenya Post Office Savings Bank so that farmers can get their money near their homes or wherever they deliver their tea leaves? We are talking about small scale farmers who suffer a lot, and we must be sympathetic.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KONES: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I agree with the hon. Member, but what I am saying is that if we keep on increasing this amount, the situation might get out of hand at one stage. We increased the amount in 1987 from Shs.200/= to Shs.500/=. We cannot continue to increase the amount indefinitely. We should be asking for payment centres, bank facilities, to be brought nearer the farmers. For the interest of the House, I would like to mention that the K.T.D.A. handles about 153,000 small scale farmers, and we are not going to treat Masaba in isolation.	 We are not to treat Masaba in isolation: If this is going to heaccepted it will be country wide, which will involve a lot of money.If we increase it from Shs.500/- to Shs.1,000/- that will be doublethe risk yet if any robbery occurs, I am sure the hon. Member will come back and raise the matter in this House. We would like to avoid robbery of a large sum and at the same encourage farmers to open accounts so that they learn how to use their money better. I do not think somebody would go to the bank and withdraw all his money and use it up the same day; I would like to see the situation where the farmer plans the usage of his money. Also incase the farmers would like to have some loan advances from the bank they will have an active account with the bank. If we encourage a situation where people are receiving their money in cash and using it up they will not have bank borrowing power and we will not be helping them in any way.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, currently the tea issue is very sensitive and we would not like to do anything that would affect farmers production capacity. The Assistant Minister has, surprisingly, talked of lack of security when transporting cash money. I do not know whether he is implying we axe short of security personnel when ferrying money to farmers. The farmers need some incentive and also a reduction in the expenses they incur when they travel to receive payments. we appreciate the Assistant Minister's suggestion the hon. Member asks banks to open branches in Nyamira Town, but this is a long term measure; the hon. Member is talking of an immediate solution to a persistent problem. Could the Assistant Minister now consider transporting the money under security escort if there is lack of security for escorting money in transit, let him tell us to pay farmers?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KONES: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir, I am nottalking only of armed police security, but also the security involved in handling cash money. The bank personnel are trained to handle cash, but green leaf clerks or k.T.D.A. managers are not. So there are two risks involved, namely where cash can be stolen and where you are using untrained personnel to handle that same cash.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.H. MOMANYI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, is the Assistant Minister in order to say that people who handle from their pockets are not trained? Can he tell us what he means by that? Again the Assistant Minister knows very well that Nyamira a is a new district and there is no bank there. How these tea farmers were transferred from Kisii to Nyamira and I am asking him to assist us have to get a bank in Nyamira.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KONES: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think we are almost going round in circles. I have told the hon. Member to ask banks now to open branches in Nyamira Town. I appreciate that Nyamira Town is the headquarters of the new Nyamira District and the hon. Member telling us that banks do not want to open branches in Nyamira Town, he should be talking to them to do so to facilitate easy payment to these farmers.</Newspeech><Header>QUESTIONS BY PRIVATE NOTICE</Header>Pension Payments to Mr. OngaloDR. WAMEYO Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Vice-President and Minister for Finance the following Question by Private Notice.When will Mr. Clement K. Ongalo, No. APIT/PC/2749. receive his pension for the months of October, 1939 to April, 1990?<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I beg to reply.Mr. Clement K. Ongalo, No. APN/PC/2749, has, in fact, been paid all his pension from October to December, 1939 and January to April, 1990.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, what evidence then does the Assistant Minister have that Mr. Ongalo has been paid. If he has it, may know the cheques numbers used to pay him?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEAH: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not have the cheques number here with me, but I can, certainly, have them given to Dr. Wameyo. What I am saying is true because I have the following information. Mr. Ongalo's pension for October to December, 1939 was paid to him. through P.O. Box 635, Mumias, which he had supplied to us. However, on 3th January, 1990 my office received information to the effect that Mr. Ongalo had not received his cheque. Upon receipt of this letter from Mr. Ongalo we immediately asked the Central Bank of Kenya to stop payment of those cheques. Then the bank confirmed to us that payment of those cheques had been stopped, we issued other cheques which, according to the information available to us. I believe Mr. Ongalo has received. May I say that we have not received those cheques at the Treasury and I can, certainly their numbers in the course of next week.In so far as the cheques for February and March, 1990 are concerned, these have also been dispatched to Mr. Ongalo but have again been returned from the post office to which they were sent. We appear to have a problem and I would ask Dr. Wameyo assist us in some way. We have on record three post office box numbers, namely 143, 336 and 635, Mumias all relating to Mr. Ongalo. Perhaps. Dr. Wameyo would be kind enough to let us have the exact postoffice box number to which Mr. Ongalo would like his cheques sent and we will, certainly, oblige. I can certainly get the cheque numbers; it is only that we I have had only one day to assemble the answer to this Question. Thank you, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WAMEY: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for that elaborate answer he was we11 aware that this House would definitely ask for the cheque numbers. if it is true Mr. Ongalo's cheques have been sent to him through those post office box numbers, I find unbelievable that the post office has been returning them and I think we need a more straightforward answer as to why these cheques are not getting to their destination.</Newspeech>		<Newspeech>MR.KEAH: With due respect, Sir, that is as straight as	I can be and if hon Wameyo wants me to be even straighter, I willdo so I have given him the cheque number let him, therefore, wait for the cheque</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr.Mureithi): Next question</Newspeech><Header>Adjudication of Nkondi Settlement Scheme</Header><Newspeech>MR.KAGwIMA: Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Lands, Housing and Physical Planning the following Question by Private NoticeWhen was Nkondi Settlement Scheme in Tharaka Division declared an adjudication area?When will the title deeds be issued to the residents? </Newspeech><Header> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICALPLANNING </Header><Newspeech>(Mr.Mutiso): Sir, I beg to replyThere is no Nkondi Settlement Scheme in Tharaka Division, "what is there is Nkondi Adjudication Section which was declared on 19th March, 1975Once the adjudication orocsss is completed, title deeds will be issued and after the current boundary dispute has been finalised</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.KAGWIMA: The first part of the reply is not correct What I know is that Nkondi Adjudication Section was firstdeclared in 1904 According to the Assistant Minister, this section"	was declared in 1975 Now, would it really take about 15 years tocomplete a small area?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MUTISO: Perhaps, I would give the hon Member the following information:	absence of an amicable solution, could he ensure that those whose pieces of land had been adjudicated get their title deeds?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MUTISO: Sir, I cannot give the number of pieces of land which were adjudicated Land adjudication process entails a lot of work and it involves a whole sublocation Title deeds cannot be issued to a section which had been adjudicated because the whole area list to be completed as one unit before title deeds can be given</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.KAGWIMA: Sir, it seems the Assistant Minister is not able to answer this Question because he was not given proper information He started by giving us the wrong year when this area was declared an adjudication section He does not even know the number of pieces which were adjudicated before the dispute arose My request is that can the Assistant Minister go back and get proper answer as to when this area was first declare an adjudication section, how much work has been done and, if possible, provide names of the people and temporary numbers of the pieces of land which were adjudicated?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MUTISO: I must go by the records I have If the hon Member is disputing that adjudication process in this area started earlier than 1975 then I am not aware This is the information which is available in my Ministry Even if the process had reached halfway before the eruction of the disoute, we cannot give title deeds before the whole area is done because it is one unit, when the whole process is done to the required standard, it is only then that title deeds are issued</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.KAGWIMA: Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not think it is clear to the Assistant Minister what this means As we speak now, the Ministry of Regional Development, through the National Irrigation Board, is supposed to undertake a project costing about KShs200 million in that area But this project cannot be undertake until proper land ownership has been established in the area What we are saying is that the residents of that area are being denied this facility This is money borrowed from outside and it is likely that it may be diverted to other areas If the hon Assistant Minister came" from that area, would he be happy to see such a project not being undertaken just because proper land ownership has not been established? If the Assistant Minister is really serious about his work, why can he not go back and send his senior officers from the Ministry headquarters to their Meru office and find out the truth rather than giving us a sketch answer from the people on the ground who have not endeavoured to do any job? Otherwise, if you are asking the same man who has committed mistakes to correct them, he will continue lying to you</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MUTISO: Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, certainly, if there were quite conving reasons of sending a senior officer from the Ministry to Meru, we would do so However, as the matter stands now, this dispute was referred to the Council of Elders of Meru to find out a workable solution so that the work of adjudication could continue Up to now, the Ministry is waiting for that solution The hon Member, who sits in the district development committee, could try and influence the elders to solve this problem, which is a dispute involving land which is assumed to be a clan land, whereas formerly it was a trust land When adjudicat¬ion work started, the issue of clan land came up and the two groups started fighting Therefore, we are still waiting for the solution from the Njuri Njeke From there we will proceed We are willing to assist in the matter, but the solution lies entirely with the Meru people</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.LEWA: Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, is the Assistant Minister, therefore, telling the House that because of this dispute as to whether that land was trust land or clean land, those three years were, in fact, wated and no work</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.LEWA (ctd): was done and that he is now waiting for the dispute to be settled so that he can start all over again?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MUTISO: Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not telling the House that the three years were wasted What I am telling the House is that the work proceeded well during the three years until the problem arose</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.LEWA: On a point of order, Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir The Assistant Minister says that the work was done! but a few minutes ago I asked him to tell us how much work was done and he said he did not know anything about that Can he now tell us how much was done during the three years?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MUTISO: Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is not easy for me to say here and now how much work was done in the three years When the processwas still taking shape As I have said, land adjudication work is a very tediousjob which entails surveying and marking boundaries When this process was continuing, the dispute arose and, therefore, it is not easy for me to say how much work was done I cannot say how much walking was done oh the land during the three years</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.AI MOHAMED: On a point of order, Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir We seek your guidance here Three years is not a short time If the hon Assistant Minister does not have the necessary answer with him, can he go back and find out how much work was done during those three years so that he can bring a satisfactory answer to the House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MUTISO: Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I did tell the House that in the three years period when there was no problem, some amount of work was done However, it is not easy for me to say here and now how much that work was If the hon Member wants to know how much walking was done on the land  that is what land adjudication entails  I can go back and bring the information to him However, the information will not be of any great use for the House We need to adjudicate the whole area for the benefit of the Meru people, but that cannot be done until the dispute is settled by the Meru people themselves</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.KYONDA: MrTemporary Deputy Speaker, "Sir, the Assistant Ministeris either misleading this House deliberately or he was misled by the officer whogave him this information because the hon Questioner says that the work startedin 1964 and the Assistant Minister is telling us that it started in 1975 We knowthat in offices people come and go and, maybe, there was an officer who perhapsdid not bother to put the records straight Since, as the hon Questioner hassaid, there is a huge project which will not benefit the people of Meru if thisadjudication work is not done, could the Assistant Minister go back and be thoroughin his work by first of all finding out when the work really started? HavingGovernment officers working in an area for three years is a long time, and there easiermust have been some work done I do not think it is for the Assistant Minister to tell us how much

us</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MUTISO: Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Ministers or even civil servants work in offices and go, but the records remain The records that I have been supplied with show

barabara ambazo bado hatujaweka lami, tunajaribu kuzifanya zipitike, hasa wakati wa mvua Ninafurahi kwa kuwa, nilipozuru sehemu kadhaa ili kujionea jinsi kazi inavyoendelea, nilishuhudia kwamba kazi inaendelea vizuri Ninge-penda pia kutoa shukrani kwa zile serikali zinazotusaidia kupata misaada ya kutuwezesha kuweka lami katika barabara zetu ambazo nitaelezea zaidi wakatiwa kutoa makadirio ya matumizi ya pesa katika Wizara yangu / Kuhusu Hoja hii, nafurahi rahe Bidu wa Mawakilisho ya Kinangoaliiwasilisha hapa na, kwa sababu ni nia ya Serikali kufikisha maendeleo katika wilaya zote nchini, wananchi wa Kwale ni karaa wananchi wengine wa Jamhuri hii yetu na Serikali yetu itawasaidia jinsi itakavyowezekana Ningetaka kuwahakikishia wananchi wa Kwale, hasa upande wa Kinango, kwamba Serikali inayajali na kuyalinda maslahi yao Ni hivi juzi tu tulipowapatia greda za kurekebisha barabara katika Wilaya ya Kwale na kwa sasa zinafanya kazi vizuri Hii si katika sehemu ya Kwale peke yake, bali tumetoa greda hizo kwa wilaya mbali mbali za Jamhuri hii yetu Ningependa kuwaomba Wabunge, wanapoona kazi haiendelei vizuri mahali fulani, watujulishe mara moja ili tuchukue hatua ifaayoBw Naibu spika wa Muda, tuko hapa kama viongozi wa mstari wa mbele, kama Mawaziri, Mawaziri Wasaidizi ama Wabunge kwa pamoja Serikalini tuna wajibu mmoja kuona kwamba kuna maendeleo katika kila sehemu ya nchi hii Ningewasihi Wabunge wote wayatumie mamlaka yao kupitia kwenye kamati za maende¬leo wilayani ill mapendekezo yatoke wilayani Hapo ndipo mipango inaweza kupa ngiwa vizuri kwa kuufuata mtindo uliowekwa na Serikali ili kusambaza maendeleo kote nchini Naamini kwamba maofisa wangu wote nchini wanafanya kazi zao vizuri na ningependa kuwaomba Wabunge wawe wakininongonezea wakati wowote wanapoona maofisa wangu wakikosa kutekeleza wajibu wao Umefika wakati ambapo watu wote nchini wameamka na tungetaka, vile vile, wafanyakazi wa Serikali watilie mkazo kazi zote wanazofanya Nimefurahishwa na jinsi wafanyakazi wa Wizara yanguwanavyofanya kaziBw Naibu Spika wa Muda, hivi majuzi tulikuwa upande wa Pwani na tuliweza kuona jinsi Wizara yangu inavyofanya kazi huko, hata ingawa kuna mipango mingi ambayo bado inatayarishwa Kama nilivyosema hapo awali, nita kuja kusema mengi kuhusu mipango ya Wizara yangu nitakapokuwa nikizungumzia makisio ya Wizara yangu hivi karibuniHoja hii ina madhumuni ya kufanya maendeleo huko Kinango, Wilaya ya Kwale na Serikali haiwezi kuipinga Hoja kama hii Shida iliyoko ni kwamba Wizara yangu imepewa kiwango kidogo cha pesa na tutaweza tu kufanya mambo yetu kulingana na kile kiasi tutakachopatiwa na Hazina ya Serikali kwa kurekebisha na kutengeneza barabara Vile vile, tutaendelea kuomba misaada kutoka kwenye nchi zilizo marafiki wa Kenya Ninafurahi kwamba Wabunge wanaihurumia Wizara yangu kwa sababu ya upungufu huu wa fedha, na naamini huruma hiyo itatupatia bidii ili tuone kwamba mawasiliano ya barabara yanakabiliwa ifaavyoKabla sijamaliza, ningependa kuongeza jambo dcgo tu hapa Katika Hoja hii, mhe Mbunge amemalizia kwa kuomba Hoja yenyewe itekelezwe "katika Mpango wa Maendeleo wa 1988/93" Tunajua kwamba miaka mitatu sasa imepita tangu Mpango huu wa Maendeleo wa 1988/93 uanze Pengine itakuwa vigumu kupata pesa hizo kwa muda uliobaki, ingawa tutajaribu iwezekanavyo Lakini, ili tusi toe ahadi ya uwongo, ningependekeza sentensi hiyo ya mwisho inayosema "katika Mpango wa Maendeleo wa 1988/93" iondolewe na tuingize maneno, "pesa zitakapo— patikana" AhsanteTHE MINISTER FOR MARKETING AND SUPPLIES

kwamba anajibidiisha kabisa kutoa huduma za  barabara katika sehemu zote za nchi na kuona kwamba zote zitawekwa lami pesa zikipatikana Ningetaka kurapongeza pia, pamoja na maofisa wote walioko kwenye Wizara yake, kwa kazi ngumu inayofanywa na Wizara hiyo Kwa hakika, barabara za Kenya ndizo msingi wa raaendeleo na uchumi wa nchl hli Ijapokuwa sisi kama viongozi na hata wananchl tungetaka kuziona barabara zote zikiwekwa lami, tuna fahamu kwamba kuna tatizo la ukosefu pesa si kwamba pesa za Serikali hazina kikcxno Kuna uchache fulani wa pesa hizi na ni lazima Wizara zote zigawanyiwe kiasi fulani kwa njia inayofaa		Kwa sababu hii, tunamwunga mkono Waziri kwa kuibadilisha Ho jaiihii  Ningependa kuichukua fursa hii kumsaidia Waziri na maofisa wake katika kazi yao ngumuJambo la kuwanz linahusu kuorodheshwa kwa barabara katika Kenya     , 	 Barabara zote zinaffia kupeja nambari au utaratibu wa kimaendeleo Tunajua kwamba barabara zikipewa riambari, huwa zimewekwa katika mpango? wa urekebishaj i Tangu tuunyakue Uhuru, kuna sehemu nyingi nchini ambako hakujakxlwa na mpango wa kutengeneza barabara mpya Kwa mfano, kuna barabara moja ndogo kule Tarafa ya Kaloleni, Kilifi, ambayo ni

Mibei a very cool mind considering he talks in this House and comforts us I an not implying that he only talks, but I would sayhe is a perfect Irlinister If his field officers would emulate himin their implementation of projects, this would help us a lot. We alwaysknow that we always have financial constraints, but with the personnel and	machinery even if tarmacking roads is unafordable for sometime  constant maintenance of the roads would keep us going it would be very difficult for the ministry to tarmack all the reads in the country at ago The Ministry can tarmack the roads according to priorities, but all roads should be properly maintained and graded because there is need for thatWith those few remarks, I beg to support </Newspeech> 	That the	words	to be left out	be	left out, proposedQuestion	of the	first part of	the	amendment,that the	words to be left	            out be left out,out and agreed to						Question	of the	second part of	the	 amendmentthat the	words	to be inserted in 	 place             	Thereof be inserted proposed				Question	of the	second part of the amendment		that the words to be inserted in place thereof 				Be inserted, put and agreed to				Question	of the	Motion as amended		proposed)(Question of the first part of the amendment)<Newspeech> MR.

cha pesa kinachohitajika kitakatwa na kupelekwa Kinango kuite ngeneza barabara hiiNikizidi kutoa shukrani zangu, ningemtaka Waziri wa Uchukuzi na Mawasiliano aziangalie sana barabara katika sehemu ya

Machakos</Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR.KYONDA: Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the follow¬ing Motion:—THAT, in view of the fact that the incessant inaccessibility of road Nos C99, ie Machakos Ukia—Emali C109, ie UkiaKilala D514, ie KilalaWote E705, ie MakueniNziu and E708, ie WoteKiangini, paralizes the only means of trans-port and communication between the headquarters of the current Machakos District and that of the forthcoming Makueni District at Wote this House urges the Government to tarmac these roads within the current Development Plan (1988/93) so as to provide the residents of these districts with a reliable and durable means of transport and communi¬cation	The operating words here are reliable means oftransport and communications"It has been said here before that roads are a prerequisite for developmentin any country Therefore if we are going be successful in agricultureif we are going to be successful in the development of cur education orany other form of development, we need proper means of communication So,in this Motion, we are asking the Government to provide our people with properroads in order to have easy means of transport What is more is important, that is we are asking for our share in the national cake The areas throughwhich the roads referred to in this Motion pass have a lot of problem when it comes to the transportation of agricultural produce, during the rairy seasons, these areas are completely cut off for ways or even weeks an which means that people in these areas cannot move forwards or backwards I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Minister for Public forks forthis area As I speak now, I am rure he rows what I am talking about because he was able to see for himself how can these reads area.Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, His Excellency the President has on several occasions talked about the main road linking Machakos to Makueri. I remember that on 8th of june last year. When he visited konga to preside ever a big Harambee meeting there, he mentioned about this road and called upon the minister for public works to start working on this particular road. This matter has now been made much mere urgent bythe fact that very seen Makueni will be the district headquarters and the offices there are nearly completed and the staff houses are new under construction Let me hasten to say here, Sir, that the progress of the construction work has been hampered by lack of proper road communication These raods have now been worsened by the recent rains ana the cons true tier, work has beer, stopped for a long time new hater means is that it will take much longer to have the offices and staff houses at Makueni complete do Consequently, it is going to cost the Government more to complete this work although it was estimated to cost much less This is all because of the poor state of roads in this area.  	The Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are not being selfish in asking the Government to consider tamacking these roads because these roads will cater for many constituencies and rot just Makueni Constituency, When I talk about Roadthis is the road that goes from Machakos and passesthrough kirome Constituency which neighbours Makueni Constituency and then on to Mbooni Constituency The Motion also talks about ten reads in Central division of Machakos district which cover about 70 kilometres in Kirome Constituency and another 23 kilometres ir rsy constituency So, you can see that I am not being selfish and all I am asking the Governer to tarmac these reads so as to open up this area which is highly potential for agricultural development Therefore, Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, here I am talkirg about the improvement of roads, not only in my constituency, but also in other constituencies and I as saying that the Government should come out and open up this area, not only for the benefit cf Makueni, but also for the benefit of the whole of Machakos District, When I am talking about Road E708 from Vote to Kiangini, I am talking about the road that links Makueni to Kibwei and I am alone taking into consideration all the area south of machakos.Having said that I would like to say something that happened last Christmas. The situation in this area was terrible in that people who work in Mombasa, Nairobi,Kisumu and so on were strandedat Mukuyund in Kirome division and had to go back to wherever they had come from You can imagine how disappointed these people were some of them had stayed for a long time before going home to see their parents, gives or their loved ones and they had no alternative but to go back to town because they cculd not make it to their homes because the roads were impassable. Some of these people were carrying things to take home to their loved ones but they had to go back to their places of work imagine what loss that these people underwent and this was very unfortunate.The Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the poor state of these contributing to great less, not only to the people in this area,but to those in other constituency as well Therefore, I am appealing to the Government to look at this Motion kindly and accept it I rould like to appeal to the Minister not to try and amend the Motion. I would like him to accept it just in the way it has been presented so as to open up this area for development by tarmacking these roads Makuoni constituency, is said to be the granary of Machakos district and when we have good rains the entire population of Machakos district depend on Makueni for food In this area, we grow maize, sweet potatoes, beans and so on. So, when reads in this area are impassable when it rains, it means that we cannot transport our food to other areas or to the National Cereals and Produce Board stores in Kibwezi, Enali in Machakos and ever, here in Nairobi Some of our food sometimes just not at home 	What happened is that most businessmen, dealing in farm produce lowered prices. They said they had nowhere to take those things. As a result, the farmers suffer and they do not get enough for their sweat. The businessmen tell them that they can only give them so much not because they do not want to buy the produce, but because they will buy the produce at their own terms. We know the gazetted prices, but they refuse to buy at those  prices, therefore because farmers have nothing to do they end up by accepting the prices given   By unscrupulous businessmen. That i am saying therefore, is that An area that would really be developed and move forward, farmers work very hard, but instead of seeing the results of their sweat, a lot of this produce goes to waste.This is why I am saying this area needs to be opened up, and for this area to be opened up we need good and reliable roads. This is why I urge the Minister for Public works to take this lotion as it is and work should start as soon as possible.Sir,we have an area that is very good for cotton growing.we grow cotton in abundance and we use to grow a lot of cotton. Until very recently when we had a problem related to cotton. Iam sure hon Members are all aware of this problem. Thank God things are now improving. We hope that with the new prices and the new system of buying and paying farmers things will improve and farmers will goback to growing cotton   areas where things like coffee and tea do not grow, farmers depend a lot of cotton So, cotton being an important crop we depend on it and we need it in this country We used to send a lot of money importing cotton into this country, therefore this is an area where farmers should be encouraged to grow more cotton. we can encourage them by providing them with good and reliable roads. Sir, we have a cotton ginnery in the area and often they have had to import cotton from outside the country. At times they have had almost to close the ginnery sending away workers who depend on their salaries to support their familities. This is a vioious circle and it is a loss to the farmers and the governments. This is a big and modern ginnery. We might even have to import cotton from outside for the ginnery if it was working to its full capacity. But this would be impossible with the kind of roads we have in the area. Therefore, I urge the minister to consider this motion seriously because we are talking about the children of Nyayo in Makueni area and adjacent constituencies to benefit and to enjoy the fruits of their sweat because people in this area work very very hard. But as I have said before, a lot of produce goes to waste due to lack of roads.Let me hasten here to add, sir, that coming to Makueni area, as I have said before, and I repeat, it is the only constituency in the whole of machakos District without tarmacked roads. Sometimes we wonder why. How come that we have been forgotten all this time? How come that Makueni is the only constituency in the whole of machakos district without tarmacked roads? The only sign of tarmac we have is at the boundary as you pass through small on your way to Mombasa. We wonder why this is the case. When you go to other constituencies, you find plenty of tarmacked roads. It is high time now the minister for public works did something for Makueni Constituency. He should answer the question from people of this area. Why is it that it is only Makueni constituency that does not have tarmacked roads?   Sir, we are not requesting for tarmacked roads in Makueni area just for the sake of it. People in this area are very hard-working. They work very hard on their shamba. They also work very hard inThe field of education. I am said before for five years, we were the best in the whole of machakos District. But there are schools up on the hills which are difficult to reach. This is where even milk takes ages to arrive. Even to take books to those schools is also a problem. Also,it is a problem for teachers to move or even to move building meterials. The question is : why? Why? Therefore, I say that this an opportunity for the minister to try to bring us closer to the rest of the people in the district and the country as a whole. We only need to look around at the areas that are known in the country and also areas that have developed. These are areas with good roads and this is what we are requesting the ministry to do.we want to develop and move on. People are willing and they are also hard working.but we have found that roads are a big problem.  Sir, if you look at areas with good roads, you find that even old cars and lorries are able to move and do some work. But in areas with bad roads even new cars will find it difficult to move around. If they do you may find that you need a complete overhead or major service or something. I cannot remember the number of times I have been late going to meetings because something bad happens to my car. In fact, people say from Nairobi and other towns have literally stopped from going to their rural homes because it is impossible to do so and we know the implication of this matter. Therefore, I am appealing to the minister to look at the spirit of this motion. We are not only talking about Makueni area, but also the whole of machakos District because there are also other areas without tarmacked roads. Then we shall move to Kilome area with its fertile hills and also Mbooni area. I am sure they will be able to transport their vegetables to the market. So, we are talking of opening up these areas and also linking Makueni are with Mibwesi and other areas. This is the spirit of the motion.Sir, with those few remarks, I beg to move and request hon. Maingi to second the motion. </Newspeech>  	<Newspeech> MR.MAINGI: Thank you very much, Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to second this Motion moved by my friend and colle¬ague, hon Kyonda" I wish to thank hon Kyonda, the Member for Makueni, for hav¬ing brought this very important Motion I, too, understand the areas covered in the Motion, as we are neighbours and I am conversant with the problems that face the people in the areas As hon Kyonda said, a new district is soon being set up where we will have Ministries and their departments stationed, as soon as the necessary plans are finalised The areas referred to have terrible roads When you talk of Road C99, it starts at Machakos, through Katumani, Mumandu, Kola, Kivani, Ukia, Kilala and Wote This particular road caters for four divisions namely, Mbooni, Makuehi, Kibwezi and Kilome</Newspeech> <Newspeech> AN HON. MEMBER: Even Machakos</Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR. MAINGI: I agree, Sir, it covers even MachakosDuring the rainy season, I have seen people sleeping by the roadside for four good days when they are travelling home to go and enjoy Christmas festi¬vals with their people Finally, some do not make it to their homes This is a very impassable road and I can name a few places where the condition is very bad There are some very bad patches around Mumandu so that once a lorry gets stuck, no more vehicles can pass The same applies to Makombo, Kinui, Kitumbule, Kaiti and Makongo The Minister for Public Works had a trip to those areas and when I asked him his findings, he agreed with me that the state of the roads in question was very bad and that they needed something to be done on themI will now touch on the: Ministrys maintenance camps I do not know what is happening because, lorries and vehicles with more clearance cannot go through some sections of the roads The exhaust pipes of smaller vehicles must break down in such conditions Since, for sure, Makueni is going to become a fullyfledged district, it is high time the Ministry  and this House  considered having the required tarmack road Makueni itself is a dry area, but with potential as the farmers there grow a lot of cotton, as you have rightly heard from my hon colleague, Mr.Kyonda An increased production can be envisaged, with good roads We do not have sufficient cotton in the country presently and, therefore, we need to grow more Makueni is one of those areas that can produce this good quality cottonSir, when Government officials are taken to Makueni District, they will, inevitably, have to eat As Makueni area is dry, they will need a supply of vegetables like :abbages, fruits like mangoes and all sorts of food The area is supposed to be supplied with these commodities by the Mbooni Constituency, which is a hilly area with a lot of tomatoes, cabbages and even sugar cane for those who want to sweeten their mouths Kilungu, which is also on a hill, produces a lot that can supply the Makueni people I think in a very short time, say in a months time, or two, the1 Makueni District Headquarters will be ready for use I know this because I have been there We need to do something urgent about thatWe had a Harambee fundraising meeting the other day at a place called Kalanzuni in my constituency and a Government directive was made to the effect that something should be done I am sure this House will effect that development We have: the Makueni District Hospital and many times I have had to help transport sick people to that institution in my own vehicle In the process my vehicles exhaust pipe has broken and some other parts of the vehicle damaged because not many people in those areas have vehicles We had an Akamba bus, but this one has ahigh clearance, but it has stopped operating on that route This is because the company was making losses because of constant repairs After one or two trips the company had to withdraw their bus for repairs every time and, therefore, they had to give upSir, the sick people suffer a lot on the way to hospital You can imagine a pregnant lady, or somebody who is so ill he cannot walk, in a situ¬ation where there is no ambulance and the road is bad People really suffer In some cases, some patients, depending on the seriousness of their ailments, have to be referred to Makueni District Hospital but, that is a very difficult thing to do because of the condition of the1 roads Many people, therefore, diebefore they are transported to those other health institutions they could have been referred to It is therefore very important that this House passes this Motion so that this Government, thorugh the Ministry of Public Works, tarmacks these roadsAs a result of the road conditions, fares have shot up and it is only those people with their personal vehicles who normally ferry passengers, like patients who may need to go to Makueni District Hospital Perhaps, this House, and the Government, could think of assisting the people there with a Nyayo Bus That would assist a lot, as the roads in that area are in very bad shape and other transporters are not willing to operate there It is really very, very badMr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will touch a little bit on chief engineers Long before, we used to have camps as we do today along the roads in a district I wonder what happened because as I travel along our roads, I do not see people working on them What do the officers in the camps do? Are they really serious in minding the roads? This is something that has to be looked into The Chief Engineer, whoever he is, should constantly inspect roads and see whether the officers in the camps are workingRecently, we were given some graders to smoothen our roads, and the Minister for Public Works is aware of this However, these graders have so far done practically nothing Nothing has been done in all the 10 divisions of Machakos In some divisions only five kilometres have been worked on So, you wonder what is happening So, I kindly request this House to look into this issueWith these few remarks, Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg tosecond</Newspeech> (Question proposed)<Newspeech>  MR.MAKAU: Thank you very much, Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this very important Motion in respect of the new district of Makueni First of all, let me preface my contribution by thanking the Government for having seen it fit to carve a new district out of Machakos This new district has come as one tangible achievement of the Nyayo Government When you go to Wote, the headquarters of Makueni, you see a lot of construction taking place The Government is, obviously, going to use more them Shsl billion in the construction of the new district headquarters Those of us who come from the constituencies that make up the new district, that  is Mbooni, Kilome, Kibwezi and Makueni, are extremely thankful because that achievement of the Nyayo Government The President has taken personal interest in the creation of this new districtWhen the relevant district development committee and the Government decided that Wote is the most suitable place for the headquarters of the new district, the Govemment moved in and the construction of the headquarters is almost complete This is the only place where you can see a six storey building in Machakos We very thankful for this The people of Machakos and the whole Ukambani in general are, after seeing this tangible achievement, sure very much behind the Government, His Excellency the President and the ruling Party, Kanu this is how we are reciprocating our thanks to the Government of His Excellency President Moi and KanuHaving said this, let me point out that we are now facing a problem because the new district headquarters, Wote, is not accessible especially during the rainy season This means that it is not accessible from all corners You cannot reach Wote from Mbooni during the rainy season nor can you reach it either from Kibwezi or kilome During this season, one cannot even move from one side of Makueni Division to another The Motion is asking that in the present Development Plan, a tarmac road be constructed I am not suggesting that the Motion be amended alii am saying is that the Minister for Public Works should ensure that we have, at least, one tarmac road leading to the new disrrict headquarters in crder to make it accessible from Emali and Mbooni The tarmac road we have in Mbooni goes up to Tawa, which is less than 20 kilometres from Wote So, these two places can be connected so that people from Kibwezi, Mbooni and Kilome can reach the new headquarters We have seen the Government policy of bringing administration closer to the people and, as I said earlier, this is one of the biggest achievements that the Nyayo Government has made With a tarmac road between Mbooni and Wote, people would be able to move easily to see their district commissioner Most important of all, Sessional Paper No 1 of 1986 stresses the ruralurban balance For Wote to develop and establish smallscale industries, there is need for a tarmac roadEarlier speakers have mentioned the question of the productivity of certain areas Mbooni is a very fertile area where horticultural products, such as vegetables, are in plenty Wote gets its supplies from Mbooni and KibweziSo, we urge the Ministry Public Works to make sure that Wote is accessible at all times so that when industries start developing in Wote, people can move their products to other areas with ease As I said, I am not suggesting that the Motion be amended The Ministry of Public Works should, as I am sure it is doing, ensure that when the new district headquarters becomes operational, the district commissioner does not get stuck on the way for weeks or months during the rainy season My colleague, hon Maingi, has said that last Christmas people could not reach their homes in Makueni because their cars got stuck on the wayWe are actually very grateful to the Government for making wote the headquarters of the proposed Makueni District and are now asking the Ministry of Public Works to make that area accessible.Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I mast say the Ministry has device a lot in Mbooni Constituency in terns of access roads A number of them have been completed and work is goin or on the	access road from Kikima through Utangwa up to Mukuyuni where it joins the Machakos wote Road This will make it easy to transport vegetables from Mbooni, which is rich in horticulture production, to areas around Wote, which is drier In fact, Mbooni people are very happy because of the construction of these access roadsI would also like to point out that we have only two graders in Machakos while I thank the minister for having taken a personal initiative to get extra graders, these have now beer taken back to where they had been before Last week we Members of Parliament had a meeting with the district commissioner and the district engineer, who is a very understanding person, and agreed to ask the Ministry to provide the district with more graders so that roads can be made allweather to provide accessibility within the proposed district As the Mover of the Motion, hon Nayonda said, the biggest problem in the proposed Makueni District is lack of road infrastructure now that the construction of new district headquarters is over all main roads from Micwezi, kilome and Mbooni should be made all weather so that it will be easy to reach theheadquarters. Later or during the current development plan, for a start a portion of the Tawa Wote road, which is less than 20 kilometres can be tarmacked and another portion of small Wote Road is about 25 kilometres can be tarmacked Thereafter, the remaining portions of these roads can be tarmacked to link Wote and Machakos  Provision road infrastructure will result in fast development in this area because this area is good for oroduction of cotton among other	agricultural cropsWith those few remarks I beg to support the Motion</Newspeech> MRS. WDETEI: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to support this motion I want to say that it is the wearer who knows where the shoe pitches most Similarly the hon.  Members who come from the proposed Makueni District know exactly how the road infrastructure linking its four constituencies and even the main Machakos District is Last year when I went to Wote to visit my parents who live near that town, it took me and other passengers who were travelling in that direction 12 good hours of pushing buses and cars This is because the roads are bad, particularly during the rains After the rains the roads are ro more than tretches, ditches and rocks.This situation has persisted for a quite a number of years now I remember that in the 60s the Machakos Makueni Road used to be graded after every season In those days the present headquarters for the proposed district was a divisional headquarters But still the road would be graded twice in a year and in that way itremained passable and not dangerous to users In those days we one bus company, Makueni Bus Company, which had many buses and used to serve the area very well Other bus companies introduced their services in that route because the road was in good condition However now due to bad roads, the Makueni Bus Company has virtually died. All its buses were grounded because the repair costs were too high and it became uneconomical for the company to its buses other companies withdrew their services At one time the Akamba Public Road Services in that route but found it impossible to do so. Provision of services in that area is generally very poor Individual would businessmen who would like to venture into transport business have been discouraged because if one buys a new matatu, within that matatu will be damaged beyond repair due to the bad roadsMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the proposed MakueniDistrict is one of the most productive areas in the whole of the formerMachakos District if you at cotton production statistics dating back to the 60s you will see that Makueni used to produce nore cotton than any other part of Machakos so is Kibwezi and other bordering areas.Kibwezi grows a lot horticultural products and hakueni Constituency produces a very high yield of pawpaws and oranges. But most of these rot in the farms because very few transporters would like to come in and ferry away the produce then there is good rainfall we also get a lot of maise yield. This maize has to be bought by dealers who transport to either Machakos or Kibwezi however due to transport problems, a lot of this maize is stored and destroyed by weevils. You can see that there is a lot of wastage in this particular area just because the transport Hight now the ministry of Reclamation, Arid, semi-arid and Wastelands would like to do development, which is not possible because of this poor transportation network, how can the ministry give the people initiative to grow more crops which are beneficialto this countrys economy unless wananchi will be able to transport«their produce? The situation is pathetic I have travelled to allcorners of the proposed district and I know how bad the roads areTwo and a half years ago before hon Nyonda became a member of Parliamenthe had two beautiful peugeot cars but now one of them is a heap of metal and the other one is a junk yet he has to travel on those roads.	  Makueni is not too far from Nairobi If the road is good, youcan take about one and a half hours to Makueni Headquarters But if it not, you can even take five to six hours.As I said earlier on, there used to be fair maintenance of roads in the 1960s out the situation has now deteriorated a great deal what has happened? The Minister should find out that has gone wrong. Have the good workers of those years Disappeared? Is it that there is no money? Are there no good traders? Every year we vobe money for that Ministry and yet every hon Member here is crying over the poor state of roads. We should not be deteriorating in services in this country we should be improving instead we need a more improved method of maintaining the roads	What we are asking is a tarmac connection from Machakos District Headquarters. There is only one small road which was done by the colonialists in 1950s When Queen Elisabeth was visiting Machakos. That is the only existing road and the Ministry has not extended it even a distance of one kilometre  The small road connecting Machakos to Mombasa road is a killer road  If you drive on it, you will only be risking, your life This road was tarmacked in the 1950 and the Ministry cannot even put tarmac on it. The	 number of vehicles using this road has gone up greatly and we need to revisit where we have gone wrong The population of vehicles is going up, there is more business coming up and harvesting of sand is going up everyday and yet this is the only road in use.I am urging the Ministry to try and connect keys areas of that district with tarmac roads For instance, there should be tarmac roads between Emali, Machakos District Headquarters, Mbooni and Mibwezi. In this way, we will be connected effectively with the administration in Makueni If we cannot be connected vdth the district commissioner in Makueni, it will not even be possible to attend DDC meetings. Do you walk a distance of 90 kilometres? During the rainy season, it is not possible to reach vote the proposed new district headquartersI remember in April this year, there was no public trans¬port between Machakos Town and Makueni for one full week. This is because all transporters refused to put their vehicles on the road because it was impassable You can imagine, Sir, what happens when somebody falls sick in the interior narts of the district and he has to be rushed to Machakos Hospital as a matter of urgency That person cannot have hone of survival he will simply die there Sir, imagine the difficult time the women go through during delivery Some mothers face difficult deliveries and they need, to be rushed to the nearest hosoital for attention Even to get to Makueni District Hospital is very difficult, say, from areas like, Mathulumbi, Mambu and so onI urge the Minister to consider this Motion as an urgentMatter. We should also recommend the Tarmacking of this road.We should not amend it and say when finances will be available because that is directly killing the Motion We would like this motion to be taken up as proposed within this Development this period so that the wananchi can benefit. In this way we can encourage the farmers to produce more foodstuffsWith these few remarks, I beg to support</Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR. TERER: Thank you, Sir, for giving me this onporturity to support this timely Motion I would like to congratulate the Mover of this Motion which is calling for the improvement of road network in the proposed Makueni DistrictI had the opportunity to travel along the roads of the proposed district and I was of the opinion that they require a lot of improvement during the rainy season, nearly all these roads become impassable. It is necessary for this new district to have better, roadsThis morning, we were told that we have only 65,000kilometres of classified roads in this country he were also toldthat only 7,000 kilometres of our roads are tarmacked.

We have been told that Makueni is rich agriculturally but its products cannot reach the market. This District may lag behind. It needs a good road network so that it car take of the ground and catch up with the other districtsIn general, access roads all over the country should belooked into very seriously This is because unless we develop themwe shall not be able to get our produce to the market Coffeeand tea growing areas should have accessible roads throughoutthe year so that that produce can reach the marketSince the western countries are threatening to cut aidto Kenya, we should be more concerned about our roads so that wecan stand on our own as far as acquisition of foreign exchange is concerned we are going to be on our own as time goes on. 	In other words, we should try to be independent economically	The recommendations of the DDCs with regard to emphasis on roadsshould be looked into very carefully.</Newspeech> <Header> adjournment</Header> <Newspeech>  THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr.Tuva): Hon Members, it is time for the interruption of business The House is adjourned until this afternoon at 2.30 p.m.The House rose at thirty minutes past Twelve o’clock.</Newspeech>   	HANSARDWednesday, 18th July, 1990The House met at thirty minutes past two o’clock The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr.Tuva) in the Chair<Header> PRAYERS </Header> <Header> NOTICE OF MOTION</Header> <Newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT AND MINISTRYOF FINANCE (Mr.Kariuki): Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to giveNotice of the following Motion:	(l) THAT, pursuant to Section 6(i) of the External	Loans and Credit Act, (Cap.422 of the Laws of Kenya),this House approves the increase of total indebtedness for the    time being outstanding in respect of principal	amount of money borrowed or credit obtained under Section2 of the Act from the equivalent of Kenya K£4,200 million K£5,000 million	(2) THAT, pursuant to Section 3 (3) of the Guarantee(Loans) Act (Cap.41 of the Laws of Kenya), this House approves the increase of total contingent liability of the Government for principal amount for the time being out¬standing under the Guarantees given under Section 3 (I) or referred to Section 3 of the Act, from K£200 million to K£300 million in case of convenarts stressed in Kenya currency and from the equivalent IX, 1, 000 million to the equivalent of K£200 million in the case of covenants expressed in other than Kenya currency(3) THAT, A pursuant to Section 33 of the Guarantee (Loans) Act ( Cap.461 of the Laws of Kenya), this house approves an increase of the total contingent liability in respect cf the principal amount of money borrowed or credit obtained (under Section 3A(2) of the Act from K£5 million to K£10 million, (the Motor car Lean Scheme)<Header> ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS </Header> Question No.375	Decentralization of Power PersonnelMR.MURSITHI asked the Minister for Energy  in line with the Government Policy of District Focus for Rural Development, that steps he has taken to post personnel at the district and divisional level to facilitae the rural electrification programmed</Newspeech>  <Newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Moturi): Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.It is the policy of the Ministry of Energy to he represented at the district level like many other Government Ministries already district based in accordance with the district  focus for rural development strategy In this respect the it Directorate of Personnel Management of the Office of the President has already approved nine district vacancies to he filled at the iietric level However, this intention has so far been constrained by lack of financial resource:As for rural electrification programme, it is implemented through the Kenya Power and Lighting Company in line with the priorities, as identified by the District Development Committee and in accordance with the funds set aside for each particular project by the Government </Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR.

The actual construction work is programmed to start in Agust, 1990 and it expected to be commissioned in 1991.</Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR.MWAGZANDI: Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from Assistant ministers reply that the work has not been abandoned, would he not agree with me that the personnel on the ground is not available at the site.  	and that they have been moved to other areas where some big fellows have asked the Kenya Power and Lighting Company to give them preference in completing  their work there? why do they not first complete work on this project before moving on to other areas?</Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR.MOTURI: Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this project was approved towards the end of last year and the survey work started immediately After the survey work, was completed, design work had to he done at the office and as I have already said, the constructicn work on this project will start next month and I think the hon.

KAMUYU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, at is not good for the Assistant Minister to talk in broad ard general terms because here we are dealing with a specific project.

Assistant Minister is deliberately misleading the house. If he gives an answer for commencement of a project, he has to indicate how long it would take to complete the work. He is vague in his answer. Can he be more specific in his answer? </Newspeech>                  <Newspeech> MR.MUTURI: sir, I think it is the hon. Member who is misleading the House. The question was straight forward and I did answer it. I said that work had not been abandoned and construction work would start next month.

JALANGIO asked the Minister for Transport and Communications inview of the long delays in receiving letters posted to various post offices in Ranieda Division, if he could institute remedial measuresto improve the situation.       <Newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Mutwol): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply carriage of mails in the area is wholly dependent on the public transport which are reasonably regular and reliable, but whose schedules are ofter distrupted during the rainy seasons, causing some minimal delays in the arrivals. During such rainy season, due care is always taken to organize alternative routing to avoid undue delays. But as the road condition continues to improve, so will be the mail arrival schedules.</Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR. JALANGIO: Sir, I asked this question during the first session of this parliament, and the Minister promised to institute some remedial measures to ensure that mail is received on time throughout the 12 post offices in my division. Those measures have never been instituted, and today we are getting a different reply. What specific remedial measures is the Ministry taking to ensure that we receive mail on time?</Newspeech>          <Newspeech> MR.MUTWOL: Sir that was a different question. The area receives mail as follows: There are two departmental post offices. One Ndori Post Office receives mail daily from Monday to Friday, both from Siaya and Misumu Head Post offices. Second, Rangieni Post Office receives mail five times a week, that is from Monday to Friday, both from Misumu Siaya Head Offices. There are also eight sub-post offices which equally receive mail five times a week except Anyungi which receives mail three times a week from Bondo Post Offices.</Newspeech>   <Newspeech> MR. KIILU: Sir, since the Assistant Minister had promised that something was going to be donewhy did he bring a different answer to the House? Why can he not follow the first answer andtell us when this improvement will take place? </Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR. MUTWOL: Sir, I would have liked the hon. member to tell me if that mail received five times a week from Monday to Friday is a delay. Again there is not much difference between the answer I have just given and the previous one which the hon. Member claim was promised.</Newspeech> <Newspeech> THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva):  Maybe, I can help him tomake the question clearer Although letters might be arriving there daily, maybe they take two or three weeks to reach there. I think this is what the hon. Member is complaining about.</Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR. JALANGIO: Sir, you have just hit the mail on the head! The problem with the mail is that it passes through a circuit route. For instance, mail from Nairobi go first to Kisumu then from Kisumu to Siaya; Siaya to Ndori; Ndori to post offices in Rarieda. But the minister had promised that our mail would come directly. So, we are just requesting the ministry to give us the mail through a direct route? </Newspeech>                                                   <Newspeech>  MR. MUTWOL: Sir, mail has to go through Kisumu and then it is dispatched to other areas.</Newspeech>  	Question No 382               Allocation of Land in Assuyuriet Farm	DR. MISOI asked the Minister for Lands and Housing when the first allocation of land to individual members of Assuyuriet Farm in Uasin Gishu District was done and how many acres were given to Messrs Kipkoech Kogo and Kaptich Koech during that allocation<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND HOUSING (Mr.Bomett): Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I reply, I would like to point out that the name used here is actually mispelt It is a Kalenjin name and should read Assururiet instead of Assuyuriet I do not know the one referred to in the Question because it is not of Kalenjin origin However, I beg to replyThe subdivision of Assururiet Farm began in August, 1989 So far, 130 plots have been sub divided Mr.Kipkoech Kogo received 133 acres whilst Mr.Kaptich Koech was allocated 310 acres</Newspeech> <Newspeech>DR. MISOI: On a point of order, Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir While trying to hear the reply by theAssistant Minister, that has not been possible because of the loud "consultations" going on in the Chamber</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr.TUva): Order There is too much noise in the Chamber</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND HOUSING (Mr.Bomett): Mr.Temporar Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me then repeat the replyThe subdivision of Assururiet Farm began in August, 1989 So far, 130 plots have been subdivided Mr.Kipkoech Kogo received 133 acres, whilst Mr.Kaptich Koech was allocated 310 acres</Newspeech> <Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Assistant Minister for giving that answer The fact is that this land was initially sub¬divided some years back and people were given their portions awaiting the official subdivision, which the Assistant Minister hs just confirmed The two named persons have a dispute Could the Assistant Minister, therefore, assure the House that these two persons will be allocated their rightful shares, accord¬ing to their respective share contributions, in order to avoid the type of disputes and quarrels that are likely to take place?</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR.BOMETT: Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I donot know whether you also understood the supplementary question by Dr.Misoi  However, I think he asked whether we could give an assurance that we are going to do something to stop these two people from having disputes However, he did not say which of the two people should be assisted This is because we are not aware of any dispute The only thing I am aware is that the number of people increased from 93 to 130 by the time we came to sub—divide the plots Maybe this is what brought about the problems</Newspeech> <Newspeech>DR.MISOI: Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I also ask, through the Chair, that the Assistant Minister asures the House that a portion of the land will be set aside for public amenities? The proposal for that was not accepted by some of the directors Could the Assistant Minister assure this House that when the plotowners decide that they will require that portion for public amenities, like shops, clinics and so on, the surveyors will enact that wish and have the said plots set aside?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.BOMETT: Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it goes without saying and, in fact, the land belongs to the subscribers  the people who bought the farm  and not the directors my Ministry would support what the subscribers would like to do with their land, especially when they have to set aside a portion of land for public amenities</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr.Tuva): Next Question Mr.WambuaQuestion No 366 Refund of Deposits by Tropical Building SocietyMR.WAMBUA asked the AttorneyGeneral, since Messrs Moses Mutiso Kasiki, No.SA 20451, A/C No.021449 and Titus Wambua Musili, NOSA 20944, A/C No.0211206 had deposited their money with the Tropical Building Societys Savings Account, and in view of the fact that this Society has since been closed, whether he could assist these people get their money back</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Mr.Muli): Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply, but before I do so, let me say that the Tropical Building Societyhas generated many Questions in this House and, therefore, I have, prepared adetailed reply to fully explain the circumstancesSir, the Tropical Building Society was registered in August, 1984At the time of registration of the Society, there were ten investors, or directorsIn April, 1984, the Central Bank of Kenya, under the provisions of Section 63(a)of the Building Societies Act, carried out an inspection of the Tropical BuildingSociety and in June, 1988 the High Court of Kenya, in Nairobi, made a winding uporder in August, the same year The Official Receiver was then appointed theliquodator of the SocietyAs far as the Official Receiver is aware, apart from land NoNgong/Ngong5898, the Building Society has no other movable assets This property was sold andrealised a sum of Ksh230,000/80 The other amount of money remitted to the OfficialReceiver was a sum of Ksh232,000/ following a redemption of the mortgage on ahouse by a debtor of the Building Society making a total sum of Ksh462,000/—The liabilities of the Building Society stand at Ksh14,777,96460In view of the fact that the credit balance to the account of the/Building Society is small, chances of declaration of dividends in this matter in the near future are very slim The Official Receiver, as the liquidator of the Society, is still carrying out investigations with a view to estab-lishing whether the Society has any other assets Also, in view of the fact that the accounts were not properly kept, the Official Receiver has not up to now been able to locate some of the records containing lists of the persons who had deposited their funds with the Building SocietySir, from the above, it is clear that the Official Receiver is still trying all he can to assist depositors to get something from the Tropical Build¬ing Society, which is under liquidation The assistance will extend to all other financial institutions that have faced similar problems</Newspeech> 	 <Newspeech>MR.WAMBUA: Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I appreciate the answer given by the Attorney—General, but may I know how soon this will take because there are many other people besides Messrs Moses Mutiso Kasiki andTitus Wambua Musili who need about Shs4,000/= How soon will these people bepushed in order to pay back the people who had deposited money with their institution?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.MULI: Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the only money that is available from the two sources, namely, sale of the land and redemption of the  law court, amounts to Shs462,000/=, but the companys liability is Shs147 million So, there must have been many more depositors that these two named here, and I have said that the official receiver is trying to find out who they are Even if they are all listed down, the dividend tobe declared after paying the liability of shs147 million will be a negative figure So, I cannot see any hope of the depositors getting anything</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.KIILU: Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, according to theanswer given by the Attorney—General, it appears as if there is no hope of the depositors getting back their money Since so many depositors, including some from Masinga, put their money in this company, is there any hope at all of their getting back their money? How many depositors are involved and what is the total amount of money they deposited?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.MULI: Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in short, there is no hope of the depositors getting anything out of this company and we can only blame the directors who ran it downhill We have not been able to locate some of them, but remedy will not be by way of prosecution or otherwise It is very bad that these directors ran their society in the way they did They actually swindled their depositors However, this is not the only society that was affected Last year and the year before, there was a clamp down of financial institutions, including building societies The exercise is still going on and, where possible, when the committee dealing with it realises sufficient money topay depositors, they are paid on a certain basis In the case of this society, I am afraid I cannot see any way in which we can get money even to declare dividends of onecent So, I am sorry I cannot help the hon Questioner any further</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.MWAMZANDI: Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, would the Attorney—General be kind enough to tell this Parliament the names of the directors of this society and addresses so that we may know them?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.MULI: Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if it is the wish of the House to know the names of those directors, I will give them now, but I wonder whether this is going to assist us I have the names here, but is giving them out going to assist us? If not, there is no need of mentioning them The names of the first 10 directors were: George M. Mutisya, Michael L. Kipusi, Henry CK. Kubo, Kipkoech A. Sambu, JM. Karungaru, Zaccheus B. Oganda, Draciano K. Rwabwega, Robert T. Shomba, Stephen M. Gideon and Mercy N Sikala At the end of April, 1987, this number was reduced to the following: ML. Kipusi, GM. Mutisya, RN. Sova, BR. Mutiso, S. Loroka, M. Mutheto and N. Kiptoo Kitui Teachers also had invested a lot of money as a depositor, not by name but in the name of the teachers institution</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.WAMBUA: Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, now that this firms directors ran away with a lot of money belonging to wananchi, these wananchi want to know whether their money is to be forgotten or what will happen to it because the final answer here would have to be given by the AttorneyGeneral, who is the person we run to in such cases to rescue the situation</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.MULI: Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when the official receiver has exhausted all aspects of this society, he will have to refer the matter back to court for final winding up of the society, but that will not be the end of the matter because depositors will not be satisfied with the proceeds since there is nothing else we can attach I sympathise very much with these depositors and hope that in future, the Attorney—Generals Chambers and the office of the Registrar of Companies and Societies will be very vigilant in screening persons wishing to form a society, company or building society That is what we are now doing</Newspeech> Question No 373Delay in Building Court House at LowarMR.EKIDOR asked the AttorneyGeneral what has delayed the constructioin of the buildings to accommodate the District Magistrate Court, Lodwar<Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Mr.Muli): Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this answer is short, and I beg to replyThere is a District Magistrate I at Lodwar, dealing with all cases there The construction of Lodwar Court was included in the 1989/90 Draft Estimates However, the amount was far too low to start the construction 	Therefore, rather than start the project and leave it incompletethe Department thought it prudent to line or re-allocate the funds to some otheron-going projects which were nearing completion. The project was,therefore, abandoned for the time being, but it has now been	allocated	funds during the 1991/92 Financial Year. The Department has beengetting very low allocations for the development projects and thishas raade it extremely difficult to undertake and complete a projactwithin a given allocation for a financial year.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, has justtold the House the funds were specifically voted by this House forconstruction of lodwar District Law Court. Now, can he tell theHouse who authorised the transfer of these funds to other on goingprojects?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MULI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, ths no irregularity in the 1939/90 main Vote, buildings only 130,000 was allocated for this projecttoo little money to start a project of this magnitude. I did not have to come back to this house to ask for virement from a Sub Vote to another I think hon. Ekidor will appreciate that it is a rather tantalising to start a project and leave it incomplete now we are ready to start the project because we have been allocated £265,000, which are sufficient to start the project. I hope hon. Ekidor will appreciate the efforts the Government is making to takejustice nearer to the people in Lodwar.</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Attorney-General still has not told the Houses who authorised the transfer of funds. Now can he tellthe House which these On-going projects were and what relationship they had with the Lodwar District Law Courts?</Newspeech>        <Newspeech>MR. MULI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the authority to vire funds is vested in the Treasury and the Accounting Officer seeks that authority from there I have not got the projects towhich the £30,000 was vired to if the hon. Member would like me to get them, I will just be too happy to do so. But I think the mainpoint is with the time when this project can be started and finished.

KIMAGMIA asked the Attorney General since the family of the late kimani Gatonye is having serious financial problems what steps he is taming to finalise Adm. Cause No. 329 of 1978, and distribute the estate as per letter, Ref. No. 64/7724 addressed to the Public Trustee by District Commissioner, Nakuru<Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Public Trustee has ascertained the gross assets of the estate of the deceased and has obtained the grant of letters of of administration from the the High Court of Ilenya The Tublic Trustee applied for the confirmation of the said grant of administrate last year with a view to proceeding with the finalisation of the estate of the deceased, but the said confirmation has not come through due to delays in the High Court of Kenya Thus the most vital steps have been taken by the Public Trustee. What is remaining is purely confirmation of the letters of administration and the estate will be distributed The Public Trustee cannot settle the above claim at the moment because the estate has only a credit  balance of Shs.33,933,35 This is the only amount in the 	but confirmation is the main point remaining and then administration of this sum will be done.the Attorney General tell this Mouse why this case has taken so long?</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. MULI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker  Six, as I have explained on many occasions in this House, once a case of a deceased submitted to the Public Trustee there are several matters to be gone into first of all, to identify the assets from whatever source and secondly to identify the rightful heirs of the estate. These matters take a long time. We rely on the provincial and district commissioners and district officers to let us know what assets the deceased left behind and who the beneficiaries of the estate were we also write to the bank and try to assemble the estate as far as we can all this takes a long time. So this case is not an Exceptional. But I am happy that although it took a long tine we are nearingthe completion of the excercise and I hope that the beneficiaries will very soon be able to get what is due to them. I would like to ask hon. Kimemia to hold on to enable us complete this exercise, whose completion I am to direct the Public Trustee to speed up.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir this matter goes back 12 years and apparently the beneficiaries have been suffering. If the money was to be used to pay school fees, those children have already dropped out of school. That is the Attorney General doing to ensure that the Public Trustee completes his duties in the shortest time possible to ensure that beneficiaries benefit from the estate of a deceased? This is because many people have suffered and many more continue to suffer. Twelve Years is too long these mattersshould be sorted out within three years, if not within a shorter period.I appreciate the sentiments of hon. Misoi. Let me out this way. Not all the estates of deceased persons come to the Public Trustee Some are settled between the heirs, beneficiaries and the court.

Our Government has constantaly advocated the development policy which can be termed as development without destruction of the resources base.  This policy sometimes referred to as sustainable development"will continue guiding my Ministry in the implementation of its programmes during the Fiscal Year 1990/91.My Ministry is charged with the following responsibilitiesDevelopment and management of forests in the country.Development of mineral resources including geological surveys and research3.  Enhancement of environment protectionThese responsibilities are carried out by the Forestry Denartment, Mines and Geological Department and the National Environment Secretariat. To carry out this function, Sir, I will ask this House to approve a gross total of K232,359,100 This will be divided into K£27,970,370 for development and K£4,388,730 for recur¬rent expenditure in respect of the 1990/92 Fiscal YearMr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we do appreciate that the resources available are limited, and we will try to strive to operate within this provision May I emphasize that the main activities of my Ministryduring the fiscal year will revolve around proper utilization of the existing institutional capacities and available manpower The budget for this approach is briefly outlined below on departmental basisSir, the efficient functioning of my Ministry presuposes effective coordination and planning This can be achieved only with the provision of adequate facilities, especially appropriate office accommodation and for both the Ministry headquarters and its technical departments As this august House will be aware, my Ministry has no building of its own. To this end, I propose to initiate the construction of Mazingira House, for which I am asking this House to approve an initial amount of K£2 millionMr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I request this House to approve expenditure in the Development Vote of K£2,245,000 for minor alterations and maintenance, acquisition of offices construction of buildings I shall also ask this House to approve expenditure of</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr.Tuva) Order, hon Members!

Continued training of personnel for the forestry sub sector of our national economyMr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as we address this issue, we are mind¬ful of past pitfalls in forestrymanagement The everincreasing population is placing great pleasure on forested areas, and we will require all concerted efforts of all relevant organs to protect and manage the existing forest areas and involve public awareness of the benefits of tree planing in general More specifically, all existing laws governing the protection of water catchment areas, soil conservat¬ion, et cetera, will have to be enforced even more stringently and amended if need be, to make them more effective To this ehd, my Ministry will work very closely with the: Ministry of Agriculture, Water Development, Reclamation and Development of Arid, SemiArid and Wastelands as well as statutory bodies such as the Permanent Presidential Commission on Soil Conservation and Afforestation, Kanu, schools and nongovernmental organisations to further awareness in agroforestry and tree planting in generalMr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I also mention that my Ministry will soon undertake to prepare a national forestry masterplan which will guide the development of forestry and sustainable exploitation of forest resourcesSir, I did refer earlier to the? limitation of resources and how it will negatively affect the development and management of forests in general I would like to refer specifically to the Forest Department four road units at Kinale, Londiani, Nyeri and Eldoret, which have not been equipped with adequate transport and other facilities for quite sometime This has resulted in the department not being able to maintain forest roads for better supervision and protection of forests. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, cost sharing is now an accepted national strategy for sustainable development. To this end my ministry does and will continue to involve saw millers and other users of forest produce in the development of forests. Their involvement in the development of tree nurseries under expert advice from the staff of Forest Department will be pursued illigently and in due course we expect to draw on their co-operation in other silver-cultural activities. Over and above plantation forests, new emphasis will be placed on farm forestry, rural afforestation schemes and local afforestation schemes. With diminishing forest cover this approach is critical for future satisfaction of fuel wood needs in the country.The proper utilization of forest produce requires skilled manpower. My ministry has in past assisted saw-millers in training of their personnel at the Forest Industrial Training Centre, Nakuru nad intends to continue this programme during the 1990/91 fiscal year. In addition the Kenya forestry college at Londiani will be manned by qualified professionals in order to continue its task of imparting forestry to Kenyans for the forestry sub-sector of our national economy.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for a long time, the mining sector has been dominated by non-indegenous people and in keeping with the Government policy of indigenization, the mines and Geological department of my Ministry has taken a lot of interest in this sector. I am happy to inform this House that about 96 per cent of the small scale mining operations in the country are now in the hands of indigenous people. We intend to pursue policies that will enable our people to participate more in this sector.However, the major constraint, as we know is finance. The miningindustry is an expensive business which is both risky and longterm It will be necessary to ensure that Kenyans have the necessary capital to compete in this business. The ministry is prepared to give advice as necessary within the provisions of the mining Act which I am in the process of revising with a view to providing more incentives to indigenous Kenyans Additionally,my Ministry, in liaison with the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife, and otherorgans of the Government, has completed ar examinationof appropriate ways and means of making mining areas more environmentally safe and secure in order to encourage optimal exploitation of mineral resources.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the following programmed projects will be carried out by the Mines and Geological Departments during the 1990/91	fiscal yearMineral Resources Development:Geological Surveys and Research(3) Investigations and Encouragement of the Development of Industrial Mineral prospecting and Development; andThe Promotion and Encouragement of the Development and Emploitation of Non-mineral Deposits used in the country.All this, Mr. temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, is geared towards enhanced industrial development generation of employment and the general economic growth through foreign exchange earnings or conservation through import	substitution. In order to achieve these objectives, I ask this House to approve an expenditure of   K£ 2,057,443 for both Development and Recurrent Votes arrived at as follows  Development Gross K£l,059,775 Activities will beas follows :Regional Surveys  K£105,003 Detailed Investigations  K£648,000 Geochemistry  K£11,000Geophysical Surveys ana Research K£50000 Purchase of Plant and Equipment K£60, 000 Rehabilitation of Workshop  K£10,000 Madini house  K£10,000 Industrial Ilineral Resources  K£35,000 Promotion of Mineral Pesources  K£50,000The Gross Total comes to K£l,059,775 The RecurrentGross will be K£997,668 The activities will be as follows:Mines and Geology Headquarters 	K£703 ,050Provincial Offices  K£208,782Mineral Surveys and Exploration K£85,736 This givestotal of K£997,668, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the protection of this Environment is a critical imperative in the world today. Kenya under the leadership if His Excellency the president is in this forefront of the international effort to protect our environment for our future generations. The National Environment Secretarian within my Ministry is charged with the responsibility of monitoring and evaluating the environment impacts of development activities in Kenya so that during the planning stage of every project	environmental implications are carefully considered in order to prevent possible environmental disasters.During the 1990/91 fiscal year our efforts to sensitise the general public on environmental issues through public lecturing will continue Compilation of data for use by Districts for planning purposes through the District Assessment Programme will also be continued. The Secretariat will be strengthened to ensure  environmental policy formulations end that the divisional and district level programmes benefit from environmental impact assessment, Thenational Plan of Action to combat desertification will be continued during the year in fulfilment of the resolutions by the United nations Environment Programme and the Inter—Governmental Authority on	Drought and Development. To carry out the activities related to environmental protection theNational Environment Secretariat will require K£100,000 and also K£507,280in both  Development and Recurrent Expenditures respectively.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,today, Kenyans  are very consciousof their environmental needs I would like to take this opportunity to thank His Excellency the President for his repeated pronouncements on the need to protect our environment I will be bringing in this House, in the course of this fiscal year a Sessional Paper on the environment and I would like to inform this House that this sessional paper is now under preparation. I willalso be proposing certain legislation on air pollution, namely, the Clean Air Bill with the sole aim of protecting our atmospheric environment. A need also exists for the establishment of environmental laws that are presently spread over the statute books under the umbrella law of environment. We will be discussing with my colleague the Attorney General the modality for doing this.In sammary, Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources has a mandate to develop, manage and exploit our natural resources while taking care to protect the environment. I shall requirea sum of £27,970,370 in Development Expenditure and £4,223,270 in the Recurrent Impendirure in order to accomplish this task.I thank hon. Members for the attention they have given me while moving this Vote .With those few remarks, I beg to move.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Mibei): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker for giving me this chance to second this Vote. The Minister for Environment and Natural Resources has given a very convincing and well detailed explanation regarding the project that his ministry is intending it undertake during this fiscal year. I think these projects are fairly distributed through the republic and for this, I would like to congratulate him. Mr. Temporarary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this ministry is responsible for environmental issues and natural resourses in this country. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency president for being in the fore front of fighting desertification both locally and Internationally Last year, His excellency the addressed a very large international conference on the ozone layer in London which draw the attention of the world to the need for preserving the environment and the ozone layer which is protecting us so that we do not catch diseases which may come from other unknown places. The President has also established his own tree nursery from which my constituency has greatly benefited and for this, I would like to thank him very much on behalf of the people from my constituency The president has given us tree from this nursery and we have planted these trees along the main road throughout the constituency.Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the President has also campaigned very much on the need to plant trees in order to preserve our emrirenmento I am happy to state that the Ministry of Environment and natural Resources has been very keen to look after the trees in this country and have been able to control the spread of disease to certainspecies of trees However, I would like to appeal to all leaders to enhance the exercise of tree planting throughout the country because if we are not careful in preserving ard planting mere trees, in the near future, we may lack timber for building , At the moment,there is a lot of building taking place all over the country and sometimes we find it difficult to get timber easily I think people should be encouraged to play oypress trees and other indigenous trees. For this exercise to be effective as part of education for our children, I think every school should be able to start a tree nursery to serve where the school is situated.     Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, those people who are convictedof minor offences die Should be utilized in tree planting so that they also learn how to plant trees ard preserving environment. When you visit areas where young trees have been planted, you find scientific names written besides these trees I would like to appeal to the Ministry to consider writing down the main vernacular names of these trees, particularly in the districts where these trees are planted. This would enable us to know the Iocal names of these trees. If you planted a tree in Kericho and you named it “Mastard Seed”, we would like the local name to be written instead so that we have “Sirigwet" I am sure that the students at Londiani Training School would assist is doing some research to get the local names of the several trees, that we have in this country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Mover of this motionhas mentioned the plans of the Ministry to guard the water catchment areas and indicated that his Ministry is going to co-operate with the Ministry of Agriculture and the rest in preserving and planting trees in this country He also said that the Ministry will he applying different a Acts of Parliament and we are pleased to note what he said about consulting the Attorney General in order to consolidate some of these Acts which are relevant to the work of the Ministry. In this way, he will make sure that he does not continue to use many Acts of Parliament at the same time and therefore, consolidating them will bring about case of reference./Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we were also glad to hear from the Minister that the indigenous Kenyans are mining our natural resources. However, we need qualified geologists to survey and carry out research on our minerals with a view to finding cut which of these minerals, if mined, would be of benefit to our country. We have survived in this country because of agriculture, but if one day we would be lucky to get minerals in this country, we shall be as rich as the United States of America so that we would not have to be threatened by anybody.    Sir, I would like to appeal to the University of Nairobi to be very vigilant on seismological occurrences,like the Earth tremors and so on. We should not be caught unaware by earthquake and so on. I am sure I am not versed in this field, but I am sure they could detect early formations of earthquakes so that they could advise us. We would like some more education in that field so that we are aware and people do not think that there is somebody bewitching the community or our land. This is something     we pray God not to happen to this country, but at the same time, I think we should be well informed so that we Know what it is all about.          Sir, I do not need to say much, and with those few remarks, I beg to second the Motion.</Newspeech> ( Question proposed)<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Misiero): thank you very much, Sir, for giving me a chance to support this Motion which has been ably moved by the Minister for Environment and Natural Resources.First of all, I would like to thank the minister Personally and his colleagues, assistant Ministers, the permanent Secretary and senior officials for touring Mt. Elgon precisely two weeks ago so that they may see what is going on in that beautiful area. It was a great honour for us to have a Minister and his officials, and I am sure they enjoyed staying in the mountain. They also did plant trees to commemorate their visit, and I believe that they will continue to revisit the place and see how these trees are coming up.       Sir, God in his own wisdom made sure that we put trees on this earth. We found out that trees are big assets to us. Trees are assets to our lives. They are assets of economic value to us, and without trees, we would not be having the many rivers that we have today. So, it is gratifying to see that His Excellency president Daniel arap Moi has continued to remind us that we must preserve our forests and environment. This is for our own good and, in any case, as I said, God decided right from the beginning that there must be forests because they are good for the life of man.      We are most grateful to the Ministry for the re-afforestation that they are undertaking in the Chebiuk area. In fact, they have done quite a lot of work within a very short time. The only request that we have been making to them is that they should reduce the number of exotic trees that they have introduced in the area and instead increase the number of indeginous trees. Indeed, when we went round with the Minister to see the new seedlings that had been planted, it was obvious that the indeginous trees were enjoying themselves. They were growing beautiful within no time without any watering and what-have-you. They were growing naturally whereas the exotic trees were finding it very difficult to breaths because the air of Mt. Elgon is very cold. Those trees are not used to that kind of environment and soil. So it was obvious that the indigenous trees would be better introduced in Mt. Elgon in greater number than the exotic trees. I hope and pray that the ministry will continue to ensure that parity is maintained. This is a situation where the indigenous trees exceed the exotic trees.    In any case Sir, the elephants and other animals in Mt.Elgon do feed on those trees and they cannot feed on Australian trees because these are elephants from Mt. Elgon. They feed on trees that they know and they also brush their teeth with trees that they know and so on. This is why it is very important that if we were to maintain that environment, we should give them more of what they are used to. This is why our request is that we          Should have more of the indigenous trees rather than the exotic trees.Sir, up in Mt. Elgon we have a lot of caves. I do not  know precisely where they belong, but I an  sure our people in geology would be interested and they are in this Ministry In any case, they are God given Then I tall of a cave, I do not mean a small little thing where two persons can enter I near, a huge governors space which is sometimes bigger than the whole of Nairobi. This is a huge room underground with partitions and even with several storeys. Some have undergroond rivers flowing with bridges. I have always said that apart from caves being of great interest, they could also be of great economic value because they could act as stores I am sure it is very expensive to store food in Nairobi. I think it might be costing about Ksh.5/ per bag per year or more But if we were to contract just one cave in Mt. Elgon, then we could store all the food from Nairobi free of charge, free of weevils and so on. We can preserve that food for very many years without it going bad and without spending, a single cent, This requires only a bit of conversion, partitioning, putting on light and so on. I am sure that one day this request will be considered to be very very necessary.Sir, since the Ministay has geologists, I have always felt that some one should do some study on these caves because somelegend have it that King Solon had come down to do mining in Mt.Elgon and that is why we have caves there. I am sure the truth can	only be established through scientific research But somehow,although have spoken a lot about the need for scientific Research	to be carried out on these caves, our researchers seem to be very©Ascared of these caves. It would appear as if we would have to the ropes virtually on their necks to drag them right inside the caves, with their notebooks so that they can do some studies I wish to assure then that nothing will injure them there. I wish to assure the scientists that there will be no injuries to befall them in the caves as the Sabaoti people are there to protect them from any evil, if any I, therefore, request our university scientists to do some¬thing about this, because there are very many cases in Mount Elgon and which we should all know something aboutWe have forests in various parts of the country, especially along the border areas like Mount Elgon and these can be a great asset, or on the other hand, a problem To us, they are problems because bandits from across our borders do come into our forests, which are very dense They are nothing like the Tsavo plains where you can see for miles These are forests with huge trees and thick bushes you can hardly see two feet ahead of you These bandits have made sure that they normally hide in those forests and, actually, they can live there forever, without being discovered In any case, there are caves in the forest, in which they can live comfortably However, they are killing and eating our buffaloes and elephants and other fauna At the same time, they are also killing our people and escaping into those forests We request that these bandits be flushed out of those forests When the dry spells come, they can easily destroy the forests with bush fires One only needs to start a small fire and the whole forest will burnLet me also appeal that the game wardens should not stay in Kimilili, which is about 10 miles from the forest, but should be in the forest itself and face these bandits so that those bandits stop destroying our animals, our environ¬ment and killing inocent wananchi in and around Mount Elgon So, we request that something urgent be done to flush out those bandits who have come from across the border and are living in those forestsSir, we also need to have our environment safeguarded against pollution. It is very gratifying to note that the Ministry has been keeping an eye on the Webuye Paper Mills where at times there is an obnoxious smell However, it looks like there are improvements However, at peak production times, the obvious smell becomes too much and, even from 30 miles away, we still get that bad smell Since we, around Mount Elgon, are not used to the smell, I presume the people around Webuye, probably, are used to it our noses have not been able to endure that obnoxious smell We, therefore, request the Ministry to continue maintaining a close watch on the pollution, especially as it even goes to the riversMr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are doing all these things because of the prevailing love, peace and unity However, there are some of our mad friends who want to have their own government a government where there are no elections They just elect themselves in bars and private nooks to come and run a government, by displacing a legallyconstituted one This is a great pity and, I am sure, all of us will keep those people with mad ideas in jail so that our Government can continue to improve on our environment and our natural resourcesWith those few remarks, I beg to support</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.MAHIHU: Thank you very much, Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to contribute on this very important Motion Let me start by thanking His Excellency the President for steering the programmes on soil erosion and afforestation in this country It is common knowledge that our own President has continued to emphasize the need for planting more trees and conserving our environment For these efforts, His Excellency the President should be shown our appreciation, as a nation We have a leader who cares for t the environment of this country and who has, at all times  even in his spare time  advocated for planting of trees He even has planted a tree nursery in his own compoundI would like to comment on the environment The time has come for us to really address ourselves to this environmental issue It is a pity, really, that the Ministry has not been given enough money I would have wished the Ministry to get more because this country needs more funds to embark on afforestationThis country needs more afforestation programmes so that we can plant more trees, trees that can grow faster and help in the provision of firewood This country does not currently have enough firewood for domestic use This can only be made available if the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, and especially the Forestry Department, continued to plant more trees The trees that are planted on ceremonial days are not enough We need to hear of major programmes where, for example, an area of more than 10,000 acres is utilised for the planting of trees year after year This is why I am saying that there is a great need for increased afforestation programmesSir, let me now touch on another area which worries me a lot On soil erosion, the Sabaki River has now taken the sea at the Coast Province very far We no longer speak of beaches in Malindi Some 20 years ago, you could jump right into the sea from a bedroom in one of the beach hotels Today, 20 years later, because of the silting, you have to walk 200 to 300 metres to the sea My worry is that if this situation continues, it means that in the next 20 years we will not be talking of Malindi as a tourist resort we will be talking of Malindi as any other town in the rural areas, because the environ¬ment has canged soil erosion has has really taken the sea awayThis now brings me to the question of soil erosion as it pertains to the whole of Ukambani area, the national parks and so on During the rains, a lot of soil is taken right to the sea and a lot of fertile land becomes arid and barren after the fertile soil has been washed to the sea It is very import ant that the Ministry concerned, and especially the Ministry charged with the responsibility of afforestation, continues to take note of these major events that are affecting other Ministries You would not be talking about tourism if you do not have the beaches you would not be talking about the growth of agriculture if the country is interfered withThere is also the question of other industries being affected by lack of firewood Take tea, as an example. If you manufacture tea by use of	 firewood, the cost of manufacturing is much cheaper At themoment, there is a big comparison between the tea that is produced in this country Most of the tea is manufactured using firewood but the smallholder sector of the tea industry uses fuel, or diesel for that matter, to manufacture tea If that is going to continue, then the tea from the smallholder sector will be very expen¬sive, because of the prevailing infrastructure I am, therefore, appealing to the Ministrys Forestry Department to start more afforestation programmes It may possibly be claimed that there is not sufficient land Some countries are known to use their highways or road reserves to plant treesSir, if we had trees planted all the way from here to Meru, or from here to Kakamega, or Kisumu, say Blue Gums, that would constitute a major affores¬tation programme for the years to come The potential for this growth between here and Mombasa, along the main highway, is very great.The people responsible for research need to get in touch with the Ministry of Public Works to ensure that we plant more trees in every available piece of land If you fly over forests, you will find that there many major pockets of land which have neither the natural trees nor the new type of trees They are bare So, this is why I suggest that the Ministry go back to the Treasury with a specific project and try to ask for more funds so that those areas could be made usefulAs my colleague who spoke just before me said, all these projects and the ideas we have which are for the development of this country can only be feasible if this country continues to enjoy peace and stability This is why the Attorney—General is here It is his department which is responsible for making sure that every person who commits a crime in this country is prosecuted We have made very many statements regarding people who are trying to usurp power by force They might think that we only come to Parliament to make noise or condemn them by means of statements It is high time the Attorney—General got to see that those people who are violating our laws are put aside This is no jokeMr.Temporary Deputy Speaker,Sir, I fully support the comment made by His Excellency the President the other day to the effect that security issues cannot be compromised I sometimes wonder how much we are going to appeal to these people who are bent on violating the law They might think that we are going to continue talking with nothing happening I think the AttorneyGeneral has now understood the mood of this House It became clear especially yesterday that this country is solidly behind His Excellency the President We have given him a complete mandate to ensure that those people who interfere with our stability and peace are dealt with firmly It is only after this is done that we will go back to enjoy ourselvesThe looking that took place here a few weeks ago is a major lesson, and we would wish that such looting, rioting, hooliganism and destruction of life and property will never occur again Let us hope that it gone for ever This can only be ensured if the forces of law and order continue to hunt down those	responsible up to the end Some people think that detention is the only thingthey can be subjected to It may be a good idea to tell them that there is prisontoo, and that there is a difference between detention and prison Some peoplethink that they cannot be detained, but they should know that they can go to jailThey think that if they go to detention, they will not face hard labour, but ifyou commit a crime, you do not have to go to detention you goto prison If myunderstanding of the law is correct, there is a very big difference between thesetwo institutions Time has come for us to tell the AttorneyGeneral and hisofficers not to let criminals go to a comfortable area Instead, let them go towhere they belong, that is prisonI am talking like this because I am angry because in the last 27 years /we have enjoyed peace and I now do not know where this ambition has come from We are saying that each Ministry comes to the House to seek money to go and develop itselfMr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.MWAURA: Thank you, Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to the Motion that has been so ably moved by the Minister for Environment and Natural Resources I rise to support this Motion and, in doing so, let me start by thanking His Excellency the President and the Government My constituency was very affected by the latest disturbances, but the Government came and quailed those disturbances I would like to inform the House and the people know that the bulk of those who brought up those disturbances in Limuru came from outside the constituency. The few who may have joined them were illinformed youngsters who thought that this was a lot of funLet me say how much we need to keep our environment clean and care for it. The planting of trees, which is a very big idea that has been propagatedand pushed very hard by our President, is catching on among our people You will\find, particularly in my area, that those who build houses continue to plant trees in a different manner from the waythey_used_to do it many years ago	Previously, they just cut down trees, but today they plant new trees If you drive around there, you will see what I mean We wouldlike to encourage this practice by teaching it in schools so that as our children grow up to become responsible citizens of this country, they may be anxious to plant trees for beauty and the improvement of our environmentI would urge the Ministry, now that it has got rid of squatters from our forests, to tiiink very hard of planing trees The squatters were also useful in replanting trees I am sure that somehow somebody somewhere within the Ministry is working very hard on how to replace the work that was being done by those people Otherwise, the large—scale treeplanting that we need from the Ministry could fail and, 10 years from now, we find that we are far from improving our treeplanting and environmentLet me thank the Ministry for paying a lot of attention to Limuru, particularly Limuru Town We had an environmental day there two years ago, and since then, we have got a lot of improvement One damping area that was being used by Limuru Bata Shoe Factory and another shoe factory from Kikuyu has now been filled with soil, and the place is very clean as a result of the visit by the Minister and his team Trees have also been planted in the town, but the perpetual smell from an otherwise most beautiful factory in Limuru still exists The water that comes from the tannery is full of chemicals, and it flows in an open gulley into a lagoon This lagoon has an outlet into a river, and you can see that the water in the dams further down the river has changed its natural colour into a different oneOnly God knows what poisons that water. We also know that an affluent from the factory headquarters also finds its way to that water . Today if you drive to Limuru  I understand even when you travel by train at night  you do not have to be told you have arrived in Limuru because the smell of the air will tell you. I would urge the Ministry, which started very enthusiastically two years ago to help us clean up that town, to come back. I know that the factory has offered to direct water from the factor through a pipe, but that water will end up in the same lagoon and subsequently in the river which is used further down by other people. It evenutally becomes the Ruaraka River; I do not know whether beer is prepared from that water but you know that the polution will not affect only Limuru people, but all Kenyans.So, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is a seriousmatter and we must tell the 3ata Company that whatever they spill intothat pipe should be completely treated and tested to ensure that itis free of all elements that would poison life. We used to have quitea lot of fish down in the water, but now we no longer see life there.This is why we are calling upon the Ministry to come and assist usAs more and more horticultural farmers are using chemicals to improvetheir plants, especially the cut flowers, I think it is importantthe Ministry looks into the question of whether or not once all these chemicals drain into the river they are harmful to :nm human beings. Down the river I mentioned there are very many small horticultural farmers who are doing irrigation. Even in places like Naivasha and other places where large scale irrigation is being carried on and chemicals are being used we may be poluting the environment and also endangering our own health and that of other animals.Let me also say that I wish the Ministry had more money.because it is charged with a heavy responsibility of looking afterour environment. We are lucky in that we have not spoilt it and soWe do not have to spend a lot of money cleaning it and I believe weshould continue to keep it clean.with those few words, I beg to support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION (Mr. Muliro): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary DeputySpeaker First of all I would like to congratulate the Minister for moving this very important motion and for touring Bungoma only two weeks ago as my colleague, hon. Kisiero has already mentioned. We appreciated it on the ground that it was his first familiarisation tour ever since he was appointed minister for Environment and natural Resources. Although he did not disclose all the reasons as to why he choose to visit Bungoma at that time, we take it that whatever the reasons, there must be tremedous goodwill. We therefore, hope that what programmes intends to execute in the entire country with the Vote he has just moved Bungoma will not be left out of it.I would like to thank the Ministry for the ministry for the able manner in which they have carried out the programme for conservation of the environment, particularly in trees conservation In this regard, I would like to commend the efforts of our own President for spearheading our efforts in tree conservation and afforestation I hope that all of us here will emulate his Excellency the Presidents example in guarding trees in our constituencies and making our People aware</Newspeech>  <Header>QUORUM</Header><Newspeech>DR.WAMEY0: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir I wish to draw you attention to the fact that we have no quorum there are only 15 hon. Members in the house.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva): You are right ring the Division Bell.</Newspeech> (The Division Bell was rung)<Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr.Tuva): Order we have a quorum now Continue, Mr. Muliro.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION (Mr. Muliro): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was saying that we should all emulate our he ad of state and plant trees in our constituencies and also have our own tree nurseries. On this note I would like to request the ministry to assists us by providing enough funds and technical personnel to ensure that this particular exercise succeeds. We need trees for many reasons; we need then for attracting rain and providing energy we are told that very soon this country will require about 30 million tones of firewood per year and there cannot be firewood without trees. So, it is very important that we realise that this need will arise and embark on tree planning programme so that when that demand arises we shall have enough wood to meet our needs. I am told that we need trees to purify the oxgygenthat we breathe I am also informed that a human being breathes out one kilogramme of carbon-dioxide per day. If we are not going to have many trees, I am quite sure that our oxygen, in the near future, might not be the pure oxygen that we are breathing now.We also need trees for the protection of the atmosphere we are told that trees require carbon-dioxide for their growth which the earth is capable of producing to the tune of 110 billion tonnes per annum. Trees require that amount of carbon-dioxide for photosynthesis for the production of fruits and other things that we require for our own welfare.I would like to comment on the efforts of our President for the able manner in which he has steered the policy of this nation in the environmental field. Right now, Kenya is a world leader in shaping the opinion in the preservation of the environment. you will recall Sir, that last year, our Head of State was the only personality from the entire world invited, he give a key note speech in London and he did it so well I would like to say that having achieved that particular level of performance,our Ministry for Environment and Natural Resources must make sure that we do not perform below those heights which have been achieved.	 Since last year, our participation in international forahas been commendable. We participated in a conference in Helsinkiwhich met to discuss the implementation of the Montreal ProtocalAs a result of our participation, we were able to convince theconference that nairobi should be the secretariat of the Ozone layerunder UNEP. I am quite sure that if our President had not led the opinion and the effort in this particular area, like he did and   continues to do, it would have been very difficult to convince the international community that we should have the headquarters on the Ozone Layer in Nairobi and that UNEP should be designated the secretariat for that very important part of the environment.We will continue to participate in those fora and I would like to say that recently we participated in a similar exercise in London where it was decided to control production and utilisa¬tion of the substances that deplete the ozone layer. Our contribution was greatly appreciated Last year in Helsinki, we participated,in the agreement that there should be a fund that  will assist in the implementation of the programme. We will speed it up so that those substances which deplete the ozone layer are phased out completely. This year, that effort led to the establishment of an executive committee which will be assigned the responsibility of administering the fund.Because Kenya has get the headquarters on the Ozone Layer under UMEP that fund should be sited in Nairobi. I would like to request that the executive committee be established in Nairobi where the headquarter is. The benefits will be tremendous because that particular body is going to handle millions, if not billions of dollars which will be donated to assist in the implementation of the programme.I would like to end my contribution by requesting that we promote the awareness of our people in matters pertaining to the environment. We should encourage, students to know that the environment is very importantI beg to support.</Newspeech>  (The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr.Tuva) left the Chair) (The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr.Marwima took the Chair)<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR MANPOWER PLANNING AND EMPLOYMENT(Mr.Otwani): Thank you, Sir, for giving me this chance to thank the Minister for moving this Motion which touches on an area where Kenya has been noted internationally.I would like to thank the President for setting up a Permanent Presidential Commission on Soil Conservation and Afforest¬ation. I would like to thank its Chairman, Zeohania Anyieni, for visiting Busia recently, particularly Amukura Division which fails under my constituency. He addressed the public in an area that needed change of attitude towards the preservation of the environment and planting of trees. He visited Morogamosing (?) in Amukura Division which had been selected for afforestation, what he said has helped us a lot in the education of the wananchi on the need, to plant trees and protect water catchment areas.I would also like to support the Minister is move to build Mazingira House. I would only request him that his house should not be built in the City Centre, but in Mathare Valley, Morogocho, Majengo or Muoroto. If this is done, his staff can see the need to keep the environment clean even in those areas. That should not only apply to Nairobi, but in districts also.I would like to support the Ministers idea to initiatelegislation especially on water catchment areas. I come from an area where we did not have any water problems, but, due to population explotion and the need to cultivate more food, most of the water catchment areas have been invaded and cleared byfarmers and we are now running short of water Today we now have to cry for Kenco water, whereas in the past we did not have that need Therefore, before the Minister introduces legislation here, he should consider issuing circulars to protect the remaining catchment areas.Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we know that wananchi who live along the roads know to what extent theiy can cultivate they know the distance they should kep off from the roads Similar distances should be suggested for the river sides so that we can protect the catchment areas and the soils around rivers.Sir, since the Minister is here! with all his staff, particularly the policy makers, I would like to suggest that we start a special campaign to protect certain indigenous grasses and creepers which have been very useful in protecting the soil and in maintaining the humus in soils They have acted as natural mouching materials, but they are getting off very fast whereas they were a great source of manure The soil is getting exhausted even where there is no soil erosion because of too much cultivation Natural manure, as we know, protects the soil more than unnatural manure.At this juncture, Sir, I would like to call upon women groups to start projects on producing firewood by planting trees meant for firewood In my consti¬tuency, women in my area have started collecting reeds for fire, something that never used to happen in the past Therefore, women groups could embark on projects to plant trees for firewood in order to expand sources of fuel.Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to end my contributionby calling on the Attorney General Unfortunately he has left, but I would liketo suggest that it is meaningless to continue discussing the various Ministerial Votes unless there is an environment of peace within the country Although the AttorneyGeneral has left the House, I am sure that he will hear what I am saying wherever he is I want to say that the time has come when these people who have been identified for deliberately wrecking peace should be charged We know that their supporters are complaining about detention without trial, but they can be tried because the charges against them are obvious they are known So, the time has come when they should be charged so that they do not continue acting like heroes People like Dr.Okullu and his preachers are now villains they are no longermatyrs We have evidence to show that they are not matyres They should not allowed to go on around, when it is obvious that they are fighting for ministerial posts, pretending that they are saving souls Maybe, the way they live, they are already in heaven These people must be removed They are not advocating democracy but war and destruction Some of them have never conformed with any system whereVer they have been, be it Uganda or elsewhere Okullu is the kind of man who, even if he goes to heaven, may easily disagree with God himself So, the AttorneyGeneral should actually charge these people in a court of law Even if he is still to investigate, let him investigate when the people have appeared before the court and out of unnecessary heroismThank you very much, Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.PJ MASINDE: Thank you very much, Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this very important MotionThe Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources is very important The face of the earth has changed tremendously What I used to fear as a child, I do not see: any more The forests which used to frighten me when I moved around are just grasslands or, in some places, dry areas The atmospheric pattern, the weather and all the rest have changed I think the Ministry should be involved and take very serious research in the change of weather, where the weather is affecting crops, and communicate with the Ministry of Agriculture, through research, and say when there is likely to be scarcity of rain</Newspeech> The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr.Kagwima) left the Chair The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Dr.Wameyo) took the Chair<Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: Very good! No more quorums! Very good!</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.PJ MASINDE: Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I feel that the Ministry should set up a serious section in research so that they can communicate with the: Ministry of Agriculture so that where it is expected to be shortage of rain, the Ministry of Agriculture should be able to advise wananchi on what crops to plant and when to plant them That way, we can fit in within that period without having to be affected by either long drought or too much rainMr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would now like to talk about mineralsNot much is heard about prospecting of minerals apart from oil, where we hear quite a bit We have a lot of minerals in this country which, we feel, have not been properly looked at on commercial, basis. We are aware that we have iron ore in the Nagijna Hills of Samia Constituency where hon Awori comes from Even today the wananchi are still melting their own iron, using the old methods, to make spears and so on Surely, if an intensive research is done there, there is no reason why we: cannot have iron and probably be sufficient to do whatever our industrial projects here can do instead of having to collect scrap or import iron from other countries We are also aware that in the early 1930s there was a booming business in gold mining in Kakamega District in a place called Rosthma (?) We are quite certain that there is still gold there, but when you talk to people, they say that it is of noncommercial value This is what the colonialists when they were about to go  they left that place to be follow and now we are being told that the gold there is not of commercial value. I would urge the Ministry to have its officers go there and reexamine the area What commercial value are they looking at? Is it not enough to help us in Kenya without having to import gold, so that we have at least a limit and not just to give it up just because we have heard people saying that it is not of commercial value?Sir, in hon. Otwanis Constituency, we have the Amukura Hills which are close to Tororo Hills in Uganda, and right next to the hills there is plenty of gypsum They usedto make cedent and asbestoes in Tororo using this gypsum.    Mr. Temporaray Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would request the ministry to have a look at these areas so that we may get some cement being manufactured there cheafly both for local consumption and also for export. With regard to tree planting I am glad that His Excellency the President has encouraged people to plant more trees. He has spearheaded all tree planting efforts in this country. We encourage school children, women groups and youth groups to plant more trees. After these trees have been planted there should be a follow up by the ministry. The ministry’s officials should go out and encourage the people to plant trees. Each farmer should at least plant two lines of trees which he will use in the future. The hills in many areas of this country are bare. Trees should be planted in these hills. Quite a number of people resisted the idea of planting trees on the hills because they thought that the Government would annex these hills. But the ministry should educate the people that if the hills are in their area the trees they are planting belong to them. This should be very much encouraged.   Mr. Tempopraray Deputy Speaker, Sir. we cannot do without Charcoal. I would therefore suggest that while we are thiking of indigenous trees, research should be done to finr out which typr of tree grows faster than the others so that these could be used for charcoal and other uses. These should be trees with low combustion so that they can be used as fuel. With all the efforts being put by our government, there is no reason why we cannot keep our country under adequate forest cover.                   	 Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I conclude my remarks. I would also like to join my hon. colleagues here in appealing to everybody in this country to live in peace. This is because we need peace in this country. The peace that we have enjoyed for the last 27 years should continue. It is the duty of each and everyone of us to make sure that peace is maintained. Peace can only be there if we are all united working together as a nation.We should forget about the few disgruntled peoplewho want to do things their own way. It is surprising to hear that a certain group of persons had selected its own "Cabinet” we wonder whether this  "Cabinet" was elected through the ballot or whether they are just trying to overturn the Government so that they can set up their own "Cabinet" If their aim is not to overthrow the Government, there is no way these individuals can sit down and give themselves position in a shadow Cabinet wananchi have not elected them and I therefore join my colleagues in condemning these people and urge the Attorney—General to tahe appropriate action against these people who want todestabilise the country and interfere with the peace we have enjoyed for so many years. They also want to ruin our plans to build a better Kenya for our childrenWith those few comments, I beg to support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KAGWIMA: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir, for giving me this chance to join my coIleagues in supporting this very, very important Vote. Since we are talking about the environment, and as one of my colleagues said earlier, we also need to cultivate proper politicalenvironment so that other things become possible including the work of the workers of the country of  Environment and Natural Resources. I say this because yesterday we had	 a very, very heated debate in this House where we also saw a list of people who want to take over the power from the present Government. What I would want to tell our seasoned politicians is that we should calculate the remarks that we make in this House and also the remarks that we make in our meetings in our constituencies and elsewhere otherwise we might appear to very cheap politicians to these people. That will make them start enjoying some popularity that they should not be enjoying. After making those brief remarks, I hope that those who are fond of making public statements will be very, very careful. We all support the current President, His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi, the Government and the party Kanu. But if we are not careful we are going to reduce the status of the same Government we are trying to support, by uttering things that are not conductive to a proper political environment that will give peace to our people. When you say that some of the Ministers are also on the other side, I think that is dividing the House. I therefore appeal to all hon. Members of this House that at this time we need to remain more united than ever before.    Let me now turn to the Vote of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources. I have looked at the figure which the Minister has asked for. First of all I would like to congratulate the Minister for a few statements that he has make since he took over this ministry and also the concern he has shown for our environment. I agree with him that we should put a lot of efforts in fighting desertification. The minister should ask for more money than he has already requested for. This is because in some areas we have some workers who have worked for over 10 years as casuals and yet those people do not have any personal members and have not been recruited into regular employment. I would urge the Minister to look in to this problem as that those people are encouraged to work and provide better services to the Ministry. It is unfair to keep these people on temporary employment for more than 10 years because they have families take care of.I would like to touch on a few tree nurseries in my own  constituency where employees of the Ministry have been working for over 10 yearn as casuals. In fact some of them are being laid off instead of being confirmed .The first one that I would like to mention here is Nkondi Tree Nursery in Harimanti location the second one is Tunyai Tree Nursery in CiakarigaLocation and the third one is Mutonga Tree Nursery also in Ciakariga Location. The fourth one is in Kathuana this is actually a national soil conservation site which was started by this House some time back under the leadership of President Moi. I would request the ministry to look into the welfare of workers in those four tree nurseries and if necessary confirm and place them on regular employment.       Secondly, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, secondly, I would suggestthat we open a few more tree nurseries particularly in my constituency and in other constituencies which are said to be very dry, semi-arid or wastelands, Therefore, I would like to appeal to the minister to start at least three other nurseries at Catunga shopping centre in Gatuya Location, at Kamwatho in Marimantu Location and at Kathangaoi-ini also in Gatuya Location.Having said that, Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch on the aspect of mineral development in this country. We are glad to note that our leading university, that is the University of Nairobi has been able to design manufacture and assemble the first three Kenyan Cars. As we cerebrate this discovery, we should also be looking into the issue of manufacturing of raw meterials. I am saying this because if we are still hoping to continue importingraw materials for our goods, I do not think we shall be doing ourselves a lot of    good. This is because if we import   the raw meterials to manufacture care here these cars will not be cheaper than those imported cars. Therefore I would like to appeal to the ministry to look very seriously into the question of mineral development in this country. For example, I know there are areas in this country where we have a lot of iron are deposits and if the minister could move in quickly to carry out research to find out the exactly quantities of those deposits this would be highly commendable. If there are enough iron are deposite in these areas, then it would be advisable for the Minister to put up amelting plants in those areas.     Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Without intending to concentrate too much on my constituency, we have massive iron are deposite in an area called Kanyuru in Marimanti Location and the report recently compiled says that millions and millions of iron are could be obtained in this area. I have been told that the employees of the Ministry have now moved to the site and I would like to thank the Minister for that timely action. I hope that he will continue with the necessary research to determine the quantities of iron are in this area and if necessary put up a amelting plant in the area. I am saying this because it would br very wrong to transport the raw material from the site to another place and there by pay very heavily for transport expenses. If the material is melted on site, we would be able to save on the cost of transportation and also provide employment to the people in the area which would case the congestation in the city and other urban centres.          Mr. Temporaray Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would now like to touch on the agricultural wastes that we have in this country. We have millet husks, we have coffee husks, rice husks in Mwea and so forth. As hon. Masinde said, we are running short of fuel wood and therefore instead of cutting the few trees that we have, why do we not use the expertise that we have to turn these agricultural waste products into fuel for cooking. We have a lot of maise cobs in Mitale also and these could be ground and converted into useful sources of energy. Today, charcoal has become very expensive to buy and its price is going up every day. Therefore I would like to request the Minister to set up a new unit whose responsibility would be to carry out research on the agricultural waste with a view to turning it into useful source of energy. I have some experience in converting coffee husks into some useful source of energy. I used to do this when I was the chief engineer in this ministry. The coffee husks are now being used to provide a charcoal which is widely being used by Nairobi residents.         With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech>                  <Newspeech> THE ASSISITANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Dr. Wekesa): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporaray Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chance to contribute to this very important Motion. First of all, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the minister for the able manner in which he presented his Vote and for having been able to tour Mt. Elgon. For this reason, I am sure he does not need me to explain to him the geography of this place. However, I would like to inform him that Mt. Elgon too is in Trans Nzoia and therefore, the next time he decides to vist Mt. Elgon, He will not just be vising Bungoma but Mwanza as well.       It is not through some kind of design. Collusion or accident that Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, you happen to be in the chair this afternoon.i would like to say that this House has appointed you to be in the chair because of your long experience in this House and the Knowledge that you have regarding the standing orders of this House.        Mr. Temporaray Deputy Speaker, Sir, when we talk about Natural resources, a few things naturally come into our minds. When we speak about this ministry we think about fuel, firewood, timber, shelter, houses and rain. I must say that this country is very lucky to have so many natural resources. We have plenty of sunshine, we have plenty of rain and many rivers and lakes. We also have very fertile soil and to add to it, we have a good Government which is load by an excellent President who has brought about peace and stability which has allowed us to talk about our democratic principles in this House. Therefore I would like to take this opportunity to join my collegues in condomning the hooliganism that has been going on, mostly here in Nairobi last week. We need peace and unity in this country for development. We know that those who do not have these quantities in their countries are probably jealous of our good Government. It is obvious from what has happened recently that unless we remain united at this time and in the future, this peace and stability can be rocked. I congratulate His Excellency the president and his government for having taken the steps they took to ensure that all Kenyans continue to enjoy peace.                    Having said that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, I would now like to touch on the vote of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources. Here, Sir, I would like to underline the word, “natural”.        	 	Sir, some people come here, and wish, that they were "bornhere in Kenya because we have all the facilities We want to narture them We want to look after them For this, I want to congratulate the whole entire Ministry led by our able Minister and his extension officers in the field We must put emphasis on the natural resources We must plant more trees We must have more nurseries We must have nurseriesin every village Every hon Member of Parliament, I plead, should have a nursery on his plot, if he is lucky to have one like me We should be the leaders. We should show wananchi what we can do with our tree nurseries. We should have more emphasis in planting trees.The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Dr.Wameyo) left the ChairThe Temporary Petalty Speaker (Mr.Kagwima) took the ChairSir, you will agree" with me that in the last ten or 20 years there has been change in the weather There has been a change in the atmospheric behaviour of winds rain When I was a chili we used to have rain tenth on the dot By 15th of March, everybody would be planting in Trans Nzoia or in those areas. Now, we do not know whether we should plant in February, March or April because the rains are not regular Itis probably because we do not have as much forest as we used to have Most of Trans Nzoia has no forest Everyfarmer has cleared the land and all you can see is maize or sunflower. But I feel that the Ministry should have mors extension officers to go round and educate people They should do this just in the same way the veterinary officers or agricultural technicians do We Shouldbe used to seeing on our plots, in our homes, on our farms and so on, extension officers from the Forest Department They should be as common as those ones from the Ministry of Agriculture or Livestock Development MinistryThese people will tell us whether we shouldplant this, type, of tree near our riverbanks, or on a hill and so on Of course, I do realise that to be able to do that, we need money. The Ministry ought to have more money.Six, money is always a problem because the Kenyan community has decided to have the highest birthrate in the world Therefore, our people are increasing from time to time Of course, there is stress on funds The Ministries that I cortsider very important have to do with the meagre resources that we have But I would suggest that since this Ministry is so important, it ought to get more money than they are getting right now This is because most of the people who voted for me, to build a house, they have to get some trees and it is becoming more and more expensive to build those huts Most of us live in mud huts. We do not live in Nairobi. We live out there and we depend on the grass, trees and so on Je also depend on trees to build our huts, to cook our food and so on. Therefore there should be more emphais on planting of trees. Even our towns here look at Nairobi here Look at west lands where live There is not a single tree In fact, they only tree in west lands is on my plot. We want to see even in towns trees planted, not just flowers I love flowers, but we also want to see trees in our towns Sometimes I feel that there are more trees in London than in Nairobi. That area should be looked afterThere is one more important factor, Sir, here I congra¬tulate the Ministry for moving out the forest workers from the forests But those ones from my area are complaining They say that they have infrastructures in those forests They have some permanent buildings that were being used as schools, health entires and so on, but they are empty now All the people have been moved.out into towns now In fact,all those people who work in Mt. Elgon live" in town and have to commute to work in Mt. Elgon These beautiful, structures are just lying  idle there.  I would urge the Minister and his officers to reconsider this decision so that a skeleton staff "can use these facilities. They can stay there We know what damage settlers have been doing in the forests But if civil servants are properly choosen, they can stay in those structures that were built with our own money and they are now going to wasteSir, there is also another very important factor here in as far as moving out people from the forest areas is concerned There are one or two farms in Kitale One is called Navike where farmers in these farms right on Mt. Elgon have requested the Govern¬ment to exchange their farms for farms below the mountain In my area we have a lot of Government farms and people want to be given land in the lower parts of the mountain so that they leave the farms which are right inside the forests so that the Ministry can plant trees on those farms. I would like the Minister to consider thatWith those few remarks, Sir, I beg to support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR MANP077ER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT (Mr.Lugonzo): Thank you very much, Sir, for allowing me to contribute to this very important MinistryFirst, I would like to join the other leaders in thankingHis Excellency the President for the swift action that was taken to bring back the tranquility in this country which is very necessary for our well being the action that was taken was timely and appropriate. We are very, very grateful to His Excellency the President for the actionSir, under the item natural resources, would like to say a few words about minerals. In fact, I believe that the Department of Geology in the Ministry of Environment and NaturalResources has not been strengthened enough. I join one of theprevious speakers in saying that we seem to have neglected manyof the natural resources which are very essential for investmentSir, the mineral side of our natural resources has not beenproperly exploited and I would like to suggest that the Departmentof Geology should be strengthened, if possible, more geologistsshould be trained The personnel also in the Department of Geology should be increased so that we can really look for minerals inour country Y7e are relying toomuch on agriculture and it is notgood to rely on one source of wealth Agriculture depends so muchon rain and weather Therefore ,    if we cannot exploit our other resources, especially minerals, our economy is not very stable I think we have minerals here which can be exploited I think it is only oil that the Government has put enough emphasis onMr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, precious stones like gold, diamonds and even copper can be found in the old rock formation in Western Province and, of course, the colonialists were exploiting these minerals, but they did not say they had exhausted the resources when they finally left the country That means that the minerals are still there I do not know why our Government has not at any time thought of putting more emphasis on the exploitation of those minerals I believe there are prospectsfor gold, diamonds, tin and even iron Let more prospecting be done so that if there are no minerals, we be told and forget about it, but I think we have not put enough emphasis on that prospectingHaving said that, let me now turn to forestry In my former larger Ikoloraani, we have the Kakamega Forest, where I believe there are some anomalies that should be corrected The first issue is on the seed beds We have forest stations in which there are seedlings and seed beds I do not see why the seed beds cannot contain all the varieties of trees that can, possibly, grow in that given station If you go to a station like one in my area known as Secheno, you will find that they have only two or three varieties of the indigenous trees that do well in those areas namely, the pine and cypress, or possibly one more type Why can we not have all the varieties so that all the wananchi who go for seedlings in those stations are satisfied?Some of the people in charge of the forest stations are paid but they do not take their work seriously Let me ask, through the Chair, that the Minister urges those officers to take their jobs seriously Right now, saw millers cannot get hard wood from Kakamega Forest they are normally told that there is nothing and that situation has prevailed since the colonial days Why can they not plan for the provision of hard wood for those saw millers who require them? This kind of planning is essential so that the country can be self sufficient in all varieties of trees for different purposesIn Kakamega Forest, we have lots, which are trees which used to grow and, perhaps, dried and fell some years ago We would like these lc££s to be givento saw millers without discrimination One man will today go and ask for those logs and be told that there are no logs while, on the other hand, another man goes and is given the logs In other words, I mean to say that there is a lot of discrimination in the distribution or supply of logs to the people who want them, particularly the saw millers and even the ordinary man who saws wood We should either have a general refusal for those logs, say for the next six years, or we state that those who are interested should go to the forest and, if they find any, they be stamped and the interested parties allowed to have themThe forest officers seem to have turned those logs to their personal property, so that they will only give the logs to only those saw millers who have given them something What other reason would there be for discriminating against people in the supply for those logs? Why would we want to allow one man to have the hard wood timber, while we deny the other? Obviously, someone must be getting a kickback for those suppliesSir, I think our civil servants must be made to know that, as a country, we need honest people, be they rangers, foresters, or whatever They should treat wananchi equally If one person wants to have the logs to mill and have timber, he should be treated like any other person This is because I have heard people complain about the discriminatioin the supply of the logs, and even about the dry trees which are not fallen In some cases, you may find an Asian with timber in form of hard wood while the next personcannot have the timber This is as a result of the discrimination by the foresters, or the rangers I am sure these things are known by the rangers, if they are being done by their colleagues, and likewise, if it is the rangers who are doing the discrimination, then the foresters must know what is going on Let the people have what they wantMr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also request the roads in the forests to be maintained There is a road in Shinyalu forest where it is only the tractors which can make their way in There are also tourists who would like to walk through Kakamega Forest to see birds, snakes and all other types of animals Roads in such an economic area should be murrumed and, if possible, tarmacked Something should be urgently done about the current condition of those roads in the forestsLastly, let me talk about cultivation in the forests If this has no harm, and the people carry out their activities in the manner that they are advised by the foresters, I think that would not be a bad ideaWith those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr.Kabingu—Muregi): Thank you very much, Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir I rise to join my fellow colleagues in supporting this Vote, which is very import¬ant My Ministry is out to make sure that Kenyans do not suffer because of short¬age of wood, and in order to do this, my Minister has gone out to the public to encourage more planting of trees in various parts of our country, including the arid and semiarid areas In order to succeed in this, it has been necessary to create awareness in the public and this has been done through public meetings and barazas involving chiefs and sub-chiefs, and even school lectures We have achieved this through our officers in the fieldMr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has done a tremen¬dous job in the sense that the Government has assisted in allocating enough funds to employ officers who are posted in the districts and divisions purposely to advise the public on the importance of planting trees as well as preservation of the existing ones Many people have been talking about the forest cover in this country being less than three per centHowever, I think there is no logic in this because three or four per cent would only mean the registered forest areas It is necessary to put into consdideration the other forests which have been merged together, particularly in rural areas and big farms This merge has been encouraging to farmers wherever they are Thus the forest cover in this country is more than 15 per cent, and this is a commendable situation in our country, although this is not enough What my Ministry is doing is to encourage more planting of trees by establishing tree nurseries in various places, including locations and sub—locations.It has been noted in many places that even schools have started their own nurseries and even of water is not readily available, children bring small amounts of water in bottles to water their seedlings My Ministry is encouraging this exercise because with the money we have in our Vote, we cannot satisfy the demand for tree seedlings in this country People have been made aware of the need to plant more trees and create more forests As a result, the demand for tree seedlings has become greater than what my Ministry cam supply In addition to primary and secondary schools and other institutions, women groups, which have been financed by district development committes, have also brought a relief tht is remarkable in satisfying the demand for seedlingsMr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is very important, and has put a lot of effort in providing the necessary plantations in this country with a view to providing enough tree seedlings for the production of wood It has not fallen short of my Ministrys recognition that the nation is growing very fast The countrys youth, who need homes, has grown bigger The youth form 70 per cent of the population of this country Thus, my Ministry has continued to preserve and provide the necessary material for the production of timber However, if the Ministry is given more funds, we will go a long way in creating more plantations wherever possible because our population is growingThe importance of trees is recognised due to the desertification that has been sounded everywhere Thus, my Ministry has continued to discouragethe destruction of forests unnecessarily This does not mean that the Ministry has gone out to stop necessary cutting down of trees for fuel, which is a requisite in our daily lives However, I call upon all hon Members to join my Ministry in working hard to make sure that the people are educated on the importance of preserving treesbecause of the dangers we may face if trees are destroyed as they used to be previously before unnecessary felling of trees was imposedI am personally satisfied with the manner in which indigenous trees have been preserved of late because of the ban that was recently imposed on the felling of cedar and other important trees The felling of trees had gone as far as creating problems in water, sources The remaining water sources were only in places with indigenous trees Therefore, by stopping further tree destruction, we are sure that dry streams might start flowing againI also wish to say something about mines and geology This is a very important department in my Ministry We are talking about unemplyment I was surprised when Ivisited Kasigau area where gem stone mining is going on I found a very encouraging situation there, and I would urge people to go out and seek assistance from the Ministry in the mining of previous stones which would bring a lot of foreign exchange into the country I do not know whether the public is ignorant of the fact that full assistance is available in my Ministry for would be miners This assistance is in the form of knowledge possessed by my officers, who would be cheaper to employ than consultants who would charge exorbitant fees I call upon hon Members to sell this idea to their constituents so that they may come forward and see if they can start the mining industry as this is one way in which we can create emloyment without waiting for foreigners to come to help us.I would like to congratulate His Excellency the President on his being the first environmentalist who has encouraged this country to grow more trees He has, in fact, started his own tree nursery at Kabarak, and this is a wonderful place for any of us to visit and see the kind of indigenous tree seedlings he has maintained thereWith regard to the recent situation in this country, in which some people came out to overthrow the Government, I would like to say that their action is condemned by all of us, particularly the people of Nyandarua who have stood firm with the Government as Kanu supporters We will never move an inch out of our stand We support our President and the Government, and we hope that peace will prevail as soon as possibleWith these few remarks, Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker,Sir, I support</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.KIILU: Thank you very much, Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chance to air my views in supporting the Vote of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resoures This Ministry has proved to be very good and, although wananchi previously used not to take the Ministry as important as they do today, they have now known the importance of the Ministry simply because of what they get from the MinistryI agree that this Ministrys Vote should be passed without any problems I also urge the Minister to request for more money so that the Ministry may be of more benefit to wananchi3  	   I am saying this because formerly this Ministry used to maintain tree nurseries in areas which had tree planting Kilogrammes Ministry officers should advise wananchi in dry areas on the type of trees that should be planted in dry areas so that they can plant drought resistant treesThe Minister himself should also visit dry areas like Masinga Where, I am happy to say, people are interested in planting trees. If he visits such areas the Minister will know how wananchi can be assisted in order to plant more trees for their benefit in future In fact, after felling down indigenous trees, people have learned to appreicate the importance of trees after seeing how areas without trees look likeWe are lucky in that we are near Masinga Dam where the President planted some trees Some nurseries in tills area are drying up and we would like the Ministry staff to come and tell us how we can save those tree nurseries If we have planted the wrong trees we should be  advised and we will use water from the dam to plant the right treesThe Ministry should also allow administration officials to grant people authority to clear bushes where they want toestablish shambas. Even the subchiefs can be allowed to grant such permission. People should also be allowed to burn charcoal from the big treesin the areas where they want to establish shambas and also be licensed to transport this charcoal to n towns where they m can get better prices This would be of great help to wananchi.I should also say some thing about precious stoneslike gemstones that have brought a lot of money into this country More people should, therefore, be licensed to deal in these stones. But the Government should also assist such people in finding where g	these precious stones are found this is another way of creatingself-employment for our people. The licensing should only be confinedto people who are experienced in determining the quality of thesestones.	Finally, I want to congratulate the Government for theaction it took to deal with the hooliganism and thvgery that eruptedin the country a few days ago. This was the work of a few peoplewho are envious of the development we have achieved and also theleadership of our President. We should condemn those who incited	 young innocent people. I appeal to the government to punish those inciters and also  request the Government to take action against such people. Consideringwhat we were told here yesterday, there might be people in this House, including Ministers, who were involved. We, therefore, requestthe Government to investigate the matter and disclose them becausewananchi would like to know them so that they know who the enemiesof our Republic are. These are people who can destroy the economyof this country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I congratulate ourResident for visiting various districts so that every wanachi hasa chance of meeting his President.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech> 	&(TA  DR. MISOI: Thank you, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to support this Motion.  We know  that without a  healthy environment, all that is possible will not be possible. The life of both animals and plants will not be possile without the environment It is,therefore, important that the way we exploit the environment should enhance our development efforts. We should protect it Jror the future of our generation.We derive fossils and fuel for our use Our shelter depends on what the environment offers "Then we talk about precious stones and other minerals which are used in our industries come from the environment There is this question of exessive destructio of forests This is an important area and if we do not stop the encroachment of the desert southwards, we will have no future The Ministry should take appropriate action and create awareness among the people. We can all team up in the spirit of Harambee to not only exploit the environment, but to protect it as well It will require resource , material and research I believe that the National Environment Secretariat is able to do the job. I believe that is has well trainer, personnel who will work hark and advise the Government on what should be done in order to improve the environment There is no use of having such a secret¬ariat if it does not have facilities to carr out research Those officers should not sit in offices they should be in laboratoryos and industries monitoring the effluent which is likely to be disposed of on land or in rivers.This is a challenging job and the Ministry look for funds either internally or externally. It must collaborate with external agencies and other bodies charged with the responsibility of promoting a viable environment. The National Environment Secretariat should be a body which we can roly upon in determining what is good for this country.	We should only allow the setting up of industries whichwill not pollute the environment. This brings to the question, of dumping of toxic elements which is an issue that has to be taken up at the international level. They right try to give developing countries monetary offers in order to be allowed to duirp toxic waste in their countries and we must be careful. We should not destroy the future of this country simply because we want aid and so on. We have read in the Press about sone countries which want to export toxic waste to Namibia and a few other countries. We may be desperate for funds for development 	but we should also be desperate to protect this country for future generation.	We must thank the President because he doing is everything. Hehas pioneered the area or afforestation and has been a remarkablefigure in international meetings, such as the on ozone Layer which most people had not heard of Cur President ave a tough address to people who believe they are more advanced than we are. This is because we have a leader who is interested in all aspects of lives, be it social, political, scientific, technical and so on.Then we have a leader like this one, we cannot but condomn the recent riots which that place in this country and also the pronouncements which have been made carelessly by people who think that this country is not strong enough to resist. I must say that this country is strong because people care for this country and they love the President.ss gYesterday, we had a Motion of national importance where names were read. We also heard that there are some people who are on the fence, that is, one leg here and the other one there. Time has come when people like these ones should not be 	allowed to eat from both sides You are either on the Governmentside or not If you are not, then you should get out and if you cannot get out, you will be kicked out. That is very important and we must be alert. We should not wait for the President to always tell us to do this and that When there were riots in some areas, some representatives of those areas too time to respond It took their, two to three days before they said somethingabout the riots. Why was this so?  Were they happy with riots? If they were not, why did they not go and talk to their people? Were they caring for this country. The Time has come for us torespond immediately For example, Sir, if there was a problem in your area, you should go back and talk to their people and show them the Nyayo was which is peace, love and unity. That is very important and we have to speak to our people and tell them what is right.I am very happy to report that there were no riotsin Uasin Gishu District. That is a sign of good leadership in that district and we will maintain it we would like to assure this country that we are Myayo people fully and we will not entertain destructive elements. We will not entertain rioters and poli¬tical prostitutes we will stay steadfast and take care of this country. We will also speak when the need arises we must no pretend we are either on this or on that side there are no two ways Let us not pretend up service must stop and let us not imagine that there are other leaders other than us in this House.This Parliament has been attacked and it ill not be there tomorrow, we will not be here For our survival, we must defend this country and its institutions	So, we have to defend the institutions of this country We must defend the Presidencythe Judiciary, the Executive and the ruling pary, Kanu, which is the party which has seen us up to where we are We must move from here, further ahead, and we cannot move in we do not maintain these institutions which have given us light, peace, love and unity We: cannot do that unless we are united and we cannot do that unless we reduce gossips We have to be true to the Nyayo philosophy and we must be: true to the guidelines provided within thei Kanu Constitution, and we have to protect the Constitution of this country because it was meant to take care of this country and to safeguard the integrity of this country, its unity and so on If we believe that we are a nation, then we must be a nation We cannot be a nation unless we act as one people under one leader and one party Those whoare outside are wasting time they are spoiling the good name of this countryWith those few remarks, Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.MIRUKAOWUOR: Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to make a few observations on this very vital and important VoteFirst of all, let me start by contratulating the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources because we notice that they have appointed Kenyan experts who sire quite knowledgeable and who are able to focus environmental problems to enable the government to appreciate the volume of the problemThe question of environmental degradation is a matter of concern to the whole world today It is noted and it has been confirmed that activities of man on earth have led to environmental degradation Consequently, it has been noticed that there has been a general global climate warming or change This is manifested in various ways You have seen floods arising at times when they should not arise, and that is becausse of the activities of manWhen God created the earth, he provided life support systems. In the ocean there are fishes and coral reefs which tend to balance life on earth There are also animals in the forest which, by their activities, tend to balance life on earth The activities of man have led to destruction of forests and also pollut¬ion of rivers and air Activities of man, through increased population, put heavy demands on the life support system Consequently, it is now acknowledged in the world that the earth on which we live is threatened life might come to a standstill altoghether unless some action is taken This is why I am taking this opportunity to congratulate the officers in the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources for focusing these facts to the: attention of the GovernmentMr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, you have seen that our President is a leading environmentalist He has urged the people of Kehya to grow trees of various kinds, particularly indigenous trees, with the aim of restoring what has already been destroyed His Excellency the President has also led in appealing to the people of Kenya to ensure that population growth is kept under controlMr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, you will no doubt recall that His Excellency the President recently gave a keynote address in London on the ozone depletion ThS ozone! depletion is acknowledged throughout the world today because of the activities of man on earth Man creates fossil gases from motorvehicles and industries, and these escape into the atmosphere and destroy the ozone layer Consequently, the sun rays hit the earth more directing causing danger to life on earth You, therefore, have people becoming blind as a result of lack of protection from sun raysSir, I am emphasizing that the question of environment is a vital matter which should be considered by the Government, and I would appeal to the Ministry concerned to consider establishing a Parliamentary committee on environment The importance of this is that the committee will assist the committee and the govern¬ment to bring more awareness tothe people of Kenya that this question of environ¬mental degradation is not a light matter it should be taken more seriously and the people should be more concerned and cooperate with the Government at all times to improve environmental conditionsMr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, resulting from the action of His Excel lency the President and the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, the population of Kenya has already been noticed to have been contained and, in fact, it is going down It has been acknowledged by the United Nations that Kenya is one of the Third World countries which have been able to control population There are other fields in which action should be taken For instance, in the field of establishing afforestation programmes, let me: cite Kisurnu where we have a district forestry officer and a forest officer under him One wonders what they are doing There is one forester at Konguta and there are very manyother areas Kisiani Hills used to be a forest even before the attainment of Independence, and was being maintained I would appeal to the Ministry to go round and plant trees and maintain them This will help in the improve¬ment of the environmentThere is also a very serious problem, which we have complained about on severail occasions namely, the pollution of rivers The factories in Kisumu, for instance, the Muhoroni Sugar Factory, emit a lot of effluent into the Nyando River This is done in daylight and the: Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources is fully aware of that situation Consequently, fish in the Nyando River die and you can see them on any day floating At the same time, human beings consume this water and become sick Livestock are also deprived of their water So, this is something on which action should be taken rather urgently by the Ministry Sir, I have said that when the earth was created, there was provision for lifesupport systems and the areas like forests are in an alarming state beeause the demand for more cultivation land is increasing and this, sometimes, ends up in bringing about soil erosion and, therefore, animals in the forests dying, or becoming extinct They are becoming extinct because of human activities and this question of afforestation is, therefore, very urgent and should be carried out throughout the country In fact, if you look at the n ap of the world, you will notice that the area of Africa is worse off in terms of forests Those parts that used to be densely populated are now becoming deserts I think it is also acknowledged that the Sahara Desert is encroaching towards the south and we in Kenya will be victims very soon unless something is done by the Government and our people for that matterSo, Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,I support the voteand urge the Ministry to create more awareness by involving Members of Parliament in environmental matters. The Ministry should also establish an Environmental Committee If I am not wrong, conferences on environment go on every month throughout the world and Kenya.should be represented so that we are net left behind in this area kenya is known to be advanced in many spheres and we should move along with the developed countries of the world.Regarding the recent distribances, we have always that we in Nyansa do not have a problem. We only appeal to the Government to bring development to the people You have seen that Nyanza and  	particularly Misumu remained peaceful curing tue nets and if may say a word a few people in recent months have called for the	dissolution of Parliament I am defeated to understand on what basisan individual can stand up  and call for the dissolution of Parliament 2his shows complete disregard of the Constitution and the procedures established therein I know that sere of the people who have called for the dissolution of Parliament are people who helped us in fighting for cur Independence they brought Independence and we thank them for that But the style of politics changes some people believe that the oil fashioned method of  abusing the Government or abusing the Minister is the only style, of politics but today we are in a situation where we pleading for more development by co-operating with the Government	With those few remarks I beg to support.</Newspeech>                  <Newspeech> MR.

First of all I would like to thank His Excellency the president and also the ministry of environment and Natural Resources for playing a leading role in the protection of our environment through various afforestation programmes that we see today in our country. The crusade which His Excellency the president has initiated and championed in this country very few of us do realize the importance of that crusade. This is because in the next 10 or 20 years of we will still be living we want to see the whole country under green forest cover. We all know the benefits of a green belt. We have afforestation programmes all over the country and we shall protect our natural resources so that we may have rain all the year round. This will have a direct effect on our food production.                   Having said that I would like to touch on a few points arising from the Development Estimates. But before I am into that , I would like to urge the Minister when he stands to reply, to list items on fuel wood programme. I would like that programme to be extended to all districts in the country. This is because that is very important. The co-ordinate role of the ministry is very, very vital. This is because as we all know, we have various agencies that have established afforestation schemes in this country; we have the Non- Government organizations who have afforestation schemes and we have our ruling party Kanu which has our afforestation programmes. We have even some leadership afforestation schemes. We would like the ministry to intensify its Co-ordinate role. This is because if these programmes are left on their own , some of them will collapse and yet we have created the desire in our people to plant trees.         	 		  		So, I am just urging the Ministry to increase its co-ordinative role in the various afforestation schemes in the country.The other point that I want to touch on is that recently there was a Conference on Ozone Layer which was held in London and I am sure that the then Minister for Environment and natural Resources attended that meeting.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MALIMBE: We cannot hear you.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: Probably ther is too much noise in	the Chamber. You know very well that as a former DistrictCommissioner I know how to address barazas. I am referring to the Ozone Layer Conference which was held in London If we go by the international trends I think the Secretariat of the Ozone Layer. I would have liked the Kenya Government to campaign very seriously Since we have the headquarters of the uUnited Nations Environment Programme here in Kenya I think the secretariat of the Ozone layer Programme should be sited here in Kenya. This is because there is a lot of funding and I am sure that if it is sited here in Kenya we will benefit a lot. But I was a bit disturbed to hear that the profit may have to go to another country. We know very well that His Excellency the President was the Chief Speaker in one of the conferences sometime last year. So it is only honourable that theSecretariat of the Ozone Layer Programme is sited here in Kenya to be attached to the UNEP.	        Now coming to the Development Estimatas, I do not know whether I got the wrong Volume. I would particularly like to refer the House to Head 676 — Sub—Head 910 Bungoma under forestry and Plantation Development. You will find that Bungoma district has been allocated   K£270,527 but out of that amount it is only K£4,500 that can be said to be set aside for development. But the rest isRecurrent; it goes to personal emoluments and maintenance of buildings and so on. I say this because Development Budget should stick more to development than to recurrent expenditure. This is because</Newspeech>     <Newspeech> THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Order, hon. Makhanu.
