Why  did  it  take  too  long  until  i  asked  the  Question twice for  the  man  to  be  paid? This  is  the  second  time  I  have asked the Question Whv  was  it  delayed  up-to  this  moment  <Newspeech> MR.   KEAH: Mr.   Speaker,   sir,   hon.   arap  Chepkok, is  aware  ofthe  procedures  and  accountability  aspects  that  must  be  gonethrough  in  order  to  effect  the  payment  of  any gratuity  orpensions  due. Unfortunately,   for  Mr.  Kangogo,  the  necessarypapers  were  delayed  in  various  other  Ministries  and  thecompleted  papers  were  obtained  at  the  Treasury  in  April  whenthe  cheques  were  written.  </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.   SPEAKER:	Next  Question. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.   arap  CHEPKOK: On  a  point  of  order,  Mr..   Speaker,   Sir,I  think  the  Assistant  Minister  is  misleading  the  House  becausethe  papers  went  to  the  Treasury  in  January,   not  in  April  ashe  says. Can  he  tell  the  House  the  exact  date  or  he  withdraws.that  remark? I  have  got  the  papers here  showing  that  thepapers  went  to  the  Treasury  in  January,  but  not  in  April  ashe  says. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.   KEAH: Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,   with  all  due  respect,Mr.   arap  Chepkok  is  not  aware  of  the  accountability  proceduresthat  we  have  got  to  go  through. I  am  telling  him  that whenthe  papers  reached  the  Treasury  they  had  to  go  through  variousstages  of  checking  and  counter-checking  and  writing  back  to.Iten  and  back  to  us  and  to  his  former  Ministry. In  any  case,since  he  has  been  apid,   why  is  he  worried? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.   WASIKE-NDOMBI: Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,   the  AssistantMinister  is  aware  that  before  a  Government  servant  retiresresigns  or  is  dismissed   in  this  particular  case  it  wasretirement there  is  a  notice  of  six  months  which  is  given to that  particular  officer  by  the  parent  Ministry  which  means,Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,   that  the  parent  Ministry  supplies  thenecessary  information  and  gets  prepared  so  that  when  a Government  servant  retires  at the  end  of  six  months  all  his papers  have  been  worked  out. .  Is  he.not  misleading  the  House  by  saying  that after  the  officer  has  retired  is  when  the  parent Ministries  begin  running  around  with  the  papers? </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR.   KEAH:   Mr.   Speaker,   Sir, with  due  respect,   those  maybe the  views  of  the  hon.  Wasike-Ndombi,   but  certainly,   I  am  not misleading  the. House  and  he  knows  very  well  the  procedures.	Infact,   it  is  not  six  months  it  is  nine  months.	Despite  that,Mr.   Speaker,   those  nine  months  come  and  go  without  the  Treasury having  the  necessary  information. When  we  get  the  information many  times it  is  usually  incorrect  E.nd  if  it  is  incorrect  we cannot  permit  a  cheque  to  be  issued  without  the  necessary corrections. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.   arap  CHEPKOK: Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,   I  am sorry  theAssistant  Minister,   is  still  misleading  the  House. I  askedthis  question  last  year  in  April. Why  is  he  talking  aboutnine  months? When  they  got  the  second  Question  they  managedto  pay. Why  did  they  not  pay last  year? Why  is  he  misleadingthe  House  that  it  takes  nine-Months? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER : 	Next Question. </Newspeech>Question No.	424MR. MWAMZANDI asked the Minister  for Agriculture:-	(a)   when the Coconut Board of Kenya will be formed as	promised by the  Ministry;  and(b)   how many tons of coconut oil was imported between 1989 andJune,	1990.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE	(Mr.  Ngaruro):	Mr.  Speaker,Sir,  I beg to reply. (a)   I  am not aware of any Government promise to form the  Coconut Board of Kenya and my Ministry has no Plans  to form the  said Board. (b)   From January 1989 to June, 1990,  only one import licence  for importation nf 36.62 metric tonnes of refined:  bleached and  deodorized coconut oil was issued by my Ministry. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the Assistant Minister has said that he  is not aware of any promise  to form the Coconut Board of Kenya when we know that  it was publicly announced py the President during the show that the  said Board wOdId be formed.Can he  answer  the Question? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  NGARURO: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  what I am aware of is that  the President promised that  the  Coast Regional Development Authority would beformed to cater fof the development of the Coast Province. I have beeninformed by the Minister for Regional Development that plans are well under way to bring the necessary instrument into this House for the formation of that particular authority. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  I  think the Assistant minister shall  -Address himself to the fact that despite  the  fact   a lot of coconut are grown at the  Coast,  this  country is  still  importing coconut oil. Now,what  is the Ministry doing to promote coconut production   and that we do not continue  importin; this commodity? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. NGARURO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said, only a very small amount of coconut oil was imported into this country this year. Because of the importance  the Government attaches  to the  Coast Province,  the President promised that  this particular Authority would be formed to cater for  the production of various crops in the region, 	We  are,  therefore,   certain that  something would be done to promote coconut production in this area. As far as the processing of coconut is concerned,  the hon. Member should pass the necessary information to his D.D.C.  so that we can take the necessary action. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE :  On a point of order,  Sir, The Assistant Minister is misleading the  House by  talking  about coconut  oil  when we  know  that  there  is no oil by such a name.	He  should instead be  talking about Palm oil.Is he in order to talk about a  non-existent oil? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.NGARURO:Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I was asked a Question about coconutoil and I answered in that breath.If Mr.  Malebe wants to raise an issuewith respect to palm oil,  he  is free to do so.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR.MALEBE:   On a point of order,  Sir.In his reply, the Assistant  Minister  said that  the Government  imported 36.52 tonnes of coconut oil.Washe  in order to talk about  'coconut oil' when we know that there is no oil by such a name?   That  is  the point I wanted him to clarify. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  NGARURO: Mr.   Speaker,  Sir, I  do not understand what the Hon. Member is talking about. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MWANZANDI:   Mr.Speaker,  Sir, we know  coconut Oil that is processed in.Kenya is used by East African Industries to process its commodity. Now,  has the importation of coconut oil affected the price of the locally produced oil?  Why  does the Ministry find it necessary  to import coconup when we have plenty of cocnut trees in the country? the price of  copra so much? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said that the amount of coconut oil that was imported was very small indeed. When this Authority become operational,the question of  processing coconut oil will definitely be taken into account.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  MWAMZANDI:   The Quantity of coconut oil which was imported was very high contrary to what  the Assistant Minister is saying. Because,of this high rate of importation,  the price of  copra droopedimmediately. How many tonnes of this oil was   imported? </Newspeech>                     <Newspeech> MR.  NGARURO:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I have already said that 36.6tonnes of coconut oil was imported last year. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  WASIKE-NDOMBI: Sir,  I  sometimes get amused. A Governmentdirective was issued and yet the Assistant Minister  is  dragging us intoa debate on the same. These  are  the  type  of Ministers who are  letting thisGovernment down. Instead of implementing a Government directive,  the Assistantminister is dragging us into a debate on  tho merits and demerits of formingthis Board   as directed by the Head of State. Is the Assistant.Minister fitto be where he is if he cannot implement what the Head of State directed? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  NGARURO: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  without going into detail regarding what the hon.  Member said,  I  said that I cannot aware that the Government promised to form the Coconut Board of Kenya. what the Government promised to form is  the  Coast Development Authority and steps have been taken to ensure  that the necessary documents are brought to this House for its formation. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: According to the Assistant Minister  an import of 36.6 tonnes  is very little.	How many tonnes of oil would be producedif all the copra from the Coast Province were Properly  </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  NGARURO:	I  am sure	a lot  of coconut  oil would be produced,as would  there be market for it in Kenya? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.. MWAMZANDI: On a Point of order,Sir. There is  too much  noisein the House and we can hardly hear what is going on tho Floor.		Can the hon.  Members to consuls one another quickly</Newspeech>         <Newspeech>   MR.  SPEAKER:	Next  Question. </Newspeech> Question No. 388DR.  MISOI asked the Miniiter for Labour why Mr.  Duncan Njogu Wambugu of P.O. Box 2723,  D Eldoret,  was dismissed by Messrs Kahoya andKahoya Limited of P.O. Box 695, Thika. <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr.Masinde): 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to reply. Mr.  Wambugu was not dismisses but his services were terminated by Kahoya and Kahoya Limited after his illness exceeded the days stipulated in the collectivebargain agreement between the Kenya Plantations and Agricultural Workers Union and Kenya Coffee Growers Association.. </Newspeech>Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Speaker,.Sir,  while I thank the Minister for that 	. good answer,  would he tell the House   what benefits this man received after raising  the issue through the union? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  MASINDE:  Mr.  Spaaker,  Sir,  Mr. Wambugu fell sick but was paid his full  salary for 45 days.  After that he was paid his half salary for the next 45 days but when he was unable to resume duty, he was laid off. 	All in all,  Mr.  Wambugu spent over 140 days out of employment and according to the agreement between the union and the employer,  he was paid all his dues amounting to Shs.2,89/-  including leave and other terminal benefits. However, I would like to add here that after further investigations by my labour officer, we have managed to secure extra Shs.3,869/- which is now lying in the labour officer awaiting his collection. Therefore, if the hon. Member would advise Mr.  Wambugu to collect that money, we would be grateful. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR.  SPEAKER:  Next Question. Mr.  Kubo </Newspeech>Question No.397 MR. KUBO asked the Minister. for Labour when Mr. Martin.Aoko Omuondo,  N.S.S.F. Member No.000 	272-221,  will be paid his N.S.S.F benefits which he applied for on 12th January, 1987. <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR(Mr. Masinde): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Mr.  Omuondo, N.S.S.F. Menber No.000-272-291 had his claimed processedon the 	16th of Apri, 1987  and an N.S.S.F.  Cheque No.055649 for Kshs.1,324/85.was sent to him through the address which he had indicated, namely, P.O. Box  3 Taveta. However,this cheque was returned to the fund unclaimed  and was eventually cancelled and we would be grateful if the hon. Member  wouldadvise Mr.  Omuondo to  give us the correct addres through which we would send his cheque to him. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  i would like to take this  opportunity to thank the Minister for the  thorough investigations he has carried out 	regarding this question. I would like to promise hm that I will give him  the address of this gentleman so that he can forward the  cheque to him. However,  I would like to request the Minister to make sure that he forwards this cheque immediately I give him the address. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MASINDE:  I undertake  to do  so,  Mr.  Speaker. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  SPEAKER:  Can we move on now to Mr.  Mureithi's Question. </Newspeech>Question No.410 <Newspeech>MR.  SPEAKER:  Mr.  Mureithi is not here? Mr.  Kagwima's Question then. </Newspeech>Question No.423 MR. KAGWIMA asked the Minister for Public  Works since the raod connecting Mitunguu-Marimanti and Meru National Park is impassable especially during  the rains, whether  he  could  consider  having  it   gravelled. <Newspeech>TEE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS 	(Mr.  Maiyani):  Mr.  Speaker, Sir,  I beg  to reply. The Ministry of Public Works will not consider  gravelling the road connecting Mitunguu-Marimanti and Meru National Park because it has not been 	 considered, prioritised and recommended by the Meru District Development Committee. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAGWIMA:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I hope the Assistant Minister is talking about the road I am talking about in 	my   Question. 	I   am   saying   this because the Meru District  Development Committee this year,  considered and gave the road the second priority in the gravelling programme for the district	Consequently,  the Meru District Development a Committee has requested the Ministry to provide Shs.30 million to gravel this particular road. I do not now what road the Assistant Minister is taking about.  Could he tell thisHouse where he obtained the information that he is now giving the House from? </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, I have no reason to doubt the hon. Member that the Meru District Development Committee has recommendedthis road for gravelling,  but what I am saying is that we have not receivedthis information in the Ministry,   Therefore,  I think the whole blaze lieswith the Meru District Development Committee and I would like to	request the hon. Member to go to the District Commissioner's Office) Meru,since he is the chairman the Meru D.D.c and ask him to forward    to our office.	Subsequently,  it will now be upon us to take the matter to the	: :Treasury to ask for this money to be provided. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MALEBE:  On a point of order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  It is in order for the Minister to refuse to implement the resolution of the Meru District Development Committee while his Ministry was fully represented in the  D.D.C,  which therefore means that his officers took the resolutions with them back to the Ministry, for implementation?   Therefore,  we would like him to explain to this House why he is misleading us by  saying that he is not aware of these recommendations while he is fully aware of them. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,definitely,  I have not refused to implement 	 these resolutions,  but all  I am saying Is that these resolutions have not been delivered to our Ministry.  It is therefore to the Chairman of the Meru D.D.C to consult the  District Works Officer who is alleged to have been at the meeting  to find out why these resolutions have not been forwarded. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. MUTUA: (Mr.  Speaker)  Sir, I wonder whom we are now going to believe. Are we going to believe the Member for the area or the Minister who has never been to  the  area?   The truth of the matter is that the Meru District Development, Committee recommended that this road be given the second priority in the programme for gravelling in the  District. Why is he misleading this House! </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, I would like 	to  be understood properlyhere.	I am not blaming the hon. Member at all.  I can only blame the machineryof the Meru District  Development	Committee which is chaired by the  DistrictCommissioner.  If we have not even been given the minutes of  the D.D.C., howunder the  sun would  we know about what the D.D.C.  discussed  passed or recommended?   How would we be expected to go for money to gravel a roadwhich has not been recommended to us  for gravelling? The Meru District DevelopmentCommittee will have first  of all to send the recommendations regarding this road to us and then we  shall go  to  the Treasury to act them for the none to move the road in question. </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR.  KAGWIMA:	Arising from what  the hon.  Assistant  Minister hassaid,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  two  things  are  likely  here.	Firstly,  he  does  notUnderstand  the  operations  of the  district  development committee 	(D.D.C.) and,  secondly,  he  did  not  take  this Question  seriously. 	Apart  from  the recommendation Meru D.D.C.  made,  the District  Commissioner and the  engineer in Meru have  already made  a request  to the  Ministry for special allocation of money because  one  of the bridges  across  this road has been washed away, and the  Ministry has  already received a letter  to this  effect. 	Could the Assistant Minister  tell  us whether he  requires more time to give  this Question more  attention  and give  us  a proper reply  later? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MAIYANI:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  answer  I  have  here  wasprepared  after my Ministry consulted the District Commissioner,  Meru.	Wedo not have  any  document  in our office  showing us  this resolution.	All  Ihave  said  is  that  if there  is  a breakdown  of communication between Meru and Nairobi,  the  hon.Member could be good enough to ask his  D.D.C.  why  it did not send this  resolution to Nairobi. 	However,  I  am prepared  to  go  and telephone  the  officers  in Meru  and ask  them  why  this  recommendation has  not 	come  to us. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MALEBE:	On a point of order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.	The  AssistantMinister  is  persistently  trying to avoid the  question.The  hon.  Member  sayscategorically  that  a  letter  was written to  the  Ministry's  headquarters  by the Ministry's Work Officer  in Meru District. 	How  come  the registry of the Ministry  of Public  Works  does  not have  this  information? This  would mean that the Assistant Minister gets his answers from elsewhere and not from the Ministry.	Since  this  information  is  already with the  Ministry,  could he  begiven time to look for a proper answer to the Question.The  hon. Member  cansubstantiate  that the  said documents  are  in the Ministry. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MAIYANI:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if the hon.  Member  can substantiate his claim documentarily, he could do us a great service, and we will thenproceed  and ask   our officers why they have not shown us  this  document.	We</Newspeech> •	• .•••••	' . •;<Newspeech>MR.  KAGWIMA:	On  a point of order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.	Is  itin order  for an hon.  Member  of Parliament to be  asked to go collecting documents  from an office to  deliver  them to  another office? 	I  am trying to  find out whether the  Assistant Minister  is  in order  to  ask me  to  go  to the  offices  of Meru D.D.C.  to  take  to  the  Ministry's headquarters. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MAIYANI:.   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  quite  in order for me to   . say  that our Ministry  does  not have  this  document. 	Please,  give  us  time  to check with Meru D.D.C.  or  ask  the  hon.  Member  to  lay  the  document on the table. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  WAMBUA: 	Could  the  Assistant  Minister tell  this  House  specifically when he  is going to visit Meru for this purpose? 	It has  been  a  tendency here to promise us  that Ministers and Assistant Minister are going to visit certain places,  but  they never  do  so. When  is  this  Assistant Minister going to visit this particular place  to ascertain the  truth  of the  situation? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MAIYANI: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is now a  question of my visiting this particular road,  and  I would be  very happy to go there  as soon as possible. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  BIDU:	On a point  of order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.	Is  theAssistant Minister  in order  to use  the words  "as soon as possible"?	If he''.takes  us  seriously,  he  should know that we  want to know the particular date on which he  is  going  to  visit  the  said place.	The  words  "as  soon  as  po sible"are  meaningless. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MAIYANI:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  words  "as  soon  as possible"mean  that  I  may  visit  that place  in a week or two.	I  will  go  there  withintwo weeks. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

KAGWIMA: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when we  talk of building only three kilometres  of road in a financial year,  is  this according to the plans of the Ministry or that  there were no sufifcient funds to fulfil all the Ministry's plans? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MIBEI: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  gave a factual  answer to satisfy the  hon.  Questioner. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MALEBE: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  the Minister satisfied with -	the  performance  of the  Rural  Access  Roads  Programme  in  light  of  the  fact that  it has  build  only  15 kilometres  of roads  in  two years? 	This  would  mean that  it will  take 100 years  before  all  the  roads  in  the  constutuency  are opened. What  is  the  Minister  doing to  solve  this  problem  and get more kilometres  of road to be worked on in the  various  constituencies  in the country than is now the  case? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MIBEI: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  details of the  roads  constructed in 1989/90 are  that these roads  include Road L 3853,  from Kimauri  to Kabaru; E	606,  from Kariatu to Karambi  five kilomentres;	D  5 to  Samaki  Farm -  fourKilometers; and the  road from Karambi to Masitonis	(?)	-  three  kilometres;All totalling 12.72 kilometres.

The  Ministerhas  not answered my  question.	I wanted  to know whether he  is satisfied withthe  performance  of  the  rural  access  road programme  in the country because  the kilometres he has  referred  to are  very  few  in any  constituency. For  example, my constituency  is more  than 50 kilometres  long and more than 30 kilometres wide.	So,   if we  depended on  the rural  access  roads  programme,  then the areawill  never  be  opened  at  all.	So,  could  the Minister  respond  to  the  questionof the  performance-of  the  rural  access  roads  programme? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

I  put  this  Question by  Private Notice so that it could be given priority by  the Ministry. If we are strict that Questions by Private Notice should be answered within 48 hours,  the Question should be answered today. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  SPEAKER:	But  the Assistant Minister has  asked  for more  time  toanswer the  Question.	Let us move on to Mrs.  Ndetei's Question.</Newspeech> 7. <Newspeech>MRS.  NDETEI: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  beg  to  ask  the Minister for Tourism and  Wildlife  the following Question by Private Notice. Since Tsavo  Inn Limited  in Mtito Andei Urban Council has remained closed  for  the  last two years,  and realising that  it is one of the major employment  and  income generating hotels  in Kibwezi  Constituency,  what urgent measures is  the Minister  taking to ensure  that  it is  re-opened  forthwith? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  MINISTER FOR  TOURISM  AND  WILDLIFE 	(Mr.  Ngala): 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, I  beg  to reply. Tsavo  Inn Hotel  Limited  in Mtito Andei Urban Council was re-operned on 16th September, 	1990,  on completion of renovations  and refurbishments which necessitated  its  closure  since June, 	1988. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS.  NDETEI: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  I  thank  the hon.  Minister  for giving me  that reply,  I  would  like  to know  if he  can  explain  to  this  House why this  particular hotel  had  to  be  closed  for  two years. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  NGALA: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thought  I  did  answer  that  question when I  said that it had been closed for renovation and refurbishment purposes. Since  it is  a private  concern,  we  cannot  push  the  proprietors  too  much  without allowing  them  to organise  their finances. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS.  NDETEI: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  although  I  agree with the  Minister that  this  is  a private  concern,  he  should realise  that the  concern  is giving the  public  a  very  important service. If the  particular owner has  been unable to operate  this  particular hotel,  I am then requesting the Minister,  it is possible,  to  find out  Even when  the  hotel was  operating the  services were very poor  and that is a very strategic hotel between Nairobi and Mombasa. 	Since many  people  travelling between Nairobi and Mombasa would like to use  the services of that hotel,  and taking into account the fact that the services offered there are  very  poor,can the Minister assure me that the hotel will continue operations on an improved basis? I  have  been  there  and  I  can  assure  the  Minister  that  • 3  ' no reasonable  renovations were done for the two years the hotel remained closed. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  NGALA:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  think we do first things first.	Thefirst thing was  to do  the renovations,  and  I  am sure that after sinking so muchmonty,  the private  investor is going to  improve  the service  so that the clientswho  visit  the  hotel  get the  best  service.	So,   I  can  assure  the  hon.  Memberthat the service will be improved. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  P.G.  GODANA:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  can  the. Minister  assure  us  thatthe  employees  of  this  particular hotels have  not  lost  their wages  and benefitsas  a result of  the temporary Closure? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  NGALA:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,   I  cannot comment  on  that  since  I  thinkit should be hanled by  the Ministry  of Labour. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  TUVA:	Mr.  Speaker.,  Sir,  if the  owners  of the hotel  are  not ableto open it,  and taking  into consideration the  fact that the Nairobi-Mombasa1'.route has  to be  served by an  institution  like  that one,  can he  consider  takingit throughhe Kenya Tourist DeVelopment Corporation so that  it can re-open  immediately? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  NGALA: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,   I  think hon.  Tuva  did  not get  my  initialreply.	I  said  that  the hotel has  been  operational  since  16th  September,	1990.So,  I  do not think  there  is any fear of the  hotel  not working now. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS.  NDETEI:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when this  particular hotel  closeddown two years  ago,  the reason given by  the management then was  that they werehaving  management problems. When the Minister  says  that  the management wasrenovating and refurbishing the hotel,  I  think either  the proprietor  is misleadng   the Minister or  the Minister  is misleading this House.	If  this  hotel  wasto close,again,  could the Minister  consider approaching  the proprietors so thatthey could sell it or the Ministry could take it over so that the services arecontinued?  I just want that assurance. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  NGALA:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  not misleading this House.	Therenovation was  done  and  I  have  seen  it myself on my way  to Mombasa.	As  faras whether  the  hotel can be  taken over by  the Kenya Tourist Development Corporation,  let me point out that KTDC  is  not very  keen  in taking over  and  managing hotels;  their role  is  to promote business people  to  take over hotels  and run them. So,  in this case,  if a situation  like  the one the hon.  Member envisages arises,  we will probably require Kenyans  to  take  over the hotel and run it as opposed  to the  hotel  being taken over by  KTDC. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MALEBE: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  can  the  Minister  confirm whether  the re-opening of the hotel was by the  order of the Ministry or whether  it was done voluntarily  by  the  proprietor?	What role  does  the  Government have  in  thathotel? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  NGALA:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there	was  no  order  issued  from  theMinistry.	The  proprietor  opened  the hotel  when  it was  convenient  to him. </Newspeech><Header> COMMUNICATION FROM THE  CHAIR </Header>      <Newspeech>MR.  SPEAKER: 	Hon.

KACWIMA: On a point  of  order,  Mr.  Speaker   Sir.  My point  of  order is  in connection with the  outbreak of meningitis  in Tharaka Division.	During the last few months a number of deathshave  occurred in Tharaka  Division.The disease meningitis haskilled a number of  people  in Tharaka  Division.	When this  issuewas reported to the Medical Officer of Health in charge of Meru District  Hospital, his reaction was that  there is no  outbreak of that  disease anywhere  in Meru District. He  said that those who have  died in Tharaka  Division have  died due to other causes. 	He  claimed that those people died because they refused to  go to hospital to  seek medical,   treatment  and that  instead  of going to hospital they chose to  go to herbalists for treatmentI would like to put the record  straight. You will find that more than 20 people have been killed by meningitis in  Tharaka Division alone.	On 1st September,	1990,  I called a pressconference within the  precincts  of Parliament  Buildings	the records right  and  I am happy that  the Director  of MedicalServices,  when contacted,  admitted that several people in Divisionhave been killed by this disease.Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the Director of Medical Services 	 has  confirmed that this disease has killed people in Tharaka,Division and the Medical Officer of  Health in Meru should not try 	to  contradict his  superiors by alleging   that  people are dying as 	a result  of witchcraft  and so  on. I would therefore urge the ' Ministry of Health to treat  this matter   with the urgency 	it  deserves  and  save the people of  Meru   from this calamity 	and particularly by removing   that particular Medical Officer of  Health from  Meru District.	This  is because the peopleof Meru have lost  confidence in the  officer concerned.This	particular Medical Officer of Health  goes out to drink during office hours  and the Ministry should look into his conduct. The Ministry must  act  swiftly in order to  save the people  of Meru from this disease. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>DR.  MISOI: On a point  of order, 	Mr.  Speaker, SirMy point of order is in connexion with a Question I raised in this House during our last  sitting regarding a farm in Uasin Gishu District:   This  is farm number L.R. 112190 whose sub-division has  created a lot  of tension. The reply from that Minister concerned was that  the land was being sub-divided. The name of the farm is Akururet  Farm in oneptes Division ofUasin Gishu. 	In the course of a sub-dividing this land, the farmers agreed to contribute a small portion of their land for a public utility site. They have identified the site, along the road. But a few people have been trying to frustrate these farmers and I would like to request the Minister concerned to givi an assurance to this House that whenever people agree to dosingle  Individual  should be  allowed to frustrate them because  that is completely unconstitutional. The  same few  individitals alsO want to victimise the  chief who has refused to  get  involved in this shaddy deal. This  is unfair to the  poor  and humble  people who  just want to  put  up bakeries,  hospitals and other  public  utilities.  So, could the Minister concerned assure this House; at  the right time, that the needs of these poor people will be taken care of without any further frustrations?   Thank you. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  SPEAKER:  Next  Order. </Newspeech><Header> COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY</Header>  (Order for  Committee read  being the Seventh Allotted Day) <Header> MOTION</Header>  THAT,  Mr.  Speaker do  now leave the Chair. Vote 	33 	- Ministry of Technical Training and Applied Technology. <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TECHNICAL TRAINING AND APPLIED TECHNOLOGY	(Prof.Ongeri):Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, I beg to movethat Mr.  Speaker do now leave the Chair.Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my Ministry was  established on24th March,	1988,  by the Presidential Circuler	No.1 of	1988,With very specific functions	- technical Training Policy and  applied technology.Under the Division of Technical Training Policy,  we have formulationtechnical training policies. Also this Division	takes  care  of  technical  education,  institutes  of technology,	,  technical training institutes which were the former tehnical secondary schools, the national polytechnics, youth polytechnics 	and the vocational training centres.	It  also looks after the Jua Kali Development programme	centres  which are nnaer the Directorate of Industrial Training. 	Mr.  Sneaker,  Sir,  with the formation af this new Ministry,  it was quite clear that we   had to formulate the objectives of the Ministry. One  of  the  objectives that were formulated was first of all,  to  provide increased training opportunities for the increasing numbers of  school leavers in the country. The  second one was to develop Practical skills and attitudes in the youth of Kenya so  that this can lead them Into income-generating activities, both in.the urban and rural areas. The third  one was to  encourage self-employment while at the same time,  producing skilled artisans, technidians  and technologists for both formal and the informal  sectors. 	The  fourth one was to  enhance the pace of our .3; national development by creating sellable  skills In the youth of Kenya.,   The fifth one was to  ensure that the practical education and training skills  are responsive and relevant to Kenya's agricultural, industrial,  commercial and economic needs. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these objectives are in conformity with the development  and manpower training  strategies  contained in Sessional Paper No.6  of 1988,  and  Sessional Paper No.1 of 1986,  of which I believe hon.  Members have had the opportunity to peruse through.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir, my Ministry has undertaken the following programmes.   One;  to co-ordinate the implementation of technical education and training components of the 8-4-4 system of education and to harmonize the curriculum and certification of these programme. In view of the fact that at the time the Ministry was set up there was no clear harmonization policy,  I am glad to report to this House that in 1988 my Ministry carried out a very extensive study and reorganisation of this sector,  and we now have fully harmonized curriculum and certification process in all the various qualification programmes in the technical  education sector. 	Secondly, we are charged with the responsibility of managing technical  training and other activities in 573 youth polytechnics out of which 320 are Government assisted.   The rest are privately assited. It would be important to inofrm this august House that there are various categories within the Ministry and,  I think,  it is important that hon. Members know this. The Ministry has programmed itself in creating more training opportunities in the youth of Kenya in the following manner.   We do know that the post-primary 5chool  leavers are many and not every one of them is going to proceed to the formal  secondary education programme. last year there were more than.500,000 students who sat for the Kenya Certificate for Primary Education and only a handful, 216,000 were able to gain places to proceed on to the formal  secondary education programme.   the balance of 300,000 who are between the ages of	13 and	15 years cannot proceed with formal  education.We felt that this group can be catered for in the post-primary trainingprogramme.   The most ideal  institution for training these young men and women is the youth polytechnics, originally referred to as village polytechnics.• ••Sir,  I  am happy to say that the Ministry has now harmonized the type of certification to be awarded at this level. 	I would also like to state that out of 573 youth polytechnics, thee is a total  enrolment of about31,000 youth of this country.   Our wish and hope is to budget for this and that is why we have come to this august House,  to increase the total  enrolment of these children to more than 100,000. I  shall  be coming back later to point out how individual Members of Parliament can assist on the Harambee spirit that is so prevalent in this country,  to increase the enrolment of our post-primary school  leavers to a respectable number and give them saleable skills that can sustain them for self-employment. The second sphere of our training programme is the middle colleges. Before we had the institutes of technology and we have 17 of them; we have the former secondary technical  education schools, which numbered 19. These have been turned into technical  training institutes,  along with the institutes of technology which are 17 in number.   Currently, we have a total  number of 36 middle colleges offering techical  skills,  at the craft,  technician,  diploma and hopefully in the future,  at higher diploma levels.   currently, the enrolment in this group is just about 6,000 and we are hoping that by next year, 1991, with the programme in hand and after this budget is passed, we will double the in-take of our youth to the middle colleges to 13,000, which is only about 1,500 less than the in-take in our four public universities. My wish and hope is that this will grow and rise to 50,000. 	Sir,  I  say this because the future of Kenya,  surely enough,  rests in the hands of the people with saleable skills.   The future industrialists of this country must come from the group of this middle college level who have attained the skills that can enable them to set themselves up in their own self-employed activities, It is important and crucial that we angulate our education system and tailor it towards technical  education rather thanproducing candidates who will be on the streets seeking for jobs and- we know that the number of jobs available are very limited,  it would be very difficult to absorb most of the graduates from the public universities.  It is my plea,  therefore, that hon. Members,  in their respective constituencies, will preach the good gospel of technical  education.   The future of this land,  and Kenya, lies in the hands of skillful  people;  nothing less and nothing more. 	At the higher level,  to give you a bird's eye view,  last year there were  171,000 students who sat for the  '0'  level  examinations and 'A'  level, too. Out of that group,  it is only 40,000 who may gain entry to our four public universities and those outside Kenya.   The balance of 110,000 will  have to look for opportunities in other post-secondary and training institutins.   I would like to suggest that this is where we should lay our emphasis in order to be able to create more opportunities at post-secondary training programmes.   I have just said that we hope to double this figure to 13,000 and with more funds being made available to the Ministry,  e should be in a position to increase this number to respectable levels.   At the higher level we hve the national  polytechics and at the moment we have three national  polytechnics;  namely, the Kenya Polytechnic leading with the number of enrolment,  at 4,000; the Mombasa Polytechnic with ,1,400   and the recently opened Eldoret Polytechnic, with an enrolment of about 500. We hope to increase the number of students at our national  polytechnics to offer higher diploma programmes.   Obviously,  it is our expectation that we will, eventually,  be able to create a Bachelor of Technology degree awarded at the polytechnic level  so that the level  of skills is equivaleR5 to the kind of service mwananchi  expects to get from this trained manpower. Having said that,  Sir, there is a second aspect of my Ministry that I would like to touch on; namely, the Jua Kali  sector.   You all  know that before 1986 the Jua Kali  sector was regarded as a function of drop-outs;  people who were anti-social  and as a function that was not respectable society.	I am proud to say that through the singular effort of His Excellency the President, today the Jua Kali  sector is a respectable one. 	In fact,  it has the ingredients and fashioning of a very primary and basic industrial complex of Kenya today.   For those of  you who may not have known what jua kali artisans are they have now come of age because they are capable of producin items of diverse Qualities. In the prototype exhibition weheld last year in Eldoret I would like to tell hon. Membersthat in November we will have a special jua kali exhibition  in Mombasa which will be geared towards indicating the diversi¬fication level of production available in the jua kali sector.One good thing about this sector is that over the one o’clock newstoday I heard that the jua kali sector stand won the first price at the first prize at the Nairobi International Show; that shows us how proliferative this sector is and it has now moved on to, in fact, encompass the Kenyan economy.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the third aspect of my Ministry is the Directorate of Industrial Training (DIT). This is a department which caters for people already enganged in the existing industries. As you know/we have ycung boys and girls employed in the various industries in this country. Therefore, these young people receive technical training skills through the DIT in our four centres: We have the Nairobi Industrial Training Centra, other centres in Nairobi and Mombasa and a special textile training institute which is tailored  and geared towards  imparting skills to our youth in textile industries,,Having said,so,I would like to spend a minute or two enumerating what happens in the youth polytechnics and what they get at the end of the two-year course Programme. At the end of the two-year programme, they get an artisan certificate in subjects ranging from house-keeping and laundry, electrical installation, welding and fabrication, food and beverage production and service,painting, and  decorating , garment-making,  tannery and leather work, Plumbing mansonry,  carpentry  and  jonnery,  general agriculture, clerk-typist, 	  store-keeping,  salesmanship,  cartography and surveying. I have mentioned these  courses  deliberately because most  of  our youth are  not able  to  decide  which  programme  they should pursue  after  their Post  primary  school education. I would like  to tell hon.  Members that  there  are  opportunities  in  these areas  that  our youth can  train  in. Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  equally  so  at  the middle  colleges  level, the  following opportunities  are  available:  plumbing,  mansonry, carpentry and  joinery,  tannery and leather work,  general agriculture, garment-making,  welding and fabrication,  mechanical engineering, motor vehicle  mechanics;  in fact,  we have  about 	 34 disciplines in  these  middle  colleges, which are being offered 	technical  training institutes  of Technology.At the national polytechnics  level the  money required to maintain these  institutions  is  collosal	for 1990/91 Parliament  approval for a net expenditure  of	213,233,830for my Recurrent Vote  and a net  expenditure  of 21,319,150  for my Development Vote,  totaling  £20,057,980. Hon. Members will now form the 1990/91 printed estimates that there is a highest increase in my Recurrent  Vote of £398,236.For the Recurrent Vote the money will be spend on janerzl administration and planning of the Ministry, which includes  and allowances for the Ministry's staff, technical and industrial training, youth development pro graces and the Directorate of Technical Training Institutes. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on the  Development Vote  we  intend to redirect  these  funds  to  cater  for  training opportunities  in the technical training institutes,  national polytechnics,  youth  division, under the Directorate of Technical Training and Applied Technology. You will note  that  we  are not represented at  the district  level, and it  is my wish and hope  that  in the  next  budget	we  will be  given  sufficient  funds  to  enable us  spread  our  activities  to the  district  level. However,  I an glad to say   that during thisfinancial year we  hope  to  establish provincial centres to  look after  our institutions  at the  provincial level. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  also  like to  say that  for Kenyans to  be  able  to  develop we must  lay special emphasis  on technical education. 	The money we have  is inadequate; 	our  existing youth polytechnics  lack facilities  like  equipment,  trained personnel and funds to  sustain their  activities. Also  in the  middle  level colleges  we  shall need equipment,  instructors and lecturers,  staff houses,  tuition blocks  and administration blocks. It is thusimportant  that  this ministry is  taken  seriously. 	I would  like  to  tell the hon. Members  that,  in  my opinion. history is the  best  example  to  go by.	After  the  Second World War,Japan went the  technology way and today it  is  a highly industrialzed country;	South Korea,  which We had the  occasion to visit recently;went  for industries today it  is highly industrialised.In fact,  the  annual turn over  of one  of  the  companies that we  visitedin that  country is 30 billion and I was told that that company's   venture  capital was  a mere	£18,000.	I  strongly believe  that  ourpresent jua kali artisans and middle college graduate are the entrepreneurs and industrialists in Kenya tomorrow. This is where. At  the  end  of  their  crafts  courses  or  technician  courses what  do  you  expect  these  individuals  to  do? 	Do  you  want  them  to go  back  and  start  looking  for  employment  in  offices  or  do  you want  them  to  be  self-employed? Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,  we  have  now worked  out  a  programme  with  the  United  Nations  Development Programme,  where  the  graduates  of  these  Youth  Polytechnics  can be  assisted  with  tolls  and  little  capital  to  enable  them  to start  their  own  programme  and  activities  and,   therefore,  become self-employed. Then,  you  also  say,  Mr.   Speaker,   that  there  is  a  very  high potential  of  employment  opportunities  in  this  sector. 	At  the • moment  in  oru  programmes  we  know  that  the  agricultural  sector will take  about  one  million  employed  people  the  public  sector  and informal  sector  are  expected  to  create  about  another  one  million jobs  in  the  next  couple  of  months.	We  do  now  that  the  publicsector  can  only  create  up  to	300,000  and	600,000  jobs  will  haveto  come  from  the  informal  sector  or  the  jua kali  sector. Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,   I  will  be  making  my  other brief  comments later,   but  I  would  like  the  hon.  Members  to  seriously  consider establishing  one  youth  polytechnic  in  their  locations. If  they are  serious  and  we  have  to  tackle  the  question  of  unemployment in  this  country  which  should  be  seen  as  a  cirisis  or  a  problem that  must  be  tackled  by  this  hon.  House  then  oru  effects,  energy and  resources  must  be  directed  towards  creating  conditions favaourable  for  these  youth  to  train  and  to  acquire  skill  and subsequently,  be  able  to  sustain  themselves  in  their  self-employed activities.  Secondly,  Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,   I  am  also  reminding  this hon.   House  that  my  Ministry  will  be  looking  for  ways  and  means of  giving  these  individuals  credits. At  the  moments  there  is an  initial  credit  by  the  Kenya  Commercial  Bank  of  Ksh.5  million and  they  are  also  currently  again  processing  a  credit  of Ksh.50  million  which  will  be  made  available  to  the  jua  kali sector.	The  Kenya  Industrial  Estates  is  now  giving  characterloans  for  these  sector.	The  Ministry  is  also  working  out  thepossibility  of  creating  incentives  and  also  of  giving  loans and  credits  to  these  individuals  so  that  they  can  grow  gradually. 	I  will  be  the  happiest  Minister  in  this  Republic  of  Kenya, Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,   if  this  House  will  one  day  say  "let  us  vote a  substantial  sum  of  money  to  the  Ministry  of  Technical  Training and  Applied  Technology". Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,   it  is  my  pleading today  that  as  we  deliberate  on  this  debate  that  we  should  find it  necessary  to  support  my  Ministry's  vote  and  to  also  encourage the  growth  of  the  technical  institutions  in  your  own constituencies. I  am sure,   you  will  be  saving  yourselve  the headache  from  unemployed  people  if  you  could  create  effective network  coupled  with  setting  up  the  jua  kali  sheds,   setting up  of  the  credits  schemes  and  setting  up  of  the  production units  you  will  not  get  any  single  individual  coming  to  Your door  step  for  employment  because  they  will  be  seeking  greener pastures  in  the  technology  line. With  those  few  remarks, Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,   I  beg  to  move. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE  MINISTER  FOR  ENERGY	(Mr.   Biwott)	:	Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,I  arise  to  second  this  motion.	In  seconding  this  motion,   I  wouldlike  first  and  foremost  to  thank  his  Excellency  the  President,   for seeing  it  fit  to create  a  Ministry  that  will  specialize  in  the training  of  Kenyans  to  acquire  skill  and  technology  and  to  acquire the  expertise  necessary  to  mount  efforts  which  are  required  of a  sustained  economic  growth  in  the  country. No  country  can exist  and  flourish  without  its  relaible  technical  skills  which will  take  the  economy  to  greater  heights. Mr.   Speaker,   Sir, the  Ministry  of  Technical  Training  and  Applied  Technology  is relatively  new  and  within that  short  period,   the  Minister  has distinguished  himself  as  a  very  capable  Minister  with  foresight, organizational  ability  and  courage  to  mould  a  Ministry  out  of very  many  fragmented  departments. Before he  took over,  there were many institutions catering forthe  training of our people in various skills.	There were, for example,  villagepolytechnics which were being shifted from one	Ministry to another.	We  alsohad national polytechnics and other  technical  schools.	There were also  severalexaminations and certificates which did not create any cohesion in terms of technical  training. The Minister has been able to device a method of harmonizing examinations in order to give uniform certificates that are  recognized also here in the world.   The Minister has  also encouraged apprenticeship in order to produce master  craftsmen who   are a vital manncnier resource in any industrial country. when he  looks back in his records,  the Minister  can be proud to see how much he has achieved for this country in terms of organising trainin for our people. The Kenyan economy will naturally denend on jua kali which in some countries is referred to as cottage industries,  home industries or informal industries. Today,  jua kali has earned   respect  to such an extent that it isknown all  over the world because of the President and the Minister who in  charge  of this Ministry.	Today,	wananchi	are proud to organize juaorganisation. provided that they are assisted financially and technically. The  most important aspect here would be the incorporation kali works in the Kenya Bureau of ,standaric. need to be standardized with those coming into this country in the export market.All  these  things, require dedication, Peace cannot some on its own.It has to be only be Protected if the peonle in   he country are united	-desist from inciting wananchi to cause chaos.	to see KNUT leaders trying to instimate strikes Peace  in order to pass their examinations. I  think this is shamefuland irresponsible.	I  hope  that  in future,  such leaders will see it fit toconform to rules of common decency so as to think of the nation first and the welfare   of our  children.The worst of all was the recent incitement of university students by the CPK. clergymen,   that is,  Bishop Citari and Bishop   Njugune.	That was shameful and embarrassingand I hope  that they will also see it fit not  to cause incitement in future.As it was reported in the  Press,  I have Personally come out clearly on thisIssue. I think keny is a peaceful  country  which protects the rights of every individual.	It  also Guarantees  the freedom of worship and freedomof  speech.	One  should   take full responsibility of his actions and	utterances.I  think time has come when the members of the clergy  should be  isolated as individuals and be held responsible individually to answer for some of things they do especially if they are going to  incite the wananchi to cause harm. This is because  the  interests  of the  masses  come first   over those of an individual. We  should not be  shy in enforcing the  law on an eaual basis  without anybody hiding behind anything even those who think that they can hide behind the church. PG NO 35 second para NOT READABLE we  have seen how much Prof.  Ongeri has done  in trying to  createa Ministry from bits and pieces that exist. Many countries are  awareof the existence of this Ministry and are pouring in a lot  of money.	Thosewho graduate .  from these technical institutions look forward to securing employment  or being self-employers   and create employment in the process. Those who go to university also look forward for the same. With these  few remarks,  I beg to second.. </Newspeech>(Question proposed) <Newspeech>MR.  MAKAU:	This Ministry that we are discussing can be referredto as a Ministry of the future in this country.	I  am saying so  because  thisMinistry will	_	Provide us with an answer for unemployment  and trainingin this ccuntiy.	When   he S-4-4 system of education was	introduced bythe President and also the establishment of this Ministry,	we knew that  some of the Problems we  face were going to be  solved. The President knew that  the 8-4-4system of education would provide Practical slills whereas this Ministrywould Provide  technical skills. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, when you talk about employment  in  this Ministry, the main emphasis  Should be laid on manpower training geared at self-employment eventually. I am  saying this because the future  solution of  unemployment in this country lies on self-employment.   Today,  if you look at countries like North and South Korea,  you would find that they have reached the stage they are in today because the people there have been trained and obtained technical Skills which they have been able to put into use.   However, while speaking on this subject,  we should remember that   the jua kali artisans in this country face three major problems. I am grateful  to  note  that  the Minister while moving this Vote,  has outlined the objectives of his Ministry in trying to sort out  these problems. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for us to be able to  solve the most crusial problem of unemployment  in this country,  it is important that we should train 	 our people in the technical field. 	The  success of our jua kali  artisans will depend on whether we have availed to them, financial support.  I am saying this because it would be useless to train an artisan without giving him any financial support to  start a business.   However,  I would like to take this opportunity to  acknowledge the personal initiative of His Excellency  the President for the financial assistance that he has given to the jua kali  artisans. I am also grateful to the Minister for outlining a financial programme for the jua kali  artisans from the Kenya Industrial  Estates.  The financila assistance that is now available to  the ja jua kalis from  the kenya Commercial Banks,  the Kenya Industrial  Estates and so on,  is not enough . At the moment, there is alot of competition and I think it is a high time that the Ministry	ofTechnical Training and Applied Technology thought  in terms of setting up a juakali venture capital  fund.Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this fund would be able to assist these juu kalientrepreneurs who are practising.  While I acknowledge the effort that has already been made to make money available to the juu kalis through the commercial Banks and so on, this is not enough. I think the funds not aside for these jua kali artisans,  sh-uld be equivalent to the f unds   that are normally set aside for the farmers through the Agricultural Finance Corporation and banks that are going to be set up to assist the farmers. Therefore,  I appeal to the Minister   to consider setting up a specifal fund to assist the jua kalis. Mr.  Chairman,  in countries like the South Korea,  you find that they have set up a venture capital to assist entreprenuers in this field. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in this country we have people with the necessary skills to  set up business but they dc not have enough capital  to start the business.  Tbis is a problem which is affecting,  not  only Kenya,  but  also other countries of the world. 	However,  you will  find that developed countries like the United States of America and other European countries,  have been able to develop high in the field of technology   due to  starting venture capitals to assist entrepreneurship in this field of tchnology.  However, the problem in developing countries like Kenya is that we do not have   people who can help us to  set up  such a venture capital fund. However,  I think it is high   time  that the Ministry looked for ways and means of  starting this venture capital  fund to assist our jua kali artisans. 	We have recently heard that  there are  some of our people who have  started making blocks for building andd if finances were made available  to  such people, they would be able  to maximize theirproduction in this field.PG NO 38 last 2 para NOT READABLE    Therefore,  I think it is time tliat the Ministry thought in terms of getting market for the products of the jua kali artisans. One of of solving this problem is by setting up a co-operative society and setting up centres where wananchi can go and view these goods.  For example, in Nairobi here, we could have a centre for the jua kali products so that we can have our people going and seeing what our jua kalis can avail to us. If marketing for these goods was well organized then we could even export  some of the furture manufactured by these people. Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  the third problem that the  jua kali artisans are facing is the problem of lack of refresher courses.  I think there is need for constant refresher courses for these people and I would like to urge the Ministry to consider this point seriously. 	Another area which I think the Ministry should look into is the area of the village polytechnics. 	First of all, I would like to urge the Minister to drop the word "village" because it give one the impression that village polytechnics are cheap institutions and Iwould like  to urge the Minister to consider removing this word 	while on this point I would like to point  out to the Minister that there are three village polytechnics in my constituency and the problem that we are experiencing in these institutions is that  they are not being inspected. 	I would like  to urge the Ministry  to  set up an  inspectorate department for technical  inaoecters who will be : • able to inspect these polytechnics. 	Going back to the polytechnics in my constituency,  I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that  although we these three village polytechnics in three locations,  we  are at  the moment  e xperiencing  a lot  of problems due  to lack of capital  and Ithis is Why I am urging the Ministar to set an inspcotorate so that theseinspectors can be  making a comprehensive  report of what is happening it These institutions and also what is lacking.	This would help those teaching in theseinstitutions to follow the laid down curriculum so as to be able to produce qualified masons,  carpenters and the rest. 	This inspectorate department  should be able to carry Out its responsibilities  just like the inspectorate department in the Ministry of Education. _- -- - Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would like  to take  this opportunity to thank His  Excellency the President for the concern he has shown in the plight of the disabled in this country and we are grateful to the Ministry for starting polytechnics to train the disabled,  for example.  at  Eldoret. However,  I think it is time that the Ministry set up a national polytechnic for the disabled in this country. In Machakos,  the District 	 Development Committee recommended a national school for the blind and disabled be  established at Machakos Town. 	The disabled people in this country need to be  trained in computer technology and the Mininistry should start a national  school for the disabled, particularly in Machakos,  by upgrading the present Machakos School for the Blind to such a status. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I am saying so because the disabled in this country need to be awarded higher certificates in technology  so  that they can be employed 	 in higher institution of technology as technical manager,  and so on. 	For this reason, I would like to urge the Ministry to consider this point seriously. With those few remarks,  I beg to  support. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  WASIKE-NDOMBI:	Bw.  Spika,  ahsante  sana kwa kuniruhusuniseme  machache  juu ya Wizara hii.	Ilinaunga mkono Hoja hii kwa sababumbili  au  tatu.	Kwanza,  ukiangalia Bunge hili,  utaona kwamba limejaa maofisawa Wizara hii.	Ningependekeza kwamba tusiwe  watu wa kuongea tu bila vitendovya kuwaunga mkono Wakenya hawa wanaoendesha viwanda chini ya Wizara hii. Huku  tukiangalia miaka  20  ijayo,  tunaona kwamba tutakuwa na shida ya  soko la kuuzia viti,  kwa mfano,  vinavyotengenezwa na mafundi  hawa.	Hivi  sasa,bado  kuna Wakenya  fulani ambao hutoa viti  vya kukalia kule  Ufaransa.	Mbaofulani  hutoka Switzerland.	Hata hivyo,  watu wadogo hawawezi  kuotea kuagizakiti  kutoka nchi  za ng'ambo.	Kwa hivyo,  ninatoa mwito kwa watu wale  ambaoItrana-pesa nyi8ngi  wayaangalie maslahi ya nchi  hii  ikiwa tunataka kuiunga mkono Wizara hii kikamilifu. Jambo  la pili  ni  kwamba tumekumbwa na ukosefu wa kazi  na ni  kweli kwamba kusoma hakumaanishi kwamba utaajiriwa kazi ya mshahara tu,  bali  ni kupata akili ya kukuwezesha kuishi  maisha mazuri. 	Hii  ni  kusema  kwamba Wizara hii  ambayo  inaongozwa na mhe.  Prof.  Ongeri  ikitenga pesa za kuwagawia watu ambao wamesomea kazi  hii,  pesa hizi  zinafaa kupelekwa wilayani na kugawa kwa njia  inayofaa bila kuwagawia watu  fulani  tu katika wilaya. Ninasema hivi kwa  sababu.hivi majuzi  Katibu Mkuu  fulani  aliitembelea wilaya ya Kakamega na kusema kwamba maofisa wa Kenya  Industrial  estates na Industrial  and Commercial  Development Corporation watawakopesha mafundi  wenye  ujuzi  wa kazi hii kati ya Sh.30,000/= na Sh.100,000/= bila dhamana,  bora mafundi hao wawe  na barua kutoka kwa chifu msaidizi  au chifu mwenyewe. Hata hivyo,  ni mafundi wangapi  ambao wamepokea pesa hizi mpaka leo? Hapana hata mmoja,  na jambo hili  limebaki  theory  tu kwa kuwa hakuna cho  chote kinachotokea on the ground,  hata  ingawa tuna Waziri  mmoja tu na Katibu wa Kudumu mmoja tu katika Wizara hii.	Maofisa hawa hawawezi kutembea kote nchini na kuhakikisha kwambayale  anayoyasema yanatekelezwa au la.	Hii  ndiyo  sababu ninasema kwambatunafaa_kuwa watu walio responsible.	Maofisa walio  katika Wizara  hii naAtiale_wo4laine ambao ni  influential wanafaa kuhakikisha kwamba yale yanayosemwa na serikali yanatekelezwa vizuri. Wizara ya Mazingira na Maliasili  imeksowa  ikisaidia kwa kuwaambia watu wapande miti.	Kwa  hivyo,  Wizara hii  pia  inafaa kuweka bidii  sana kwasababu isipofanya hivi,  itakuwa vigumu kupata mbao wakati  ujao.	NilifurahiWaziri wa Kawi  alipoiunga mkono Wizara-hii.	Ile  Wizara ya muhimu  sana katikakuiunga mkono Wizara hii ni  Kawi.	Ningependa Waziri wa Kawi  aone kwambanguvu  za umeme  zimesambazwa katika wilaya  zenye miji na vijiji.	Ningependakampuni ya Kenya Power  and Lighting iwe  na mtindo wa subsidy katika ununuaji wa transformers. 	Kununua  transformer kwa wananchi wa kawaida ni  ndoto. 	Kwa hivyo,  tungependa Wizara ya Kawi  iliangalie  jambo hili  na kuhakikisha kwamba stima imeenezwa kote nchini. Ninatumaini  kwamba Waziri  huyu  itaisaidia Wizara hii ambayo tunazungumza juu yake sasa hivi iii kazi ya mafundi wa  Jua Kali  iweze  kuleta matunda katika nchi  yetu. Wizara ya Ujenzi pia inafaa kuweka jambo hili maanani kwa kuwa ni vigumu sana   kusafirisha vifaa kutoka mashambani hadi mjini  ikiwa barabara  zetu si  nzuri.	Wizara hii  tunayozungumzia sasa  inahitaji  usaidizi mwingi  sana,  napesa hizi  zilizoombwa kwenye  kitabu hiki  ni  kidogo  sana.	Ninatumaini  kwambaWaziri  atarudi  hapa kuomba  Supplementary  Estimates  ambapo  Bunge  hili  halitasita kutoa nyongeza hiyo. Katika kuisaidia Wizara hii,  ningependa Mawaziri  wawa  macho  zaidi kwa sababu Waziri akitolewa Wizara fulani  leo na kupelekwa katika Wizara. nyingine,  Waziri  mgeni  anayekuja hubadilisha vitu vyote ofisini. Waziri Msaidizi  akipelekwa katika Wizara mpya,  hubadilisha vitu vyote  hap:, hats secretaries. </Newspeech> <Newspeech> THE  ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR  INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING 	(Mr.  Nassir): Jambo la nidhamu,  Bw.

Wanabadilisha magari  pia kama hivi  kwamba wale  waliokuwawakiyatumia zamani  wameweka time  bomb ndani  yake.

Mimi  ni mwanachama wa biashara ya jua kali  katika Mombasa nambari  moja na nimepewa msaada ya Wizara hii.	Katika Kanu  tawi  la Mombasa,  Wizara hii  ina wanawake	60  ambao  wamenufaika	kutokana na Wizara hii.	Katibu wa Kudumu katika Wizara hii  pamoja na Bw.

Many   of these points may have been touched  on by the  previous  speakers and if  I  repeat  any of the points;  it  is purely   a matter of  emphasis.

They mast  ensure  that whatever funds they obtain   They should know the unemployment rate so as to work out  easily how much fuming is required in order to create those particular  jobs and  therefore  solve the unemployment problem.	So,  they can,  in fact,  calculate   here  and now the capitalneeded to  establish those  jobs under the Jua kali  Scheme.	That  ismy first point. •  If you multiply KShs.20,000/- per job with 20 million Kenyans, that will  give you the amount  of  cash that is required to create Jua Kali jobs.It  is  indeed a tall order and I wish them all the very best of  success. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  my second point is that this Ministry being a new Ministry it is important to define the organisation structure of the Ministry so that people know what falls under the realm of Jua Kali  and what  is in the aspect inthe bigger scale.	So,  it  is important define the structureof this Ministry  so	that  those who  are in the Jua Kali Sector mayknow that they are in that  sector.	I am sure that  they can also  setup Jua kali  companies,  co-operative societies,  jua kali partnerships or  jua kali  individual traders. There  should be some form of definition of what constitutes a Jua Kali industry  so on. 	Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  my third point regards the  provision of the technical skills that are required by the Jua kali  artisans.	We must  certainly set  up standards for thesepeople.	I listened very carefully to introductory remarks by theMinister in this regard.	We need to constantly giveA quality education, quality tuition and Quality inspection to Jua Yali  artisans.  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  my  fourth point  is very crucial indeed. 	I am going to  touch  on the  question of the provision of funding.   I have in mind low-interest rate funding and, low  security in the funding. Among many other available  aspects,  there  could be  established a Jua kali  Bank.  I talke to the Minister and I know that he has in mind the idea of  setting up a Jua Kali Bank.    I urge him not to look back in this  aspect.  I urge the Minister and his team of  officer to  ensure that we actually do have a Jua Kali  Bank.This will go  a long way. in solving the problem of unemployment  in this  country. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  finally, we do have the Jua Kali  sheds that the ministry has very ably constructed throughout the Republic.	Most  of  these Jua Kali  sheds are  singlecolumn structures with sheds on top.I  am  sure that theMinistry will prepare a scheme to make sure that there is provision of water and  electricity to  Jua kali  sheds:	In fact,  I doUrge the Ministry to  ensure that  they take the Jua kali	sheds notonly on an experimental basis any more but to  also realise that the Jua kali   sector is here to  stay.	They should put  up JuaKali   sheds  In every location and sub-location.	If they do  thatthey will have covered   the  entire country with Jua kali sheds. In this way we will be able to  spread the  gospel the Jua Eali sector to  every corner of the Republic and we will moving nearer to the  solution to the unemployment problem in the country. With those remarks,  I beg to  support the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika ffa Mud a. Kwanza kabisa ningependa kumshukuru waziri kwa kuiwasilisha Ko ja hii kwa wakati waauaSaaz unaofaa. Pia ingependa kumshukuru Lxfcukufu Hais kwa kutambua kwamba kuna haja ya kubuni Wizara krty kama hii. Vile vil ningependa kumshukuru inrfcukufu Bais lava kutambua kwamba ri Professor Ongeri anaiweza kazi hii. Ewa vile maofisa waWizara Mi wako hapa scs sasa Tuna watoto wengi ambao wanachu kua mafunzo katika vyuo vya vijana hapa nchini. Kwa vile nafasi za kazi hi km haba ingef aa wale wanaomaliza masomo katika vyuo vya ufundi wapewe mikopo kuwawezesha kununua vifaa vya kufanyia kazi. Hii ni kwa sababu idadi ya watu imekuwa kubwa na. hakuna nafasi za kutosha za kazi. Iwa hivyo, ingef aa kubuniwe hazina maalurrru ya kusmsaidia vijana hawa kwa njia ya mikopo. Pia ningeiomba Wizara isambase ujenzi wa vyuo vya ufundi kote xnashambani ili watu wetu waweze kufaidika. Kama ingewezekana, Vila wilaya ingekuwa na chuo kimoja cha ufundi. Hi ksveli kwamba kuna vyuo vidogo vidogo vya ufundi h wlw. kule mashambani, ingef aa vyuo vile vikuwa vianzishe matawi katika s eh emu za mashambani. Hili ni jambo ambalo itawafaidi sana watu walioko kacika sehemu za mashambani.Kwa vile Wizara hii ni muhimu sana katika Serikaliyetu ingef aa maofisa wa Wizara hii wajaribu kuzite mbelea kata zote na wilaya zote hapa nchini ili kuwatia moyo wananchi na kuwaf ahamisha juu ya umuhinra wa Wizara hii. Huenda ikawa Waziri ana shughuli nyingi lakir.i yafaa awatume sehenru za mashambani waende wakawa saidie watu wetu kwa kuwapa u.shauri unaofaa kuhusiana na mambo ya Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, vile vile ningependa kusema kwamba mimi mwenyewe nimekubaiana na maombi ya pesa yaliyotolewa na Waziri hapa. Ningependa pesa hizo zitolewe kwa Wizara mara moja na tujaribu kuona kwamba haki imefanyika. Ingefaa kila wilaya ipate kiwango chake na si wilaya zenye watu wakubwa wakubwa kuwa zikipata pesa zaidi kuliko kule kuliko na watu wadogo wadogo. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu hata katika Biblia tunasikia ili semekana kwamba hata aliye nazo ataongezewa na hali yule atakayekuwa hana kile chake kidogo atanyanganywa. Kusiwe na mpango kama huo katika ule ugawaji wa pesa hizi. Tungetaka kila mtu apate haki yake. Ingefaa zile sehemu ambazo kuna watu wengi wa mapato ya chirn zipatiwe pesa zaidi ili watu hao waweze kufungua viwanda vidogo vidogo kupitia kwa mpango huu wa Jua Kali.Ningeomba pia kuwa, kwa kuwa wakati mwingi tunaona kwamba Wizara mpya ikianzishwa maofisi yanakuwa katika miji, vile vile tuwe na idara zinazofaa katika wilaya na hata katika sehemu za tarafa. Kwa njia hiyo wananchi watakuwa wakitatuliwa taabu zao na wale wanaohusika na mipango ya Jua Kali, kwa mfano, wataweza kuona jinsi wananchi wanavyoendelea. Ni juu ya Wizara zinazohusika kuona kwamba maofisi yamefunguliwa huko katika sehemu za wilaya ria tarafa ili kurahisisha njia ya mapatano kati ya watu wenyewe na maofisa wanaohusika, hasa wanapotaka kupatiwa mawaidha, ama kuomba usaidizi wa kifedha.Kama tunavyojua, Wizara hii ni moja ambayo inapendwa na kila Mkenya. Ningeomba sote kama Wabunge tushirikiane kuhusu huduma za Wizara hii. Kila Mbunge ama Waziri awe mtume wa kuyatangaza mambo ya Wizara hii kwa sababu, tukifan.ya hivyo, wananchi wetu watafaidika zaidi kutokana na huduna za Wizara hii. Si si Wabunge tulio na maarifa tuna jukumu la kuji tolea ili kuwaeliraisha wananchi wetu. Hii ni kwa sababu nafasi za kazi nchini Kenya ni haba sana. Ni Wizara hii peke yake itakayctuokoa kutoka.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Muturia): Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipa nafasi hii ili nami niweze uiunga mkono Hoja hii kuhusu Wizara ya Mafunzo ya Ufundi na Teknologia Tekelezi ambayo inasimamiwa na Waziri na maofisa mashuhuri sana. Kwanza, kabisa, ningependa kumshukuru Mtukufu Rais kwa sababu anaona mbeie sana hata kufikia miaka 100 ijayo. Kwa hivyo, alianzisha Wizara hii i1ikuwahudumia wananchi walio na viwanda vinavyojulikana kama Jua Kali. Ni kwa sababu hiyo Mtukufu Rais aliiunda Wizara hii ili kui saidia nchi hii. Tangu Mtukufu Rais aianzishe Wizara hii, kumekuwa na matokeo mazuri sana, ya aiabu na haraka. Ni muda tu baada ya Wizara hii kuundwa ambapo tuliona gari la kwanza kuundiwa hapa nchini na wananchi wa Kenya. Pi a, ni wakati huo huo hata tuliona utengenezaji wa dawa inayo julikana kama Kemron. Hii ni kwa sababu Wizara hii inahusiana na mambo ya utafiti wa aina nyingi.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, Mtukufu Rais anaipenda Kenya kama vile inavyotakikana kutoka kwa kiongozi na baba wa nchi. Hii ndiyo sababu Mtukufu Rais anajishughulisha kuyafanya mambo kama haya na mengine mengi makubwa ambayo singeweza kuyataja yote. Pi a ninatoa shukrani kwa Waziri Prof. Ongeri. na maofisa wake, kwa kuwa ninawafahamu sana. Unaona kwamba wanatilia maanani raambo ya Wizara hiyo, hata hapa Bungeni kwa kuwa wanaonekana wamefika kwa wingi ili kuyasikia yale yanayosemwa na Wabunge ili kuyatekeleza wakirudi maofisini. Ni hivi juzi tu Wizara hii ilipoundwa na tumewahi kusoma kwenye magazeti jinsi Waziri na maofisa wake wanazuru sehemu nyingi za nchi yetu. Kwa sasa kila wilaya nchini ina mipango fulani ya Jua Kali. Nchi yetu yote inafaa kujigamba kwa kupata Wizara hii. Hata katika karnusi za Kiingereza, sasa neno jua kali limeingizwa, na haliwezi kuondolewa kanrwe.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, nchi ya Kenya pia inajigambia neno safari ambaloliraeingizwa kwenye kamusi za Kiingereza. Kwa hivyo, ukiangalia utaona kuwa Wizara hii ina mwelekeo wa kuisaidia nchi ya Kenya. Hata huko India, ambako uhuru ulipatikana mwaka wa 1948, wakati ambapo wengine wetu hapa walikuwa wakizaliwa na hali wengine walikuwa wakifanya kazi, kuna maendeleo mengi sana huko kwa sababu waliuendeleza mpango huu wa Jua Kali. Nimewahi kuitembelea nchi ya India na mara ya kwanza nilijionea nyumba ambazo zilikuwa na mfano wa Madaraka Estate hapa kwetu Nairobi. Nilikuwa nikifikiri tunazuru nyumba za watu. Kumbe katika kila chumba kulikuwa na mtu na bibi yake na mtoto wake wakitengeneza kipuli kimoja cha chombo fulani. Hii ndiyo inayo julikana kama cottage industry. Kama ni plug ya taa, unaona inatengenezwa na mtu mmoja na mwingine anatengeneza wire, na mwishowe zinaunganishwa na kuunda kipuli kizima. Vifaa hivyo vinauzwc huko India na vinavyobaki vina uzwa nje kupitia kwa kikundi kinachotumiwa na Serikali kuvipeleka vifaa hivyo vingine katika nchi za nje, na kwa njia hiyo nchi ya India inajipatia mapato ya kigeni. Tungetaka kuwa na mtindo kama huo hapanchini, na tunatakia heri Prof. Ongeri na Wizara yake ili kuyazingatia mambo kama hayo. Kwa njia hiyo tutaweza kujitosheleza na hivi kuweza kuuza bidhaa za namna nyingi kwenye nchi wanachama wa P.T.A. na hata huko Ulaya.Bw. Naibu Spika wa uda, ningetaka Irorishukuru Lltukufu Rais kwa kusaidia eli.rrg ya kiufundi. Utaona kwanba .vale wanaotoka katika vyo vya ufundi wanapata kazi nara moja lakini wale wanaotoka katika vyuo vikuu wanatafuta kazi kwa nrada nrefu. Eiva hivyo, ni v. a.m shukuru Rais kwa kuagiza Kenya Polytechnic iwe chuo kikuu. Hii ni sababu vale watakaofuzu  kutoka katika chuo hiki v.vrataweza kupata k&z_i katika nchi za hje. Juzi nilipokuwa Zambia niliwaona \7akenya wanaofanya kazi huko kana ofs. wa afya na neneja wa hoteli. Kwa hivyo, tunataka Wizara hii itoe safunzo Jcexh kwa watu wengi ili wasaidie, kwa kufanya :azi katika nchi nyingine za Ziafrika ambazo asiwaJkupata wataalanu wake Kabla ya kuaaliza ningependa kusema kwanba ingawa Tarafa yetu ya Ntonyiri ilibuniv;a mi ska isirme iliyopita sisi tusejenga chuo cha ufundi kizuri kwa njia ya Haranbee. Bva vile hatuna waalimu tungependa 5.7asiri atusaidie kwa waalinu ili war.anchi wa huku wafurahie aatunda ya xz± wizara hii.Eva hayo sachache, naunga zrkono.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WABUGE: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir for giving me this opportunity to make a few remarks on this Ministrys Vote. First of all wish to say that this is a very important Ministry in a country like Kenya. However, I feel that this Ministrys provision is inadequate. This is because for this countrys economy to develop, we should have highly Qualified middle level graduates. We should thus go all out to ensure that our young people are well trained in this Ministrys programes.As a person who comes from a fanning district, I have seen that jua kali artisans are very useful when a farmer farm machinery breaks down he can have it repaired by jun kali srtiser Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is why I want to appeal to the Minister to ensure jua kali sheds are	built in Trans Heoia District, particularly in Kitale Town to protect the artisans from sub shine and rain because this district gets heavy rainfall.Thirdly. I am sure the Minister will agree with me that jua kali artisans do more just like clincial officers who work more than the doctors work them engineers and mechanics in big organizations the Minister should thus allocate more money to the development of jua kali programmes. In fact, we should encourage jua kali artisans to invent more and new items for both local use and export.In fact, the Minister and his staff should go round the country and see how the jua kali artisans work.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, despite the Minister being a farmer in Trans Nzoia District, he has never used this opportunity to cone and see how jua kali is operating there. I would appeal to him and his staff to go round the countryside and try to assess the requirements of each area. For example, if he came to Trans Nzoia District, the first and foremost requirement he would note is the spreading of jua kali activities to various markets to assist farmers, say, in the repair of their tractors.The Minister should also get in touch with the Minister for Energy so that he can transmit electricity throughout the district so that jua kali artisans can do their work easily. For example, welding cannot be done without electricity.As I said earlier on, jua kali contributes a lot to the economy of this country. It creates employment opportunities as well. For example, one jua kali artisan can employ several people in his shed. Therefore, I would urge the Minister to ask for money so that jua kali operations can be established throughout the country in order to ease the unemployment problem in this country. Unemployment is a very serious issue our country today. The Government is the major employer in this country and i u is my prayer that the private sector should assist the Government in this respect. I do not know long the Government will absorb university graduates. The privies sector should be given incentives so that they can expert their independence employ more people.Jua kali enterprises should be assisted financially in roles TO EMPLOYED their operations in order to employ more people. This Minister has a big responsibility in seeing to it that unemployment in eased through the expansion of jua kali industries. with these few remarks I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PLANS AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Ogle): Asante sana.

Kwa hivyo, ni lazima hatua inayopaswa ichukuliwe kwa gazeti hili. lTinasema hivyo kwa sababu vita kubwa tunalopigana katika nchi hii yetu, ni vita ya kuangamiza ukabila katika nchi hii.

Ni juu ya Wizara hii kutekeleza jambo hili. Kwa hivyo, ningependa kuwahimiza Waziri na maofisa wake wahakikishe kwamba wanawakilishwa wilayani. Ninakubali kwamba Wizara hii ilianzishwa hivi majuzi tu na kwamba mtoto hawezi kuanza kutembea na kukimbia mara tu anapozaliwa. Ni lazima kwanza aanze kutembea ndipo aweze kukimbia hapo baadaye. Ningemwomba Waziri awe na maofisa wa kumwakilisha wilayani. Ikiwa ni vigumu kuwa na wawakilishi wengi wilayani wakati huu, ingefaa ahakikishe kwamba ofisa mmoja anamwakilisha, huku akifanya kazi chini ya mkuu wa wilaya ili awasaidie wananchi kwa kuangalia kazi yote ya youth polytechnics na mafundi wa jua kali. Hapo ndipo Wizara itakapoweza kujua kile kinachoendelea katika kila wilaya katika Jainhuri ya Kenya. Waziri anafaa kuhakikisha pia kwamba ofisa huyu anapokea mshahara kama ule wa mwalimu wa youth polytechnic. Mpaka sasa, walimu wa youth polytechnics wanapata mishahara yao kupitia kwa Wizara ya Utamaduni na Huduma za Jamii, na wakati mwingine mishahara hii huchelewa kidogo. Ningemwomba Waziri achukue hatua ili ahakikishe kwamba amelilainisha jambo hili ndipo walimu hawa wawe wakipata mishahara yao wakati unaofaa.Jambo lingine linalohusu Wizara zote ambalo ningependa kugugusia ni kwamba kila Wizara inafaa kuhakikisha kwamba inawasaidia mafundi wa Jua Kali kwa kununua bidhaa zao. Vitu vyote vinavyotengenezwa na mafundi hawa, viwe viti, meza na vinginevyo, vinahitaji kununuliwa na Wizara ili bidhaa hizi ziwe na soko. Kwa vile haiwezekani kuwaajiri kazi wanafunzi wote wanaotoka katika youth polytechnics zetu, wale ambao hawataajiriwa kazi wanafaa kuunda vikundi vya kujisaidia. Ninafurahi kwa sababu Waziri alisema kwamba ana mpango wa kuwapa vifaa vya kazi wanafunzi wakimaliza masomo yao. Labda watatafutiwa pesa kidogo pia za kuwawezesha kuanza kazi ya kujiendesna wenyewe Wanaf unzi hawa wanafaa kuanzisha vikundi vya kujisaidia katika wilaya zao. Nina furaha kumjulisha Waziri kwamba katika mawakilisho yangu tuna Wamba Youth Polytechnic, na kwamba ni newaomba wanachama wote wa board of aoverr.crr ulfrr kamati za shule za msingi wahakikishe kwamba wanaipa kazi youth polytechnic hii, kama utengejezaji wa viti na ujenzi. Mpaka sasa youth polytechnic hii inafanya kazi nzuri sana. Tumefungua account ya akiba na tuna pesa ambazo zinatuwezesha kujiendeleza sisi wenyewe. Ningemwomba kila mhe. Mbunge afanye hivi ili tuone kwamba youth polytechnics na viwanda vya Jua Kali vimepewa kazi. Sasa hivi tunautekeleza utaratibu wa District Focus for Rural Development na hatufai kuwaleta mafundi kutoka wilaya fulani kuja kujenga nyumba katika wilaya nyingine na hali wilaya zote zina youth polytechnics na viwanda vya Jua Kali ambazo zinafaa kupewa kazi iliyopo katika wilaya zao.Jambo la rrtwxsho linahusu amani iliyopo katika nchi hii. Watu wachache nchini, hasa viongozi wa dini, kama vile the Church of the Province of Kenya, wanataka kuichafua nchi hii. Watu hawa wanafaa kujua kitu kimoja. Shida ikizuka katika Kenya leo, hata wao wenyewe wataumia. Wasifikiri kwamba wakichochea taabu katika nchi hii, watapona. Shida yo yote ikitokea itawadhuru Wakenya wote, na raha iliyopo katika Kenya ni ya Wanakenya wote. Kwa hivyo, watu hawa wanafaa kukubali tuishi katika amani chini ya uongozi wa busara wa Mtukufu Rais. Hatuwezi kuongea juu ya maendeleo yo yote ikiwa hatuna amani na siasa iliyo imara. Absante Bw . Naibu Spika wa Mada Naoraba kaunga akono.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. TERER: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to congratulate the Minister on the way he moved his Ministrys Vote. He did this prudently and exclusively. First of all, I would like to congratulate His Excellency the President on creating this very important Ministry of Technical Training and Applied Technology. His Excellency the President has always looked ahead positively and he knows what the country requires because he has been in politics for a very long time now.This Ministry is very important because wananchi expect it to solve the unemployment problem that we have. In the past, we have had this problem especially in the case of white collar job seekers with academicWe would not like the same thing to happen in the case of the socalled "blue collar" jobseekers. The creation of employment is a complex issue which requires the cooperation of a number of communities, and it is not only the Ministry of Technical Training and Applied Technology alone that is going to solve it. We would like the Ministry to cooperate with nearly all the other Ministries so that its role becomes a success. We have been told that we now have three national polytechnic, that is, Kenya Polytechnic, in Nairobi, Mombasa Polytechnic and the recently inaugurated Eldoret Polytechnic. That is all right, but I think it is time that these polytechnics were upgraded to university status so that they may award degrees in various technical fields.When it comes to youth polytechnics, I was moved by the Ministers speech in which he said that he would like to see every location having a youth polytechnic. We will endeavour to see that this comes true. I would like to urge the Minister to build, at least, one technical institute in every district. At the moment, we do not have such an institute in every district. We want to have equitable distribution of technical institutes. With regard to the staff in these polytechnics, I think the Ministry should play an important role in the supply of trained and qualified teachers to man these polytechnics.Touching on postprimary technical institutes, such as youth polytechnics, I think their graduants may not be ready for employment as soon as they complete their training because they leave primary school at the age of 13 or 14 years.They may not be employable at that tender age because they are still teenagers; they will be people who will not even be able to obtain identity cards. I think the Ministry should endeavour to ensure that these young people are attached to industries. In other words, there should be a lot of cooperation with the industrialists, the Ministry of Industry and others. These children will not be able to stand on their own because they cannot borrow loans and, maybe, nobody will be willing to stand for them so that they can borrow loans.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, jua kali entrepreneurs are doing a good job, and I think the Ministry of Technical Training and Applied Technology should be able to advise them as far as the viability of the businesses they would like to undertake is concerned. I think the Ministry should set up a feasibility study unit that will be advising the entrepreneurs accordingly.Sir, when it comes to employment of the Ministry officers, they should be seen at the divisional level. We want the Ministry to make arrangements so that in future we have officers at that level so that they can be able to carry out inspection of youth polytechnics. I do not think our youth polytechnics are inspected regularly, and we need qualified officers to go round advising instructors on how to go about their teaching and so forth. We need inspectors, and I think the Ministry is going to look into that issue.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when it comes to establishing these institutions, I think electricity is a must. So, when the Minister advises that we should be having youth polytechnics in every location, then that means that we should be having electricity in all locations. I would like the Minister concerned to liaise with the inistry of Energy so that we have the rural electrification programme hastened. We should have electricity in every location so that this programme can succeed. In certain areas, especially my constituency, we have electricity lines passing overhead and we need transporters so that the lilies can be used to supply electricity in those areas. Unless are going to train welders, and welders cannot carry on any business without electricity. Even carpenters require electricity.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is my strong feeling that the Ministry should also be involved when it comes to marketing of jua kali products. In the first place, the Ministry should help in advising the entrepreneurs on whether what they are going to undertake is viable or not. When it comes to the district development committees and subdistrict development committees, we would like the representatives the Ministry to be there because they are the ones to offer expert advice to the committees on how to go about putting up youth polytechnics. I think there should also be a close liaison between the Ministry of Technical Training and Applied Technology and the Ministry of Education. We would like the Ministry of Education to identify students who are technically inclined so that right from the start they can be helped and advised to carry on a career that is suitable to their liking and talent.Sir, as I said earlier, we need trained technical teachers. These technical teachers are also required by the Ministry of Education because unless we have them in that Ministry, we may not be able to advise the young children on the careers to pursue. Again, we would like to request the Minister to be visiting districts with his headquarters staff so that we see them and talk to them. I know that the Minister is a busy person, but we would like to be visited by his officials so that they can get the problems facing us first hand. That way, we will work together cooperatively to promote this Ministry. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry itself is young, butit has done a lot.Turning to the security of the nation, I think it is important that we support the Government fully in whatever it does. The security of this country is not going to be compromised. Whatever action the Government takes will be supported fully by us. It takes a long time to build, but destruction can take only seconds. We are not going to allow the few disgruntled elements to destabilisethis country or destroy whatever we have built over the years. So, any action taken by the Government to ensure stability and security must be supported by all Kenyans.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILDLIFE (Mr. Gakunju): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I rise to support the Vote of the Ministry of Technical Training and Applied Technology and join my hon. colleagues in thanking His Excellency the President for creating the Ministry, which is very important to us all. I would also like to thank the Minister for Technical Training and Applied Technology for the manner in which he has presented his Vote, which covered all areas of his Ministry. He explained every¬thing very explicitly.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that the Ministry although new, has been felt in all parts of the country. Indeed, in my constituency of Gatundu, we now have jua kali sheds. Although the sheds have not started operations, we have been organising and the impact is great and the people are getting ready to move in. The main problem is that the 12 sheds we have will take only a small fraction of our people, and we would like to request that something be done to the many people who have been left out of the sheds. They can be provided with both fuidance and finance. We have very many jua kali entrepreneurs who would like to be assisted in Gatundu. I know that this is so all over the country and, hence, the need to educate all Kenyans on the operations of the Ministry. Very many people do not know how the Ministry operates or how they can make use of whatever facilities the Ministry may avail. There is, therefore, need to have officers of the Ministry in the district to coordinate the work of the Ministry.For instance, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministrys work in the districts is still being done by officers from the Ministry of culture   and Social Services and we do not really know where to draw the distinguishing line. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is therefore need to train the youth and follow them up after training. I say this because we have several young people who have been trained in tailoring, carpentry, masonry and leather works but they do not have anywhere to go after training. They come to us looking for jobs but we do not know where to take them. I think these people should assisted to start some operations after completion of their training. Also those who graduate from technical schools and institutes of technology need to be assisted. There is also an anomaly here because people taking courses in some institutions pay while others in other Institutions do not pay.There should be uniformity terms and conditions of training should be even in all training institutions.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, going back to the youth polytechnics, I think there is a problem in the management of these institutions. This is why in some places, like in my constituency, many of the polytechnics are half full or are not fully occupied. There is therefore need to streamline the management aspect of these polytechnics. I say that because there is loss of tools and equipment. I understand that this is prevalent in many other areas where tools, machines and other implements are stolen as soon as they are handed over to the institutions. There is need to look into the management aspect of institutions in those areas and see what could be done about this problem. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, with regard to take employment opportunities that are created by the Jua kali sector I would like to say that this is a very significant contribution  I say this because every Jua Kali person, whether he is a tea shop or a kiosk of another kind, has one or two people working with him and they are being trained. These people should be encouraged to train. There are some people who can expand their businesses with very little effort. If they are given some guidance and little financing they can double their employees. I have in mind those people who make watering cans which can be used by horticultural farmers. You will find that those people who make those watering cans are not making enough of them because they do not have the materials. There is no organization that they can go to when they need help. If these people are given money they will make more watering cans and they will export them from Nairobi to the rural areas. That will create employment and many people will be able to vise these watering cans to increase their horticultural production. Apart from things like jikos and steel basins the Jua Kali artisans can also be encouraged to produce things that will be used on the farm by farmers to produce enough food for consumption and for export. So, the Jua Kali artisans should be encouraged to produce items that will be used by our people to produce commodities that will earn this country some foreign exchange and more than anything else create employment.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we know that the Minister and his officers are s taking these things seriously. So, this Ministry should be given all the money it requires and even more because the Ministry is operating in an area where you can easily see the results. But there is a danger when young men and women are trained and left without tools I remember the time whenpeople used to be given tools after training. These people who complete training should be given tools before going home. Theyshould be assisted to organise themselves after training and I am sure that more and more jobs will be created.So, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the need for information about the operations of the Ministry and the facilities available from the organizations that we understand support the Ministry will be of great use to these people. While we appreciate the construction of Jua Kali sheds, I would like to say that there is need to look for and encourage these people in the informal sector. It has been proved, like the Minister said that 70 per cent of the businesses in a country like Japan are small scale businesses. This is why the economy of a country like Japan has grown so rapidly. In encouraging these small scale businesses, the Government of Japan has been able to support the majority of the Japanese. We should adopt the Japanese style of industrialization in order to reduce the crime rate in Kenya and improve the living standards of our people. This will reduce the bad things that are done by people when they are idle. We commend the Ministry for the good work it has been doing and we pray and hope that it will keep on improving the lot of our people in the countryside and in the urban areas.Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMINO: The first point I would like to make on this Vote, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, is about the glaring difference between what has been provided for Recurrent expenditure, which is K£l8 million, and Development expenditure which is only K£l.8 million. Really, we cannot consider this to be an adequate allocation of resources to a Ministry that is supported to be development oriented. I would like to urge the Ministry to request for more funds for development because without that he is really taking money to pay salaries. This is important because this Ministry must use more resources on research and development because without this we shall have achieved very little.I say this, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, because this Ministrys training programme holds the key to this countrys industrialization. The Ministry cannot achieve anything if the development funds allocated to it are so meagre. Their training programmes must give Kenyans equal and opportu¬nities. By this I mean that this Ministry and the Ministry of Education should determine how much it costs a Kenyan child to receive certain education and that should then be given to every Kenyan child of school going age and then if the parents want better or more educational facilities they can then costshare with the Government. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, looking through this list, you note that there are only three national polytechnics. I hope that the Ministry is hoping, in due course, to either upgrade these polytechnics into full fledged technical universities, or to promote the establishment of one technical university in the country. If the latter proposal is selected, we will need more polytechnics in the country so that every district has a fair chance of gaining trained manpower. Youth polytechnics are now fairly spread throughout the country but there is still a confusion. Some instructors in those polytechnics emanate from the Ministry of Technical Training and Applied Technology while others still come from the Ministry of Culture and Social Services. Surely, it is difficult to harmonize this very important area of development. We know that thee is need to know which particular Ministry is dealing with the polytechnics.Sir, if the Ministry eventually does develop a technical university, I would urge the Minister to ensure that as one of the conditions precedent to that event coming to pass is the question of national polytechnics in every province. Secondly, the Minister should ensure that there is total integration, both hori¬zontally and vertically on the technical training so that not only certain sections of the community will attain that degree of training, but that all school going children in the country have that equal opportunity. The system of education gives us a good takeoff point and, therefore, we should ensure that at the primary school level the technical training component of the curriculum is adequate and that schools are supplied with equipment and capable instructors to impart that knowledge.Sir, it seems to me that this Ministry is purely regarded as a "Jua Kali" Ministry, but let us assume that it is. The Jua Kali sector is producing a variety of goods but it is no good just to produce those goods and when you visit the Jua Kali sheds you find piles upon piles of goods manufactured by our people. That indicates resources that are lying idle. Therefore the Ministry bought to evolvea policy through which the Kenya National Trading Corporation should not import the types of goods that are also manufactured by the Jua Kali sector, but to take on the responsibility of marketing all the Jua Kali products, as should be done through Uchumi Supermarkets. They are national institutions that should promote members of this community that make such products.When the chips are down, you will find that it is these Jua Kali artisans who are true entrepreneurs of this country and, therefore, they should be given every encouragement. I would suggest that the Ministry pursues the possibility of earmarking a certain percentage of banks to go out and promote this sector of our economy. The Jua Kali sector seems to be spreading very well. However, I want to say that in Kisumu, land that was earmarked for Jua Kali sheds has, apparently, been earmarked for other developments without an alternative for the Jua Kali establishment. If, in fact, we are serious about the creation of employment opportunities and increased generation of income for our people, no matter how laudable an alternative project is, if land has been alienated for the purpose of Jua Kali development, that land should be so reserved and utilised for that very purpose.Sir, we also need to improve on the quality of goods produced by the Jua Kali artisans. "That can only be done if we spend adequate funds on research and development so as to improve the quality of the goods and to make them avail¬able to the artisans adequate and appropriate tools and equipment and, thereafter, to ensure that organisations like the Kenya External Trade Association, which was recently revived, takes on the responsibility of exporting these goods. There is no doubt that this Ministry is equipping young Kenyans with market placed skills. Without those skills, talking about creating job opportunities is meaningless. We can only create jobs at a level that makes sense if we have skills to exploit. I would therefore like to congratulate this Ministry for its efforts to provideKenyans with marketplaced skills, particularly to the artisans.Sir, if we are going to make a difference between purely agricultural economy and an industrial one, then these are the budding industrialists who must be supported. I would like them to be supported to the same degree that others are being supported, with loans to acquire businesses from Indians and Europeans at greatly inflated prices. This is because these people are showing in no mean ways, that Kenyans have the ingenuity to invent. If the Ministry could see very clear to help those jua Kali artisans who invent new gadgets, they should be protected so that they are not pirated by wealthier members of our society.With those few remarks, I support this Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Ntimama): Nasimama kuiunga mkono Hoja hii iliyowasilishwa na Waziri mwenzangu, Bw. Ongeri. Kwanza, ninge¬penda kumshukuru Mtukufu Rais Daniel arap Moi kwa kuwa hii ni nguzo moja kubwa sana ambayo ameijenga hapanchini kutokana na fikira zake, kama vile vile anavyo fanya kuzileta nguzo nyingine nyingi za maendeleo na ambazo zimeiendeleza nchi hii kwa miaka 12 ya Enzi ya Nyayo tangu auchukue usukani.

Hizi ni nguzo kati ya nyingine nyingi ambazo zimeanzishwa na Mtukufu Rais mwenyewe, na akazishindilia kabisa ili .tuweze kupata maendeleo hapa nc.hini. Kwa sababu hiyo, nguzo hii ya mpango wa Jua Kali ni moja ya zile kubwa ambazo amezifikiria mwenyewe na kuzitekeleza.Nachukua fursa hii pia kumshukuru Waziri mwenzangu, Prof. Ongeri, ambaye kwa kweli aliteuliwa kuwa akiyasimamia mambo haya ya Jua Kali. Kusema kweli, huyu ndiye Waziri anayefaa kwa upande huu kuyaendesha mambo ya Jua Kali.Bw.

I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for the way in which he presented his Ministrys Vote. His Ministry is popularly them as jula kali, because gives our youth skills to use in both paid and sold employment Right form the onset I would like to pay that industrialisation it the basic of development .We cannot develop this country unless there is peace, love and unity.I will come to that later on.I would like to suggest that the Ministry should n have a section for dealing with research and development. This is because jua kali artisans cannot be able to have such a facility on their an o:m and the Ministry should assist them in this regard. Since there are jua kali sheds all over the country, the Ministry should have branches right down to the grass rootlevel. Before this is done. I surest that seminars be held with district heads and other prominent people. That would help our people. Jua kali has become very popular^ but many people do not know much about it. would like public awareness as far as jua kali is concerned, such as, what it entails, its benefits and so on.A number of hon. Numbers have rightly said that jua kali enterprises will assist this nation in solving a big part of unemployment in this country. If the artisans would not be salaried employees, they would employ themselves and be able to earn a living. After all, that is all we rant. I always cherish the saying of the President that the best politicsis that of the stomach. Me should not preach tours others we all own to be satisfied. If the jua kali sector can enable people to meet the basic needs in life, we should encourage its growth.At this juncture. I would like to congratulate Prof. Ongeri for running this Ministry well since its inception. A visitor we Kenya would not know that the Ministry never enlisted before the last general election. The President thought it wise establishing this Ministry. Hers I again say that our President is our think tank in Kenya. He sees ahead of everybody else. When other people are talking petty things our President is Thinking for the good of our nation.  I would also like to suggest that the Ministry should develop technology centres in various districts starting with the heavily populated districts, such as. Kalakamoga Kisii, Iyanira and Vachahos. These cantors can be catchment points for those areas. This will reduce the unemployment problem that we have and the influx of. people into cities and towns.We should also have a technical university similar to M.I.T. of the United States of America where people can study technology to the highest level. This is where lecturers for middle grade institute will come from.Where there is peace there is development. I was saddened recently when I read in the Press that a Bishop had said at the pulpit where he knows he cannot be questioned that the lbos of Kenya will fight harden than the Ibos of Nigeria. I would call that blasphemy.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is nowhere in the Bible you can read about the Ebos. Therefore, this particular person was trying to align a group of people with this kind of allegation. I personally would not like to be associated with this kind of a statement. The same person said that they will fight more than the Ebos did, but when one talks about fighting, one must be having an army to be able to do so. Therefore, can this person tell us whether he is a leader of an army which he alleges will fight very hard. We need peace and stability in this country for the jua kali industry to develop. We need peace in this country so that everybody can he about their business more peacefully. However, this kind of talk tends to bring chaos and disorder in a country where we would like to have peace love and unity.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Nwanje): Thank very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to say a few words about this very important Ministry which is very soon going to become second to Education in this country. I am saying this because it is being lead by a Professor and I can see the Ministry being able to absorb very many people into employment. Therefore, if this Ministry works in the way we expect it to, then it is going to save this countryKenyans have now come to appreciate the purpose of setting up the jua kali industry. We know that the purpose of the jua kali industry is to generate selfemployment. In so many areas, particularly in the city, "here are many people who employ themselves and they have found he need to put the technical knowledge that they have into seme practical use by providing employment for themselves and others.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, although we call this a jua kali industry, the name was coined from the fact that they wont under the hot sun. However, we know that this industry no longer deserves be a very much associated with working under the sun. If anything this much story is has continued to create employment opportunities to our people. It is today "becoming the most important employment sector of economy in this country this Ministry. We appreciate that has "been given the right man to lead so that everybody can appreciate the importance of the jua kali industry. We have seer, the jua kali artisans operating very well in Gikomba here in Mairoci where they manufacture goods of very high standard. In fact some of the goods they produce are of a much higher standard than those produced in other industries, When these goods are put in the market, they fetch better prices than those manufactures in the industries. However, they need a little bit of encouragement and they will do a much better job than they are doing at the moment. It would be important for those who are marketing the jua kali products not to advertise them by saying, "This are some of cur best products from the jua kali industry. They should say that they are from our local industries here in Kenya. After all these jua kali goods are better than those imported goods or those made in the industrial area.In this respect, I would like to thank His Excellency the President who, through his initiative, made it possible for us to start a proper jua Mali industry which is going to house over ECO artisans in Embakasi and Mariobaji South and we are grateful for the money we have been provided to assist them 	  We have been given money to start off the project, and I would like to thank His Excellency the President for having given us the first Shs.l million through the Ministry of Technical Training and Applied Technology. We received this money without any delay, and I am grateful that we are almost starting the operation of the project. The area concerned is now being prepared. Very soon, the people of Embakasi will benefit from this Jua Kali industry. At least 500 of them will get employment, and you can rest assured that this doubled ray votes, too.Coming to the women side of the Jua Kali industry, originally people thought that it was only men who could possibly get into the Jua Kali business, but of late, those of you who have seen what is happening in Embakasi, have noticed that even women have gone into this business and we are now producing in Embakasi blocks which can be used in the construction of all types of houses that we require in. this city. I appeal to the constructors in the city to go to Kayole and see women making blocks in their Jua Kali industry, which they sell at a better price than any that can be offered by an Indian in the country. These women even deliver their blocks in their own lorry. I wish to take this opportunity to thank His Excellency the President again who donated this lorry to the women. Roofing tiles are now being made in Kayole. The Jua Kali industry in my constituency is growing so first that all we need now is a little encouragement to prove how much more the industry will grow and compete with those that have been in existence since time immemorial. We can say today that in the next five years, the Jua Kali industry will employ the biggest number of employees in the country, possibly even more than those employed by the Government. So, we should encourage the Jua Kali industry to prosper. In the case of Nairobi, I appeal to the City Commission of Nairobi I am glad that the Minister for Local Government is here now to set aside land purposely for Jua Kali artisans in Nairobi. Of late, there has not been very good planning in the city and this is why we sometimes have problems with hwkers. Proper planning will help us to place Jua Kali Artisans and hawkars.in the right places. I am glad that this is going on well at the moment, and the first person who noticed this is none other but His Excellency the President. He said that city planning must be rejected and redone so as to accommodate Jua Kali artisans and hawkers within the city. I believe that this is going to be done for the betterment of our peoples businesses within the city. I am also glad that markets have started being identified. It is His Excellency the President himself who has said that such markets must be started for our people within the city, whether they are Jua Kali artisans or otherwise. So, we request our city planners, including the Commissioner of Land, to ensure that whenever any land is allocated for the development of housing, certain areas are set aside for the Jua Kali industry.The Minister for Technical Training and Applied Technology will also be called upon to go out and look for money from anywhere to encourage these artisans, who should start cooperative societies to enable the Ministry to help them. It is very difficult to deal with individual cases, and we hope that the Ministry will encourage these artisans to form cooperative societies.With that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Header>ADJOURNMENT</Header><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Hon.

MWANZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister that saying he will not supply the medicines until a house is built for the personnel but the house is already there.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the information with the Ministry shows that there is no staff house which is ready, completed and handed over,</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, who do we believe now, the hon. Member who is Questioning or the hon. Assistant Minister. The hon. Questioner says that the house is there and it is ready and he knows because he comes from there. Who do we believe?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. GODANA: Obviously, you should believe the Government.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWANZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we happen to know that this is one of the misguided Ministries in that no proper information is sent to the Minister. A house is there. It has been build by Kikundi cha KANU Maendeleo ya Wanawake and the aim was to accomodate the officers in this building. The Assistant Minister is saying that there is no building. Are they going to be confused by their district officers so that they give us false information in this House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOY: Sabotage. We know that.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to inform the hon. Member and the other hon. Members who are supporting him that the Ministry is not misguided and the information we bring to the House is the correct information. I would like to add as you said before, that the dispensary in Question in Wasini Island is about one kilometer from the mainland. The project was started ona Harambee basis but not by the Ministry. Later on, however, assistance was extended to it from the Rural Development Fund (RDF) and at the moment it has a dispensary block with three rooms and a toilet. Now, the hon. Member is saying that there is a house although there is not house.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Members statement has confirmed that there is a House somewhere on the island which is used by Maendeleo ya Wanake Organization presumably for their own purpose. However we have not been told whether or not this House is part of the dispensary, but if MaerdJeleo ya wanawake think that they can provide proper accommodation, I think the procedure is very simple.As an experienced hon. Member of this Parliament, the hon. Questioner should know the procedure to follow namely, he should consult the Medical Officer of Health in the District and inform him that there is, in fact, a house which has been built by the Maendeleo ya Manawake Organization who are prepared to give it out for the accommodation of the medical staff posted to the dispensary. It is up to the Medical Officer of Health then to inspect the house and find cut whether, in fact, it is suitable for that purpose. However, as far as the Ministry is concerned, we are not aware that there is a house at the island which could be used for the purpose of accommodation.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWANZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in his reply, the Assistant Minister seems to be talking about Wasini Dispensary, but I am talking about Mkwiro Dispensary and there is a difference between the two dispensaries. At the moment,Wasin Dispensary. is used by white people while Mkwiro Dispensary is used by the black people. The unfortunate thing is that there is a tendency on part of the Ministry, to provide medical services to the white people using Wasin Dispensary leaving out the black people using Mkwiro Dispensary. This is why the Assistant Minister is talking about Wasini Dispensary when I am talking about Mkwiro Dispensary, Could he give a proper reply to my question?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. GODANTA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the statement by the hon. Member that my Ministry. has a tendency to take service to the white, people using Masimj Dispensary is not correct. The truth of the matter is that my Ministry does net Practice any kind of discrimination. In any case, we are not aware of any medical facilities that have been set aside for use by the white people in his constituency or elsewhere in the Republic and. I think such a statement is completely cut of order. I was answering a specific question on Mkriro Dispensary, ana not Wasini Dispensary .</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUTO: Mr. Speaker, in view of the fact that there is great need for medical services for. the people living on the island, would the Assistant Minister ignore some of the technicalities involved in providing medical services to these people, and lock at the problem as it stands.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GODAMA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the population of the island is about 2,500 people but there is, in fact, another dispensary that is coming up on the same island which is again being built on a harambee basis. My Ministry has given an undertaking that once these two dispensaries are completed and provided with the required facilities, they will be supplied with the required drugs and staff. Therefore, it is now up to the hon. Member to assist his people to complete these facilities and I promise him that once he does that we shall provide all that is necessary to run these dispensaries.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOY: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The hon. Assistant Minister did not quite understand the hon. Kubos supplementary question, which was that now that there are more than 2,500 people on the island, whether he could remove the existing red tape 2nd provide these people with medical services straightaway? Could he try and help these needy people since there is a house which could be used by members of staff once posted to this dispensary?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure that the hon. Members from the Coast Province, know this locally only too well unlike some of the hon. Members in the. House. However, for the benefit of those hon. Members who do not know about this area, I would like to say that the island in question is only a kilometre from the mainland. In fact, during the high tide, there is a problem which is brought about by the people in the island by moving to the mainland which means that access to the dispensary which is only one kilometre away is still there.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. MMAMZAIHI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no question of people in the island vacating their hemes and moving to the mainland as the Assistant Minister says. These people have been living in the island since this world was created by God. In part of his reply, the Assistant Minister said that there is another dispensary which is coming up on Masini Island. Mould he not agree with me that the Ministry is employing delaying tactics so that the other dispensaryMr. Masimi for the unite people is completed and opened while the other dispensary at Mkwiro for black people is left uncompleted.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not agree with the hon. Member in what he is saying.</Newspeech><Newspeech>ME. SPEAKER: Next Question. Mr. Bidul</Newspeech>Question Uo.444Upgrading of Lutsangoni DispensaryME. BIDU asked the Minister for Health what plans his Ministry has to upgrade Lutsangoni Dispensary in Kinango Division to a Health Centre.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. gODANA) : Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.I wish to inform the hon. Member that my Ministry does not have any immediate plans to upgrade Lutsangoni Dispensary in kinango Division to a health centre. This is because the facility was upgraded to a modem functional dispensary only two years ago. The Dispensary is at the moment well staffed and it is operating to the satisfaction of the Ministry.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, would the Assistant Minister tell this House what. criteria the Ministry used to upgrade a dispensary to a health centre.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GODAMA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member should have know the answer to the question a long time ago. 'The criteria used to upgrade a dispensary to a health centre is quite simple and straightforward. First of all, it depends on the number of people who turn up at the dispensary on the average per day; it also depends on the total demand for health services at that parti¬cular place and the recommendation of the district development committee of the area. In fact, the Kwale District Development Committee has already recommended the upgrading of two dispensaries in to the status of health centres during the life time of the current Development Plan. 'These are Devaya and Uniunda Dispensaries. Unfortunately, my Ministry cannot make the decision for them and it is therefore up to them to go to their district development committee and get that decision made to upgrade the dispensary.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU. Mr. Speaker, Sir, would the Assistant Minister tell us the number of average attendance of patients per day that is required before a dispensary is upgraded to a health centre.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. GODAMA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it seems that the hon. Member was not listening to what I was saying. I said that after all, the decision to upgrade a particular dispensary into a health centre, first and foremost lies with the recommendation of the district development and no decision that has been forwarded to us from the D.D.C of Ewale for us to accept or reject upgrading this particular dispensary.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Assistant Minister has just told us that this particular dispensary was upgraded two years ago into a modem functional dispensary, However, he later said that in order to upgrade a dispensary into a health centre, it will	depend on the denar for health services in a particular area. Mould he therefore tell us whether or not the demand on this particular island warrants this dispensary to be upgraded into a health centre?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member is quite right because that is precisely what I said. At the moment, however, the demand in this particular area does not warrant the upgrading of this particular dispensary, Furthermore, no request has formerly been made to my Ministry regarding upgrading of this dispensary by the D.D.C. Mwaleo</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the Assistant Minister says that at the moment, there is no demand in this area to warrant the upgrading of this dispensary , would he agree with me that as a representative of the people in this area, I have to be taken seriously when I say that the demand for improved health services in this area warrant this particular dispensary to be upgraded into a health centre? For the information of the Assistant Minister, this issue has been discussed in the District Development Committee and passed. However, my question to the Assistant Minister is: what future plans does the Ministry have to upgrade this dispensary since there is demand for improved health facilities in this area?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. G0DANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have already said, my Ministry has not received any request from the Kwale D.D.C. to upgrade this dispensary into a health centre. However, if the hon. Member insists that the D.D.C. Mwale, has decided on this matter and recommended the upgrading of the dispensary , he should take the trouble to make sure that those recommendations are supplied to us and we shall take the necessary action.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTUA: for. Speaker, Sir, is the Assistant Minister aware that his Ministry is there to serve our people and that the Ministry simply does not control (inaudible)? Is he also aware that this is why wananchi are suffering.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: No, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not aware of this.</Newspeech>Question No. 316Payment of N.S.S.F. Dues to Mr. ChepkaitanyMR. CHEPKOK asked the Minister for Labour why theMinistry has not paid Mr. Chelimo Kandagor Chepkaitany,N.S.S.F. No. 120 418 266, his benefits.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. D.M. Amin): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. The claimant applied for his benefits on 24th April, 1981, having worked with the Office of the President from 1st January, 1948 to 30th April, 1984. The Fund paid the claimant all the money that had been received as of 21st August, 1984 vide cheque No. 197182 through the address supplied by him, that is C/o District Commissioner's Office, P. o. Box 200, Iten. The cheque was returned to the Fund on 15th April, 1985 when already stale. on 9th March, 1988, the Fund wrote to the District Commissioner, asking him to supply the current address, of the claimant if he knew it. No reply has been received from him to date. the Fund will issue a replacement cheque immediately it receives the correct address.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the third time I am asking this Question. If the cheque was available in 1985 why is that when I asked this Question in 1986, did the Ministry say that the man had not applied for his benefits? I put the same Question again in 1987, and got the same answer. How is that the cheque was sent to the District Commissioner's Office, Iten, and then returned stale? How is it that it is only today that we get this answer? Why was this answer not given in 1987?Ministers and Assistant Ministers have formed a system in which they bring wrong answers to the House, and we need your guidance here. If that cheque is available, could I have it?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are ready to give the cheque to the owner even tomorrow, if only the hon. Member could provide us with the address of the claimant.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the Assistant Minister wants me to get the address of the claimant, I will do so. However, in 1987, I was told that Mr. Chelimo Kandagor Chepkaitany had not applied for his benefits. I wonder why I should be told today that a cheque was sent to the District Commissioner, Iten, in 1985. If this had been the case, the District Commissioner could have handed it over to Mr. Chepkaitany because he lives in the same town and he is well known. This is why I ask whether I can be given the cheque to forward to the owner.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the hon. Member comes with the claimant, we will obviously pay him tomorrow.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MIS0I: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member for Kerio Central, if I understood him well, said that he asked this Question in 1985, 1986 and 1987. He has now asked it again in 1990, for the forth time, and yet no action has been taken by the Ministry. He requests the Ministry to write the cheque, give it to him and he will take it to the person concerned. Could you guide us' here as to why this cheque cannot be written and sent to the claimant so that hon. Chepkok does not ask this Question for the fifth time?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D. M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the important thing here is the address of the claimant which we need to feed into the other data relating to the claimant.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I seek you guidance here. Once more, I wonder whether I myself can get that cheque since I am tired of asking this Question. The address the Assistant Minister is asking for is the same one to which the cheque was initially sent. If he wants this matter to end here, let me have the cheque to forward to the owner.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are ready to give the claimant the cheque if only the hon. Member comes to us with him.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Question is the property ofthis House, and the Assistant Minister should bring that cheque to this House and it over to me in front of hon. Members.</Newspeech>Question No. 399Payment of N.S.S.F. Dues to the Late Ketiwija's KinMR. KUBO asked the Minister for Labour when the beneficiaries of the late Mr. Tatu Ketiwija, N.S.S.F. No. 002806185, a former employee of the Ministry of Water Development, will be paid survivor's benefits.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. D.M. Amin): Mr. Speaker, Sir I beg to reply.The widow of the late Tatu Ketiwija applied for survivor's benefits on 24th February, 1986. On 17th March, 1986, she was asked to bring to the Fund her late husbands personal number with the Ministry of Water Development or one of his pay slips. On 5th June, 1986, another letter was sent to her and two others were sent to her on 5th February, 1989 and 13th July, 1990, but no reply has been received from her. The Fund is unable to move without the late tatu Ketiwija's personal number to enable us to contact his last employer for details of his contribution.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a very surprising reply because according to the documents I have, the Ministry has the late Mr. Ketiwija's employer's number and it knows the Ministry concerned. This Ministry's N.S.S.F number is 020214. So, I do not see any problem that can prevent the N.S.S.F. cannot look at the Ministry's records and find out the details required. The last records I have here contain a letter written by the Director of N.S.S.F. on 25th March, 1986, asking the District Officer of the area concerned to clarify some anomaly in the name of the claimant. Since that time, there has been no further communication, besides the Ministry being told now that it has not supplied Mr. Ketiwija's persdonal number. Could the Assistant Minister take the matter seriously and contact the Ministry of Water Development for details?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Ministry has contacted the Ministry of Water Development, but we could not get the required personal number form it. This is why we are requesting the widow of the late Mr. Ketiwija to give us her late husband's personal number if she has it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTUA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the Assistant Minister aware that he is overpowered by his juniors and that this is why this problem arises? Why is it that when one retires from employment or dies the Ministry does not pay him or his survivors benefits promptly?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are not aware of this.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am surprised because, according to the record I have here, the deceased was a contributor to the N.S.S.F. since the Fund started in 1966 up to the time he died in 1986. So, the Fund had a lot of time within which it could have verified the necessary particulars. Why has this taken so long to settle? How could someone contribute to the Fund without its having his particulars? How does it continue to receive his money only to start looking for his particulars when he dies? Do you not agree with me that there is something definitely wrong somewhere within the N.S.S.F.?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is nothing wrong with the records of the National Social Security Fund. If the hon. Member can give us the deceased's personal number, we can assist the survivors.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think the Assistant Minister has not answered the question asked by the hon. Member. The pay slip comes from the employee and not the N.S.S.F. Number. If, therefore, he asked for the N.S.S.F. Number, that would have been better. If he asks for the" pay slip, which does not contain the N.S.S.F. Number, how can the hon. Member get the payslip?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did not understand the point of order raised by the hon. Member.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I am telling my friend the hon. Assistant Minister is that pay slips come from the employer and, therefore, he should have asked for the N.S.S.F. Number which is there. If he asked for the N.S.S.F. Number, he could have got it but not the pay slip. For what reasons is he asking for the pay slip?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the N.S.S.F. Number, there is no money. Therefore, in order to follow up that particular issue, we want to ask the Ministry of Water Development to take the money to the Ministry of Labour so that we can pay the family of the deceased.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister has not answered the Question. According to the records I have, the deceased was a contributor to this Fund and be had been contributing throughout since 1966. What I am asking the Assistant Minister is to explain how this anomaly comes about, a situation where they receive money and they do not update their records. Is there any guarantee that if we get the N.S.S.F. Number the money will be shown on record? It seems as if there is something wrong somewhere.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we get the personal number of the deceased, obviously we shall ask the Ministry of Water Development to remit any money that might have been contributed by the. At the moment according to the records held by the Ministry of Labour, no money has been remitted to the Fund.</Newspeech>Question No. 442Vehicles for Primary School Inspectors in MwalaMR. WAMBUA asked the Minister for Education what urgent steps he is taking to provide vehicles to all Assistant Primary School Inspectors in Mwala Constituency in order to facilitate the said officers perform their duties more effectively.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Amayo): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.My Ministry has no plans to provide vehicles to assistant primary school inspectors in Mwala Constituency because of financial constraints.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am most dissatisfied with the answer given by the Assistant Minister because it is the Ministry which appoints these assistant primary school inspectors and the Ministry knows that the officers are not supposed to just sit in offices. Therefore, I see no reason why these officers should not be provided with means of transport because they cannot inspect schools when seated in the office; they have to move from one school to another. Even if the Ministry does not have funds to buy vehicles, why can they not consider buying motor bicycles so that the officers can move. Now that that we are having the 84—4 type of education which is very important, teachers should be inspected. How does the Ministry expect these officers to move from one school to another? What is the purpose of appointing the officers if they cannot be provided with means of transport?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have noted the sentiments expressed by the hon. Member. One of the reasons for making educational zones smaller is for easy accessibility. In Mwala Constituency, for example, there are seven educational zones to the seven inspectors of schools in the constituency. The first idea is to make supervision possible through shortening the distances between one zone and another so that the inspectors can walk to theIn areas where, because of special geographical conditions, the inspectors are unable to reach particular schools, the district education officers are authorised to organise pannel inspections where vehicles can be used in that regard. What I am saying here is that it is not practical to provide primary school inspectors with vehicles throughout the Republic. Mwala Constituency alone has seven educational zones, and we have about 188 constituencies in this Republic, and if every educational zone, has to get a vehicle for an inspector, that means that the Ministry would buy 1,300 vehicles just for inspection work alone. So, the continues to make educational zones small enough to be reached by inspectors.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAINGI: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker , Sir. In actual fact, the Questioner of this Question has put across a very nice and valid idea as far as education in Kenya is concerned. If, as the Ministry says, there are no funds to buy vehicles, then they can consider buying bicycles or motor cycles which are not very expensive. If we want our schools to be inspected so that we can move fast, the Ministry really needs to look into this matter and at least come out with something nice so that teachers are inspected. I am not trying to blame teachers in general, but there is laxity among them; sometimes some of them do not just go to classes and sometimes others just want to sleep.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: Ask your question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAINGI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if there are no funds to buy vehicles for school inspectors, then can the Ministry not think of substitutes like bicyles or motor cycles for the inspectors?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I indicated earlier, there are no immediate plans for buying vehicles for assistant primary school inspectors. The hon. Member has talked of bicycles and motor cycles, and I think hon. Members are already aware that the education budget is the highest in all the Ministries. There are no immediate plans to buy vehicles. If it is a question of making vehicles available to all Government officers in the Republic, then we would also say that assistant chiefs and chiefs should have vehicles too.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: No! No!</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Speaker; Sir, I still do not agree with what the Assistant Minister is saying. I, personally, come from Mwala Constituency and I have visited these officers in their offices. I do not agree with the hon. Assistant Minister when he says that they have made educational zones smaller so that inspectors can walk from one school to another because I know the distances from one school to another. No single inspector can walk all that distance. Considering the fact that Mwala Constituency has seven educational zones, if the Ministry could buy at least two motor vehicles, the schools could be effectively inspected. The Assistant Minister cannot just say that there are no funds to provide transport to school inspectors because that means diluting the quality of education in the whole Republic. So, the Ministry should do something and buy at least motor cycles for assistant primary school inspectors.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the provision of vehicles is quite desirable. The hon. Member has told this House that some educational zones in his constituency are too vast to be managed by one inspector. But the hon. Member should present to the Machakos District Development Committee the recommendation to split them further into sizes that can be managed by the inspectors.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. P.G. Godana's .Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: On a point of order, Sir. Speaker, Sir. This Question concerns the mobility of these officers to enable them perform their duties effectively. The Assistant Minister has not told the House what his Ministry is doing to solve this problem. Therefore, in my view, this Question has not been answered. AIT HON. MEMBER: That is not a. point of order!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AMAYO: That is a supplementary question, Mr. Speaker Sir. I would like to say that "mobility" can be through vehicles and even people walking on foot. Vehicles are available at the District education Offices. Mwala Division, as an example, has 11 motor vehicles and five motorbikes which can be used in areas which cannot be reached by schools inspectors on foot.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. P.G.

SPEAKER   Let us go on to the next order.<  Newspeech> <Header>POINTS OF ORDER<  Header><Newspeech>MR. BIDU   Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Spika. Nidhamu yangu ni kwamba wakati uliopita niliuliza Swali Nambari 100 mnamo tarehe mosi Julai mwaka huu kuhusu ofisi ya mkuu wa tarafa ya Kinango. Ujenzi wa ofisi hiyo umechukua mudamrefu na hatamfanyakandarasi alitoroka. Nilijibiwa hapa na Waziri kutoka Ofisi ya Rais, na ninafurahi rafiki yangu, Bw. Nabwera yuko hapa, kwamba ilekazi iliyoachwa huko Kinango ingeanzishwa tena mnamo tarehe mosi Julai, mwaka huu. Lakini mpaka sasa, na tuko katika mwezi wa Oktoba, ujenzi huo bado uko vile vile na hakujaletwa mfanyakandarasi mwingine. Hata mbao sasa zimeanza kuoza na ninahofia kwamba tutapata hasara zaidi. Ningemwomba Waziri, ambaye yuko hapa, atuambie kulitokea nini hivi kwamba hata sasa jumba hilo lililokuwa likijengwa halikami1ishwi.<  Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Nabwera)   Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question raised through the point of order by hon. Bidu is very important. However, I would like to assure him that it is our intention to undertake the completion of such buildings. I wish to inform the House that it is not just the district officers office in Kinango that is at a standstill. We have a lot of construction that we had intended to continue with this financial year, but because of financial constraints we could not make much progress. We have, for example, the Provincial Commissioners offices in Kisumu and there are very many other stalled constructions all over the Republic. Because of the financial situation the country is currently facing, we have not been able to start doing any work and any money that we have now will be utilised to meet more urgent and more demanding requirements of the State before we can continue with the constructions throughout the Republic.<  Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. 0K0ND0   On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I rise on a point of order because a number of my colleagues have been asking me why I resigned from my Ministerial post and I thought I could shed some light on that. I resigned because. I felt the pressure on the nation on the question raised by the clergy which tended to imply that I was withholding changes that would be positive. On a point of principle, I thought that in those circumstances I should make way so that the. clergy may-find out what else they could do. So far, what I thought they would do has happened   namely, that they have dis¬agreed amongst themselves because their purpose was not really me. Theirpurpose was somewhere else. They wanted the whole of the Government to go out so that they could bring in their own, which we GO not know where. I think my purpose in resigning has been achieved because they have started disagreeing amongst themselves. The Press, and anybody else, who were forming stories and verdicts on the Government, have now ceased to form those stories. Therefore, my move has brought about the solibrity (?) that I expected it to bring. I am very happy because my support for the Government is solid and remains the same and will be as strong as it has ever been. I will continue to support the Government through and through.I only wanted to make that point very strongly, that I am behind the Government and all the people behind the Government, come what may. Those who have been hunting me to find fault with the Government has therefore missed terribly, because they have been defeated by my move not to hold them up and provide them with a target. They have now missed the target and do not know which way to go. I am still supporting and working with the Government.<  Newspeech> <Newspeech>DR. MISOI   On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. In today’s Kenya Times, on page five, it was reported that I was not in the House yesterday to ask Question No.389 which was directed at the Ministry of Culture and Social Services. I would like to confirm that I was in the House and   indeed, I asked that Question, which the Ministry could not answer because the written reply was inadequate, and I agreed with them. That impression should be corrected.<  Newspeech> 	<Header>COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY<  Header>(Order for Committee read  being ninth Allotted Day)<Header>MOTION<  Header>That Mr. Speaker do now leave the Chair Vote 30 - ministry of Energy <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Biwott)   Mr. Speaker, Sir I beg to move that Mr. Speaker do now leave the Chair.<  Newspeech> Mr. Speaker. Sir. I would like to refresh hon. Members1 minds with regard to my Ministry• s responsibilities so that they may understand the printed estimates, My Ministry is charged with the responsibility of guiding formulation of energy policy and development, the establishment of power development and utilisation, geothermal power exploration and exploitation, thermal power development, provision of electric services, explorationand exploitation of oil and fossil fuel, wood fuel development, exploitation of non-conventional energy, registration of electric and the coordination of energy-oriented organisations such as the National oil Corporation, the Kenya Pipeline Company, the Kenya Power and Lighting Company. Kerio alley Development Authority, the Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority and the Agro-Chemical and Food Company.As everybody knows energy is vital in our development strategy because without energy as a prime mover there can neverbe real progress in any country. Consequently his Excellency the President has seen it fit to establish this Ministry so as to cater for the needs of wananchi in the provision of electricity. I must say that we have been successful over the last few years in accelerating the provision of electricity especial in the national fuel capacity which was dismal that, in fact, it could not even, sustain our owndevelopment.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the major thrush of my Ministry atthe moment is to ensure that we provide electricity to everycorner of our country. To be able to do that, we will requirecontinued support from this h House, which I am pleased to sayhas beer, forthcoming, and I know that hon. Members are keen tosee that rural electrification promoted. I would like the hon.Members to continue supporting us in that manner and also to participatein district development committees (DDCs) in order to help us todecide the priority that we need to embark on.At the moment there is a bit of financial squeeze inthat our financial resources ere dwidling in view of other demands,especially from oil whose prices have gone up. I would like thehon. Members and the public in general to be understanding. Wheneverthe KPLC moves power posts from one place to another for use ina project which is nearing completion some political rumour-mongeringstarts around that particular matter. I would like to tell hon.Members that we do not listen to any politics we go by the orderof priority given to us by the 2 districts. So Whenever sucha situation occurs, it arises purely out of development necessities.If hon. Members look at the way we have budgeted they will seethat we have catered for every district this is because go bydistricts and we do not provide electricity somewhere becausesomebody has asked for it. Occasionally, of course, there arenational priorities which are identified by people who are muchhigher than ourselves and naturally have to be taken into account.So if there will be a little bit of curtailment because of the need to pay for all the other services, because of the increasing prices .and the nature of our economy. I would like wananchi to be more. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are very lucky in that all theprojects we have developed have succeeded, and we have also enjoyeda considerable measure relief. FOR example, the Kiambere Hydro power Station was built with cheap aid. Later on part of the aid was 2 written off some of the money written off by Jest Germany pertained to this project we are very grateful to these countries which have so helped us. Turkwell has also benefited because the Trench Government wrote off about a third of the loan they gave.In fact, I am pleased to inform is the House that as of now the power line linking Turkwell and Lesos is now under tension if you touch now you really get into trouble. So, very soon we will be using energy from this place.So this has been a major success and I would like, to thank the members of the public who have visited Turkwell frequently. This will enable the nature of our work, learn more about energy and seeother things associated with energy. For example, when you build a huge dam it will further development   You will need to conserve the soil in order to prevent siltation by creating afforestationand so on. This is something which enables our students to learn	Conservation , ecology and also to see what technology can do to a country.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am really very grateful that hon. Members who have been there have seen that the money they approved in this House was put into good use. We will continue with the same kind of development. At the moment we are concentrating on the Sondu-Miriu Project in South Nyanza, which will also embrace Magwagma. When this project is completed we will be able to produceenough power to meet our demand. At the moment demand is running hand in hand with supply. But if we will use electricity export processing cones, expanded jua kali programmes decent houses, pumping water, schools and in hospitals we will require a lot more energy. Yet conceiving and implementing an energy project bakes a long time and also costs a lot of money.Therefore, MR. Speaker, Sir. electricity cannot be cheap. We have been trying to restrain ourselves from increasing electricity tariffs but have found that in most cases we have it very difficult to do so because we have to continue with our development plans. However, each time we increase these tariffs, we always inform wananclhi in advance. Ultimately, our natural resources will save us fromthe difficulties of constructing dams and so on. We are lucky in this country because we have geothermol power which has enabled us to use the steam which is God-given.We are told that it has potential of 1,000 mega watts. Our programmewill continue to be geared towards geothermol power in addition to hydro-electricity nothing	 save us from our energy predicament other thanoil. We are therefore, putting ever effort to see to it that we discoveroil in this country.As of now there are two major developments taking place inwajir, Garissa and Mandera. There is intensive exploraticn going on atthe moment and I think that between now and next month. We will know whathas been discovered there. Exploration in that area is being done by Totaland other companies. They are also very keen that we do not waste our moneyand the results wouId be made known as and when we receive the necessaryinformation On the north western part of Kenya. We have the Shell Companywhich is leading a team that is carrying cat exploration studies and we hopethat we will he able to learn more about what we have I what particulararea, be have other areas that are potential in hydro-carbons which have alreadybeen divided into blocks and are being sold at the moment. I am told that twocompanies have already come in and have bought two blocks. We will continueto encourage then. This is because there is no other way in which we can securea continuous supply of cheap energy other than discovering our own oil.I am sure the House will bo interested to know the trend of oil prices. For Example as of 1st of this month, oil prices variedbetween $36.45 per barrel   on 2nd it came down to $33.50 per barrel and on3rd - that is yesterday - it went up to $33.50. Today the prices had goneup to $34.30per barrel, we are still operating a very high prices and weare praying that the prices may come down. This is because if they do notcome down. we may have to be forced to revise the prices again. This is because noyield on their investment.We are lucky to have the National Oil Corporation because without it. Wc would not be able to get this information and our position would be more difficult. In addition to this the Corporation is now bringing about 30 per cent of the oil we use locally. Because of its involvement the Corporatic is able to moderate the prices. I am pleased to say that the working relationship between this Corporation, the Government and the private oilCompanies is very good indeed. Because of this we are  able to sometimesrestrain them from being panicky as this will cause unnecessary reactions in the market.I urge the House to continue supporting us by asking questions with regard to exploration of oil and also on rural electrification.WE also have other minor sources of energy, such as   solar energy, biogas and tidal waves which we have not explored at the moment. Kenya has also scored highly as far oil transportation to rural areas is concerned, we have been very successful in operating the pipeline which has helped to reduc e damage to our roads, we are not ready to start the west Kenya Pipeline   Which I am sure the hon. Members are aware of The first leg of this project will be between Nairobi and Kisumu, Nairobi and Eldoret with a possibility of extending the Eldoret line to Malaba. WE hope that UGANDA will do the same so that in future oil can be pumped from Mombasa right to Kampala. This will reduce road carnage AND ALSO ROAD DAMAGE.In the case of Tana ahd Athi Aiver development Authority. I would like to say that it has done a good job. The first project they carried cut was Masinga hydro-power Station which was then part of my Ministry. This Authority has also done a lot with respect to Kiambero Hydro-power Station, we have also revised them to use the water so regulated from the dams dowmstream We approached the Japanese who gave us aid and we started construction dykas at Garsen in order to stop over-flooding in order to grow rice and othercrops. They HAVE also been involved in demonstration works in kibwezi where wehave horticultural farming. We have decided that instead of leaving our dams idle. We should use them for fish farming. It will also help in fish farming so that the wananchi can now go and fish and use them for recreational purposes. For example, we have a boat which can be also used we can alsothe facilities which were erected before by the constructing companies as lodges for the wananichis ccnfort. So, those are some of the things that are being done.In the case of the Kerio Valley Development Authority (KVDA), their major project was Turkwell Power Project it is now coming to an end and they are hoping to extend it to coveranother projects nearby. They have been able to experiment very successfuly with irrigation at a place called  way-way  	and that has enabled them to prove that you canactually grow the best seeds in the Kerio Valley through wananchi we have small plots of 2.5 hectares EACH WHICH WERE ALLOCATED TO wananichi on the pilot scheme. This was done through the House of the Italian Government and we are very grateful to the Italian Government because they gave us the S10 million which again went through this House. The KVDA has been able to demonstrate that a lot can be done in that area and they are now hoping to expand. In addition they have had experimental stations in other sections of the area under our jurisdiction. They have also been trying to promote solar energy and a few other things.We are also engaged in another activity which is mainly education. We introduce the farmer to a process of self- management in terms of energy requirements in his own particular farm. We have tried to encourage them through a programme called Agro-forestry where WE domonstrate to the farmer how he can can utilize his land in such a way to grow the food keep his bee hives get fire-wood, fence, shedsand other things. We found this to be very attractive especially inthe areas where we have done it like in Kisumu, Narok, Nyeri and Mombasa we have found it very successful and we will continue to do the same. We are also moving to the districts in order to work with the District Development Committees (DDCs) and we are hoping to expand that programme so that our own officers can become present during the DDC meeting in order to help the DDC to explain exactly what our programmes are and also to receive suggestions and orders of priorities from the wananchi themselves. We hope that this will help in the process of promoting energy and its related programmes.I would like to talk about the Ministrys- headquarters. Wein the Ministry are meant for coordinating the activities and we normally plan the rural electrification programmes and also the major projects coastal areas with our own departments. For example, in the case of Kenya Power and Lighting is a legal entity andit manages its own affairs, but it implements for us the programme of rural electrification. We normally apply for the money through the Treasury for approval in this Ministry for allocating it to the rural electrification programme When we get that money we normally oass it on to the Kenya Power and Lighting who will in turn add some of the money from their own profits and then mount the rural electrifi-cation programmes So, I would like the hon. Members to be aware of that relationship.  1 •In the case of refineries, we shall supervise them on behalf of the Governmenttogether with the Treasury. WE are at the moment trying to improve our ownterms so that Kenyans can benefit from that facility as opposed to the casein the past where Kenyans were not getting enough benefits from this joint venture, weThis is because we were not given preferential shares and this is one of the things that we are now going to normalise, we have had to use the National Oil Corporation in order to process cur own oil.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to thank wananchifor the understanding they have shown in the recent oil price increases which were very high. This is situation was brought about by the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq as a result of which all the oil refineries there were put out of action and oil production curtailed. The same thing happened in Iraq because of the oil embargo and as a result of all this there has beer, a global oil shortage. In a situation like this, oil companies also take advantage of the situation by increasing the prices of oil and creating artifical shortage of oil. In spite of increased oil production by the Saudi Arabia and Argentina, the prices of oil are still. However, we are hoping that the situation in the Middle gast will be resolved peacefully because if it is act resolved peacefully, nobody knows what the situation will be. So, the prices may even rise higher than they are at the moment.	Therefore, the understanding that wananchiand this House has shown with regard to these price increases, is really a scarce of encouragement to us. I would like to assure this House that my Ministry will strive to serve the needs of this nation and if there are any shortcomingson our part, hon. Members should not hesitate to inform us. I am saying this because we are ready to accept cur own mistakes. This is because we would like to provide the best services to our people, With those few remarks, I beg to move.<  Newspeech> <Newspeech>MINISTER OF THE STATE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Mabwera)   Mr. Speaker, Sir, in seconding this Motion I would first of all like to thank the Minister for Inergy and his officers in the Civil Service the chief executives because this Ministry has done a tremendous job. This Ministry is one of	these Government Ministries that have been very successful since we attainedour Independence. As a result of the hard work that this ministryhas done, today in this country. We have ceen able to establish a lot of hydro- electrict power stations, which has made it possible for us to develop faster than we would have done. Therefore, I would like to congratulate the Minister for the manner in which he has planned this Ministry and for the way he has presented his vote to this House. I wish the financial situation of our nation round have allowed us to allocate even more money to this Ministry. I am saying this because we would like the entire country to be supplied with electricity under the rural electrification programme. However, it isunfortunate that we are not able to allocate more, funds to this Ministry,and this is something that has also affected other Government Ministries.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to make one suggestion to my colleague the Minister for Energy, namely that under the rural electrification programme, the time has come when we should target certain areas. Instead of embarking on a general rural electrification exercise, we should take electricity to institutions, we should supply electricity to the polytechnics here mine it is badly required for the development of cur rural areas. Secondly, we should supply electricity to areas where new industries are being started. It is true that without electricity, we cannot develop in rural industri ligation and therefore, this Ministry should target areas like institutions and ether vital centres instead of embarking on a general rural electrificaticr programme, we would move much faster in our development programme under difficult conditions that we are now experiencing. 	Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to take this opportunity to addto what the Minister has said by thanking the French Government, west Germany Government arid other foreign Governments who have assisted us in putting up hydro-electric power stations in our country . We are grateful to them, parti¬cularly for writing off some of the loans advanced to us by them. This means that we shall be able to use this money to develop electricity in this country.Mr. Speaker, Sir, all these things that have taken place all the development that has taken place since our attainment of Independence, especiallyover the last ten years or so, would not have been possible, if we were not a a peaceful and united country. This is why as hon. Members of this House and Kanu leaders as well, must safeguard the security of our nation.Of late, we have been going through a period in which artificial situationshave been created to divert the attention and determination of the people of the nation. Unless we are loyal to our President, the Government andthe.nation, we will achieve very little development. There has been confusion brought about by a few self seeking leaders. I cannot talk about church leaders as a group because only a few of them have becbrae   politicians   and made it their habit to try to magnify whatever happens in this country.Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me briefly refer to the unfortunate death of our brother, the late Dr. Robert Ouko. Everything was said about the Government, smearing its name. Now that His Excellency the President has appointed a judicial commission to probe into the details of this death, I would like those church leaders who sure talking about an attempt by the Government to cover up the matter to go to Kisumu and tell the commission who killed Dr. Ouko among us. If they think that it is Nabwera who did so, let them go to the commission and say so, so that I may be invited to the commission. What these church leaders and some lawyers, who aire known for their radical views, have been trying to do is to use the misfortune that has Lefailed this country to smear the name of the Government and certain other leaders. There has been an attempt in the streets of Nairobi Kisumu and elsewhere to smear the names of certain leaders in the Government, especially those who are loyal to the President and the Government. Time has now come for us to say the truth.There was talk of a cover up of the Troon Report on Dr. Oukos death. This report has been received and, if it has any value and if Troon knows who killed our brother, this should be discolosed That person or persons will be punished according to the laws of our nation. Let us not divert our attention. If there are individuals who want to attack the President or the Government, they should not pretend that they are doing so according to the Constitution.  There is no way in which President Moi could cover up the murder of a person, especially one of his Ministers. President Moi, by his very nature, cannot do so, because he is a God-fearing person. He is not the kind of person who couldcover up anything. By creating the commission of inquiry, he has thrown everything.open in a kind of field day or free for all. Let us know the truth because this is what we are waiting for. So, the Archbishop of the Church of the Province of Kenya, Dr. Okullu, Dr. Gitari and Dr. Njoya should report to the commissions offices in Kisumu and explain what they know or think. Let all bankrupt politicians who wallow in happiness when somebody dies and the bishops who go to church to be carried shoulder high by university students go to Kisumu and report to the commission there. They do not need passports to travel there because they have my permission to do so and we will collect mc.iey from the hon. Members of this House for their bus fare.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to conclude by appealing to fellow Kenyans to leave aside the question of attacking a whole community. We are only talking about a few individuals in the church who do not have the mandate of their community. The fact that a bishop is a Mluhiya, does not mean that all the Abaluhiya contribute to his ideas. Let these few individuals understand that the majority of Kenyans are with this Government. We should stand firmlyin Kanu and in this House and be solidly behind the President. Let us not be intimidated because we are a country that has gone through thick and thin. So, my sisters and brothers in the Press should write the truth instead of trying to magnify whatever is said. Let them, too, go to Kisumu and testify.With these few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.<  Newspeech> (Question proposed)<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TECHNICAL TRAINING AND APPLIED TECHNOLOGY (Mr. Leakey)   Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chance to talk about the Ministry of Energy. Energy becomes every more important in the daily lives of all Kenyans, and I congratulate the Minister for Energy on his able presentation of his Ministrys Vote. I stand in support of the Minister in this matter.Since I know that very many other hon. Members would like to talk about this Vote today, I will not touch on many issues. First of all, I wouldparticularly like to talk about wood fuel, which every Kenyan in rural areas depends on in one way or another. Every Kenyan is finding it difficult to get a good supply of wood fuel, not only in rural etreas but also in urban centres such as Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Nakuru and many other major urban centres. The people in these places are facing a crisis with respect to wood fuel.because charcoal is coming from further and further away and transportation is by vehicles that use fuel. So, the price of wood fuel is also sky rocketing. There are very many people, especially commercial farmers, who would like to grow wood in a plantation and supply it on a commercial basis, but they have one big problem of how to raise finance in order to put capital into wood plantations. I say this because to get a tree from a seedling, you need, at least, seven years because it is not like the other crops that our farmers grow today, which give them a very rapid return usually within a year on their investment of capital. In the case of wood fuel, you are talking about a seven or eight year turn over before you even see any return on your money. The problem here is that none of the financial institutions in this country today, such as the Agricultural Finance Corporation, offer any kind of moratorium on capital investment to enable anybody to get a return on his investment in wood fuel. So, I would like to urge the Minister to try to find a way out of this problem. I am sure we can raise money on soft terms from international communities, such as the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank, to set up a special fund to lend money for wood plantations, bearing in mind that this money must carry with it some kind of moratorium to be repaid in a certain period. No farmer can borrow such money today and start paying it back within a year from a wood plantation he must have a moratorium on repayment over six or seven years when he starts to harvest his wood fuel. If the Minister does this, he will have done a great service not only to the urban people but also to rural people who will be growing this wood fuel and forming a tremendous source of income for the farmer. He will also be saving the urban people.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I cannot overemphasize the need for this because what we are seeing surounding Nairobi today is more and more rural people cut¬ting down the only wood fuel supplies. If you go to Kajiado District, you will see more and more people cutting down the few trees they have and thereby creat¬ing an environmental problems. They are doing this because of the high price of wood fuel in Nairobi. I say this and plead with the Minister to take it as a matter of urgency in thev sake of all Kenyans.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other aspect that I would like to touch on very briefly is also affecting the rural people today. Many a home has not been close enough for access to rural electrification through the main grade (?) My interpretation of rural electrification tells me that it does not only mean supplying the rural person from the national grade. It should emcompass some mechanisms where the farmer or the rural person can be self productive in electricity by means of generator sets. Fortunately, the Government has seen it fit to waive import duty end also remove taxes on some agricultural equipment, but we are still paying heavy taxes on generator sets. It makes it almost impossible for a farmer or a rural person to buy a generator set today. So, I would like to ask the Minister for Energy to find a way with his colleague, the Vice-President and Minister for Finance, to give us generator sets duty-free. If we can waive the taxes on generator sets, it can have a major impact on the rural electrification programme. So, I do urge the Ministry to also take that one up as an important aspect. The other aspect that I would like to touch on, Mr. Speaker, and which I know has been mentioned here, is the question of targeting the rural electrifi¬cation programme by whatever means to areas where there is going to be productive use of that electricity. Whereas electricity is important as a domestic requirement, it is more important to target the supply to a major socio economic picture of this country. It. should be turned to where it is going to be productive either on farm production or on jua kali indistry production. I am saying that because we also link that to the incentives that the Vice-President and Minister for Finance gave us in the last budget to try to get investments in the rural areas. There are many investors, both local and foreign, who would like to take opportunity of those tax incentives to create industry in the rural areas and thereby create employment. But without electricity, those investors are not going to be able to do that. So, we must target the rural electrification programme to go to productive centres as the major priority rather than to the domestic centres, which I think is the secondary requirement at this stage in. our development.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other thing, and the last one that I would like to talk about is the question of electrical price rises. I know that there are good reasons why the Government has to allow price rises in electricity. I know that the Vice President and Minister for Finance agonises.when he has to raise electricity prices, and I do not think he enjoys announcing price rises in the commodity. All I ask him is to explain to Kenyans the reasons behind these price rises because the average person in Kenya says that the price of electricity is through a dam and, therefore, it cannot go up. I know that it can because the capital investment maybe being paid off in hard currency, the exchange rate is changing and there are many other reasons why the Minister has to put the prices up. All I am asking is that the Minister explains these reasons to the consumer so that he may understand and stop complaining.<  Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. R.K. KINYANJUI   Ahsante sana, Bw. Spika, kwa kunipatia nafasi ili nami niongeze raachache juu ya ale yaliyosema kuhusu Voti iiiyombele yetu. Kama vile mhe. Mbunge mwenzangu alivyosema, kuna haja kubwa sana ya kuwa na nguvu za umeme katika sehemu za mashambani. Ni kweli kwamba tukiwa na nguvu za umeme katika sehemu hizo tutakuwa na mambo mazuri ya kufanya. Jana tu ndio tulikuwa tukizungumza juu ya Voti ya Wizara ya Mafunzo ya Taaluma na Ufundi, na tukaeleza vile ilivyo muhimu kwa Wizara hiyo kuingia katika .sehemu za mashambani. Itakuwa ni vigvunu sana kwa Wizara hiyo kuingia katika sehemu za mashambani ikiwa hakuna nguvu za umeme.Bw. Spika, kama vile tulivyosema jana, Wizara ya MaTunzo ya Taaluma na Ufundi ina kazi kubwa sana ya kuinua maisha ya mwananchi aliye wa hali ya chini. Kazi hii haitawezekana kama hakuna nguvu za umeme katika masoko madogo madogo. Kwa hivyo, kuna haja kubwa sana ya kusambasa nguvu za umeme katika sehemu za mashambani. Kama vile Waziri wa Kawi alivyosema, ni kweli kamba kazi nzuri sana imefanywa na Wizara yake. Siku hizi shughuli za Wizara hii zinaonekana kila mahali kuanzia Mpango wa Maendeleo wa Mito Athi na Tana na pia Mpango wa Maendeleo wa Kerio Valley. Kwa hivyo, tungetoa shukrani kubwa sana kwa Serikali kwa vile inavyo tusaidia kuwa na mabwawa mengi kwa sababu tutaweza kupata nguvu za umeme kutoka katika mabwawa hayo na pia tunaweza kutumia maji yanayotumiwa kutoa nguvu hizo. Yafaa tu aweke maji yanayotoka katika sehemu za juu katika mabwawa ili tupate nguvu za umeme na pia tutayatumia kunyinyizia maji mashamba. Tukiwa na uwezo wa kunyunyizia maji mashamba na pia tuwe na nguvu za umeme, watu wengi watapata kazi ya kufanya.Bw. Spika, pia, tukiwa na maji ya kutosha tutaweza kuendeleza kilimo cha mboga na matunda, mazao ambayo yanahitajika sana katika nchi za Ulaya, na nchi hii yetu itafaidika sana. Kwa hivyo, tukiweza kuzuia maji yote tunayo yasiteremke kwenda baharini, tutasaidika sana. Haina raaana kuona maji ya Mto Tana yakiteremka na kuingia baharini ria huku sehemu kama vile Garissa na kwingine hakuna nlimo kinachoweza kufanyika. Kwa hivyo, Wizara ya mhe. Biwott ina kazi kyi wapat i ajyatu wetu. kazi.Bw. Spika, kama vile mhe. Waziri alivyosema, katika Kerio Valley ukilima shamba dogo unapata chakula kingi sana na pia mambo ni hivyo hivyo katika sehemu za Kiambere Kwa hivyo, taabu tuliyo nayo ya kukosa kazi ita weza kuisha ikiwa Wizara ya Mafunzo ya Taaluma na Ufundi itaendelea na kazi ya kujenga mabwawa ndipo tupate nguvu za umeme za kutosha. Hakuna kazi nzuri kuliko kilimo cha kunyunyizia maji mcishainba. Ikiwa tunaweza kupata maji ya kutosha, tutaweza kutoa chakula cha kutosha katika nchi hii.Pia, Bw. Spika, ni kweli vile mhe. Waziri alivyosema, kwamba ikiwa tutakuwa na mfereji wa kupeleka mafuta katika sehemu za magharibi .nwa Kenya na tuyaondoe matrela meikubwa katika barabara zetu, hakutakuwa na gharama ya ku rekebisha barabara zetu kiia wakati. Tunsihitaji kutumia magari ya moshi kusafirisha mizigo yetu ilituziokoe barabara zetu.»Bw. Spika, ni kiasi kikubwa sana cha pesa kinachotu miwa kwa urekebi3haji wa   barabara kote nchini. Kwa hiyo yale magari k mazito yakiacha kuzitumia barabara zetu zile pesa ziaa zotumiwa kurekebisha barabara baada. ya kuharibiwa na hay a magari zitatumiwa kugharamia miradi ya aina nyingine na ambayo itawanufaisha watu wetu. Waziri amedokeza kwamba huenda Tile mfereji wa kusafirisha mafuta ukapanuliwa ki tx. kutoka hapa Nairobi hadi sehemu za Magharibi mwa Kenya na hili nijambo zuri sana.Bw. Spika, ningependa kuitolea shukrani nyingi Wizara ya Kawi kwa kazi nzuri inayofanya ya kusambaza nguvu za zz umeme katika sehemu za mashambani . Wizara hii ina mradi katika mawaki 1 isho yangu na hili ni jambo ambalo limewatia moyo wa kufanya kazi watu wa sehemu yangu. Kwa hivyo yafaa nguvu za umeme zipelekwe kwenye vituo vyote vya biashara ili watu wetu waweze x a dikk kufaidika. Yafaa shule sote za upili katika sehemu za mashambani zipelekewe nguvu za umeme. Hii ni kwa sababu chini ya mfumo mpya wa elimu wa 8-4-4 ffagaxa yafaa kila shule iwe na nguvu za umeme ili kuwawezesha watoto wetu kuchukua mafunzo ya kiufundi.Bw. Spika, ni kweli kwamba kuna watu wachache wasiotoshe ka ambao wanawatumia kwa njia mbaya vijana ambao hawana kazi. Kwa JH hivyo utaona kwamba tukiwapatia vijana wetu kazi hawa watu waliopotoka hawataweza kuwatumia vijana wetu kwa njia mbaya. Mimi nafikiri kwamba ni vyeraa kwa Wizara ya Kawi ipewe pesa zaiai ili kuiwezesha kuendeleza na kutekeleza mipango yake yote katika sehemu j T .ftttaaaa.a i see za mashambani. liii ni kwa sababu kwa wakati huu hatuwezi kufanya maendeleo mengi   oila ya kupeleka nguvu za umeme karibu na watu wetu katika sehemu za mashambani.wa hayc machache, sSasisb Bw. Spika, naomba kuunga mkono<  Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KAGWIMA   Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my colleagues in contri¬buting to this very important debate. I would like to i congratulate the Minister for Energy and indeed the entire staff of the Ministry for the job they are doing in the rural areas spreading and providing electricity to our people. The Ministry of Energy is a very important Ministry in the sax sense  that most of the other Ministries, and particularly the Ministry of Technical Training and Applied Technology, will find it difficult to operate without the services of the Ministry, of Energy.  Mr. Speaker left the Chair    The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Wabuge) took the ChairMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, a lot has been said about the Rural Electrification Programme and I do not wish to repeat what has been said by the previous speakers. But I would want to mention what I consider to be our priorities the areas on which we should lay our emphasis. 1e know that it is the policy of the Ministry cf Energy and the Kenya Power and Lighting Company to supply electricity to all divisional headquarters in the country. This policy is clearly stated in the books of the Ministry of Energy and also in the books of the Kenya Power and Lighting Company Kiza Limited. But it is taking the Ministry and the Company a very long time toimplement these policies. Thepolicies are very good. The Ministry of Energy and the Kenya Power and Lighting Company must implement the Rural Electri¬fication Programme to the letter. They should practise what thepolicy says. I know that they are working very hard but the Ministry should supervise the   Every divisional headquarters in this country should be supplied with electricity. If we do not supply these areas with electri¬city it will be very difficult to start any Jua Kali projects there. It will even be impossible to take telephone services to those areas without electricity. We know that the Kenj a Posts and Telecommunications Corporation is doing its best to instal STD facilities and 24-hour services to divisional headquarters but they will not be able to achieve much in this direction until those divisional headquarters are supplied with electricity. I thing preference should be given to those areas that have been affected by banditry.or activities in the past. Security is a priority in those areas   it is a priority in areas like Tharaka, Igembe and Tigania divisions. These areas have been affected by banditry and the district officers in those areas need a 24-hour telephone service so that they are able to communicate with the rest of the country whenever security is threatened in those areas. Without electricity these district officers will find it impossible to co-ordinate their operations whenever	.security in their areas is threatened. So, I appeal to the Ministry of Energy and the Kenya Power and Lighting Company to assist us.MR. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other issue that I would like to touch on regards projects along the Tana Pdver. I have in mind the famous Seven Porks Dams. If I am not wrong about three or four such dams have been constructed. This was advertised ana everybody has been expecting miracles to happen. We know that the Siambere Power Project is a very good example. People in Mutonga are very anxious to see another dam constructed in their area. They accuse me of not talking about that project in Parliament. I therefore urge the Minister to look into this matter and save us from answering  He should also try arid lift the standards of living for our people living in those areas especially Where he isproviding electricity and implementing irrigation projects at the same time These are big and good ideas. So, we are appealing that the Minister assists those wananchi by moving as fast as possible to construct the power generation plants at Mutcnga site.Sir, looking at Meru District, you note that that is one district with the size of a province. When we have similar considerations, like those other smaller districts and I am not going to name them - it means that their pace of implementing the rural electrification is much lower than in those other districts. I am happy the Government has agreed to the subdivision of the district into two. We should now consider Meru as two districts in one so that instead of having one team, we have three or four teams and that way we will be able to implement the projects that the Ministry is bringing to the wananchi. Unless we do that, we will only be talking of providing services to the wananchi. I am happy that the Ministry is very keen to provide money to the divisions. We will continue to say we are happy that the Ministry has provided money for Tharaka and such other areas. All the divisions now have money allocated in this finan¬cial year, but there are not enough teams to implement the projects. It would appear as if we do not need the electrification services. However, we do need them. We are not blaming the workers at the site, but the work load is so much, when you consider the size of Meru District. I am sure the Minister and the Managing Director of the Kenya Power and Lighting Company will note that point so that, even if it is starting tomorrow, we have additional teams to work there.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the next point I want to raise, and on which I want to congratulate the Minister on, is the oil exploration exercise going on in the country. So far, we have not been told in clear terms whether we have discovered any oil deposits. We, however, have hopes and, as the Minister himself said, we will keep our fingers closed and continue praying that this country is blessed with the discovery of oil before long. I would like to ask the very able Minister to press the exploration companies to move faster than they are doing currently.Sir, I know that oil prices in this country are among the lowest inthe world, but they are quite hurting, taking into consideration the level of our economy. Even to us hon. Members who travel to the rural areas every week, we are feeling the pressure. We would request the Minister to press harder so that even if only one site has some oil, we can start utilising such oil while awaiting the discovery in the other exploration sites. We know the Minister is trying his level best and we have trust and confidence that the Ministry will get somewhere. However, instead of spreading the exploration exercise so much, we should push more so that we can see the benefits of the contracts that have o	already been signed.Finally, since there are so many other sources of energy, I would like to request the Ministry to emphasise more on the conversion of the wastes from our agricultural products that are lying in the countryside, and some of them in this City, to new and renewable sources of energy, like charcoal. We have so much of such resources like saw dust, dry coffee husks which is being utilised at the moment maize cobs and so many other sources. I am sure the Ministry is capable and will utilise its abilities to convert such wastes to new and renewable sources of energy.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the use of fuel gas has gone up sohigh that it will be very difficultto continue supplying enough gas to the people. Because of the unavailability of charcoal, almost everybody is turning to the usage of gas. So, we should assist in the production of some charcoal which will really help.With those few remarks, I beg to support. c DR. MISOI   Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, T for this opportunity to support this very important Motion on the Ministry of Energy. The Ministry has really been very well managed. We have had a continuous supply of power and adequate and affordable electricity and this could not have happened if we did not have a good Minister who is always ready to take action whenever there is a problem. That could not have happened if we did not have managers in the Kenya Power and Lighting Company, the Kenya National Oil Corporation, the Kenya Pipeline and even the Kenya Oil Refineries in Mombasa. These people have done a good job and we must give credit where it is due. I am telling them well done and go ahead.Sir, we have problems related to energy in this country, whose costs have risen so dramatically that the people of this country will find it very difficult to maintain their normal services   Weknow that this rise has been unavoidable and we should not blame anybody. The factors that have necessitated the rise in costs are beyond our control. We must thank the Government for its foresightedness in managing this important resource in such a way that we can still develop even when faced with the high costs. We, however, need to look around and diversify other sources of energy. We need to devote more funds to financing research programmes and utilising any waste materials which could produce energy. The hon. Member who spoke before me said that there are so many of these waste materials from agricultural production whicn can be turned into energy that can be used to provide domestic services or even industrially. This is an area where the Ministry requires a very competent team to study the available resources and also develop priority areas of even manufacturing equipment and appliances used in the industries.At the moment most of the machinery and equipment used in industries are very expensive, as they are mainly imported. The Minstry should look around with a view to making components to supplement those being used in these areas. In that way, we will be able to reduce the excessive costs end also save our meagre foreign exchange, which goes a long way to ensure a continuation of the system we have today, we need to also ask ourselves whether we have identified other sources. There Is the current exploration exercise which is covering a large area of Kenya. I suggest that more efforts should be put in the exercise   let us move on to the other areas we have not covered because I believe there is oil in this country. We are living in similar grounds that in other countriesthe oil reserves in the country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the development we have in this country has not happened by accident   it is not even coincidental. We are simply developed because we have had responsible people guiding and leading this country. It is shameful for a few Kenyans to go round unashameadly criticising the Govern¬ment for all ills that affect this society. They go around as if they live on the moon as if they are not part of the system. This is ridiculous. These people should be happy and thankful to God that we have reached where we are. It may not have been through their efforts but through the efforts of other people that we have reached whce we are. Let us mention the President, the Ministers, the Permanent Secretaries, the directors, the managers in industries and the wananchi themselves, Ihey have been able to sustain the country so that we have so much food in the country and nobody is going hungry here.If our Government was not doing a good job we would be fighting as other people are doing. These fellows have other interests and ill motives they are not talking about, a good Government because, after all, we have a good Government. Otherwise they should tell us what a good Government is and where it exists either in Africa or in the rest of the world. Gur Government is not killing but gets wrongdoers jailed by our courts.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I insist that we are not badly off. But we are not operating in a vacuum   we are interacting with nk other people in this world   we hear what is happening elsewhere in the world   we have radios and televisions from which we learn of deaths and starvation in other countries around us   one wonders how many people are starving in Kenya. We free people and  driving to Mombasa, Eldoret, western and North Eastern Kenya without being mus molested by anybody and yet we have some very ambitious people who are blind to all this. Thay should know that are human beings who are never perfect   even fellows who are creating havoc in this country are not perfect. These people may be lawyers or clergymen but they are still human beings who are not perfect they will say that they have divine powers but the devil can still tempt them. So as the President has said, we must be ourselves but if somebody wants to go away I do not think President Mois Government will prevent him from going away. If one thinksAmerica is good let him go there and he will definitely discriminated against like the negroes   if one wants to go to Europe let him do so at his own risk because he will suffar there.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would now like to turn to myconstituency and request the Minister, who is familiar with that area, to help expand rural electrification in that area. We have primary and secondary schools, trading centres and markets, farmers who want to manufacture animal feeds and rear poultry and jua kali programmes and all these recrire electricity. Althoug my area used to he within the white highlands during the colonial days, and is relatively developed, despite ath that time it still did not have electricity, unless we get electricity we will not develop as much as we would wish to. I am specifically asking that rural electrification focuses around secondary schools, the community around such schools and around growing trading centres in rural areas This is because for us to industrialise we have to go to rural areas where raw materials are found. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, unless we givepriority to rural areas we will not stop rural urban migrationWHICH creates an environmentally situation in our urban centres.The only way of stopping rural-urban migration is by creatingconditions in rural areas that encourage people to remain where itis only thorough provision of electricity that we can create goodliving conditions in rural areas. Our children in rural schoolsalso require electricity in order to compete with those urbancentres who study at night because they have electricity. So thespread of electricity in rural areas will save our chilaren fromusing poor sources of lighting.with those few remarks I beg to support,<  Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING(Mr. Kachila)   Ahsante sana Bw.

HONES). THANK YOU,Mr. Temporary deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chance to also supportthis very important Motion. First of all, I would like to congratulate theMinister for the very able way he moved this Vote. The amount of moneythat the Minister is asking for under this Vote, should actually be double thatsum due to the need we have for rural electrification, be have talked aboutrural industrialisation but this cannot take place whatsoever without electricityin the rrnra rural areas. Electrification in the rural areas, will completelyrevolutionaiise the activities in the nr.   rural areaso be have been talkingabout the jua kali industry in this country but I think emphasis should firstlyhave been made on rural electrification and then the jua kali industry second.I am saying this because the jua kali industry cannot be established in the ruralareas without electrification. Electricity today in themodernsociety is of vital importance because nothing can take off without it. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I must congratulate the Minister fcr gnergy for what he has been able to do so far and what he is about to do I am saying this because at the monent, we are seeing a lot of electricity  wires all ever and we hope that we shall be able to have electricity throughout the country within a very short time. I believe this has taken place due to the very able way that the Ministry has been handling its affairs.Having said that I would like to touch briefly on some electrification  programmes in my Division. I would first of all like to commend the Ministry for moving into what we call,   hydro-electric power stations   in my area and this will probably enable them to tap surplus power from these stations for the rural electrification within the area. However, I would like to urge the Ministry to tap more of that power. I am saying this because at the moment, there is only one station working although there is a provision for another station which the Ministry would easily establish, long the same river there could be our  two other hydro-electric power stations which would go long     i more electric power in the area.	  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is also another rive within the Division known as Hara River  where we have one or two potential water falls. Something could also he done, to toost electrification programme in their area by making use of these water falls. However, I would like to commend the ministry for approving a rural electrification programme through Homett Division although this has not been implemented. I would like to urge the Kinistry to implement this project immediately I note that the Minister is listening to me very attentively and I would like to inform him that at the moment, we have two major projects in my Hivisicn. However, these projects will not take off unless this power is installed.  We have a very big district hopsital which is coning up at Longichar whose phase I is just about to be opened. However, it cannot be opened without the supply of electricity.   We also have a Shs.l6 million milling project at Pcmet Centre but this too will not take off until and unless electricity is supplied there. I believe that something will be done about this immediately.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we also have huge milk cooling plant which has been tarmacked to be established at Siribwet in Bomet but this too will not take eff unless electricity is supplied to the axsa. This has been recommended by the district development committee and the Ministry has already given it their blessing and it is my sincere hope that something will be done immediately. I would also like to commend the kinistry for ccming up with the kawawa Hydro-electric pewer station. I believe that once it is functional, this power station all, no doubt, szx serve war.anchi in this huge area of Kericho by electricity including the Nyanza area.However, I would like to urge the Kinistry of Energy, in conjunction with the Ministry of Water development to do try and start   water projects within the district so that wananchi could be supplied with piped water from this dam. I am saying this because the dam is going to cover a very big are a and I believe this dam is only used for irrigation in Nyanza but much  	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I.would also like to commend the Ministry for the tireless job they have teen doing in their efforts to explore oil the North eastern part of our country. 	We are grateful for the exploration because the Minister has assured us that within another two or three months, we will be reading something positive about it. This is good because we need our own oil almost urgently. So., it is very encouraging to hear from the Minister that efforts are being made, at least, to explore and find out if we can have our own oil. I am almost positive in my own mind that we have some oil in North-Eastem Province. Now that this oil exploratioin, I hope that something good will come up.We are very grateful at the moment because oil-prices have notbeen fluctuating here although they have been in the world market due to the Gulf oil price crisis. So, we must commend our Ministry for Energy for stabilising oil prices in the country.	...Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, a lot has been said about thestability of our country. All that has happened could not have occurred withouta stable Government. We are grateful to our Government and the President forwhat he has done for us. This could not be explained in better terms than hasalready been done before. Chaos will never take us anywhere. Some few elementswho are never satisfied will always come up with one or two crises here and therebut we must, at all costs, support our Government and President. We can not saythis in any stronger terms than by stating that any disgruntled elements who comeevery now and then to criticise our Government irrationally must be crushedwithout reservation. We must strongly support our Government because nobodyelse is going to give us a better Government than we have today. The AfricanGovernment that we have today can only be understood best by an African, andnobody, else should come and tell us what sort of Government we should run. It  is only we ourselves who can decide which Government we want.When you visit countries around the world, you find that our Government has a good reputation and our President has a good name outside this country. It is only within the country that you heara lot of unnecessary talk about this and that. I think it is high time we called a spade a spade. We are not going to marktime for every trying to pursuade fellows to see sense inDefinitely, they can see sense, but they just refuse to see it or admit that they see it. So, sense must be pumped into them using any method available. The Government is stable, and we are happy because we are making great progress. We are not going to cheat ourselves that anybody else could do better. We have done quite a lot so far,.and we must come up every time and congratulate our President on what he has done.. We should not criticise him every morning and evening.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR:   thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to support the Motion. Sometimes, we say that actions speak louder than words. I thin it is high .time we congratulated the Ministry of Energy on the lots of work that it has done so far. I congratulate it particularly on having implemented the Project, which has given us very good fruits. We must also thank His Excellency the President for initiating such a big project. When you look at the rate of increase of our population, you find that it is very high and, as the population increases, so does the demand for manpower ana development in rural areas. Since the Rural Electrification we have seen practical work taking place in rural areas, and I wish to thank the Ministry especially for deploying its officers in these areas.When you look at the pipeline project from Nairobi to western Kenya, you find that it is a part of the development we have achieved. We will be able to supply fuel all over the country, and this is a credit to the officers running this Ministry. There are some Ministries in which there is administrative failure, but this is not the case with the Ministry of Energy. I am particulary grateful to Mr. Gichuru for the work he and his officers are doing in rural areas everywhere in the country.The Minister has said that every district has been given its share of the Ministrys   cake  , and this is in accordance with the Presidents principle of being mindful of the welfare of other people. If every district is served properly, we will have no problem and development will move faster inthe country. I appeal to all hon. Members and members of the public to make sure that whenever they implement any projeccs in the districts they concentrate their efforts there in order to make it easy for Government officers to know what is required where. This will speed up development.I would like to say something on the oil crisis in the country. The recent oil price increase came abruptly after someone outside the country caused some problem. This person has made everybody here suffer. The chaos in the Middle East has affected people everywhere, even innocent people like us. We have no idea as to why what is happening in the Middle East should happen, but it has affected us badly. When you look at other countries, you find that they are increasing their oil prices by more than 70 per cent. In Tanzania, for example, oil prices went up by Shs.l8 and in some areas a litre of petrol costs Shs.20  We, however, have maintained our price stably. It is time we implemented oil exploration projects to ensure that we have our own sufficient oil. I am sure that as soon as the Turgen Project is implemented, we will cease experiencing problems of having to import oil. I appeal to the Ministry to continue implementing such projects elsewhere where they have plenty of river water, such as we have in a place in my area where we have Embogut (?) River. Feasibility studies have been done of this river with a view to generating more electricity from its waters. If such projects go on, we will not only have our own sufficient power   we will also be able to supply it to other people. This is our main objective. In this way, we will be able to earn foreign exchange for our country and our economy will continue to be stable.We go on like this because we have love, peace and unity in our country. As our President has often said, these things must continue to exist. I am very happy because all Kenyans, including those in overseas countries, have rejected the idea of multi parties because they know that many parties will only cause chaos and problems. We have no time to engage in multi parties. In 1963, we attained our Independence and struggled to get the best political system. We chose Kanu Party.It was accepted by all Kenyans that Kanu was the only party which should rule this country, and we have no time to discuss multi-party leadership. We are busy doing other things. For example, His Excellency the President has been very busy initiating very many development projects, including universities, and colleges expansion because he knows that Kenyans need those institutions.I am happy that the Ministry of Technical Training and Applied Tech¬nology was created so that it could absorb our children who cannot go to higher institutns of learning so that they can be taught how to be self sufficient. We have not time to concentrate on quarrels   we need development only. Hon. Members of this House have rejected idea of multi-party leadership, someonejust wakes up and declares that Parliament should be dissolved just to suit his wishes. That is ridiculous. I am happy that Kenyans are willing to develop   their country, and I am appealing to the Ministry of Technical Trainig and Applied Technology to continue making research so that we can plan for our people. Like¬wise, the Ministry of Energy should also plan ahead so that we can plan for the 25 million Kenyans so that everyone can be satisfied.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Energy has done a wonderful job in the creation of job opportunities. Those hon. Members who have been approached by job-seekers have referred them to the rural areas to be helped, and many of them have been assisted through the Ministry of Energy. I must thank the various managing directors in the Ministry and other officers in that Ministry. As hon. Members of Parliament, we are very happy with what they are doing in that Ministry. The Ministry has been answering the call of our President that we should help to develop our country. I appeal to those in charge of the various Government Ministries and parastatal organisations to emulate the exmpale set by the Ministry of Energy. They should not frustrate workers.or members of thepublic. At this juncture, I would like to appeal to the government to ensure\that if any public officer misconducts himself, he is sacked so that he does nothas been singing about unity and how we should co-operate because nobody will come to develop our country if we do not develop it ourselves. I am appealing to every hon. Member here to continue supporting this Ministry. We should also thank them because whenever we appeal to them to come to our aid they have always done so. We should not have any Kenyan being frustrated. Therefore if the Ministry can continue doing the same good work it has been doing, no Kenyan will be frustrated.With those few remarks, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. ANASWA:   Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for offering me this chance to contribute on this very important Motion.Sir, in Kenya we have different types of energy, and this energy can be acquired from hydroelectricity, thermal electricity and other forms of electricity which many Kenyans are proud of at the moment. Currently we seem to be depending on hydroelectricity which comes from Tana River. Also, the Turkwel Hydroelectric scheme which we are developing now is going to make the output to be very high. But we are forgetting a very important issue, that is, thermal electricity. At Naivasha we have this type of electricity being developed, and if more effort is put in, we can increase the output so that it can supplement the hydroelectricity which we are having in Kenya today. Thermal power potential is not confined to Naivasha ara only. The area around Lake Bogoria has hot springs which could easily be developed to harness geothermal power to supplement our current hydroelectricity production.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the need for electricity in Kenya is indeed very big. Many people in Kenya are craving for electricity, be it in the rural areas or in the urban areas. Therefore, it is fitting to try and improve the supply of electricity to serve these people. We are aware that population is increasing very highly and, therefore, the demand for electricity is becoming high too. We should also look into other sources of this commodity. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, electricity in Kenya is used in various aspects, including industrialisation, which is very important to Kenya in terms of creation of employment. Most of the industries in Kenya today need electricity in order to boosts production of goods for export in order that we get foreign exchange. If you look at the industrial sector in Kenya, it is manufacturing various varieties of products which are consumed locally and also exported to our neighbours and other far countries. This explains why electricity is so important in this particular sector. If we can improve industries in the rural areas and supply electricity there, the production would go up and the rural—urban migration would be curbed.Sir, the most encouraged thing which we were talking about yesterday is the question of jua kali industries. This sector is being encouraged so much because it is offering employment. Many people who are.able to think of new models that can be produced in Kenya and be sold are being helped bythe jua kali sector. You cannot run a jua kali industry effectively without electricity. You find that in areas where electricity is supplied, most of the items produced by jua kali artisans are of a polished nature and, for that reason, when these items are sold outside they earn us extra foreign exchange. This is in contrast withthe areas where there is no electricity, whereby most of the items produced are very crude. If you look at a jiko that is manufactured without using the help of electricity, it is made in such a way that the finishing is not all that pleasing. But when it is produced with the help of electricity, it becomes very finely finished. Therefore, if we want our jua kali artisans to succeed, we should have electricity supplied to them. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there have been problems pertaining to electricity. One of these problems is thatwhen you use electricity and a bill is brought to you Manypeople have complained that they have received very high electricity bills from the Kenya Power and Lighting Company. I appeal to the Ministry to ensure that the electricity bills that are sent to our people are correct and genuine bills. This is because people have a feeling that some.of those bills are not really genuine.Sir. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other problem that I want to  touch oh regards the power black-outs that occur from time to time. These pcwer black-outs or power failures are very disturbing and I would like to request the Ministry to ensure that these power failures are eradicated completely. Electricity supply should continue without any dxsisa disruption. Then powerfailures occur people working in hs hospitals and particu¬larly the doctors in the operating theatres are greatly inconvenienced   they have to rely on generators which are not able light up the places adequately. Also power failures cause a lot of inconveniences to students studying at night.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the importance of electricity in our lives has not been given adequate publicity in this country. Many people have never used electricity before and they find it difficult to operate some electric appliances. Cur people also need to be educated on the fact that electricity can be dangerous if handled carelessly.Children should not be allowed to play around with electric appliances because that is very risky. So, the Ministry should give the common wananchi adequate information relating to electricity; its uses and the dangers it my pose if it is handled in a	careless or reckless manner. There is a programme dealing with usefulness of electricity and also its dangers, which is aired by the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation. But you will find that most people in the rural areas do not own radios. Another method of educating the masses in the uses of electricity should be found. This can be done through posters every where. People from the Kenya Power and Lighting Company should go round in the rural areas and educate. our people on the importance of electricity. Our people should be taught how to use electric devices because misuse of these things can cause very nasty accidents. We have read about some of these accidents in the newspapers and therefore there is need to tell our people that electricity can be dangerous.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, my constituency has not been supplied with electricity. We have been waiting, for very many years, for the Government to implement the Pural Electrification gn Programme in our area, and we hope that the Ministry of Energy will implement the proposals they have for providing Malava with electricity. Malava Division is the only division in Kakamega District which does not have electricity. We have very many small scale industries in that Division and all these need electricity to enable them to function effectively. These sugar related small scale industries need to be supplied with electricity. Schools in that area are having problems because they do not have electricity and this lias affected the performance of our children in national examinations. So, I would like the Ministry to hasten the imple¬mentation of the Rural Electrification Programme so that we can utilise electricity in industries, schools and so on.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have started a Jua Kali project at Malava and this projects must be supplied with electricity., because it is going to cater for the employed people in that area. So, I feel that this Ministry should be given more money to enable it to implement the	Rural Electrifica¬tion Programme.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Che sire): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute on the Vote of the Ministry of Energy. This Ministry is the prime-mover of the economy of this country and therefore the Ministry itself is very important in our daily lives. Energy is needed everywhere in this country - in the offices, factories and in the farms. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency the President for initiating the Rural Electrification Programme. He did that with a lot of foresight and lie has seen to it that the Programme is implemented in most parts of the country. As the Minister for Energy has said, rural electrification will create a rural-urban balance. If we are to have balanced development in this country, we must follow the President's footsteps. We can do that by ensuring that the power that is needed for development is spread to every comer of this Republic.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is pleasing to note that in the Development Vote of the Ministry provision has "been made for rural electrification in virtually every division of this country. That is a step in the right direction. Also in the last financial year similar provisions we re made and we were very pleased.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hope of every person in the rural area is to have electricity in his village and in Ms trading centre. I know that we have very serious financial constraints within our economy and particularly after the recent steep increases in the prices of fuel which have been caused by the Gulf Crisis. Nonetheless, there is dire need to ensure that resources are found to ensure that we provide electri-city rural areas. I say this because it is not good to design projects without implementing them. Therefore I would like to urge the Ministry of Energy and the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance to see to it that funds are made available to the Kenya Power and Lighting Company Limited so that they may carry out these rural electrification programmes which they have vowed to implement.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, certain areas in this country and particularly Uasin Gishu District where I come from	 Districts like Uasin Gishu, Trans-Nzoia, Kakuru and Laikipia used to be controlled by the White Settlers. These districts produce the bulk of the food that Kenyans eat - the maize, the milk, the wheat and the barley are produced in these areas. Farmers in these areas need all the support they can get from the Government.This will save them the trouble of having to travel to the big towns all the time taking their machinery for repairs.      In view of the very high cost of fuel, it would be cheaper if electricity was supplied to those areas where heavy machinery are being used, like farms, so that whenever there is a breakdown the farmer does not have to spend the whole day going to have a small part that has broken down in centres like Nakuru, Eldoret or Kitale. It would be much more cheaper and economical if that service was provided so that that small task can be undertaken right at the farm. The farmer would be saving fueld and, in fact, making his operational costs cheaper. It may reach a situation where the farmer may not always be grumbling about increases in the price of his crops. However, because the farmer now has to travel and waste a lot of time, he has to keep on asking for price increases on his produce so that he can make ends meet. I theefore. hope that when we are looking at the rural electrification, particularly now that we have serious economic strains, we should take into account those areas which sustain the economic activities of the nation;.      It is very important, Sir, that we particularly support the farmer. As you know, the farmer has to foot very high prices for his diesel. I am sure prices of inputs, like agro-chemicals, fertilisers and others are going to be raised as a lot of them are oil based. As a result of that, it is really our duty to ensure that we do not give a chance to prophets of doom in this country by not supporting the areas that maintain stability in this country. In this respect i am saying that we must ensure that food production must be maintained, if not enhanced so that at all times, irrespective of the costs, we have enough to feed our people, the farmer must be given all possible encouragement to ensure that he steps up the production of the basic food commodities that we require so that, at no time in future, should we ever complain of shortages of food because of the current oil crisis.I say this because I know we have enemies bent on destruction who are looking for every loophole. This is an area in which we have to plug all the looholes at the momant assuring the farmer that he is going to obtain inputswhich include fuel, fertiliser, agro-chemicals and, at the same time, give that incentive on prices for the farmer's produce accordingly. In that way the farmer will be encouraged to produce more. We are very lucky in this country that we have a President who has helped all Kenyans. He has helped us on the Rural Electrification Programme, putting up various development authorities like the Kerio Valley Development Authority, Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority and many others." His intentions are to boost the economy of this country.I would like to take this opportunity to urge those officers who have been vested with the responsibility of running these institutions to uphold the good name of H. Excellency the President by making those institutions profitable and to maximise yields. They are supposed to go out of their way to produce the best cattle, vegetables, flowers and crops that hitherto we have never had, so that we can export some and boost the economic and foreign exchange earnings of this country. I urge them to take heed of His Excellency the President's wish and support him in this direction. They should ensure that the responsibility that has been vested in them bears fruit.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR MARKETING AND SUPPLIES (Mr. M'Maitsi): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me a chance to contribute on this Motion on the Ministry of Energy. First of all, I would like to thank the Minister and his team for the job they are doing for the people of this nation. I would also like to thank them because every undertaking or project they have taken on to imolement has gone off with a lot of success.Sir, the Minister mentioned the Export Processing Zones and I was very touched by that because we are an agro-based country and, if we could promote agro-industries in this country, especially in the rural areas, the wananchi can start their own small industries. This can only be done if we can supply electricity to these people. The District Focus for Rural Developmentstrategy, as it is right now, is mainly being undertaken by the Government. We need to encourage other investors, local and foreign to come and invest in the rural areas. The only way we can do that is by making sure that the infrastructure they need is there in the rural areas.Sir, electricity, we can say, is the mainstay of every industry because machinery is driven by electricity. If the Ministry of Energy can work hard enough to make sure that all the main centres, or what my colleague called priority areas, like the institutions and the major markets have electricity, we could have these investors going in and using locally available raw materials to start industries that will benefit both the rural folk and the nation as a whole in foreign exchange earnings and employment.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Jua Kali sector has been talked about very much and I think the development of Jua Kali lies solely in the Ministry of Energy. We leave it upon the Ministry of Energy to make sure that the sector grows. If the Ministry does ot put efforts to electrify the rural areas, the Jua Kali sector will be staggered. So, we call upon this Ministry to work hard, as it has been doing, in the electrification programmes, so that all the sheds that have been planned by the Ministry of Technical Training and Applied Technology, as well as all the development projects that have been planned can take off with the supply of that electricity.Sir, We have poured much praise on the Ministry of Energy for the work it has done, although there is one area I must say I was a bit disappointed and hope the Minister will look into that. In our district development committee I have been shouting there for a representative of the Ministry to come and explain to us what the Minister explained here today. If this would have been done earlier, we would not have had need to come and seek any explanation from the House.If the Ministry can arrange to, at least, have officers at the district level to advise and help in the planning of the distribution of energy we would be better off in our plans and projects. I believe that I cannot plan for energy when I an not an expert in energy; and you cannot plan for energy for my division from Mairobi. So if you cannot plan for my division, where I am from Nairobi there is no way we can work together. So if there is an officer in the district he will come down to my area, know its requirements and relay those requirements to to the Ministry's headquarters in Nairobi so that when his plans approved they benefit wananchi more than I advocate for electricity to pass via my house so that I can get it and yet there is a school around which requires that electricity more than I do.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, our distribution of electricity in rural areas should aim at assisting small projects. I believe the Ministries of Energy and Industry can work hand in hand to see which industries can benefit our and then utilise whatever resources there are to develop such  small industries.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, while there is a nothing much we can do about the oil crisis - it depends on one Hon. in the Middle East - I believe the Ministry Energy should work extremely hard to ensure that wananchi do not get overburdened by the oil prices. Oil prices have so for been rising and they are likely to rise further - we cannot say they will come down because Saddam Hussein has not been behaving very well if he ehaves well we might be safe; but at the moment the Ministry of Energy should try best and work out a system by which energyconservation can he undertaken not only by the Government out also by every Kenyan. It is only from the base, the Ministry of Energy, that we can be advised and directed in the best ways of conserving energy.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, sir, while the Merio Valley cad Tana and Athir Rivers Development Authorities ore doing job for this nation I would ash the Ministry to identify other smaller similar projects. If a river in Kakamega, even though it may be small, could be identified it could be worth wile to set up and a plant over it so that it can distribute electricity to the people in that locality: we do not have to wait for rural electrification whereas vre can generate our own electricity within a particular region.It is the responsibility of every Kenyan; be young, old, a Government officer or private sector worker, to build the economy of this nation and the only way in which we can do that is by trying as much as possible to save on foreign exchange. This means we should all try to invest locally within our villages lost of the people have moved to Meirobi because of the availability of infra-structure. This is why I am a sking the Ministry to try as much as possible and take electricity to furthest point so that people can work within their home areas instead of having to come to Nairobi or go to Mombase. We, therefore, towards getting wananch a job back in his village; I think although the Ministry has played a big role in distributing the energy resources that we have, it can do much more to get right the last person in the village.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

MAKHANU: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my colleagues in congratulating the Minister for Energy on the able manner in which he has presented his Ministry's Vote and on the able manner in which he is co-ordinating the activities of the Ministry.</Newspeech>(Hon. Munyi crossed the Floor without bowing to the Chair)<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Omido): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I have seen hon. Kamwithi Munyi move from where he was seated and cross the Floor to where he is now seated without bowing to the Chair. Is this is in order?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): The hon. Assistant Minister has been here long enough to know our Standing Orders to the effect that when one wants to cross the Floor, he must go to the Bar and bow to the Chair. I noticed similar behaviour last week, and now I ask hon. Kamwithi Munyi to go to the Bar, bow to the Chair and then sit down again.</Newspeech>(Hon. Munyi went to the Bar, bowed to the Chair and took his seat)<Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was saying that I want to take this opportunity to thank His Excellency the President for the able manner in which he has been co-ordinating the activities of this country, which rave gone a long way to benefiting all Kenyans. I particularly want to refer to what he said yesterday at the Nairobi Agricultural Show. He called upon all Kenyans to exercise care in their use of fuel. We are very grateful to him for that and I am sure that all Kenyans, especially those who are in charge of the public sector, will heed the President's advice. You notice that the present crisis in the Gulf that has been caused by the impeding war there has turned oil into "gold". Oil has become so important that it gives us, Kenyans, more time to think about our efforts in discovering oil in this country. In that light, the money that is being asked for by the Ministry is far less than expected. We would like to see more funds being made available to the Ministry, whether through borrowing or a guarantee by this House, so that it may be able to pursue and intensify its search for oil. We have heard very encouraging announcementsfrom the Ministry and the Government that there is a possibility of discovering oil here. We would just like to urge the Minister and his Ministry to intensify its oil exploration. Now that we know the importance of oil and other kinds of fuel, it may be adviseable to the Government to ask Ministries to re-examine their policies of acquiring large—capacity vehicles. We have quite a number of such vehicles in various Ministries, some of them being used by very junior officers. I would suggest that large—capacity cars, such as Volvos, Land-Rovers, Mercedes Benzs, and so on, should be limited to top—level management officers in our Ministries and Ministers. Travelling around the world, you will find that there is a class of vehicles that their officers use. Even in Britain, which is a very industrialised country, most of the vehicles are very small- capacity in terms of fuel consumption. As a Government, we may need to review our policy towards vehicle use and stop acquiring large—capacity vehicles.The Rural Electrification Programme in the country has done very well, and we would like to congratulate this Ministry, particularly the Kenya Power and Lighting Company, for the able manner in which it has co-ordinated this programme. The only problem I have in this regard is that in Bungoma, we have about seven divisions.Out of these seven divisions, Kanduyi Division is the only one which does not benefit from the rural electrification programme in the district, and yet this matter has been brought up and discussed in the local district development committee. I am sure that the information has been passed on to the Ministry, and I am just wondering why this particular division should be excluded from the programme. Even in the current Programme Review and Forward Buget, a document that has been circulated, that division has not been included. It is unfortunate that the aspect was not included in the original plan of the district which was drawn up in 1985/86 and 1986/87. But that is not enough reason to leave out the whole division from the rural electrification programme. That has led us into various problems in the division.For example, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, a few months ago Nzoia Sugar Company was supplied with electricity by the Ministry of Energy. The power - was tapped near a large market area and near a secondary school. I personally did request that a transformer be placed there but, unfortunately, the contention was that that was not part of the rural electrification programme. I think that is not very well co-ordinated. If there is a supply line to a certain area, I would suggest that the Ministry looks a little bit far ahead so that all the areas along the line are provided with transformers for power supply. As it seems now, it will have to be a repeat performance when the rural electrification programme is implemented in that area.    Sir, there are other certain institutions such as the Natinal Cereals and Produce Board depot at Mihanga, which is one of the largest stores in the district, where you find that everything is done manually. Even the stacking of the maize is done manually because the process cannot be computerised due to lack of electricity. We would like the Ministry to be more visible in Kanduyi Division. Unfortunately, the division houses all the whole district headquarters. So, the district is just an island in the whole constituency which has electricity. I would appeal to the Ministry to look at the minutes and see what our recommendations are. If the minutes have not been submitted, then maybe, there was a breakdown in Government machinery.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, turning to the issue of regional development, I notice that the Ministry of Energy did take over the Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority and the Kerio Valley Development Authority and left out the Lake Basin Development Authority to the Ministry of Regional Development. I would really urge that now that there is a programme</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Biwott): On a point of information, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabugej: Hon. Biwott, I think you are late. Let the hon. Member finish what he is saying.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was urging the Ministry to come in more visibly in the on-coming electricity programme, that is, Sondu—Miriu, which is within the Lake Basin Development area. In other words, the Ministry of Energy should co-ordinate its activities with the Ministry of Regional Development so that we can get electricity in that area to boost supply in the Western Kenya region.Finally, Sir, I would like to support the views expressed here by hon. Nabwera that we need peace in this country. We also need security and understanding among leaders in this country. We shold sill support His Excellency the President and the Government.	With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Biwott): On a point of information, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I wish to correct an impression which seems to have been created about oil exploration in Kenya. Earlier on I said, and I would like this recorded very clearly by the newspapers to that they do not report erroneously tomorrow, that within the next three months the oil companies which are doing the oil exploration in Kenya will let us know where they are likelyto drill because they will have already finished their exploration work to determine exactly the location of the wells. That is different from saying that we will discover the oil by then.Sir, I also said that there are efforts at the moment to sell some of the blocks, and we also hope that within three months' time we will have covered quite a number of them because many companies have shown interest. Two have already bought documents for two plots and we are expecting more. At the beginning of next year, we will have a lot of information which we will give to this august House. So, until then, we do not know how exactly the exploration is going to be done. Let that one be understood very clearly so that people do not have false hopes.Secondly, Mr. Temporary Deputy•Speaker, Sir, thon. Member who has just spoken mentioned the liaison between the Kerio Valley Development Authority and all the others. The actaul development and generation of power is the work of the Ministry of Energy and the Kenya Power and Lighting Company Ltd. It so happened that in the past Tana River Development Authority and the Kerio Valley Development Authority did involve themselves in the development and generation of power but, as of now, the Lake Basin Development Authority is in another  Ministry and they are interested in things like irrigation and other matters. But they will be able to follow what we are doing in the normal process of co-ordinating within the Government system. We will be very pleased to inform them of any development that takes place along the lines the hon. Members touched on. But there will be no formal way of integrating the Lake Basin Development Authority with the other Ministries in that process, except in the normal horizontal way of co-ordination within the (Government machinery.Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabugs): Hon.

WAKOLE asked the Minister for Agriculture since the canal supplying water to Mnazini minor irrigation scheme is faulty due to the recent flooding of -River Tana, whether the Ministry could take urgent measures to have it repaired in order to facilitate farming activity in this area.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Kones): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Mnazini Minor Irrigation Scheme was implemented by my Ministry with the full participation of the farmers of the area in 1981/82 Financial Year. This was done on the understanding that the Government's contribution would only be limited to the initial implementation costs as regards the main work, while subsequent operations and maintenance costs would remain the responsibilities of the farms. In view of this, my Ministry has got no immediate plans to take over the resonosibilities of farmers other than providing the necessary technical advice on the proper maintenance of the irrigation canals.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAKOLE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, I thank the hon. Assistant Minister for his reply and I would like to ask him whether he is aware that last year and this year, no farmer has cultivated anything because of the blockage of these canals.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KONES: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not aware that no farmer has done any cultivation, but if this is the case, it is still the responsibility of the farmers to clean up the canals. They have to do resilting of these canals because it is the understand of my Ministry that this is the responsibility of the farmers. However, if there is a major problem within the canals more funds should be solicited through the Ministry, but the District Development Committee (DDC) must sit first and request such funds to be remitted. Thank you.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.I. MOHAMED: Is the Assistant Minister talking about cleaning of the canal. The canal was washed away and actually it is even rendering the road to the town impassable. So, this needs major repairs and the technical work, but not merely farmers cleaning up the canals. What immediate action is your Ministry taking to save the situation?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KONES: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said before, my Ministry has got no immediate plans to carry on any repairs on these canals because first, Mr. Speaker, we understand all of us, that if there is a lot of silt blocking the canals there is likely to be some major damages along the canals. I would advise the hon. Member from the area to try first of all to put the farmers together to have the canal cleaned up. If there is going to be any major breakages within the canals then like I said, they must pass their request through the DDC for funds to be provided for the repairs of the canals.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.I. MOHAMED: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to tell us that his Ministry has no immediate plan realising that this is a project which was there and it is the duty of his Ministry to maintain the canals? Is he not shunning his responsibility by bellow us that they have</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KONES: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is quite a very straight forward issue. Whaat I have said is "that it was the responsibility of the Government to implement the project with the understanding that the farmers will take the responsibility of the day to day running and operations of the canals. Now, we are to running away from any responsibility. The implementation aspect was done by the Ministry and we understand to that the farmers must do the day to day running and cleaning of the canal.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the Assistant Minister is misleading the House. Such projects are normally undertaken by the Government after having studied the area before-hand, assuming that the Government had already studies the area before they started this project, it is quite natural for the Ministry to expect flooding in that particular area and therefore, they should have made provision for clearing this canals during floods. So, what the hon. Member is asking is why the Government cannot help wananchi in that particular area so that they can use this water because without the Government help wananchi in that area cannot manage to do the desilting of the canals.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KONES: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think it will be good if the House could also be informed that there are five similar minor irrigation schemes of the same nature. Two of them are operational and the other two are nearly completed and the other two apart from Mnazini Irrigation Scheme are working very well. It is all because the farmers around that area are taking the responsibility of cleaning up their canals. In this particular area, the farmers have not taken it upon themselves to clean the canals. This is because probably, the hon. Member of the area has not made the farmers aware that it is their responsibility. Now, I am requesting him to tell them that this is their</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was and is a Government project. The Assistant Minister is saying that his Ministry has no immediate plan. Okay, we forgive him for that. He should also forget about the immediate plan. What future plans does the Ministry have now, because they have seen the shortcomings t ensure that the farmers do not go on suffering?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KONES: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we do not have immediate nor any future plans about this. All I am saying is that the farmer must be made aware that it is their responsibility, otherwise, this has nothing to do with the Ministry any more.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Do we not have what we call agricultural extension technicians who go into the field to advise farmers? Is the Assistant Minister in order to say that the district officer should go to the field to advise farmers on how to farm? Does the Government not have exports who should be sent to the field to advise farmers?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KONES: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a social problem, it is not a technical problem. We have identified the problem and we now the problem that the farmers are facing. The best person to address the farmers or the members of the public will be the district officer and the hon. Member of the area. We know the problem is; there nothing is difficult about it. Our technical officers have said that the problem is on silting and the farmer have to clean the canals. What else do yo want us to do?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAKOLE: First of all, I would like to tell the hon. Assistant Minister that my farmers in the constituency are working together. Secondly, this issue is a very serious one. The way the Assistant Minister is answering is really embarrasing me. The Holland Government has sent a lot of money for that scheme. They just left' two or three years ago. We do not needthese canals. When they get blocked the farmers cultivate their crops properly but last year they burst again. What I want to know from the Assistant Minister is whethere there are any Government plans block up this canals.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KONES: Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I have said is that if there is going to be any major problem within the canals and that the hon. Member feels that the Government should move he should pass that information to us throught the DDC then we can look into it. As at now what we know is that it is a social problem that is causing that blockage, otherwise, it is nothing technical.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to keep on misleading this House by saying this is a social problem when we very well know it is an agricultural problem?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KONES: I do not understand what he means by an 'agricultural problem’, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Could he substantiate that?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. This a technical problem and experts are expected to advise the farmers.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KONES: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am an severing this Question by repeating myself many times. I have said that this is a social problem. Our technical officer attached to this particular irrigation scheme has told the fanners that the problem is caused silting. Let the farmers desilt these canals first and if another problem arises then they will be advised accordingly.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Kyonda's Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

No.162-613-62X, is now on permanent and pension¬able terms of employment under the T.S.C. when he will be refunded his contributions by the N.S.B.E.<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOE LA30UE(Mr. P.J. Masinde): Mr. Speaker, Sir I beg to reply.According to our N.S.S.E. records, Mr. Mwasaru was born in 1954 and therefore he does not qualify for repayment of his N.S.S.F. contributions until he attains the age of 50 years.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my Question I have stated very clearly that an once somebody's terms of service are converted from temporary to permanent and pensionable under the Teachers Service Commission such a person is normally refunded h N.S.S.F. contributions. M Mr. Mwasaru is not requesting to be paid his contributions because of age but because he is now on permanent and pensionable terms of employment.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.J. MASINDE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to Section 7 of Second Schedule of Chapter 258 of the National Social Security Fond Act of 1978, an employee who ceases to be a contributor after being employed on permanent and pensionable terms does not qualify for reimbursement from the Fund until he attains the qualifying age of 50 years or 55 years.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have got a letter here from the T.S.C. addressed to Mr. Mwasaru, which states as follows:-"To enable the Commission to process your first years refund of the above scheme, please furnish us with two photostat copies of your N.S.S.F. Card."Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is on the basis of this letter from the T.S.C. that I am now pursuing this matter. This gentleman did what he was e_xpected to do but up to now he is still expecting to be paid his money. This letter is dated 6th June, 1935.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MS. P.J. MASINDE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the T.S.C. may not have known the proper procedure. It is not the T.S.C, that pays N.S.S.F. contributions to qualifying workers. I have already told the hon. Member what the procedure is as far as N.S.S.P. payments are concerned.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASIKE-NDOMBI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have some experience as far as teachers are concerned. When teachers were' adopted into the pensions scheme and theywere allowed to use their Provident Funds contributions to purchase their pension scheme. Could the Minister, instead of refunding the money directly to the employee, allow Mr. Mwasaru's contributions to purchase his pension scheme?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.J. MASINDE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as far as the paymentsare concerned  We are being asked to refund the money directly to Mr. Mwasaru, and I think I have already replied to that question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU : MR. Speaker, Sir, while I agree with the Minister on that section of the law, since it is not fair to retain this man's money until he attains the age of 55 years, could the Minister make arrangements to review that section of the law so that if an employee is placed on permanent and pensionable terms of employment he can be refunded his N.S.S.F. contributions without delay?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.J. MASIITDE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is k a completely different question.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KUBO : Mr. Speaker, Sir, in view of the fact that this teacher has been assured by the T.S.C. that he is going to get his refund, and bearing in mind that the Minister has said us that that is not guaranteed, would the Minister assure this House that the money is going to be paid back to the T.S.C. and that it is going to be held by the T.S.C. on trust for this gentleman so that it can be taken as part of his pension?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.J. MASINDE: The hon. Questioner wanted to know how soon we will be paying this money because the employee is on permanent terms. I have already replied that he will be paid when he attains the age of 50 years. There is nothing else we can do.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the when the Ministry should look into this matter because this affecting people all over the country. I also contribution the N.S.S.F. but I have never been paid that money. There Ministry should do something about this problem.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MASINDE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think we are generalising too much much on this issue. Here is somebody who changed his terms of service, and this is completely different from the case of somebody who was employed in the normal manner and his payments are delayed. I can assure the House that we are trying our level best to ensure that there are no further delays in payment where we get the normal, and proper details concerning the employee.</Newspeech>Question No. 426Payment of N.S.S.F.

No. 06638612, his benefits since his retirement on 1st April, 1983.THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Masinde'): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Mr. Guyo Dambi's claim was settled on 8th May, 1987, as per our cheque No. 056636, for KShs.9,671.90. This was done through the address given to us, P.O. Box 30027, Nairobi. The cheque was later returned to the Fund because it had not been claimed and it has since gone stale. I would, therefore, ask the hon. Member to advise the claimant to give us the correct address and then we shall be able to write a new cheque.MR. FALANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the hon. Minister for the good reply, could he consider me as the claimant's honourable representative or as his permanent address, and give me the cheque to hand over to the claimant?<Newspeech>MR. MASINDE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would like to get an authority from the claimant in order to issue the cheque to the on, Member. We would also like him to confirm that he did not receive the cheque, although we know that he did not. While the hon. Member goes to cheque for that confirmation from the claimant, he may also take that opportunity to get the right address. After we get the correct address, we shall definitely communicate the cheque through the right address.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIILU: Mr. Speaker, Sir. why can the hon. Minister not trust the Questioner and issue</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MASINDE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is nothing difficult. All I have said is that the claimant should be advised to give us his correct address. So., the question of mistrusting the hon. Questioner does not arise; he is not the claimant. If he has undertaken to help the claimant, we are quite willing to co-operate.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Question I put in this House is a clear indication that Mr. Dambi did not receive his cheque. He has, therefore, authorised me to ask the Question and, if possible, take the money to him. Could' the Minister take the Question as an authority from the' claimant? The Minister was a very good friend of mine when he was a Back-bencher.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MASINDE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is either one or two alternatives. Either the hon.

Spika, naomba kujibu. Jumla ya pesa ambazo zilitengwa kujenga jumba hili la akina mama la Mkwiro ni KShs.180,000/-. Wakati kazi ya kuijenga nyumba hiyo ilipokwisha, pesa zilizobaki ni KShs.7,120.65.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Bw.

Ni kwa nini alikubali kupotoshwa kwamba jengo lenyewe•limemalizika ile hali halijamalizika?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LOMADA: Bw.

MWAMZANDI: Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Spika. Kwa kuwa jengo hili halija- kamilika na Waziri Msaidizi amepotoshwa kwamba limemalizika, ningeomba Swali hili liahirishwe ili Waziri Msaidizi aweze kuleta jawabu la kuridhisha hapa. Nafikiri amepotoshwa.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. LOMADA: Bw. Spika, vile ninavyojua ni kwamba kazi hii ilifanyika. Kulingana na utaratibu wa mipango ambao niko nao hapa, pesa zilizotengwa kufanya kazi hiyo ni KShs.180,000/-.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. CHEPK0K: Jambo la nidhamu, Bw.

MWAMZANDI: Bw. Spika, jambo langu la nidhamu lilikuwa limeelekezwa kwako, kwamba kwa sababu Waziri Msaidizi anaonekana amepotoshwa. Je, Kiti kina- weza kuruhusu Swali hili lijibiwe siku nyingine ndipo tuweze kupata jawabu la kuridhisha? Nilikuwa nataka uamuzi wako ball si jawabu kutoka kwa Waziri Msaidizi.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order, mhe. Mwamzandi. Wewe ni mhe.. Mbunge, na ninaamini vile umesema, kwamba jengo hilo halijakamilika. Pia, mhe. Lomada ni mhe. Mbunge na ninakubali vile anavyosema, kwamba anafikiria limekamilika. Jukurau langu ni kuwaamini ninyi wawili kama Waheshimiwa Wabunge.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Spika. Nidhamu yangu ni kwamba inaonekana Waziri Msaidizi araepotoshwa na maofisa walioko huko nje. Kwa sababu mi mi mwenyewe ninatoka sehemu tunayozungumzia, naweza kusema kuwa jibu lililotolewa si sawa. Kulingana na Kanuni za Bunge hili,. Bw. Spika ana haki ya kutoa uamuzi kwamba jibu kama hili likataliwe na jibu lingine liletwe baadaye.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LOMADA: Bw. Spika, ningependa kusema hapa kwamba hi 1o ni swali lingine. Kama jengo tunalozungumzia halijakamilishwa, basi hilo ni swali lingine tofauti.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Spika. Nidhamu yangu ni kwamba Swali linauliza ni "kiasi gani cha pesa kilitengwa ili kumaliza jengo la akina mama" na Waziri Msaidizi amefahamishwa kuwa ujenzi haujakami1ika. Si haki kwa Waziri Msaidizi kusema kuwa anaulizwa swali tofauti, na hali analoulizwa ni kuhusu jengo hilo.</Newspeech>(Mr. Lomada continued to sit down)<Newspeech>MR.

Kama kazi hii haingekuwa imekamilika, basi pesa hazingebaki.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Bw. Spika, kama Waziri Msaidizi anavyosema, pesa hizo zilitengwa ili kukamilisha ujenzi wa jengo hilo. Kwa hakika ujenzi huo haujakamilishwa na kuna ukora wa namna fulani wa kuzibakisha pesa hizo kiwango cha Ksh.7,000/- na hali ujenzi huo haujakami1ika. Kwa sababu Waziri Msaidizi amepotoshwa na maofisa katika wizara yake atafanya jukumu gani ili arudi na kuleta swali lifaalo Bungeni? Kwa sasa ceiling na milango bado hazijawekwa na kuna sehemu nyingine nyingi ambazo hazijakami1ishwa. Ni lini atarudi na kuja na jawabu linalofaa hapa Bungeni?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LOMADA: Bw.

Member who  asked the Question still insists that the building has not been completed. On the other hand, the Assistant Minister claims that the building is complete. Of the two, whom shall we take seriously? Who is telling the truth? That being the case, there must be somebody in between the two who can tell us whether that building is complete, or not. Would it not be all right for this Question to be deferred until next week Tuesday so that if the reply will be to the effect that the building is actually completed, we will go ahead to reprimand the hon. Member. If, on the other hand, the building is not completed, then the House must reprimand the Assistant Minister. I am only seeking your guidance on that aspect because the two hon. Members here; the Assistant Minister and the hon. Member who asked the Question, cannot lead us anywhere. Each of them is, in his own way, telling his "truth".</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order, hon. Members. I think the two will lead themselves to Kwale. I think what the hon. Member who asked the Question should do is to invite the Assistant Minister to Kwale to see the real development of the building.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am very grateful for your ruling but I would like to ask whether the Assistant Minister could be asked to show whether he has concurred with your decision for a visit to Kwale. I would like him to indicate that he has accepted your extended invitation to Kwale.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LOMADA: Bw. Spika, kulingana na matamshi ya mhe.

Let us go on to the next Question.</Newspeech> Question No. 445Cess Collection from South Coast HotelsMR. BIDU asked the Minister for Local Government how much money, in terms of cess collection, has been remitted to Kwale County Council between 1986 and June, 1990, by all hotels in the South Coast and how this money has been utilised.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Wagura): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Kwale County Council does not collect cess from hotels but rather charges licence fees from them. Between 1986 to June, 1990, Kwale county Council has collected a total of Ksh.2,737,200/- from the hotels and lodges in the South Coast. Once the funds are collected, they form part of the Council's revenue. In the Council's development programme, priorities are then identified and the Council embarks on implementation. The Council, using those resources, and the other funds from other sources, has been running its various activities as follows. The Kwale County Council is running a special school for the mentally handicapped and another school for the deaf and dumb. Other than that, the Council is running 14 nursery schools, provision of extension services in the Council, water services to the arid areas and market maintenance.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

WAGURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thought the hon. Member would thank me for my reply. However, sons of the nursery schools I have referred to are in Kwale, Matuga, Chitsini, Malalaini end Kasalwa and we are spending over Shs. 751,453/- on nurseries chools alone.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker thank the Assistant for that good reply. But he has said that part of the money is used  in water provision. Since it is well known that Kinango has no water, could the Assistant Minister tell us where in Kinango specific water projects are sited?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAGURA : Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the hon. Member is misinformed. Once the revenue has been collected it is for the local authority concerned to prioritise projects and not our Ministry. All the same, we have some boreholes at Tsavo, Mdavaya and Bondo which cost Shs.976,195/- and so we are looking after the hon. Members  interests in Kinango.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker. Sir, I will only thank the Assistant Minister after he has included Minango in the water provision programme. The areas he has mentioned are getting more and more water while Kinango, which is semi-arid, is not included in the areas for water prevision.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have councilors in Kwele County Council. Could he channel his grievances through those councillors so that he gets a portion of the money.</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. SPEAKER : Mr. arap Chepkok's Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Therefore, if the lion. Member warts to make a correction his corrected Question should be deferred so that I also do my research.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK : Mr. Speaker, Sir, I asked for a bulldozer and not a grader and, perhaps, this is a typing error.

Construction of Athi River Bridge which was a major bottleneck on this route was completed in 1983.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

The survey work on the portion has been completed.</Newspeech><NEWSPEECH> MR.

The aerial survey was dene in 1972 when the road was a priority in Machakos District. But subsequently priorities were changed and, at the moment, Nun gun i-Hi ko ko Road is in the same district is being completed through contract -.virile the Ministry is working on Machakos-Hangunao Road.(a) Makutano Msrket-Mwala-Musaalani through Myanyani to Hithimani project would commence after the other two roads are substantially completed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

MAIYYII: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the information available in our Ministry is that the Machakos DDC changed the priority.The Ministry could not have stopped the DDC from doing that because we implement the wishes and decision of the DDC.

Maendeleo ya "Manawake Organisation.<Newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mr. Lomada): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Ministry of Culture and Social Services has been assisting women and youth in all constituencies, and will continue doing is so. As for the plans the Ministry has for the ELaoret South Constituency in assisting both women and youth programmes through the Kanu Maendeleo ya Wenawake awake Organization, I like to say that although it has not possible for the Kanu Maendeleo ya Wanawake to undertake programmes in ELdoret South Constituency, in the past, machinery for implementation of these project is now being sex up. To This end, the organisation of Maendeleo ya Wanwake has now recruited a district field worker whose area of word will cover ELdoret South constituency. It is therefore important for the hon. Member to work closely to the Kanu Maendeleo ya ^ar.awake elected women leaders in his division to identify projects which they would like to he undertake by the Organization.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for that reply, could we get an indication from him as to whether the Maerdeleo ya Wanawake Organization ever draws up annual budgets for each district and whether these budgets are subject to the approval by the district development committees.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I do not think that answer by the Minister is satisfactory. I would like him to take this matter very seriously and tell us the specific day when he thinks he would be able to answer the question. He cannot stand and say, "sometimes next week'.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: I am fully satisfied with the reply given by the Minister. He shall wait for him to answer the Question sometimes next week. "I will you ask your Question Mr. Chepkokc.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Mbori): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Minister is aware of the financial problems affecting various local authorities, Keiyo Marakwet County Council included. However, it is the sole responsibility of each and every local authority to look for the necessary finances to meet their own commitments. The Minister is further aware, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Keiyo Marakwet County Council has paid some of its workers up to and including August, 1990 2nd for the rest of the workers who have not been paid, the council is working hard to ensure that they are also paid. The Question as it stands is not fully correct; in that it is alleging that all the employees of this county council have not been paid for the last eight months.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Speaker. Sir, I think the Assistant Minister is misleading the House because the truth of the matter is that the Keiyo Marairwet County Council employees have not been paid for the last eight months. It is unfortunate that while this has continued to be the case, the county council recently decided to buy a vehicle worth one million shillings. This means they do not pay any consideration to the plight of these employees. Could the Assistant Minister tell us why this has been done?</Newspeech><Newspeech>ME. MEORI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is most unfair for the hon. Member to say that I am misleading the House. I take this as a matter of national importance since it involves the welfare of the employees of this particular county council. While it is true that the staff at "the headquarters have not beer, paid for only one month, namely September this year, it is not true to say that all the employees of this council have not been paid for the last eight months.Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are about 90 nursery school teachers whose salaries have been outstanding for the last five months On a point of order,</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKCY: On a point of order Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the Assistant Minister in order to continue misleading the House? I would like the Assistant Minister to tell this House whether these employees are going to be paid or not? It is not true to state in this House that some of the employees have been paid! As far as I know; Belay in Faying Keiyo Marakwet Council Workers.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CEEFKOK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Local Government the following Question by Private Notice:-Since the employees of the Elgeyo Marakwet County Council have not been paid their salaries for the last eight months, what urgent steps is the Ministry taking to pay these employees their salaries forth with?none of these employees has "keen paid for the last eight months. I we wanta straightforward answer as to whether they are going to being paid or not.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MBORI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was just in the process of explaining to the house and the nation at large what has taken place at the Keiyo Marakwet County Council. If the hon. Member would he willing to co-operate with us, we shall get on very well. I was saying that there are 90 nursery school teachers whose salaries have been outstanding for the last five months. This means they have been paid for some months. There are also 12 community development assistants whose salaries have not been paid for the last five months. The total amount outstanding for these salaries is Shs. 144,670/-  There are also allowances for some of the councillors, amounting Shs.33>,525/— which have not been paid since May this year. "However, the Ron. Member is not right in saying that I am misleading the House because as I have already said, some employees have been paid their salaries.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEFKCK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I still maintain that the Assistant Minister is misleading the House totally. He is now saying that councilors have not been paid their allowances while I know that these councillors have been paid their allowances, and worse still, the council has proceeded to buy a new vehicle worth Shs.1 million. However, these employees have not been paid their salaries since Janaury. Not a single employees has been paid salary at the Keiyo Marakwet County Council and we cannot stand the Assistant Minister when he deliberately decides to mislead this House. The information he is now giving the House is totally wrong and misleading!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MRORI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the information that I am giving to the House is based on facts and figures and if the hon. Member has such facts and figures, he ought really to lay them on the Table of this House to prove to the House that what I am saying is misleading. The vehicle he is now talking about could be a donation to the county council and may have nothing to do with its budget.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are asking the Assistant Minister whether he is going to pay these councillors and workers or not. That is the point.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MBORI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the two hon. Members who have just spoken were co-operative with the Ministry and the County Council concerned, matters would be easier. We have an outstanding sum of money owed to the council out of rural rating to the tune of Shs-5 million. However, the two hon. Members are not co-operating with the Ministry because they have not taken any time to tell, farmers there to pay this money. If they were co-operative, this sum of money would be available for use by the council.</Newspeech>(Applause)<Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I seek your guidance here because the Assistant Minister is misleading the House. If he does not want to speak the truth, you had better send him out of this House. What I know is that the Ministry approved the council's request to buy vehicles, using its cess. Why should the Assistant Minister mislead the House saying that these vehicles were a donation? I know my council properly. He has also misled the House by saying that the council employees have been paid a part of their dues, but this is not so because they have not been paid even a single cent Could he give the House a proper answer, failing which you should send him out?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING .

MBORI:• Mr. Speaker, Sir, I seek your guidance in this issue because the hon. Member says That I have to tell the House the truth whereas all that I dohere is to tell the House nothing but the whole truth, which is what I have been doing. So, the hon. Member should co-operate with the Ministry. He has at times been known to tell farmers not to pay the rates due to the council adn which could help it to render service.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been telling the House that the Assistant Minister . is misleading us and, as you have heard, he has now given us a different answer altogether.

No 3677 of 1986, Nairobi, to Isaya Musungu, following a fatal accident on 9th November, 1985?</Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Although judgement was entered by the High Court that Mr. Isaya Musungu be paid a sum of Shs.232,928/= by Mumias Sugar Company and a Mr. William Kipkoech, following a fatal accident on 9th November, 1985, Murimi and Company Advocates, on behal fof the two defendants felt that the award was on a higher scale. Accordingly, they appealed against this judgement and obtained an order for stay of execution of the judgement on 24th July, 1990.The advocates for the plaintiff, Messrs Khamati Munishi and Company Advocates, pressed for the lifting of this stay of execution because they thought that tis sum of money should be paid to Mr. Musungu, pending hearing of the appeal. Just before the recent High Court vacation, the High Court order that the stay should continue on condition that the insurance company of the defendants pays a sum of Shs- 50,000/=.

I never talked about any money in this connection; I only talked about the distance involved. I donot know why The Standard reporters are not good listeners to the debates held in this House. This newspaper has been in operation since 1902. When will it grow up? I complain though you to the Kenya Union of Journalists.

MEMBER: Why?</Newspeech>(Laughter)<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Kamotho): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to present both Recurrent and Development Estimates of expenditure of my Ministry for the.Fiscal Year 1990/91. Before I do so, however, I would Like to take this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency the President, who is also the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Kenya and the President of the Ruling Party, Kanu, on the able and dedicated leadership he has provided to this country, which has enable the nation to enjoy peace, stability and prosperity.Let me now turn to the Estimates of expenditure of my Ministry. I am going to request this House to approve £41.19 million, which includes £34.13 million in Appropriations-in-Aid, for Development expenditure, and £15.46 million for Recurrent expenditure, which includes £0.67 million in Appropriations—in—Aid, making up a total of £56.65 million.My Ministry is charged with the responsibility of ensuring that transport and communications in this country are properly run, managed and developed. In this connection, my Ministry operates through its various departments and state corporations. These departments include the Kenya Meteorological, the Directorate of Civil Aviation, the Civil Aviation Board and the Road Transport Branch.The state corporations include the following:- The Kenya Posts and Telecommunications, the Kenya Railways Corporation, the Kenya Airways Limited and its subsidiary companies namely Kenya Flamingo Airways Limited and Kenya Airfreight Handling Services Limited, Kenya Ports Authority and its subsidiariesythe Kenya Ferry Services Limited and the Kenya National Shipping Line Limited. Before, we turn to the corporations, I would like to say a few words on the requirements of the Ministry's Headquarter:Let me start by saying that this august House will remember having read quite a bit about adverse press reports in the previous years touching on the operation and safety of the Likoni Ferry Services in Mombasa due to worn out ramps. My Ministry has carried out repairs to the ramps and has continuously been monitoring their status so as to ensure safe and secure operations of the ferries.	Mr. Speaker, Sir, the ferry services unking Mombasa Island to the mainland have for a long time, been operated by the Kenya Bus Services Limited through a franchise agreement between the Mombasa Municipal Council and the company. The Government has been contributin K£90,000-00 every year towards the ferry services so that pedestrians are carried free of charge. The franchise agreement was terminated on 31st December, 1989 and the Kenya Bus Service ceased to operate the ferry servies.The Government, therefore, purchased the Kenya Bus Service ferries with a view to ensuring continued provision of ferry services to wananchi and the tourists. Ferries provide a vital communication link between the Mombasa Island and the mainland and ire necessary for the development of the Mtongwe area and the South Coast. Other funds included in this head are to cater for the construction of the Ministry's show stands at the provincial capitals and these stands as we all know areextremely necessary for educating wananchi about the serviceswe provide and the opportunities available for training underthe Ministry of Transport and Communications.Mr. Speaker, as we are all aware, rains do play havoc tocracked roofs. The roofs of Transom House are in very badshape and we propose to re-roof the building so that we maysave, this investment from being united by rain water. Otherfunds included are for installation of a PABX which has beendonated to the Government by the Government of the Netherlands.Another aspect of the Ministry's responsibility is toco-ordinate the functions of the National Road Safety Council.The Council was established to advise the Government in broadterms on all matters  relating to road safety with particularreference toj setting out goals and objectives of road safetywork in the country co-ordinating the work of all organisationsinvolved in the promotions of safe road usage devising waysof procuring personnel and financial resources for theimplementation of road safety improvement programme, controlling and co-ordinating the implementation of road safety work in the country, taking into consideration the interests of society, user groups, trade and industry, individuals as well as road and environmental aspects and lastly to draw up a national long-term programme for the improvement and enhancing safety on Kenya roads and to supervise its implement¬ation . Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already earlier on in my address stated my Ministry's requirements amounting to KE15.46 million in Recurrent Expenditure. In order for the Ministry to . discharge, to the satisfaction of the nation, the responsibilitie bestowed upon it, it is necessary that the Ministry is manned by men and women who deliver services to wananchi in both qualitative and quantitative terms.Part of the funds in respect of which I am now seeking the approval of this august House will go towards defraying expenses related to personal emoluments, gratuity and pension contributions, house allowance and related expenses for the staff falling under the	Besides, the bulk of thevote provision under this head will be applied towards Non- Wage Operations and Maintenance expenditure of the Ministry. This is to ensure, that the staff in the Ministry are provided with operating tools, equipments and other related facilities they require for the day to day discharge of their respective duties and responsibilities.Mr. Speaker sir to turn to the Departments of the Ministry, the Kenya Meteorological Department. Let me turn to this department and say that this particular department which is this particlenot normally very known publicity is very important to thenation in providing metero logical data. It is charged with the responsibility of serving agricultural, aviation, maritime and tourism sectors. The department has been given added responsibilities of hosting the Drought Monitoring Centre for the East and Central African and also hosts a Regional Training Centre for Meteorological Training Research. Our economy as we all know, is agricultural. WEATHER forecasting and provision of historical climatologically and weather data are essential ingredients in the agricultural production process of this nation.The aviation, maritime and hence tourism industries are dependant .upon continuous supply of weather information as an aid to air and maritime navigation and safety. Without this service, aircrafts and ships which bring in a lot of tourists and commodities will not be able to fly and sail safely into our beautiful country. The department requires K£2.64 million for Development Expenditure to meet on going projects and KE6.12 million for Recurrent Expenditure making a total of K£3.76 million.The other department falling under the Ministry's the Directorate of Civil Aviation. This department  is an equallyimportant department. It is charged with the responsibility of controlling all air traffic entering and leaving our air-space - and within the Kenya Flight Information Region.. Without the provision of air traffic services, aircraft bringing in tourists and other travelers will not be able to land safely in Kenya airports and revenue generated from tourism and other sources would^ therefore be jeopardized.Mr. Speaker left the chair) ,(The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Wabuge) took the chair) Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Department also liaises with, the Department of Defence on matters pertaining to aviation safety and security in airspace. The Department therefore, requires a total of Kf.15.95 million of which about KX10.42 million will be spent on development and   K£5.52million will meet Recurrent Expenditure.Capital expenditure covers on-going projects on the salvation of radars and other telecommunications equipment necessary as aid to air navigation and hence ensure air safety. Radar install¬ation at Mau Hills, Jomo Senyatta International Airport,  and Moi International Airport, Mombasa, has been commissioned and aircraft are now navigated on radar at our two international airports. we have embarked on	Phase Two of the projectwhich covers Garissa and Eldoret airports. This ensure that our airspace is fully under  radar coverage.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Department also  calibrates navigation aid equipment not only for Kenya but also for  neighbouring countries thereby generating revenue to the Exchequer. Equipment are used by Tanzania and Uganda in routing aeronautical messages on aeronautical fixed telecommunications network using the Department's Central  Transmitting Station	. located near Athi River Township onthe Mombasa Nairobi Road.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other Department is the Road Transport Branch. The Road Transport Branch is charged with the responsibility of collection of revenue under the Traffic Act and TheThird Party Moto. Vehicle Purchase Act, through transfer and drivers. This brings in substantial revenue to the Exchequer. In order to make registration and record keeping at the Vehicle Registry soreefficient, the Department is installing a mini-computer which will be linked to the Central Computer in the Treasury. This facility will be extended to the district treasuries to facilitate data collection relating to revenue and the number of vehicles registered every time.Another function of this Department, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,. Sir, is to ensure road safety in this country. The constru¬ction of the Vehicle Inspection Centre has been completed at Nakuru and equipped and it is due for commissioning  any time now. Work on the Kisumu Vehicle Inspection Centre is in progress and we expect that it will be completed during the current Financial Tear. The Department plans to establish other vehicle inspection centres in Thika, Smbu, Eisii, Hyeri, Machakos, Voi and. Naivasha. Hon. Members are fully aware of the serious razi accidents which have occurred on our roads in recent years. It is hope that with regular inspection of passenger vehicles using our roads, we will be able to reduce road carnage considerably by removing unroad worthy vehicles from our roads. The  Department therefore requires K£.0.30million in the Development Expenditure and 2si Kill. 470 million in  Recurrent Expenditure. Hon. Members, will be aware that His Excellency the President has continuously been expanding the fleet of the Nyayo Buses. On 20th June, 1990, His Excellency the President launched a further fleet of 13 buses at  Id panda House Nairobi. Other buses are either being assembled in the Netherlands or are  on high seas en route to Mombasa.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Members will also note that under the Kenya-Belgian Protocol signed in January, 1990, the country will receive . a further fleet 100 Volvo "buses. Some of the buses have been allocated to Eisusu, Nakuru, Eldoret, Mombasa and Meru and other areas with transport problems.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this provision of transport is important because as all hon. Members are aware, the main purpose of the introduction of the Kyayo Buses is to try and regulate bus  and matatu fares which have of late been rather exploitative. Matatus and  bus operators who have been chargingexorbitant fares These fares will be regulated by theintroduction of more and more Nyayo Buses throughout the country.I ask you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, and the House to join me in congratulating His  Excellency the President for this very generous gesture and pray for his long life so that God may give him  strength and wisdom to continue leading this country to-greater  heights, of development and prosperity.Let me now turn to State Corporations which  fall under my Ministry. There are five State Corporations that fall under my Ministry. As I mentioned earlier, the Kenya Posts and Telecommu¬nications, the Kenya Railways, Kenya Airways, Kenya Ports Authority and the Kenya national Shipping Line Limited all fall under  my Ministry. Each of these State Corporations and Companies performs specific statutory functions for which it was created. The capital  expenditure has been included in their development  votes ma. to mainly cover projects and programmes which are externally  financed through donor funds and their financing is guaranteed by Government as stipulated in the Guarantee of Leans Act Chapter 451 of the Laws of Kenya. They also include development projects which..they execute on is behalf of the Government of Kenya.Mr. Temporary Deputy  Speaker, Sir, we all know and appreciate the great contribution the Kenya Posts and Telecommu¬nications Corporation has made to the national development of our country. I will start by stating that during the last few years, as I have just said, the Corporation has made very significant contribution to the development of telecommunications not only in our country but  in the African region. Each one of us is aware that nearly all district headquarters have been connected with the Transcriber Trunk Dialling (STD) service. All those telephone subscribers using those telephone exchanges have been provided with the service. This is no mean achievement during that short period or time. This development goes hand in hand with the installation of very many telephone coin boxes all over the Republic for wananchi to use. The Corporation has embarked on the next phase of extending STD facilities to all administrative divisional headquarters, which is expected to be completed by the end of 1993. This will be followed by further extension to growing market centres in the Republic.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the introduction of this facility in the rural areas has enabled wananchi who cannot affort to install telephones in their houses to use the facility through coin boxes which have been provided near their homes. The Corporation has further expanded and upgraded post offices to departmental levels where all postal services are now provided. to enable the Corporation to continue to expand the services, a sum of K£5.84 million is required during the year for meeting capital expenditure on on-going projects. This money is in form of grants from -friendly countries through the Government of Kenya to Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, turning to the Kenya Railways Corporation, let me point out that this is the principal transporter of. all kinds of goods and heavy equipment in the country. It also provides transit traffic to land locked countries as provided in the Northern Corridor Transit Agreement. In order to provide efficient traffic movement - with the Corporation's rail net¬work and inland waterways - the Corporation has embarked on an improvement and restructuring programme. Funds have been acquired from the World Bank, through its affiliate - the International Development Agency - for the improvement of the Mombasa-Nairobi railway line. IDA is also continuing with a short-term actionprogramme which sets to identify problem areas and suggest  measures inorder to improve performance and efficiency of our railways corporation Mr. Temporary Deputy.Speaker, Sir, the DANIDA is also carrying out a study into the inland waterways,and the study is in progress, to improve public transport within Lake Victoria. That falls under the Kenya Railways corporation. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany is also providing technical assistance in form of service engineers with a view to improving the Corporation's- telecommunication and signalling network, which has already been completed from Mombmasa to Nairobi, and we are now in the process of looking into the possibilities of extending this telecommunication system from Nairobi to Kisumu and other Western areas.All these measure's, Sir?, are being undertaken to enable the Kenya Rail¬ways Corporation to offer reliable and safe: transportation, and I would like to assure hon. Members and wananchi in general that railway transport is extremely safe. The Corporation will, therefore, require seme K£6.4 million in development expenditure to finance the on—going improvement work. We must not also forget that Kenya Railways Corporation played a key role in the manufacture of the Nyayo Pioneer car.Having said that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would now like to turn to the Kenya Ports Authority. This Authority has been carrying our a rehabilitation of cranes both at the port of Mombasa and also at the Embakasi Inland Container Depot through the generous assistance' of the governments of the United Kingdome and France. The Authority has also been carrying out 	work at Mkuguni and Larau harbours. This Corporation is doing a commendable job. In 1989, the franchise agreement I mentioned earlier between the Kenya Bus Services of Mombasa and the Municipal Council of Mombasa and the Ministry, through which the Kenya Bus Services provided ferry services at Likoni and Mtongwe was terminated; The Government, therefore, bought the old ferries owned by the Kenya Bus Services so as to ensure continued provision of ferry service's at the channel. Due to the age of the acquired equipment, the Government arranged to acquire new and modern FERRIES FROM THEY HAVE ALREADY ARRIVED at Mombasa. Four ferries will be launched officially very soon. During the current plan period, the Authority also plans to construct inland container depots at Malaba, Kisurau and Eldoret. The Authority will, therefore, require some K£14.88 milion to meet capital expenditure for the on—going projects.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, our Kenya Airways is the national flag carrier. The Government s injected a lot of funds to acquire two new air buses and to lease an additional air bus and a Boeing 757. The Government has also bought two new Fokker 50's. The Government has provided these new aircraft to the national flag carrier to enable it to provide efficient and reliable services and to generate enough revenue so as to yield profits to the shareholders In order to operate' these' aircraft more efficiently, necessary training has been intensified for all airline staff. The airline requires K£0.30 million for this purpose.Sir, I wish to appeal to hon. Members and members of the public at large to patronise our airline whenever they are travelling either locally or abroad, for travelling by air is not only fast but also safe. Hon. Members are aware that the airline has undergone a very difficult period because of the increasing operating costs. It had to take a painful decision of laying off about 1,000 members of staff. Recent financial indications show that these austerity measures are yielding some good results in that the airline, for the first time, has made a profit of KShs.45 million.Having said that, I would now like to talk about the Kenya National Shipping Line, which is the last organisation under the Ministry. This is a very new organisation which has been established by the Government as a joint venture with UNIMAR of Germany to handle our export and import trade which had, their to, been monoplised by foreign owned shipping lines. The establishment of the National Shipping Line will ensure that our foreign trade does not suffer under the hands of other foreign shipping masters. Definitely the shipping will generate and repatriate the much needed foreign exchange earned in international trade and commerce. A local board has already been established to learn the affairs of the shipping line.Finally, Sir, I would like to appeal for support to this hon. House in passing the Development and Recurrent Votes amounting to K£56.6 million, which includes K£43.8 million in form of Appropriations-in-Aid.to enable' the Ministry of Transport and Communications to continue discharging the functions and responsibilities entrusted to it in the best interest of our nation.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg tomove. </Newspeech></Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Mibei): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I rise to second the Motion on the Ministry of Transport and Communications. I think the Minister himself has given us a thorough explanation of the functions of his Ministry which, when I compare with other parts of the world, compel me to believe that the world has now become a small place. Through weather forecasts we can know of what ishappening elsewhere in the rest of the world. Through the air transport, wecan reach China in 14 hours and New York in 12 hours and this shows that weare competent to participate in this modern world.Sir, there are a few points I would like to emphasize on is on road safety, which the Minister himself addressed himself to. I am sure that we have campaigned a lot for road safety in this country a lot of times, but it appears we need to make our people more aware of the necessity of being careful when driving or walking along our roads. I would like to congratulate the singer of the song which says, "Dereva chunga maisha". I think that gentle man has done a lot of good. It is only important that the Ministry of Informat and Broadcasting should be making use of that record which was composed by that good Kenyan, with a view to improving on our road safety.Sir, everyday I watch the weather forecast over our television and I am very much impressed by the amount of knowledge imparted to us from our own satellite. I think the focus has been fairly accurate and I do not think there is any other place in Africa where we get such correct information. I would like to appeal to the Ministry to train some of our commentators further so that they can continue to give accurate information, which is actually required by the farmers and travellers as well.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the Ministry itself, I think the most popular corporation, which touches on nearly everybody is the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation. I would like to express my satis¬faction at the rate of progress in the Corporation, especially in the ruraltelecommunications, which the Corporation has done in the rural areas. I think the Corporation has been effective and I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the staff of the Corporation, led by its Managing Director,Mr. Ng'eny, for being committed and thorough in providing services to wananchi.I wish to inform the House that, of late my constituency has been a beneficiaryof the services of the Corporation in that the Item Post Office was automatedand the people there are very happy. Right now they are very happy to be usingthose facilities. I thank the .Minister for Transport and Communications himself,who came to officiate in the opening function.Sir, there is no reason whatsoever why other State corporations should not be as effective in the country if they followed the steps taken by the KenyaPosts and Telecommunications Corporation. What the directors and officers ofthese other corporations need to do, perhaps, is to steal the secret that theKenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation has been applying.On behalf of the Kericho people, I also wish to thank the Kenya Postsand Telecommunications Corporation for the "sports that they held in Kerichorecently and which boosted the Kericho Stadium to the level of being one of thebest in Western Kenya.	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we used to hear complaints aboutKenya Airways but, as the Minister has explained, there are now new developmentsin the Kenya Airways through additional aircraft and changes in the personnelsuch that we are now hearing that the Kenya Airways is making profits. It appearsto be working on its motto of being "The Pride of Africa". I have travelled inthe Kenya Airways aircraft and found that many people, especially. foreigners,like to travel in our airline. I would therefore appeal to  those concernedto improve the airline better because improved services can attract more touristsso that we earn some profits.The other area that needs more, training and knowledge is on maritimeservices. I am sure the Ministry is training staff and getting proper equipment.However, since we are even seeing war looming in the Gulf region, maritime know¬ledge is required in guarding our coastal safety. I hope the Ministry will keep to congratulate the staff of the Corporation, led by its Managing Director,Mr. Ng'eny, for being committed and thorough in providing services to wananchi.I wish to inform the House that, of late my constituency has been a beneficiaryof the services of the Corporation in that the Item Post Office was automatedand the people there are very happy.

We cannot only do that, n walking in the streets but showing knowledge in all the areas of our as well as the areas of the services we are supposed to render to this .I think the Kenya Railways Corporation is also catching up and. we get new equipment, I am sure, more people will be making use of the  With those few remarks, I beg to second. (Question proposed) </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.MAKAU :  Thank you very much mr. Temporary Deputy speaker The Ministry, whose Vote we are discussing, is very importantbecause its services touché on the social-economic developmentof this country as well as our security in that in it we have radarsand weather forecasting.One thing that managers in this country, especially thoseof state corporations, should do is to emulate the prudent managementof the state corporations in this Ministry. This Ministry'sstate corporations  Kenya Airways Corporation, Kenya RailwaysCorporation, Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporationand the Kenya Ports Authority  market services. For those whohave an idea of marketing know that marketing sendees in the worldis very difficult marketing services needs creativity.we have heard that the KAC, KRC,Kp& TC the KPAare now doing well. This is commendable because the world overrailways and air lines, even those  operated as privateconcerns, have difficulties competing in the market. Therefore,our corporations success is due to the good management of theirchief executives and I would like to take this opportunity tocommend them and urge managers of easily marketed products likeceramics to emulate these chief executives.Furthermore these corporations can assist us in othereconomic areas. The Kenya Airways Corporation should be preparedto compete for business in southern Africa now that South Africais opening up because many people will be travelling southwardsand also many airlines will move in to do business. I am concernedabout the role the MAC is playing in the promotion of tourism anahorticultural production in this country. Tourism in this countryis doing very well we have been told that in this year we arelikely to earn over Shs.10 billion from it. If the becomes  more creative and introduces a night or two nights stop-Over in Nairooi and Nombasa we can manage to improve on what airlines like  have beer; doing. Our airline can work closely with tour companies like the African Tours and Hotels so that travellers  stop in .Nairooi and Mombasa and spend money in our national parks, museums and so on. we should therefore design a scheme that will attract many southward-bound travellers to travel through Nairooi and in tills way we will take a large share of the tourism market.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, our airline can also assist a lot in the area of horticultural export promotion. we are facing a big problem of lack of cargo space; in spite of this problem we are now earning over Shs.2 billion from horticulture. </Newspeech>Dr.WAMEYO: on a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. may I point out that we have no quorum in the House?THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. .Wabuge): Your are right; ring the Division. Bell. </Newspeech>(The Division Bell was rung)<Newspeech>THE TEMPORARAY DEPUTY SPEAKER(Mr.WABUGE): Order we have a quorum now Mr.Makau continue. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>Mr.MAKAU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was saying thatwe should, promote the services of our Kenya Airways "by making sure thatmore cargo planes are introduced to the airline. WE should stop relying on foreignairlines if went our airline to be an important foreign exchange  earner in this COUNTRY.At the moment, we have beer, depending on  other airlines for transportationof our imports and we can be taken at ransom by those airlines, worse stillis that these foreign airlines are trying to charge more over and above therecommended charges. Therefore, I would like to appeal to the Kenya Airways totry and provide more cargo space in their services. At the moment, WE are earninga lot of h revenue from tourism, we find that horticultural exports is now becominga thing of the past in this country.Having said that, I would like to say something with regard to theKenya Posts and Telecommunications; Corporation. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,Sir, this Corporation has done a marvellous job and I would not like to go intodetails about the operations of this Corporation. I AN pleased to note thatthe Managing Director is present here in the Chamber and I would like to urge himto consider providing postal services to areas where major projects have been started.At the moment, out of the five locations in Mcooni Constituency, four have beensupplied with telephone services. However, there has been a problem.siat Kalawa Location where we have been seeing telephone posts for a long time\and every now and then we are being told that the Corporatio will instal a telephone exchange there, but nothing so far has been done. I would like to take this opportunity to urgethe Managing Director to complete this small project so that Mbooni Constituency is well served. As I have said, only one location of the five in my constituency which does not have telephone service and for this I really say thank you to the Corporation.Having said that, I would like to come to the Kenya Railways Corporation. I would like to say that a lot c has also been done by this Corporation and we are very happy to note that a lot is still being done. However, I would like to urge this Corporation to consider extending railways services to Hachakos Town so that industrial and commercial development in this town could be improved. As you remember , Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the railways was started just near Nachakos Town, but because of  some quarrel between two people  and those of us who now the history of ilachakos can bear me  Machakos Town failed, to get a railways extension. Therefore, I would like to urge the chief executive in the Ministry to look into this matter so that we can have a railways extension to Nachakos Town so that we can develop the town commercially and industrially.Mr. Temporary deputy Speaker, Sir, as I said earlier, the Kenya Ports Authority has done and still continues to do a lot of good work and we would like in their: to continue with this good work with a view to improving their services. As we know very soon, apartheid is going to be dismantled in South African and therefore, there will be quite a lot of competition. Therefore, we should  be ready for this competition by trying to improve on our services. However, as I have already indicated above, we are grateful for the marvelous work that this Corporation has continued to do. Above all, we know that all these achieve¬ments have come about as a result of peace and stability in this country. So, I would like to urge the hon. Members and other leaders in the country to make sure that they safeguard our peace and stability, is should emulate in our thoughts and deeds, what the President is always telling  us, As are talk in this house, we have always appreciate the good work that has been done by most of our parastatals, but we know very well that if there is no peace and stability, these parastatals could be highly affected, we are looking up these corporation to promote our export earning and we must encourage them in all ways.Mr. Temporary deputy Speaker, Sir, if all of us make sure  that there is peace and stability in cur constituencies, the total effect of this would be peace and stability in this country.with those few remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Mara kwa mara, mimi mwenyewe hutumia gari la moshi na huona kwamba chakula ni kile kile tu kila siku. Kila chakula huwa na curry. Tungetaka Shirika la Reli ligeuze mtindo huu na kuanza kupika vyakula vya'Kiafrika kwa sababu vyakula vyenye curry hutusumbua matumbo yetu. Kwa hivyo, ninamwomba Waziri aone kwamba' kila yeye na maofisa wake wanapopanga huduma za mashirika kama hili, wanazipanga kulingana na vile watu wetu wamebadilika. tuna vyombo vingine vya kulia, kama vileuma, ambavyo vilinunuliwa wakati wa Mfalme George na ingefaa tuvibadilishe. Tunataka kuwa na Kenya ya kisasa ili.kila anayesafiri kwa gari la moshi awe akijisikia kuwa huru, huku akisafiri na gari moshi la Kenya la kisasa.Ninafurahi kwa sababu Shirika la reli limeunda cheo kingine cha nahodha, na hili ni jambo-zuri kwa sababu tangu shirika hili lianzishe cheo hiki, hatupati taabu katika magariyetu ya moshi. Wizi humo umepungua na wale ambao hawakuwa na heshima wamekuwa nayo sasa. Cheo hiki kinafaa kudumishwa milele kwa' kuwa kinatusaidia sana.Kuhusu shirika la Posta na Simu, ningependa kusema kuwa hili ni shirika moja ambalo limetupa mafanikio mazuri sana katika Kenya. Ningeyaomba mashirika mengine yaige mfano huu. Sasa hivi tuna kiwanda kule Gilgil cha kutengeneza vifaa vya simu. Kile ambacho ningependa shirika hili lijue ni kwamba siku hizi ukipiga simu, unakuta watu wengine 10 wakizungumza katika laini hiyo hiyo ambapo unasikia siri zao mbaya mbaya. Kwa hivyo, ningeliomba shirika hili, kupitia kwako, lijaribu kurekebisha mitambo ya simu ili mtu mmoja anapozungumza na rafiki yake watu wengine wasiwe wakiyasikia mazungu8mzo hayo.Ningeomba kwamba pesa hizi tunazojadiliana juu yake leo zigawanywe sawa sawa. Kwa sababu shirika fulani lina mkubwa fulani, lisipewe kiasi kikubwa wakati ambapo lingine lililo na mtu mwingine linapopewa kiasi kidogo. Pesa hizi zinafaa kugawanywa sawa sawa kulingana na'miradi ya Wizara. Tumesema kwamba ingefaa tuimarishe maendeleo katika sehemu za mashambani, na tunaambiwa kwamba simu zitajaa katika sehemu hizi, lakini hivi sasa bado kuna mahali fulani amhako tunahitaji huduma hizi, kama vile kule kwangu, Kinango. Hivi majuzi tu tuliingiliwa na majambazi, na ikawa vigumu kwa mwananchi kutembea kutoka upande  mmoja hadi mwingine kwa vile hakuna mawasiliano ya simu huko. Kwa hivyo, ningeiomba Wizara hii inapofikiria kufanya mipango ya miji, iifikirie pia mipango ya sehcmu' za mashambani. Watu wa -huko, nasa machi-f.u. ha wengine ,• wanafaa kupewa sirau. Tungetaka huduma za simu zisambae kote hata kule Turkana ndipo mtu aliye huko akitaka kuongea na mtu mwingine hapa Nairobi asilazimike kuja hapa bali  aongee naye kwenye simu.Wizara hii ni nzuri na ninajua !wamba ndiyo "roho" ya Kenya-. Kama si kwa sababu ya Wizara hii, sisi, waheshimiwa. Wabunge, tungekuwa tukichelewa kufika Bungeni wakati ufaao kila siku.Kwa haya machache, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, naunga mkono.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Bornett): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to air my views on the Vote of this very important Ministry. This arm of the Government is very important to the common man. I would like to say that this Ministry has done a great job all-round, although there are still certain things that need to be looked into.First of all, I would like to say that the Kenya Railways Corporation has really changed for the good since the new Board—of—Governors was created and a new Chairman appointed. It is now common to hear trains moving both during the day and during the night. Previously, this movement had almost ceased. It is, indeed, very important for the Corporation to be strengthened because under the circumstances under which we now find ourselves as far as the price of petrol and diesel is concerned  this price has gone up and there is nothing we can do about it  is time we thought more about the train.(Members applauded as hon. Dr. Wameyo walked out of the Chamber) We should think more about the train because we do not have to built new railways every day because the rail lines that were built before are there for use at all times and all we need to do is to improve or repair it from time to time. On the other hand, we have to use a lot of money in building new roads and repairing old Therefore, it is common sense to make more use of our trains in order to re—route the ever-increasing traffic on our roads, thereby causing havoc, death and so on. It is important to consolidate the Kenya Railways Corporation and give it more, support and .money. Most Government and parastatal goods are transported by rail. The private sector, too, should be encouraged to make more use of the railways.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would now like to turn to the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation, which has done a marvelous job. Besides the Kenya Rower and Lighting Company, which has done an equally good job, this Corporation is excelling. This is because of teamwork, with people trusting one another. We shower our congratulations on the management of the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation  the Minister. for Transport and Communications and his Ministry as a whole. There is, however, one thing that needs to be looked into which is bothering our people and the users of the telephone apparatus. We do not know exactly how the figures we receive at the end of each month are computed. One finds it very difficult to challenge these bills because when we write letters to the Corporation, we are told, "You have to pay the money." In most cases, you will find that your telephone bills include a call to places such as Bangladesh whereas you have never been to this country nor do you know anybody. Included in these bills, you will also find calls to Bombay, Italy, England and so on, when you have no friends in these places. In fact, I have a neighbour who was charged for an alleged call to California, in which he knew nobody. Something sinister is happening in telephone billing. As a matter of fact, I am told that there is somebody in Ashleigh who is doing a roaring business. All that you need to do is to pay him Shs.l00/= and speak to people in any part of the world. Who is being charged for this? It is we, the poor fellows who do not know how these charges are worked out. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we must prepare bills but these bills must be fair. Bills must reflect what one has actually used with regard to the Kenya Ports Authority, I would like to say that although they are trying to serve this country there is a certain amount of corruption in the Authority. I know a certain Member of Parliament here who imported some  goods and he had to pay KShs.120,000/- to a conman because someone in the Kenya Ports Authority has got an Official Stamp which he uses to collect money instead of the Authority collecting that money. This matter should be looked into. I can see the Minister shaking his head but I can lay the papers on the Table to prove that the money did not go to the Ministry but went into the pocket of someone. I am not blaming the ministry. I am just saying that there are conmen in the Authority. I say this because KShs.120,000/- is enough to build one good primary school. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE Assistant  MINISTER OFFICE OF VICE-PEESIDEITT AND MINISTER OF FINANCE (MR. Kariuki): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The hon. Member has made very startling revelations that, he knows of a conman who is collecting money instead of the Government collecting the money. Since this is a  very important issue can the Assistant Minister give a proof of this so that this man can be arrested? It is a terrible thing for an individual to collect money instead of the Treasury collecting that money. </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND HOUSING (Sir. Bomett): Sir. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would, have liked to do that "but already hon. Nathubuti has taken steps; the man has "been arrested and he is being dealt with.I would now like to touch on the Kenya Airways Limited. The Kenya Airways is improving quite a lot. I do not want to repeat the question of lateness because at one time one would have thought that our aircraft were like matatus- because lateness. But I believe  that this is history now. I am sure that things have improved and we must give credit where it is due. I think that Kenya Airways is going to fly higher and higher. We even hear that it is planning to fly South; we say why not? This is because we want money to employ our people. We were not actually fighting South Africa for the asking of fighting. But we say that if they free our people and accept that our people are equal to them and that they have a right to vote  one man one vote  we should share the cake; not only from South Africa but from all parts of the world.Mr. Temporary “Deputy Speaker, Sir,  I would like to say that  transport in Nairobi is becoming more andmore hectic every day. This is becoming a matter of great concern. I am not a Member of Parliament from Nairobi but I belong to this City nonetheless because it  belongs to  all of us. We should plan quickly about  what we are going to do about this problem. They tow away vehicles which are wrongly parked and that is very bad. This is caused by lack of parking space. When you are coming from Langata in the morning it takes you two to three hours to travel a distance of only three kilometres. I do not know of any solution to this .problem but I am sure that the Ministry of Transport Communications has people whose work it is to look for solutions to Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry should look into the possibility of introducing electric trams in Nairobi to ease traffic problems. Are they more costly than the Nyayo Buses? This avenue should be explored immediately because sooner or  later  it will become extremely difficult to move within the City. we should even consider the possibility of building satellite towns around the City of Nairobi. I hope that the Minister will find a solution to	this problem. Ifhe finds a solution to this problem he will be the most popular Minister in Kenya in 10 years to come and we will  all remember him.with those few remarks, I support the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER PGR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT (Mr. Otwsri): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me a chance to support this very important m Motion.I will start with a word of appreciation to his Excellency the President for the Speech he delivered yesterday during the Moi Day celebrations. I particularly note with appreciation his permission to allow the proposed scheme of service for non-graduate and technical teachers to discussed. This scheme will now be discussed,  considered and eventually it will be implemented I would like to thank him very much for this because as you are all aware teachers had virtually started to go slow. Once again our President has shown that he is above petty issues, temptations and human weaknesses. This is because despite the annoying steps taken by the Kenya National Union of Teachers, he has allowed discussions on that scheme of service to continue. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir, I would also like to thank the Chairman of the Kenya National Union of Teachers, Mr. Katumanga, for guiding the KNUT Secretariat to a patriotic decision to withdraw the strike notice that they had issued. I would like the step the teachers have taken to be noted as a good example to all of us particularly those who have been cautioned by His Excellency the President. many of us have been cautioned by His Excellency the President but we have not been good enough to humble ourselves and take his caution. I think the teachers have shown a very good example by humbling themselves and taking the President's caution. They have showed that they have absolute respect for the President and for this nation. So, I would like to appeal to all those who have been cautioned and those who will be cautioned by the President in future to emulate the example of teachers.I know that we have said a lot of things about loose tongues. But I think something should also be said about the "stiff" tongues. In fact we have very many people with stiff and two-pronged tongues in this country; stiff  tongues that do not even allow the mouths to shut. Those who accuse the Government daily of various misdeeds should also shut up. why should they stick out their stiff and two-pronged tongues out all the time? They will praise the President today but tomorrow they will say completely different " things. So, I would call upon those people to ± emulate the example of teachers and take heed whenever they are cautioned against certain things. I do not need to mention them because they know them se1ves. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Minister for Transport and Communications for the work he is doing for us in this country. He has not only run his Ministry of Transport and Communications effectively and efficiently but he has  as Minister for Transport and Communications communicated very, very clearly and articulately on national issues. In fact as the Secretary-General of Kanu he has been very  articulate and clear. He has guided us and he has  see  proved that he is areal Minister for Transport and Communications. Since he has brough with him a large team of officers from his Ministry I hope that these officers will try to emulate their Minister so theour system of transport and communications continues to be effective and efficient.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Minister for Transport and Communications for what his officers are doing in Susia District. I would like to state that maintenance of roads in Busia District during the last two years has been generally good The maintenance and the opening of  new roads in Susia District has been noticeable.  At least, for the last two years; I have not heard of the Ministry of Transport and Communications running short of fuel or having breakdowns in tractors and so forth, and that shows that something is happening. So, we thank the Ministry for responding to the needs of the Busia people, who had been hard hit prior to the last.two years. We are extremely happy now and we would like to thank the Minister for that.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, mmay I note here that the matatu and bus fares that hon. Members have referred to in this House are not just exorbi¬tant but frustratingly so. We, from Western Kenya, cannot travel home as frequentlyas we used to do. We love home ingo as the Luhyas say  but the current matatu and bus fares cannot allow us to visit those areas frequently. I believe that there must be somebody trying to keep on pushing matatu and bus fares further and further up; there must be somebody who must be making a big deal out of this because the excuse cannot be the rise in oil prices or even spare parts. The Nyayc. Bus Corporation has shown that it is possible to run very economically with fairly reasonable fares. So, I would like to appeal to the Minister not to hope that Kenyan transporters will take the example of Nyayo Buses and regulate their fares acordingly. I would like to ask him to consider direct means of regulating fares and not hope that the example set by Nyayo buses will be enough. We commend the exEiaple of the Nyayo buses, but I think we need a more direct approach to matatu and bus fare's otherwise some Kenyans from Mombasa, Kisumu, Nyeri and other areas may never see their homes again.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to go ahead and remind the Minister that the Busia people' are still awaiting the tarmacking of the Mumias- Busia road to connect at with Kakamega, which is our provincial headquarters. Besides that, I would like the Minister to consider a possibility of enabling the Busia people to fight against the tse tse fly menace by enabling access to certain infected areas. We do not expect the Uganda Government to take as much are taking to  the tse tse fly menace. Tse tse flies continue to fly in from Uganda, and the only way to deal with tse' tse flies is to have access roads to the infected areas. I would, therefore, like to call up the Ministry of Transport and Communications to come  to our aid.On the question of roads in Busia District, Sir, I would like to appeal to the Minister for Transport and Communications to note that</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Kamotho): On a point of information, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I want to inform the hon. Assistant Minister that road construction works come under the Ministry of Public Works, whose Vote will come after this one. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Yes, I think the Minister is corect. I have been listening carefully to what the hon. Assistant Minister has said, and he should ralise that we have the Ministry of Transport and Communications and the Ministry of Public Works which deals entirely with roads. The two Ministries are completely different. When you talk about tarmacking of roads, that comes under the Ministry of Public Works, what is before the House today is the Vote of the Ministry of Transport and Communications and we should stick to it. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I do not agree with the hon. Minister because Ministries have collective responsi¬bility. He should take the points down and hand them over to the Ministry concerned</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): No, no. We cannot discuss the matters of the Ministry of Public Works within the Ministry of Transport and Communications. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT (Mr. Otwani): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to apologies for the slip of the tongue. I was derailed by the idea of roads Coming-back to the Ministry of Transport and Communications, I would like to say something on the question of telephones. I wish to thank the Kenya The Busia line has become fairly clear of late, but I would like to request the Corporation to be moving in fast whenever there are breakdons. Nowadays, whenever there is a breakdown of a line, it takes the Corporation employees a very long time to repair it. I am told that not all maintenance material is readily avail¬able.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAHIHU: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chance to support this very important Motion.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as my colleagues have said, this Ministry deals with some very important parastatal organizations which are the back bone of our economy. Touching on the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation, I wish to point out that this Corporation has taken a great initiative in establishing the factory to manufacture telephone equipment at Gilgil. When we make a word of praise to a corporation, it is important that this particular corporation should take a very serious note on the general, complaints on telephone bills.. I know that we have a computer system, but a computer will produce an answer that has been given. So, I would like to urge the Kenya Posts and Tele¬communications Corporation to take a serious note on general complaints on people1s bills. Let me not waste too much time on that particular aspect. I am sure that we are honoured today because the Managing Director of the Corporations is here listening to the House and our comments.Having said that, let me touch on the Kenya Airways. Kenya Airways has been described as the pride of Africa. This country has made great contributions to buy new aircraft for the Kenya Airways Corporation. It is, therefore, very important that those charged with the responsibility of maintaining Kenya Airways will live to those expectations. I am particularly concerned with the marketing system that has been used over the years. I travel quite a lot. I use air bus too often. I more or less travel to Mombasa every day But it is many painful to find an airbus leaving Nairobi to London half empty or leaving. London to Nairobi half empty. Kenya Airways has been given new aircraft and it is the best equipped airline in Africa. It is even better equipped than some airlines in Europe. We are very grateful that the Kenya Government has given support to buy new aircraft for Kenya Airways. Mr. Nyagah and his team are here, and we expect them to work round the clock to maintain that reputation so that, as we go along and as the old aircraft get out of the air-space and the new ones take place, we should seemore profit than we have had before.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me comment on the Kenya Ports Authority. There has been a general complaint that Dar-es—Salaam port is better than the port of Mombasa. I do not believe in that. I know the coastal ports fairly well. It does not mean that when South Africa opens up for use by Kenya the Mombasa port will have a greater competition. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is very important for the Kenya Ports Authority to. keep the marketing and tariffs in order, as well as competitive, so that we do. not have Dar Es Salaam, or other ports in East and Central Africa having better tariffs than ours. We live in a world of competition. I know that there have been general efforts to divert cargo that is normally transported through Kenya to other land-locked countries to other ports other than through Mombasa. I am appealing to the Ministry to be on the lookout so that this area of the Kenya Ports Authority is looked into so that v/e are competitive enough.On the question of railways, I do not think we have added any new railway lines since we attained our Independence. The farmers would like to transport their goods to Mombasa and so on through the rail system. Recently there was a suggestion that all tea should be transported to Mombasa through the railway system. However, the railway system is notable to load the tea at the various collection points as the current machinery is not suitable. I am appealing to the Minister to ensure that in future the railway system is adopted so that it can transport all the tea from Kisii, Meru, and all the other parts of the country and transport it to Mombasa. We would then be able to move from the road transport to the rail transport. It is very costly these days to transport some of these goods by using lorries. So, it is important, as prices of almost all commodities continues to go up, particularly in view of the Gulf crisis which is going to push oil prices very high, we should now endeavour to use our railway system.I am grateful to note, as it has been said before, that all these issues depend on whether our security will remain the same. I join all Kenyans to support His Excellency the President. I also support his yesterday's speech and to urge all Kenyans to stand up and be counted in defense of this country. I never realised, and I was most surprised to hear that Koigi wa Warnwere came into Kenya secretly armed. This is an issue that Kenyans should not joke about any longer. We cannot accept that our country is going to be subverted by these elements. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, on 17th June, this year,we had a meeting of our church in Thogoto- where the Presbyterian Church of East Africa (P.C.E.A.) pastors prayed for Kanu. They were celebrating 30 years since the formation of the church in Kenya. My church has been under attacks both loally and overseas, that we do not pray for Kanu. Let me say that P.C.E.A. is not a church of subversion; it is a church of Christ as He is the head of zhat church. Christ did not come to this earth for subversion; Christ came to earth and even said that we should "give Caesar what is his"  We are being "crucified" by some few disgraced politicians that our church, P.C.E.A. is not vocal enough to speak against the Government.I am standing here to tell all those disgraced politicians that the P.C.E.A church is a church of Christ and we are not going to talk against the Kenya Government. If they want us to ts lk against the Kenya Government, they should go elsewhere. We have also been told that we have not produced many pastors and that out of nearly 300 ministers of the church, it is only one who is speaking. Let me inform the House that we know of some overseas people who have cut financial support to the P.C.E.A. church because we are not shouting loud enough. All these things are beign done so that we can rise against the Government. There is no difference between the church and the Government; we are one and the same and those people should know that.Sir, all these budgets we are passing in this House would be of no value if trouble starts in Kenya tomorrow. What is happening in Rwanda and Liberia? They do not talk about the budgets The same problem is facing the people of South Africa. All the developments that we want through the passing of such budgets depend on stability. We are grateful to President moi  Yesterday he said it very clearly, that from now on there will be no jokes. We would like, to continue supporting him and also advise those who are not members of the P.C.E.A church to keep out of the church. Let them go to their churches if they want to pray Sir, this issue makes me very angry and I feel that the time has come when I have to tell them that we support President Moi and Kanu, as the ruling Party and everything that is constitutional in this country. This is not a matter of guessing. We can no longer keep quiet when people come and try to subvert our beloved Government. President Moi is elected by all of us and there is no shortcut. He is there to stay until God wishes, and nobody else. He is elected to say in power and guide us.With those few remarks, I beg to support the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for having recognised me. I would also like to thank hon. Kamotho, the Minister for Transport and Communications, for the way he has moved his Ministry's Vote. A lot of development has already been carried out in this Republic and we expect to see more. In any case, wherever that development has taken place, we expect such development to be extended to other places, too.Let me start by touching on the Kenya Posts and TelecommunicationsCorporation. This parastatal body has done a lot. I heard last year that theaim of the Ministry was to see that Subscriber Trunk Dialing services (STD) wasspread to almost every division in the country. This implementation is beingawaited very eagerly by the people. This is because we have divisions in thecountry which have a lot of potential in that immediately these services areavailable, a lot will start to happen there. I can cite Msambweni where thereare a lot of tourist activities. There is no problem in Diani as there areSTD services there. However, when you go past Msambweni, where we have othertourist hotels coming up, as well as cottages and other developments, we havelost a lot of markets because it is difficult to do any bookings for the hotelsand lodges in those areas because of shortage of telephone facilities. Normally,it takes you hours to get through to Mombasa on telephone through the MsambweniTelephone Exchange. Sometimes the lines are broken indefinitely and it has been very difficult to utilise the existing telephone services there. Sir, the Corporation is currently erecting an exchange that will house the STD service at Msambweni and I hope it will hasten the exercise so that the people of Msambweni can have those essential services being rendered to them. In this area we have hotels like those	in Halindi but tourists210 longer want to  stay there they cannot get to their hones in europe, Asia and so on. It would be veryhelpful if the corporation ensured that that building very STD facility is completed soon. Once the SID service is available, the manual telephones in KIkoneni, Ishimba Hills and Pongwe Kidinu Location should be replaced.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir, Coast Province is one of the richest regions in this Republic: In it you find the Indian Ocean which is full of fish, cattle, sheep and goats. we also have the Eilindini Harbour there, which is  doing a lot for this country. In fact, we should give all possible support to this harbour so that it provides efficient services. I am surprised when I am told that some ships move away from Celandine Harbour to Dor es Salaam: sometimes we have been told that one reason why ships shift from harbour is that our anchor charges are too high.I think we should get more and more international shipping lines to use our harbour.One thing that might force shippers away from our harbour is the kind of service we render to businessmen. we have been told that sometimes cargo would remain unloaded for a long time. I would suggest that the port employees work a little larder to avoid a situation where shippers feel frustrated. I am happy that the current container system has curbed a lot of theft that used to take	place when goods came in pieces.While the Roads Branch department is doing a good job I wish to inform the Minister that the road licence fee is too high. This fee should not be so  because of motor cars is not a luxury Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would likewith hon. Mahihu that churches in this country have becomepolitical when they are supposed to be providing spirt spirit. services to the public. You will notice we Muslims have no evil of the Government, Kanu or the President we are 100 behind the President, we would like cur fellow Christians to us. Alternatively, since churches have become so politer urge Christians to turn to islam so that we can all be go supporters of the Government and the President. In fact, now there is something wrong with the Christian relion; I why present day Christians do not follow the teachings ofMR. MANG'OLI: on a point of information. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Since hon. Mwamcandi is a Muslim  know we have Christian religious leaders and the itself and that the two are different: It is the who are preaching anti-Government but the religion itself contain anti-Government teachings. </Newspeech><Newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Chesire): On a point of order. Mr. Temporary Deputy speaker Is the hon. Member in order to imply that Christians are n loyal to the Government? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MWAMABANDI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  only agreeing with what hon. Mahihu said. Christians in Church’s and other Christians are talking too much -against Government and that is why  i am inviting them from	is am.with those few remarks beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Kariuki): Thank you very much, Deputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to air my  First of all, I would like to take this ouoortunit" to thank theministry of Transport and Communications for the very good work ithas done; by "good work" I am referring to what I have witnessed.A few years ago the people did not imagine that they would haveSTD service in their area. At the moment, as I speak here, peoplein one of the remotest villages in Nakuyu, namely Ithar.ga, can dialdirectly. Congratulations to the MinistryMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, having said I mustpoint out that I understand there has been problems of financialconstraints, which have hindered for a very long time honoring of promises for provisionof the STD services in other places. Now that his Excellency thePresident ordered all the state corporations, private companies andeven Government ministries to pay whatever they owe the KG? TC Ihope that the XP & TO will now embark on fulfilling the promisesit made earlier,I would also like to compliment and congratulate theKP & TC staff .for their courtesy, the way they speak to the customerthe -way they handle customers' problems, which is very important.I must say that the NP & TC managing Director is even one of themost accessible head of a state corporation; this is very important.But, unfortunately. we have in our state corporations some .verybig-headed chief executives who cannot be approached by an hon Member of Parliament when an hon. member goes to see them they think theyare being disturbed. I must tell them that when a Member ofParliament goes to a public office he does not go there on his ownBehalf but on behalf of thousands of Kenyans and no one should eversay that he is too busy to attend to Kenyans. Then you do that to an hon Member of this House, you refuse to attend to thethousands of Henyans who have elected him to this House.Mr. Temporary deputy Speaker, Sir, coming to the Kenya Airways,I would like to congratulate them for the good work they have done. A fewmonths ago, we had this problem of  flights being delayed, cancelled andso on. However, during the last few months, there has been a tremendousimprovement in the services being rendered by the Henya Airways. Indeed, nowthis airline has become the pride of Africa However, there is one pointwhich I would like the airline to take into consideration. As we all know,about a  week ago, we had a very sad episode when horticultural produce worththousands of shillings were lost at the airport just because there was no CarrieThere a was a misunderstanding between the Ministry of Transport and Communicateand maybe the Ministry of Agriculture and certain airlines Consequently, a lotof horticultural produce was left to perish, and I do not third:that Henya ha can afford this kind of wastage. Therefore, I would like to urgethe Ministry of Transport and Communications and the Ministry of Agriculture,to get together and discuss this problem together. This is a problem whichalready is bothering farmers particularly because most of them base their livelihood on growing horticultural crops, which are in fact, taking over fromcoffee as being the single most important produce in Henya. I do hope thatthis problem will be discussed and sorted out once and for all.Mr. Temporary deputy Speaker, Sir, a lot has been said about theHenya Railways Corporation. It is very sad as one hon. Member said that we havenot seen extensions of railway being done since Independence and I think it ishigh time that we awoke to the needs of  improved railway system. He havefor example, the line from Hairclip to nanyuki which is virtually left to lieidle and all you see is a train passing once in a while pulling a few wagonsand carrying very few goods It is high time that we started studying the possibilities of using trains for our computer services. People could, for give this point a very serious consideration.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, a let has also been, said withregard to the unpaid telephone bills and I really need to repeat all this.I would however like to say this is a recurring problem everywhere. I personallywas a victim of false telephone bills when I received a telephone till of Shs.10,000/- which was purportedly made by me to Paraguay and Brazil The onlytime I have ever thought about Paraguay or Brazil is only when I have seenthese names on the world map and when I received a bill purporting that I didmake telephone calls to these places, 1.2 was particularly surprised. I thinkthe post office should make sure that they sort out this problem once and for all.	Mr. Temporary deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunityto also thank His Excellency the President for has the speech which he madeyesterday. In this speech, he did make it quite clear that there is going tobe no playing about from new henceforth. He said this because there are	certain people in this country who are out  to run the peace and stability that we haveenjoyed over the years. He have heard of people like Hoigi Hamwere think can  from Herman3 by force. I would liks to take this opportunityto tell them that they are day and night dreaming Neuyans bill never acceptthe idea of giving up power by force. He are a democratic country and we aregoing to support our President by our "blood and lives if needs  Therefore;I do stand here to condemn all those people wherever they are hiding, namely,in public offices bore he s and so or to come cut and support the Government.If they think about sabotaging the Government, they are net just fighting the President. but with all Kenyans. I would like to warn them that all Henyansare reader to fight them to the last man.we have heard of  people, be they politicians or church people, talking, of in this country. I would like to km tell these people that we have no ebos in Henya and if they know where they are, then they should come out and tellus where these Ebos are in Henya. I am saying this because we do not know an know that we have associated ourselves from such ill thoughts. At the moment, Kenya has enough problems and we need not create other unnecessary problem, that we should be discussing no is not petty issues. Some people in this country should their ambitions and be satisfied to be what they are. I am saying this because we have real problems in Kenya and we should be spending our energy talking about the problems of unemployment and other economic problems in this country. He should address ourselves to the development of industries in this country, we should be cracking our brains day and night  thinking ofhow to solve these very major problems. For example, how are we going tosort out the unemployment problems in this country. How are we go to  industries in the rural areas? He must realize that these petty politics and disharmony between this group and the other, is not going to lead us to anywhere. Therefore, I would like to appeal to ail Kenyans to start a new chapter. Let us think about the real problems that are affecting this country„ Kenya has in the past survived not because of the rich minerals or other resources that certain other countries have, but because of good political  management.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have, been having good. political management in Kenya coupled with good administration and this is why Henya has survived unlike many other countries which are endowed with vast resources Today, there are countries in Africa with a lot of minerals and ideal and vast agricultural they are still begging for food. This is because they lack proper political management. Peace and stability is our only asset and we are not prepared to give it up once we give up this one asset	we shall be lost. He shall be completely finished whether we believe it or not. God gives us and therefore, let us show him gratitude by thanking him. However, we shall not be thanking him by doing or saying anything that is likely to cause chaos and disorder in this country. If we do or say anything that is likely to course bloodshed in this country, we shall be telling God that we are so ungrateful to him for what he has done to Kenya and I pray earnestly that this bill never be the case with those few remarks, Mr. Temporary deputy Speaker, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr.KILIKU: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary- Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving  this chance to support this vote. First of all, I would like to thank the Minister for the way in which he moved this vote. I would like to thank him for particularly being able to give details regarding the operations of the various parastatals related to this particular Ministry. I would like to take this opportunity to than all these corporations which arc under the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the very good work that they have been doing. They have provided some kind of a working force for the Ministry and  we must encourage them to continue with their good work.Having said that, I would like to however appeal to the kenya airways Corporation to improve on their timing.  Some hon. Members have complained about delayed  and cancellation of flights. Sometimes this can be very embarrassing particularly when you find passengers already seated in the plane only to be told that the flight has been cancelled. I would like to call upon the Managing Director to see that this problem is eradicated once ark for all.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to remove the  impression which has been made in the past that parastatals do not do well. This is a very wrong impression and I third: each corporation should be viewed separately, I Know there are some corporations that are doing very well and therefore, that impression should be done away with. There have been allegations made that certain ships wanting to anchor at the part of Mombasa have been directed to the pert of Ear-es-Salaam. I being the Member for the area which includes the Mombasa Port would like to refute these allegations. They go by season because this is a seasonal business in which sometimes some countries may have a very few ships calling at the port depending on the prevailing season. At. the moment; there are many vessels in the port. The strange thing is that those who criticise the port when there is no business do not praise it when there is a lot of business as is now the case.One other thing is that it was wrong for the Government to say that containers in transit should be opened at the port, and this is what caused business through Mombasa to be very costly. This was not a fault on the part of the Kenya Ports Authority's management. We shouldnot open all the containers that are in transit on their way to Sudan, Uganda and elsewhere because this delays business and makes it too expensive. However, the containers coming to this country should be opened at the port in order to check on what they bring here.I must thank the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (K.P.T.C.) for having build a small post office in my constituency. I appeal to the Managing Director of the K.P.T.C. to open this post office in Changamwe and see for himself how my people will appreciate his Corporation's good work. I also thank His Excellency the President for directing those people who have not paid this Corporation its dues to do so by 15th November, 1990. However, the K.P.T.C. should not wait until the President comes in; instead, it should have some means of ensuring that all services it renders are paid for in time because this involves public money.With regard to the Kenya Railways Corporation, I think road transport is very expensive at the moment, and the Minister should look for a lot of money with which to support the Kenya Railways, which will provide us with cheap transport. If you go to Nairobi Railway Station now, you will find all the passenger trains there full because people cannot afford to travel by road. So, the Minister should address himself "to the Kenya Railways.Coming to the Kenya National Shipping Line, which was recently established, I would like to SAY that the way this Line has been established is not all that encouraging. We must be very careful with the UNIMAR of West Germany because the people who operate the shipping line re not the right ones to deal with since they are the ones who. contributed to the collapse of the former East African National Shipping Line with whom I was working. Although the owners of the UNIMAR hold only 30 per cent of the business at the port, we must be very careful with them because if we follow their system of business, we will not go far. The system of buying slot on board is, I think, a bit expensive. So, the Kenya Ports Authority should look for a way of canvassing for cargo because if it buys slot on board and it does not fill the space given with goods, this becomes rather too expensive. Being a country with marine facilities, we have been losing a lot of business to the tune of 40 per cent of our export earnings and a similar percentage in import earnings whereas we are supposed to control this percentage, leaving 20 per cent to what we call "cut—throat" competition. Unless we have a system of ensuring that we have enough cargo to export and import, we cannot benefit from the present system of business. I think the Minister should look for money to enable us to have our own vessels. At the moment, we buy slot on board from foreign companies which may not be co-operative. With our own vessels, we can control the present system. we should also have our calling port in Europe where we can canvass for imports coming into the country, rather than doing this through the telephone.Even if we open business with South Africa, Mombasa Port will not be affected by this business. I heard that the Kenya Airways is thinking of opening business with South Africa. We should not, however, do this. These statements are embarrassing to this House. If there is any intention to open business with South Africa, this must be brought to the House for debate because the President of South Africa has only promised to install the system of "one maui, one vote" and he has not yet implemented it. We do not know whether he is going to abolish the apartheid system of government. It is not. good to talk all the time about </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Nassir) Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda. Ningependa kumwelekeza njia iliyo ya haki mwenzangu, mhe. Kiliku. . Jambo hili la kufungua biashara na Afrik-a Kusini lilisemwa lakini Serikali ilipoona- kuwa jambo Hili nalikuwa zuri, Waziri wa Mashauri ya Kigeni na Uhusiano wa Kimataifa akatoa taarifa na kusema kwamba hatuna nia ya kuanzis'na biashara na Afrika Kusini. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I very much thank my Kanu Chairman of Mombasa for this information. I did not read the statement .he has .just mentioned. .Thank you very much for that.However, I would like to thank the Minister for Transport and Communications and also request him to give part of the money his officers collect at the toll station in Mombasa. to Mombasa Municipal Council to enable it to repair the roads there. We pay a lot of money at this toll station, but the roads in Mombasa are almost impassable. I think we should have a system of giving some of this money to Mombasa Municipal Council for repair of roads so that we may see the usefulness of paying toll charges. This money must also be accounted for.We are going to vote this money to last the Ministry 12 months. If the Minister brings Supplementary Estimates here before June, 1991, he should explain why he needs extra money and what he will have done with this money that we are now going to vote.With these few points, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Maiyani): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for according me this opportunity to make my contribution to this most important Motion. I would, first of all, like to congratulate the Minister on his most successful work. I am particularly very grateful because my constituency is one of the beneficiaries of his efforts to provide the subscriber trunk dialing facilities to the public. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for a long time Mukurweini has remained behind due to lack  of telephonecommunication. I hope that  within the foreseeable future the Minister for Transport and Communications will visit Mukurweini to officially inaugurate our STD facility.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, regarding the Kenya Railways, I would like to point out that our railway system is very.. much out of date. Our railway gauge and our operational capacity are more or less the same as those established by the colonial authorities back in the 1900s. we.are using ..the same gauge.when in fact the needs of our railway services have multiplied since that time. For instance the railway services long the Nanyuki Nairobi Line are very poor; the train is very slow. It is mainly a goods train line. But you will find that people from that area need passenger train services.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, you will also find that the City of Nairobi has expanded from what it was 30 years ago and traffic congestion is terrible and it is becoming worse every day. I am not being critical but I am just giving constructive suggestions. It is high time we considered providing Nairobi with an underground railway system. Underground railway systems are  common in major cities in europe. we should start looking for ways and means of financing such a project. we should even look for foreign donors because I think the project is most worthwhile. If necessary we can form a company partly owned by the  Government and partly owned by other investors just like the Eurotunnel in the English Channel. At one time that project was thought to be an impossible task but they are now about to link HIS	Minrdon WITH HE join ment of Europe by a railway line passing under the English Sea. That one is a very expensive project. But here in Nairobi we do not have to cross any sea. So, I think this kind of a project is worth undertaking. With regard to Kenya Airways, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have one humble suggest suggestion to make. Since our international airports are becoming the most important airports in this region of Africa, it is high time we considered building a very good hotel within the environs of the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to cater for passengers in transit. In this way Kenya Airways will be able to earn extra foreign exchange from . passengers who would otherwise spent uncomfortable nights at the Airport. Sometimes they  into the City and spend that little money in their own hotels. This is because I believe that most of the hotels in this country are owned by foreigners. There is a good hotel at Heathrow Airport in the United Kingdom. That hotel is owned by the British Airways and the money earned by that hotel remains in that  country. So, the Kenya Airways  should consider this suggestion which I think is quite appropriate. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like congratulate our beloved President because of his exemplary leadership which is not equaled by any other  on this continent of Africa. I would also like to support Government's efforts to deal with these foolish Kenyan dissidents who are trying to cause chaos in this country. They have their own  selfish motives. Mr. Koigi warmer was rejected by Nakuru people but he was not satisfied that he had. lost that leadership acumen. He is not really a leader. How can we accept him? How can he be supported by anybody in this country? He has been talking about given by the people. .Democracy does not come through the force of arms.  by the sword will be killed by the sword. Those words by the Lord Jesus Christ. Mr. Wamwere should know that kill by the. sword shall die by the sword.Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy  Speaker I beg to support the Motion. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr.- Nassir) : Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, yangu ni .kuzungumza maneno machache juu ya Wizara hii ambayo ina faida kwa Kenya. Hii ni.Wizara arabayo inatilia nguvu Kenya ili tupate shule, hospital! an kila ki.tu. Kama ingekuwa ni mimi kuchagua ni Wizara gani ningefanya kazi, ningeenda kumsaidia Waziri wa Uchukuzi na Mawasiliano. Lakini sina ruhusa kujichagulia Wizara nitakayofanya kazi.Bw. Naibu Spika, ukitaka kuijua Kenya, basi iangalie Wizara hii. Ukiangalia katika Shirika la Ndege la Kenya.kuna Bw. Nyagah; ukifika katika Kenya:Ports Authority kunaye Bw. Okundi; katika Shirika la Simu na Mawasiliano kunaye Bw. Ng'eny na katika Shirika la Reli unampata Profesa Musuva. This is the Kenya we want; si Kenya ya bunduki. Ukiangalia katika Wizara hii kila kabila linawakilishwa. This is the Kenya we want; si wale akina fulani ambao wanataka the Kenya we want of guns. We want this type of Kenya ambapo makabila mbali mbali yanafanya kazi pamoja kututafutia pesa ili tupate shule, hospitali na kadhalika. Hakuna te'na mambo ya kusifu; haya ni mambo ya kweli. Shirika la Ndege la Kenya leo limekuwa balozi wetu kwa sababu watoto walioko katika shirika hilo ni wa kila kabila. Ule urembo wa kila kabila katika Kenya unawakilishwa katika shirika.hili. Hata Shirika-la Ndege la Kenya lina kanda za video na unaposafiri unaonyeshwa picha za Kenya. Hivyo, Mzungu akisafiri katika ndege la Shirika la Ndege la Kenya anajua kweli anaenda Kenya. Hilo ni jambo kubwa.Pia, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, Shirika la Ndege la Kenya limerekebisha jinsi ya vile ndege' zake zinavyosafiri. Ukiambiwa kwamba ndege yako inaondoka saa moja kamili na uende saa moja na dakika tano, basi utapata umeachwa. They are keeping time. Kwa hivyo, hata kama intewezekana, Wizara hii ingeongezewa pesa ili iweze kutuhudumia vizuri zaidi.Kuhusu mambo ya Kenya Ports Authority, nataka kuwaambia wale wasiojua kwamba shirika hili ndilo shamba la watu wa Mkoa wa Pwani. Nataka kuwahakikishia. wananchi kwamba baada ya miaka.10 shirika hili litakuwa na bandari.. kubwa sanakwa sababu kutakuwa na kazi zaidi. Wale wanaoleta vifaa vya kujenga viwanda wote wanatumikiwa na shirika hili. Kwa hivyo, watu wataajiriwa kazi. Kuhusu mambo ya shipping, wale wanaochagua kampuniya shipping si wajinga; ni watu walio na akili zao. Je, yule Mkenya atakayedanganywa na Mzungu yuko wapi? Sijui ni Mzungu gani atakayemdanganya Bw. Kamotho au Mtukufu Rais. Wametazaraa na wakaona ni lazima wawe-na shipping line yao wenye'we kwa sababu wanajua kampuni hiyo inaweza kuleta pesa ngapi. Na lcwa sababu ya amaaa kwa kuona vile meli zinavyoingia na kutoka, nao watu wengine wataka kufanya biashara hiyo hiyo. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kuhusu Shirika la Posta na Simu, nataka kusema kwamba miaka 18 iliyopita wakati nilipoingia katika Bunge hili, simu zilikuwani zile za kuzungusha na pia zilikuwa hazisikiki vizuri. Leo kote katika Kenyahakuna mambo ya simu zisizosikika vizuri. What Kenya do you want? Haya ndiyo mambo tunayotaka.Ukiangalia Shirika la Reli la Kenya, mambo yamekuwa mazuri zaidi. Hivi majui nilimterabeza Mchina mmoja katika ofisi za shirika hilo na alikuwa ananiuliza kama maofisi ya Kenya yote yako hivyo. Nilimwambia ndio, lakini ukarwa ni urongo tu. Katika Kenya hakuna ofisi nzuri kuliko za Shirika la Reli la Kenya.Mtu akiingia ofisini hawezi kufikiri kuna Wafrika humo; anachani pengine ni kwa watufulani na si Wafrika. Ofisi ni safi. Watu wanaofanya kazi humo ofisini ni wasafi. Nivizuri waendelee kuiendeleza rnipango ya maendeleo kufuatana na mwendo wa leo.Jukumu letu hapa Bungeni ni kupitisha pesa za matumizi katika Wizara mbali mbali. Tukitoa pesa kwa Waziri wa Uchukuzi na Mwasiliano, atayagawia mashirika yaliyo chini. yake, kama vile Shirika la Kenya la Reli, ambalo lina jaribu kuwasaidia wananchi wanaokabiliwa na shida za magari ya matatu. Hii ni kwa sababu kuna huduma kama ile inayojulikana ulaya kama "trams". Katika siku zijazo ingefaa kuwe na huduma kama hizo za trams.ili mtu yeyote akitaka kufika Loresho, ama pengineko awe akizitumia trams hizo, na aondokewe- na shica inayodokana na magari ya matatu. Vile vile rnipango ingefanywa ili mtu yeyote akitaka kusafiri hadi Voi awe anapata huduma kama hiyo ya reli wakati wowote.Kwa hivyo, hii ni moja ya WLzara ambazo zina biashara kubwa. Kila moja ya mashirika haya yanawezakuwa yakifanya faida ili Serikali ipate pesa za kujenga shule, zahanati na hospitali nyingi zaici. Kwa njia hii watu wengi zaici nchini watafaiaika na nafasi nyingi za kazi zitakuweko. N'inashukuru kwa sababu mashirika ambayo yamewakilishwa hapa, kama vile Reli, Posta na Simu, Ports Authority yana nafasi ku'owa sana ya kuwaajiri watu wengi sana. Ukiangalia upande wa Kenya Ports Authority yenyewe utaona kwamba idadi ya wale walioajiriwa inepanda juu, na ni hivyo hivyo katika Shirika la Reli, na pia la Posta na Simu. Hivi ndivyo tuna- vyotaka mambo yawe, si maneno ya mdorao tu. Nimesema mara nyingi kuwa hapa Kenya hakuna siasa, bali kazi ni ya tumbo. Watu wanataka pesa ili kujipatia chakula, za kuwawezesha kuwpeleka watoto wao shuleni, nyumba za kuishi. Je, baada ya kupata huduma hizo zote, ni nani atakayemtaka mwanasiasa kama Sharif Nassir na rnakele yake? Siasa ni huduma kwna zinazotolewa na mashirika kama yalivyov/akilishwa hapa, na ningependa kuwaomba wakurugenzi wake wawaajiri watu wengi kazi ili wapate mishahara.Kila siku hapa tunapata watu wengi sana wakiwasum oua Wabunge kwa kutaka wapatiwe kazi, lakini hawapari. Wanaaabiwa "keti hapa UNGO, jee utapata ka 	    mwanasiasa anaondoka na kwenda nyumbani kwake na gari aina ya Mercedes, bi kuwa na habari ya yule anayetaka huauma. Tuna bahati katika uongozi wake na watoto wetu wanataka nafasi ya kuiendeleza nchi hii. Nikiangalia wakur waliofika hapa leo, wote ni wachanga, si kama sisi wazee arribao wamekomaa. hatuwezi kuwasaidia hawa wakurugenzi wa mashirika, basi tusiwasumbue kuiha nchi hii. Ingefaa waachwe wawe starehe kuwaajiri watu kazi na kuendeleza mengine mengi yanayohusu mashirika wanayosimamia.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Bw.

Kenya Ports Authority, Kenya, Airways Corporation. The Meteorological Department, the Directorate Civil Aviation, the Kenya Railways Corporation and the Ministry's Headquarters itself for their exemplary performance. I would only like to urge the following principles which should continue to guide the operations of the Ministry and the state corporations under it.	I must urge that the Ministry's corporations must continue to be run as commercial entities, perform efficiently, seek to do excellent marketing end plan for profitability and liquidity. Unless they plan for profitability and liquidity then they will sink.Let me also say that we .are, indeed, grateful to the 		 for the very exemplary complement Gilgil for the manufacture of telephones. which has won world re-known. I know for sure that the African development Bank has praised this complex as the only institution in Africa that is capable of doing what is beingdone in Taiwan, Hong Kong and elsewhere in the world. I am delighted that through this complex the KP & TC has received orders 	[this line is not eligible to read]															 Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, with regard to telephonecommunication I should say that there, is a lot of congestion within Nairobi telephone exchanges. I would only ask the KP & TC to unshod the exchanges by enlarging then so that we can communicate effectively: It is both annoying and terrifying to pick up a telephone only to hear somebody speaking with his girlfriend.For example, my own telephone has not been in working order for last three months. I am sure Mr. Mg'eny, the KP & TC hanaging Director, is listening to what I am saying and will ensile that I get some SERVICE.I would also like to stress in the need for accelerationof the provision of the STD service in the divisions throughout thecountry} which is very important. I want to be selfish and say_		an waiting for the day when the Minister and the KP & TC Managing Director Willtriger and snatch on the Kaloleni and Marinkani STD Exchanges.As the Member of Parliament for Maloleni Constittuonoy  I have saidwhat my people expected ne to say and I hope the KP & TC Managing Director has taken note of it.A lot has been said about us losing business to Dar es Salaam but I would still the to congratulate the Kenya ports Authority Managing Director and his staff for, in fact, being very efficient. I speak quite a lot with officials of shipping companies and agents who admit that there has been very marked improvements in the operations of ore port. I can only urge the KPA staff not to relax but to work even harder so that we can beat everybody in both the eastern and western Africa Coastline ports. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there have been some complaints that perhapsemployment opportunities have not been distributed as equitably as it ought tobe the case. I have no facts to verify this point. However, I must mention that these thingshaving been told these things by those that I represent, my duty is to ask the Managing Director to at least investigate this claim. I know the Managing Director very well and I do know that he is a very good Engineer and he exercises equity re¬distribution of employment opportunities. It is my sincere hope that equitable distribution of job opportunities will continue to be his guiding principle in this Corporation. That as it may, I have made the point I wanted to make.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in so far as the Kenya Airways is concerned, I would like to say that they have done a good job and that they should strive to keep	it up. Since the prunning of the management team,We have been leaving both Nairobi and Mombasa airports on time and, I remember a couple of times that I personally have been left behind for arriving ten minutes after the scheduled departure time, This is good  enough but I think the Airline has taught us some bad. manners in that if you get there five minutesbefore take off, you can still get onto the aircraft. I would like to congratulate them, however, for their improved efficiency and also for the Tidiness in their aircrafts, One   is particularly impressed by the uniforms worn by their staffmembers. This uniform is very pleasant indeed and I think a job well done shouldbe appreciated and therefore, I congratulate the management of the Kenya airways.However, they should not be big-headed on the side of profit making.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, on the side of planning and profitmaking I would urge the Corporation to strive to improve its services. I amsaying this because at the moment, the Corporation has a lot of debts and Iwould expect them to make sure that they do enough marketing to earn enoughrevenue in order to service these debts rather than locking for assistance from elsewhere within the Government to have their debts serviced. I am not referring to the KenyaAirways alone, but also to all other Government corporations. This point should be taken heed of seriously because a lot of the corporations that we have 	.have totally failed to service their debts and they always tend to go back to the Treasury hoping that the Treasury can mint money. I would like to appeal to them not to ashame the Government. They can only be able to repay their debts by making sure that their budgeting includes adequate cash-flow provisions.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as for the Kenya Railways corporation, I would to say that this corporation has been doing a good job, but I think it is high time that this Corporation planned to extend their services to the rural areas. I think this is a difficult thing to do particularly at this time when money is hard to come by. However, I know that WE are very brilliant in this country and with a professor at the helm of this corporation, we should be capable of expanding railways services to the rural areas in order to assist the farmers.I look at the major corporations that I have mentioned as a source of solving our unemployment problem. when these corporations make profits, are can generate more jobs for wananchi and this is really the point I would like to emphasize. These corporations should look at themselves, not as just mere parastatals but as business entities aimed at making profits, and with a major responsibility to assist His Excellency the President in making sure that WE generate more and more jobs for Kenyans.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as for the meteorological department, I would like to say that they too are doing a good job, but I wish they should be able to tell us, particularly at the coast, when the rains are due So that we plant on time. Most of the times, we are caught up by the rains. Most of the time, the rains come either earlier or later than expected. So, I request our scientists to devise ways and means of informing us when the rains are due so that we may plaint in time.the only corporation I. have not mentioned is the Directorate of Civil Aviation and, since it is doing a good job, I am not going to interfere with it. I will just let it go on doing the job that it is presently engaged in.the final point that I would like to emphasise, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, is that there is a lot of competition in so far as the business of our state corporations is concerned. We must face up to this competition from Dar-es—Salaam and elsewhere.With these few remarks, I beg to support. I see that my time is up. So, thank very much.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. ogur): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to speak on behalf of the people of Nyatike, who have never seen a telephone. It is ridiculous for me to speak today and ask for a telephone to be installed in Nyatike, which used to be under Migori. All the telephone lines we used to have then ended at Migori, which is another-world altogether as compared to Nyatike. When a message is received by telephone in Migori, you cannot send somebody to deliver it to Muhuru Bay, which is 70 kilometres away, because by the time he gets there the message will have evaporated. In June, 1990, I saw tall black telephone polls being dropped as near as Opuchaku (?) Market and I started to be happy. However, the women there have now started turning these poles into firewood. Why have these poles not been erected and connected with telephone lines to give me a chance to speak on telephone from Nyatike? We have telephones nearly everywhere else in Kenya except in Nyatike. Why is this so? Nyatike is right inside Kenya and the Minister for Transport and Communications is my friend. It is very awkward for me and my brother, the Provincial Commissioner, to be collected by policemen whenever we are wanted outside Nyatike. my people always wonder why policemen come to me. This is because we have no telephone there. So, policemen come to me with guns only to tell me that I am wanted back in Nairobi urgently. If there were telephones, they would be used in such cases. Leave alone the subscriber trunk dialling facilities; I do not even have an ordinary telephone line although the Minister is my friend. If he does not know Nyatike, this is what used to be called Macalder Nyanza Mine.Leaving telephones aside, what about that small airstrip which the settlers who used to mine gold and copper in Yatike used to utilise in bringing sausages from Nairobi? This airstrip is now idle. One day, the Minister and I went to see the floods which had affected Nyatike in totality. We flew there and came- back here without having stopped anywhere.</Newspeech><Header> ADJOURNMENT </Header> <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mureithi): Hon.

WAKOLE asked the Minister of State, Office of the President, why the Officer Commanding Police Division, Malindi, directed the Manager of Tana Salt Company Limited to dismiss all the Orma boys who had been employed by the company as casuals.<Newspeech>THE MINSITER OF STATE, OFFICER OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Nabwera): DeputyMr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Manager of Tana River Salt Company Limited had employedsome Orma casuals and they were asked to return to their home districton security grounds. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAKOLE: Mr. Deputy Speaker; Sir, is the Minister aware that occasionsSeveral occasions the Officer Commanding Malindi Police Station arrests all Ormas who are working in Malindi and repatriates them to TanaRiver district. Why does this Police Officer not take somebody tothe court of law when he commits an offence? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am referring to a specific.period in time and I am also referring to specific casuals who wereasked to retun to their home districts. I am not aware it is ageneral practice to ask people employed from Tana River districtto go back to their district. After all, they must be employed inmany parts OF THIS reDublic.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAKOLE: Before those casuals had been dismissed andreturned to their districts, why ,did the police not send them to a court of law if they had committed any offence.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, not every security problemIs effected to court. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. FALANA: This word "security" is verysensitive. Could the Minister tell this House what he exactlymeans by saying that they were taken away because of security reasons?Were they a security risk because they were Ormas? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, these casuals whowere taken away because they were contacts of people who were a danger to the security of this nation and I am sure my hon good friend knows what was happening in Malindi at that time. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ADEN:	If he has got	evidence to show that what he is telling the Houseis true, why were they not apprehended and taken to a court of law? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have just said that NOT EVERY security case is 	to a court of Law. The Previous answer that gavewas that these boys were being used as conta^s by the people who were dsngerous. </Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MI SOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, I do appreciate that answer from the Minsiter. If these boys were, a security risk to the nation then what guarantee does the Minister offer to the House that there willnot continue to be any security risks wherever they are? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, they were not boys,they were	adults. The House is aware of the difficulties through whichthis country has gone over poaching and other security issues. Itwas decided, instead of keeping those casuals employed in Malindithey should go back to their home district in Tana River where theywould be observed. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. I.M. MOHAMED: Mr. Deputy Speaker, can the Minister give a specific and satisfactory example? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Bomett): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am really at a loss.

MOHAMED: Can the Minister give a specific example of the context he has mentioned to satisfy thisHouse or, otherwise, that company was being malicious in laying off those casuals? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am very surprised that my good friend thinks that it was malice. This country is under constant attacks from various groups. Currently  the hon. Member is aware that police pick up a lot of information on what we as individuals do. It is in the interests of the country when the police feel that a certain group to do a thing, like.this. In this case, the poaching was rampant and people were being injured or killed and the police had enough reasons to believe that these casuals were being used as chief contacts and it is part of the exercise that restored peace and order in that area. </Newspeech>COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR<Newspeech>MR.

Also accompanying our distinguished guests is a 	representative of the British High Commission, Mr. Robert Denny; and Mrs. Colvin.The delegation arrived here last Sunday and will be around with us till next Sunday.May I take this opportunity, on behalf of all hon. Members, to wish the distinguished guests a very enjoyable and fruitful stay in our country.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: On point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, It is not the first time that people who are thought to be criminals have been transferred from one part of this country to another. Is the Office of the President really in order to keep on transferring 	because this same case happened in Lamu. There was a time when	people from the northen Kenya were sacked and sent home. This Orma	boys are another example. A criminal is a criminal and whether youtransfer him from Lamu to Marsabit or from Busia to Moyale, he still remains a criminal and he should be dealt witk according to the law. Is the Office of the President, really in order to keep on transferring criminals from one part of the country to another instead of dealing with them security wise?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I said that we had not reached a stage where these casuals could be taken to courts. But, they had to be sent back to their home districts where they could be watched carefully to see whether they were likely to cause more trouble. </Newspeech>  Question No. 455<Header> Cost of Moyale Sub-District Hospital </Header> MR. P.G. GODANA asked the. Minister for Health how much money was used in the construction of Moyale Sub-district Hospital and when the completion certi¬ficate of this project was issued.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.I wish to inform the hon. Member that the construction of Moyale Sub- district Hospital was done at a cost of KShs.42,139,157. The practical complet¬ion certificate was issued on 25th April, 1986.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.G. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, now that the Assistant Minister has a completion certificate, is he aware that this particular project is actually not complete in that the roads are not done, the mortuary gets flooded up and no proper landscaping has been done? Is he also aware that even the X-ray room could not be used (because the walls were not of the required standard? How come that a completion certificate was issued for such unsatisfactory work?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hospital is functioning normally except the X-ray department which requires one lead glass for use in the X-ray cubicle. The same has been ordered from Nairobi X-RAY Supplies Department. Secondly, pass-through-hatch (?) has been bought and arrangements have been made	to transport the same to Moyale. The Kenya Army has been requested to transport it to Moyale during their normal journeys to that area. Thirdly, a radiographer HAS been posted to the hospital but he has not reported up to date, and my Ministry is looking into that issue.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for that answer, it is interesting to know that this completion certifi¬cate was issued on 25th April, 1986. If that is the case, why did it take such a long time for this sub-district hospital to function? Why were X-rays not ordered on time and why was a radiographer not posted to the hospital at the right time? Was it planned to have these things or not?</Newspeech>	 <Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, posting a radiographer to the hospi¬tal before the machines are bought and installed there would not have made much sense. Now that these arrangements have been made, a radiographer will be posted there. Although we have been given a satisfaction that the work was well done, we are at it anyway; we have not forgotten the whole thing and we are doing it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MIS0I: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. It is now four years since this sub-district hospital was completed, is it in order for the Assistant Minister not to tell us why it took so long to have all these amenities provided? Is it proper for him not to give an explanation?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR:; Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have explained when the construct¬ion work was completed. These other little things likek machines which have to be serviced or ordered from abroad anbd carefully transported to Moyale would, of course, take time. What is important is that we have done our part and the remaining bit is already been undertaken.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.G. GODANA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the Assistant Minister is deliberately misleading this House when he says that this project is complete. I have given examples of areas which are not complete and, therefore, that completion certificate should not have, been issued in the first place. It is very serious why a colossal amount of money like KShs.42 million is involved in this type of a project and the Ministry does not care to ensure that the project is completed. In fact, nobody would like to go to that hospital by-his.vehicle because a lot of hardcore has been poured on the road and nothing else has been done. You cannot put a dead body in the mortuary because it-gets flooed due to improper landscaping. The roof of the hospital leaks because it was not properly done. Could the Assistant Minister say cate¬gorically that this project was properly done?</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: What is your question?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.G. GODANA: Could the Assistant Minister send the necessarypersonnel there to see the amount of work that has actually been done before heTHAT THE PROJECT IS PROPERLY COMPLETED?	The certificate should not been		work was not completed. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the construction wok has been done, and it has nothing to do with the x-ray being repaired. The construction has been done and completed and a completion certificate has been issued to that effect. What now remains is the installation of the X-ray and these other details will be finished.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Who are we going to believe? Here is the hon. Member from the area who has been to that hospital and who knows very well that the project is not complete despite the fact that a comletion certificate has been issdued. Here, just because someone from the Ministry of Health wrote the reply the1 Assistant Minister is reading to the effect-that everything has been done, the Assistant Minister insists that the work has been properly done. Now, under those circumstances, who are we going to believe?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I talk here I am both the Government and the Ministry and I have to be believed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the hon. Assistant Minister in order to personify himself as both the Ministry and the Government? Can he apologise to the House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am giving the Government reply which has been given to my Ministry. Therefore, what I say should not be doubted. If the hon. Member has anything more to ask, I will invite him to the Ministry.</Newspeech>Question No. 461 <Header> Vehicle for Masii Health Centre </Header> MR. WAMBUA asked the Minister for Health what steps he is taking to ensure that a serviceable vehicle is provided to Masii Health Centre since the vehicle meant for this centre is unserviceable.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.I wish to inform the hon. Member that Masii Health Centre was allocated GK C428 - Chev Luv - vehicle. The vehicle broke down and it was discovered thatit requires an engine overhaul. It is now undergoing repairs at Maru Garage in Machakos town and, as soon as it is repaired, it will be taken back to the station.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this vehicle was removed from Masii Health Centre five months ago and it has been under repair all this period. The dispensary serves a lot of health centres and some dispensaries because it is the station where the vehicle is stationed. How soon are the repairs going to be completed since patients are suffering, because they have no: means of going to the Machakos General Hospital? There must a vehicle to serve this particular health centre.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Masii Health Centre is supposed to be between 20 and 25 kilometres on tarmac road to Machakos Town. In case of an emergency, the district hospital can be reached on telephone to assist with a vehicle to collect any emergency case. Otherwise, not all patients who visit our health institutions need to be transported in the one ambulance. The patients are normally taken to hospitals even by personal cars and even on bicycles. That should not frustrate the hon. Member at all.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not agree with the Assistant Minister when he says that medical officers in Masii can telephone Machakos District Hospital to be provided with transport. Just think of the time to be taken to make the telephone call for a vehicle while somebody may be dying at the health centre. That is not an appropriate answer. Can the Assistant Minister tell this House when this vehicle will be despatched to Masii Health Centre? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as soon as this vehicle is repaired and tested, it will go back where it came from; that is, Masii Health Centre.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order, when he is asked to give a specific date, to just rise and say that that will be done as soon as possible? Is he in order to mislead the House with such statements?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as soon as possible means immediately the vehicle comes out of the garage.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant Minister's reply, we have not been told when the ambulance broke down and what temporary arrangements have been worked out to ensure that the patients who need such services are assisted </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I inform this august House that we do not have a pool of ambulances so that we can just despatch them to those places which do not have such services. We do not have such spare ambu¬lances. Let me also add that immediately we are informed that an ambulancein a given area has broken down, as is the case with Masii Health Centre, we try to get the necessary funds to repair it. This is exactly what we are doing in this case.</Newspeech>Question No. 467 <Header> Repairs to Nakuru M.T.C. Buildings </Header> MR. A.K. KIMEMIA asked the Minister for Health, since the buildings housing the Medical Training Centre, Nakuru and in particular the kitchen and dining hall are leaking seriously, what urgent action the Ministry is taking to have these buildings repaired forthwith.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Some K£150,000, equivalent to Ksh.3 million, has been released to the Principal of the Medical Training Centre, Nakuru, to fund the repairs of the kitchen, dining hall and administrative block. These funds were released through Authority to Incur Expenditure number D1l/RD/344/10/011 of 9th September 1990 and was received by the Principal on 26th September, this year.

P.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell us when he became aware that those repairs were necessary? /Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not have a specific date but, since the Question provoked me to give this answer, there must have been a reason for it. Why was the Question then asked? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.K. KIMEMIA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister said he is aware of the state of the Centre. However, why did his Ministry take so long to check on the problems of the Centre? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, because of certain procedures, it had to take some time for the Ministry to arrange for the tenders and also award them to the contractors. This is what we have done and there are many firms that are putting in their bids for the construction. I am sune the hon.

There is an understaffing by 33 teachers.(b) The breakdown of teachers in Kinango Division is as follows:- 321 trained teachers and 429 untrained teachers. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.BIDU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister's breakdown shows variations. Is ha aware that Kinango Zone is leading the zones that are understaffed? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: M.r. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is not strictly true. This Constituency has four zones whose understaffing as follows: Minango Zone whose teachers; Maavaya Zone - 4 teachers; Maseras Zone - 16 teachers and Samburu Zone - 6 teachers So, you can see that Maseras Zone is nore understaffed than Minango Zone. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell the House why some divisions are understaffed and others overstaffed in this country? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.KARAURI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this happens because there say not be enough teachers to fill the understaffed positions. The Ministry of Education will, however, continue to recruit untrained teachers (UTs) and also continue training the serving UTs. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.KIIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Spaaker, Sir I do not think that was my question. I have asked the Assistant why we have understaffed and overstaffed divisions in the country. Does this show that his officers are not working properly? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, currently in Mwale District there is no educational zone that is overstaffed. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.WAMBUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sure the Assistant Minister knows that wherever we have understaffing teaching is affected. why should we have understaffed and overstaffed schools? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is insvitablebecause when we recruit serving understaffed teachers (UTs) training until we haverecruitsd more UTs to fill there positions there will be understaffing 			will continue to fill these positions. </Newspeech>Question No. 441 <Header> Funds for Mwiro water Catchment </Header> MR. 		alinwaulisa waziri wa ustawi wa Maji ni kiasi gani cha pesa kiliohotengwa ha kwale DDC cha kujenga jabia (water catchment) la maji la Mawiro (wasini Island) katika Lokesheni ya pongwe/Kidimu, Tarafa ya Msambweni.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Mweu): Bw.

MAKHANU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Health the following Question by Private Motice.Is the Minister satisfied with the performance of Kenyatta National Hospital as a parastatal and in particular the effectiveness of X-Ray Intensive care Unit (ICU) and staff welfare departments andif not, what steps is the ministry taking to streamline the management of this hospital?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.I wish to inform the hon. Member that I am satisfied wath the performance of Kenyatta national Hospital as a state corporation and that X-ray, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and Staff welfare Departments are managed effectively. Since the establishment of Kenyatta National Hospital as a state corporation and the appointment of a Board of Managment in July, 1987, a number of initiatives have been taken to streamline and improve the management of the hospital.The X-ray Department has been functioning for the last 20 years. Although some equipment is old most of the equipment is working. My Ministry is rehabilitating the X-ray Department at a cost of shs.100 million. It is enpected the ultrasound Unit will have been acquired by December, 1990. The rest of the equipment will be ready for installation at the beginning of the next calendar year, 1991. The department has no problem with films and chemicals. The department has been able to carryout most of	its investigations at theThe ICU has a full capacity for 22 beds. However; we have all along operated 11 beds. This is partly because of the unit cost of operationalising the bods in the ICU and also duo to thehospital's needs. The department has 13 ventilators, including three for children, all of which are functional.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, usually when the Intensive Care Unite is full six to eight ventilators are used. There are eight cardiac monitors which include four which were bought early this year. There are three blood gas analisers of which two vere bought in 1988. There is an agreerment between the suppliers of the Intensive Care Unite equipment to train cur local technicians and to have regular supplies of spare parts, otherwise, My Ministry is satisfied with the general performance of the Intensive Care Unit at Henyatta national Hospital.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, on the side of the staff welfareDepartment, I would like to say that following the approval by the Governmentnew terms and conditions of service were prepared and implemented towards theend of 1988 for the staff working at the Kenyatta National Hospital.At the saae time, a Staff Welfare Association was formerly established throughwhich members of staff are able to participate in the various activities bothwith in and without the hospital. Here one may highlight the traditional dancersgroup, the hospital choir and the various staff activities in which the officerof the hospital have excelled. For example, in the recently Tiekwondo championships, a member of the Kenyatta National Hospital staff was among the test performer in Nairobi.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Staff Training Department has also been strengthened and has beer, able in the last two years to organize a series of training activities for the staff. This is because my Ministry believes that manpower is our most critical resources and that it is an invest ment that will ensure the contued service of this resource.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while thanking the AssistantMinister for that very lengthy reply, is he aware that I am raising this matterdue to public outcry regarding the very poor services that are now being offeredat Kenyatta national Hospital? This matter has even been publicised in thenewspapers, specifically in the Sunday Nation of 3 September, 1990.  Mypersonal experience is that many patients who are ferred to Kenyatta nationalHospital are now being referred, to private hospitals, for example, the Agah Khanand the M.P.Shah Hospitals Intensive Care Units. In his very length reply, whichappears to ce evading the Question, the Assistant Minister has informed this Housethat he is satisfied with the performance of Kenyatta National Hospital as areferal hospital in this country. Could he tell this House why he is satisfiedwith the performance of this Hospital, when the operation of the of the DepartmentX-Ray Department and the Intensive Care Units has continued to deteriorate?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to inform the hon. Member and the House that I am satisfied with the work that is being done at Kenyatta National Hospital. There are perhaps a few cases which have been referred to other specialised hospitals but all the same, I am very much satisfied with the work that is being done at the Kenyatta national Hospital, He have a Board of Directors which is capable enough to look at the effectiveness of this hospital in consultation with my Ministry.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GALGALLC: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from the reply by the Assistant-Minister, is he aware that I was once a victime of bad management that is now going on at Kenyatta national Hospital? I took a patient for renal examination but the hospital did not have the equipment for this kind of examination and I was referred to the M.P. Shah Hospital where I paid over Shs.7,000/-. This was a referal case from Hola and  would like the Assistant Minister to tell this House how long it is going to take to have this equipment available at the Kenyatta national Hospital so that wananchi could be saved from the exploitation they are now experiencing from these private hospitals?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OCUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I admit that there have been a few cases which" may have been found necessary to refer to private hospitals because a specialised doctor is needed for that particular patient. However, this does not at all prove that we are not doing well at the Kenyatta National Hospital.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr.  Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the Assistant Minister has admitted that there is nothing wrong in transferring a case from a Government hospital to a private hospital, would he therefore agree with me that the Government should, in such cases, meet the cost incurred by patients in privat hospitals when referred there?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, my Government My Ministry does not patients to any private hospital. It is the</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALAKA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if I heard the hon. Assistant Minister correctly, he said  My GovernmentIs he realty in order to say that? which Government does hon. Ogur have here? we would like to know !</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: My Ministry, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, my Ministry  does not transfer anyany patient to any priviate hospital, but in many cases,patients transferred toprivate hospitals, are so transferred by their relatives and not the hospital.Therefore, there is no question of the Government or the Ministry for thatmatter,taking the responsibility of meeting the hospital bills so incurredby such n patients in private hospitals.</Newspeech><Newspeech>ME. KILIKu:   on a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, five minutes ago, the AssistantMinister was heard to say, "My Government", could he withdraw that remarkbefore we can continue?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Ogur, you realise that this kind of slip oftongue has been a bit frequent this afternoon. Perhaps you would like toclarify the position?</Newspeech><Newspeech>ME. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the correct thing to say is“The Government of Kenya” and “The Ministry of Health"</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Very well indeed!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA.: on a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it appears that the hon. Assistent Minister is playing about with words. He has not withdrawn the remark he made as far as we are concerned. If it was a slip of the tongue, could he withdraw what he said because as far as we know, hon. Ogur does not have a Government. He should withdraw that remark and apologize.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, of course, the right thing to say is: "The C-ovemment of Kenya".</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: on a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it would have been in order if the hon. Assistant Minister would have withdrawn the words he used and then use the correct ones after that and we would have accepted that.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Of course, the Government is not mine alone; it is all ours.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASIKE-KDOMBI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, as some of us can remember, one of the charges against the former Minister for Home Affairs and Constitutional Matters, was that he once referred in his speech to, "My Government". This kind of remark led to a judicial inquiry and now hon. Ogur has the guts not to withdraw the words, "My Government", which he has also used in this House. Can he withdraw those words categorically without any ¬condition, otherwise he will be responsible for any consequences.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: I withdraw, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, and substitute those words with the words, "The Kenya Government", which indeed is our Government!</Newspeech>(laughter)<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Kiliku's Question.</Newspeech> <Header> Sacking of Workers by M/s Egatex Company </Header> <Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Labour the following Question by Private Notice.(a)	Why did the management of Messrs Egatex Company, Mombasa, terminate the services of 22 employees during September, 1990?(b)	When will the complainants be paid their terminal beneftis? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. P.J.W. Masinde): Mr. Deputy Speaker,Sir, I beg to reply.The Egatex Comapny of Mombasa did not terminate the services of its employees. Therefore, the question of paying terminal benefits to complainants does not arise.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the Minister must havebeen misled by his officers because the services of these employuees were terminated and the employees have not been paid any terminal benefits for the time they have been in employment, which ranges between five and 10 years. If the Ministe doubts this, I will bring documents here next week to substantiate my claim. I could not have brought this Question here without being sure as to whether their services were terminated or not.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is your question, Mr. Kiliku? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the Minister doubts that the services of these people were not terminated, I will substantiate my claim next week and prove that they were terminated.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MIS0I: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. With regard to the substantiation that hon. Kiliku would wish to bring here next week, is it in order for the Minister to ive an answer to this Question? When a Question is asked here, all the relevant details should be provided.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.J.W. MASINDE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, all we know is that the employees of Egatex Company went on strike on 12th September, 1990. The matter was reported to the Ministry of Labour; and the labour office in Mombasa  intervened and came to a go—back—to—work formula under which all the employees resumed work on 13th September, 1990. These employees are now all at work and nobody's services were terminated. However, if there is any evidence to prove that the services of these employees were terminated, we aire naturally prepared to look into the matter.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister said that these employees went on strike. Was it confirmed by the Minister that this was actually a strike? If so, what kind of strike was it?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.J.W. MASINDE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the employees of Egatex Company were asked to do the tailoring of a new design, for which they were to be paid a certain amount of money for the new design, but they did not accept the rates that the employer was giving. For that reason, they walked out of work. That was when the Ministry of Labour got involved. A meeting was held in the labour office in Mombasa and a formula of returning to work agreed upon. These employees went back to work on 13th September, 1990, sifter accepting on how to work on the new design for payment of Shs.45.35 per piece. However, before this work was carried out, the management decided to withdraw the new design, and all the employees have since continued to work in the normal manner.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Minister tell the House why the management of Egatex Company decided to change the terms and conditions of service of these employees?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.J.W. MASINDE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the main Question is why the allegedly sacked people have not been paid, and I have just told the House that no employees were sacked and that, therefore, the question of terminal benefits does not arise. As to why the new design was withdrawn or employee terms and conditions of service were changed does not arise because the employer is free to change a design if he thinks the new one will be more appealing to wananchi. At any rate, that is the not the Question before us at the moment.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASIKE—NDOMBI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Minister in order to mislead the House by saying that no services of any employee were terminated when after the alleged strike all the employees were takenback under changed terms and conditions of service? These terms and conditions were changed in such a manner that an employee would henceforth be paid Shs.l/= for sewing one poair of trousers. How many trousers can one sew in order to earn Shs.45.35 per week? Is this not termination of services?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.J.W. MASINDE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the rate was not Shs.45.35 per week, but per day.</Newspeech>COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY (Order for Committee read being Twelveth Allotted Day)<Header> MOTION </Header> THAT, Mr. Speaker do now leave the Chair Vote 14 — Ministry of Transport and Communications (Minister for Transport and Communications on 11.10.90)(Resumption of Debate interrupted on 11.10.90)<Newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur): Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I wish to take this opportunity to thank the Minister for Transport and Communications because immediately I arrived in Nyatike last Friday, I found telephone cables arriving there. They were placed next to the poles that have been lying there since June, 1990. So, I hope that the road from Migori to Muhuru Bay will soon be equipped with telephone lines. This is great, and I praise the Ministry concerned for it.Leaving that point aside, I wish to state that there used to be a small airstrip for the use of the miners who used to mine gold in Macalder. When these people left, the airstrip grew bushes, but I need it back so that when I visit the place one day, I do not have to land in Homabay, more than 80 kilometres away. So, this airstrip should be rehabilitated.There also used to a small ship between Kisumu, through Kendu Bay, Homa Bay, all round to Rusinga, Mfangano and Muhuru Bay. However, that pier is idle at the moment although it is still strong and can be used for tying a ship to. I need this ship back so* that my motor does not rotor. There are very many Asian heavy vehicles driving down my small bridge, and I do not need them. Instead,I would prefer to use this ship to bring ray motor to Kisumu. These Asian vehicles just need fish from my place to bring to Kisumu on a large tarmac road. So, getting back this ship to the people of Nyatike will be praised because it is required.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I understand that other people have already received Nyayo buses, at least one bus per area. What would be wrong to give a Nyayo bus to serve a small distance between Migori and Muhuru Bay? If this happened,we would see the benefits of the Nyayo Philosogphy. I understand that these vehicles are very comfortable and cheap. They are strong and do not break down as often as the other vehicles that I have seen being withdrawn from this road. When my people use matatus during the rains, they get wet. Let me be favoured by this good Ministry with a Nyayo bus so that I may feel good.Besides that, I am very happy with the Ministry, which is quite a big one and is known and loved everywhere, including Nyatike. So, I highly support the Ministry's Vote and request that this money be provided. Thank you very much.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND HOUSING	(Mr. Mutiso): Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute on this very important Vote. First of all, the Ministry of Transport and Communications is a very important Ministry. This is because the ministry of Transport and Communications should take urgent action to solve some of the problems that are facing us today. I say this because roads in some parts of this country are in a very poor state. We want to give this Ministry money so that it can improve the state of roads  and other facilities throughout the country. The Ministry should know that there are some areas which are worse than others particularly with regard to the conditions of roads in this country.Also, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to ask the Ministerfor Transport and Communications to consider When he talks ofhaving reached some understanding to the effect that Kenya Airwaysmay start making flights to South Africa That is a good gesturebut I do not know whether we are actually in a position, at the present moment, to entertain that particular kind of venture. This is because the South African regime has not improved its politics of apartheid. They have not improved things to the extent where Kenya can enter into such negotiations.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while supporting this Vote there is one issue which I would like to bring to the attention of the Minister. This concerns Kenya Airways. The national carrier has increased its fleet of aircraft. But there is one particular area which has been over-looked and that is cargo transport. Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, Kenya has become a major produ¬cer of horticultural products. He rely on foreign airlines to take our products to overseas markets. Unfortunately you will find that most of the time our products are left at the airport because of lack of space in the aircraft. The Ministry should now begin to consider the possibility of buying at least two cargo aircraft. This will even enable, the Kenya-Airways to make more money than it makes using the passenger aircraft. This is because we have a lot of horticultural products that need to be transported to markets overseas. We also produce flowers that are selling like hot cakes in Europe. So, Iplead with the Minister to consider purchasing at least one cargo aircraft in order to try and alleviate this problem. I say this because the Ministry has continued to overlook this very important area cargo transport. Horticultural products do earn this country a lot of revenue. I would like to request the Minister to consider buying cargo aircraft to enable this country to export horticultural products without problems. That is a very wise step to take because our crop has to be transported to markets overseas. It is therefore my sincere hope that the	Minister will consider this matter and take thenecessary action when we give him the money. I am quite sure that Parliament is willing to give the Ministry this money. This is because we want to improve our national carrier. HE also want to show the world that Kenya is a progressive country. we want to show the world that we can produce products that cannot be produced in other parts of the world. Things like these flowers can only be grown in Europe in green houses. But here in Kenya we nave a veryof business but they are disappointed by the fact there is no adequate space in our aircraft. The foreign airlines over-look the bookings that are made by Kenya citizens.Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, personally I do not have any other point and I would like to support the Vote of this Ministry and ask the Minister to consider that important of stf buying cargo aircraft which will provide that kind of service we are lacking at the present	moment and with these remarks,I support the Vote.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER POR COMMERCE (Mr. Ndong) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to contribute on this Motion. I would first of all like to congratulate the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications for the wonderful complex they have put up at GilGil. This complex is going to serve this nation and the countries surrounding Kenya. I would also like to suggest to the Ministry that the Central Training  College at Mbagathi should be converted into a constituent college of the University of Nairobi to train specialised personnel in electronics. This will of course widen the scope of the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Nairobi.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like to thank the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation for allowing individuals to import telecommuni¬cation equipment. This give way for a healthy competition because when we have several, types of those equipment all over the country the prices will go down. Recently we read in the newspapers that the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation will introduce mobile telephone equipment, and this is a welcome move which, I think, has come at the right time. However, wananchi are complaining a bit about the prices. They think the amounts to be deposited will be on thehigher side. Maybe, Lwe. Couldi consider including those amounts in the monthlybilling system Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while still on the question of telephone, I wish to point out that we are a bit about fault reporting system. Normally, when one reports a fault, it takes about a week or even more to get that fault repaired. Kenya being a growing country, we cannot allow our telephones to go out of order for that long. I think a system should be devised to look into the fault report¬ing system so that as soon as a telephone is reported to be out of order some action is taken. There is also the question of telephone tapping by the employees of the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation, especially at Homa Bay, where telephone operators listen to telephone conversations. That is risky for us, politicians, because those operators can pass information from one politician to the other. It may be necessary that employees for an area should not be allowed to work within that particular area.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Rangwe Divisional Headquarters requires a Subscriber Trunk Dialling (STD) system urgently. This is a big market centre with such institutions as Asumbi Teacher-Training College, Asumbi Secondary School and Orel Secondary School. We also have trading centres such as Thiru, Nyawita and Imbo which would benefit very much from an STD system.Touching on Kenya Airways, I would like to congratulate the management nowever, do feel very strongly thatis not opportune for us to go to South Africa. It appears that there is some conflicting information as to whether we have agreed to go to South Africa or not, and I think this should be handled by the Office of the President and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation. Another point is that Kenya Airways is overbooking. From time to time when you travel from here to eithe Mombasa or Kisumu, you find that the planes are overbooked, something that I do not understand. Overbooking of planes is not only humiliating to travellers but also shows some sort of mismanagement. So, I think it is the high time the corpoation looked into the booking situation.Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, once again, I would like to thank the KenyaRailways Corporation very much because, for once, the derailments which used to exist have; disappeared. We never hear of derailments as often as we used to. This shows that the new chairman and the new general manager have taken their job seriously. However, it is unfortunate that since Independence we have not had any new railway line built in the country. What we have are the old railway lines which are still in operation. The time has come when we should have new railway lines, particularly from Kipkelion to Kericho through Kisii to Sough Nyanza. We have a lot of agricultural production in Kericho, Kisii and South Nyanza districts and if we could have the line I have suggested, it would be profitable.While still on the Kenya Railways Corporation, I know that we have ticket examiners on trains going to Kisumu. But the examiners should also be examined because we have seen examiners putting their own people in trains. The present examiners need to be examined too.Touching on the lake transport, it is unfortunate too that we have not had any new steamers in Lake Victoria since Independence. As hon. Members are aware, Lake Victoria is the second largest in the world, and what we have as of now are the old steamers serving it. Consequently, you find that there are constant breakdowns and the cost of maintenance has become very high. That way, passengers cannot use steamers as and when they need them. I would suggest that we now replace the old steamers in Lake Victoria so that we can have new ones going from Kisumu to Kendu Bay, Homa Bay, Muhuru Bay and up to Mbita. We need new steamers so that we' can also tap tourism to Lake Victoria.With those few remarks, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support theMotion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this very important Motion on the Ministry of Trans¬port and Communications.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if it is true that we; are1 voting this money, one wonders whether it is going to be used for paying salaries only or some of it will go towards developing this nation. We have been passing money here year after year to be spent by this Ministry and yet we do not see any tangible projects in various constituencies and districts. So, we are wondering whether we are only being asked to vote money so that parastatal bodies can pay salaries. Indeed, all hon. Members would like to know whether part of this money is going to be used for development in this country. We want tangible projects to be seen after we have passed this money.Turning to the Kenya Railways Corporation, I remember I put a Question in this House last year asking for a daily train to SERVE Bungoma and Malaba. Up to now that has not been done. I recall that during the colonial time when the population was less than it is today, we used to have a daily train going to Malaba. Why was that train stopped? Why should we have a train going to Malaba onee in a week? I wish to call upon the Kenya Railways Corporation to take this issue as very important because this is the only way wananchi will appreciate the money we are voting here today.At this juncture, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to call upon the Minister for Transport and Communications to re-examine the fares being charged by matatus and buses. Let us not take this for granted. If it is the Ministry of Transport and Communications in charge, of these matters, then why do we see matatus overcharging? What then is the purpose of having the Ministry if they cannot control such things? The Ministry must advocate the wanancni's stand. I am therefore urging the Minister to liaise with the bus and matatu owners so that, although we know that the petrol prices have gone up, there should be a certain percentage that is agreed on before increasing fares. We should not leave that aspect to just any individual who can just come up and say, "From today henceforth, I am going to be charging Ksh.300/- from here to Webuye".It is important for the Ministry to come into such issues because wananchi are suffering especially when exhorbitant fares are being imposed on them.Coming back to the Kenya Airways, I wonder why some employees were sacked from that parastatal body. There are shortages of certain cadre of employees in the Kenya Airways. I would like the Kenya Airways officers to recall seme of the important employees who they have laid off. I am also surprised that the most competent and trained personnel are the ones they laid off. What was the point of joining the service of the Kenya Airways? I would like the Kenya Airways officials to re-examine the procedures they used for lay offs, as it will be noted that they must have spent a lot of money in the training of such staff. I urge the Minister to liaise with the management of the Kenya Airways in that matter. I hope they will also address themselves to the current unemployment situation in the country. If the management is going to be allowed to sack people at any time, then at the end of the day, even other private institutions will start doing the same.Let me now touch on the Kenya Ports Authority. The reason why we do not have as much cargo coming in through our Kilindini Port is because of the high rates charged. They also did away with the grace period they used to give those who wanted to offload cargo at the Port. So, when you import youryour goods through the port, it is more expensive than airlifting them. The reasons for the raising of the rates should be examined, as it actually shot up by 500 per cent. It takes too long to get an entry passed by the Customs officials and it takes no less than a week to clear your cargo and yet you have to pay for charges that the customer, or importer, does not need to pay. We would like the Kenya Ports Authority to re-examine that aspect so that we do not have such high costs on those who are importing goods, as the cost will eventually be passed down to the consumers. That rate should be genuine and based on the limits of the documentation time.It is important that what we are saying is heeded and action taken to rectify the situation, even tomorrow. Let us not be taken for granted as people who just come to Parliament to shout while they just forget all that we propose in the House. We would, at the same time, like to commend the Kenya Ports Authority for doing a commendable job. I am not saying they are bad in everything, but where there are rates that are making it so expensive for importers, then we have to talk out for the management to take action. I am sure if they look into some of these proposals and deal with them, the Kenya Ports Authority will become more viable.Sir, all of us support the Minister in the manner that he has moved his Ministry's Vote, but we would like him to take note of all that we are saying here. The Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation has also done a very good job. However, the management of the Corporation should not be carried away when they hear every hon. Member here praising them for doing a commendable job. There are problems in telephone bills accumulating, collection of the bills taking too long and there is inconsistence in the services rendered. When you go to pay the bills, you have to stand on a queue for a very long time. Those are aspects that should be looked into.We are happy to hear that there will be a new introduction of a communication system that allows people to have cordless phones that canbe carried even in cars. For those areas that have areas that are out off from the communication systems, there should be a priority for those new introductions, especially in Western Province in places like Bungoma. It is important for us to have that much needed service. I talk of Bungoma here because Webuye is in Bungoma and I am sure the services will be spread to all the other areas.On the introduction of the Subscriber Trunk Dialling Services, (STD), I would like to agree that a good job has been done. However, there are some areas in Webuye where you find schools near Webuye like Sipala, Misikhu which do not have telephone services. I have been urging for this service for a very long time and nothing has as yet been done. The commendable job we are praising the management of the Corporation for should be seen to be genuine through the provision of these facilities. They should start re-examining the existing situation and see their own weaknesses with a view to correcting them. We would want the telephone services to be extended, where possible, even to the villages and schools. Some of these schools are very near post offices and yet they cannot get such necessary services. One wonders why that is the case.We would not want to have a situation where the Minister only appears to be here to have his Ministry's Vote passed and then nothing happens. This would create the implication that we only come here to talk without expecting nothing much to be done on the proposals we are making here. We would like to see action on all those proposals we are making here on the various parastatal bodies under the Ministry, like the Kenya Airways, Kenya Ports Authority and so on. The We buye people are listening to hear what we are voting this money for- and they would like it to benefit them, too.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. Hemed): Ahsante sana, Bw.

OMONDO: Thank you very much. Mr. Deputy Speaker. Sir,for giving me an opportunity to contribute to this debate. I wouldlike to start by joining my colleagues in congratulating the the Ministry for their great success in managing their portfolio  they have dene wonderfully well and we are all grateful for	theyhave done so well that they got into emport market, which is very important because the enport of our products to 			 territories and overseas gives cur enport industry leadersliip. This Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Kenya Forts Authority is doing very well and we do hope that it is going to maintain that level of performance and even improve on it. However, it is also true that there are areas which the Mininistry needs to improve. Therefore, is for instance, a problem in the telephone section of the Ministry. The Ministry has been complaining that they do not have enough money to do what they want to do. However, when you look at the way they do their accounting, it is awful. The service of a telephone is completed at the 30th of June but the contributor does not get the bill until August or September. That a delay! we have been told that the telephone services have been computerised. A computer as we all know, words at the speed cf lightning and therefore, if the telephone service is completed 2 on 30th June, at 12 midnight then surely by 4th of 5th of July, the accounts should be out, but they do not come out until much later. Perhaps the Minister should be able to tell us why telephone users have to wait for two months before they receive their telephone bills. At the end of it, the telephone user has a very large accumulative bill unpaid at the post office and yet they keep complaining that they do not have enough money.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, by the time that the bill reaches thetelephone user, he has forgotten what trunk calls he made and he thereforebegins to think that he has been cheated and he keeps wondering at to whetherhe made the calls or note He even goes to the eirtent of thinking that somecodyelse made those calls and rnrd his bills charged into his account. If he goesto the office to raise a query, he does not get satisfactory explanaticn becauseperhaps some of the people responsible have already been transferred to otherplaces and so on. Therefore, I would like to urge the Minister tomake sure that these telephone bills are issued no longer than seven to 14days after the date which they refer so that the telephone user could stillbe fresh in his mind as to what calls he has made. This is the only way bywhich to improve debt collection on telephone services. This is an anneal that I an making to the Minister and I hope he will do something about it. I personally have Sufferred.Mr. Deputy Speaker, normally, I make my own statement of account toshow I have used my telephone cut they! still show in my account hills that Ipaid two or three months ago. then I try to tell them that happened,they do not accept because they are in arrears in updating my account. Mr. DeputySpeaker, Sir, if you want to do a very poor business, he in arrears in yourdebt collection. In other words, credit control is vitai in this area andthe Ministry should try to improve on this.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is another area which I would like to touch on under the same department of telephone services. I think that too many of the telephone posts are made to stand at angles so that they do the gravitation force keeps pulling the posts until they fall down. Can they not not maize a sufficiently deep hole to keep the pole upright for the whole of its life. why do these poles leaning on one side? This is not right. They have spent so much money to instal these poles and nn the wires and it is unfortunate that they spend such colossal sum of money only to find that the oreation of the poles is wrongly done. why do they do this? The Henya Power and Lighting company uses bigger end thicker poles, but they have always orected thorn very 		. why cannot the Its poet office people not do their job properly.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, you will also find that too many of the telephone poles are eaten away by termites something that we ought in not to allow at a time like this when there is sterilization of timber. They can treat these poles so that they do not get eater, by termites. These are the things that the people in the field are doing and doing them 	 and I think the Ministry could eliminate these problems.However, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that the  way in which the Ministry has generally conducted itself has beer, very geed and this reflects well on part of the leadership cf this country. It shows that the leadership cf this nation is top class; it is so good that it has made it possible of for us to enjoy these facilities. The leadership of President Daniel arap Moi is exceptionally good. In this generation, AfricaMoi. This is why most of the Government departments have made so muchsuccess. WE have made so much development in the country as well due to thepeace and stability in this country, we are  enjoying such a peaceful timethat sometimes we tend to forget ± this and start saying that we are having avery difficult time. He should always remember that the effortsof the President have been so great that we have been acle to enjoy the peacestability that we are enjoying. This is why the economy of Kenya hasdeveloped so fast that Kenya is now at the verge of take off.The economic miracle that has happened in Kenya has been solely due to thefact that the leadership .in this country has been very good.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, those agents of disturbances who come here and try to create problems for us must ce condemned and we as loyal citizens must stand together against the enemies of this country. This is the only way in which we can prevent these disturbances and assiso Government to ; leads us into prosperity. All of us have to stand together against these disturbing elements. These elements have come here to tell us that they are democratic, but they do not seem to uns understand what democracy is. They are just parrots of whatever they have heard elsewhere. After all democracy started in Athens in Greece. What was the form of democracy in Greece. One—third of the Greeks kad the right to vote while the other two-thirds were slaves andeach Greek was entitled to two or three slaves and yet this country was boasting of having democracy. If you go America, the same thing happened for a long time and Americans used to boast of a democratic country and yet the American Kegroes the black people of America did not start voting until 1965. So, what kind of democracy were they having before 1965?Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, each country has got its own system of democracy, and you cannot say that the British system of democracy can operate in America because it cannot work. Similarly you cannot take the French system of democracy to England and expect it to work there because it will not. Kach country runs its democracy according to its tradition, according to itm cultural background and so on. Our Kenyan systemere going to stay with. Let no one come here and tell us that we must run our democracy like they do in Poland or in Spain because it will not work. This is because we are a different community. If the labour Party in Britain today wants to obstract the Government by use of grenades and bombs, would they still be tererated as the opposition. An opposition has to be loyal to the Government but they have the right to voice their disagreement within the regulations. Tne moment on opposition becomes disloyal, then it is no longer an opposition but an obstraction and here in Kenya we cannot torerate an obstraction but we shall crush it.Mr. Deputy Speaker. Sir, the Government in Kenya has been elected and it is under the leadership of Daniel arap Moi and it will continue to leads this country.with those few remarks, I beg to support.</’Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKASANU: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to join my colleagues in thanking the Minister for Transport and Communications for the very able manner in which he presented his Ministry's vote, I and for the able manner in which he is managing the affairs of this Ministry, having said, that, I would also like to take this chance to congratulate the heads of parastatals which fall under this Ministry, particularly. the Kenya Railways Corporation, the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation, the Kenya Ports Authority, Tne Kenya Ariways and so on. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the Kenya Railways Corporation and the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (K.P.T.C.) we must appreciate the wonderful role that the K.P.T.C. is playing in this country. Every constituency today has a post office, a sub-post office or a telephone exchange. All I would like to request is that the K.P.T.C. looks into the question of installing telephone facilities in all public institutions. We have various very well established chiefs' offices, divisional, headquarters, where district officers are stationed, large secondary schools and railway stations. We would like the K.P.T.C. to instal telephone facilities in these institutions because by doing this, we will be serving the public in the areas concerned better before formal telephone exchnages are installed there. In this regard, I wish to thank the K.P.T.C. for installing telephone facilities in my constituency. Very soon, I think the K.P.T.C. will be installing such facilities in Bumula. Recently, such facilities were installed in Nzoia Sugar Company and we are very grateful for this. However, I would like to urge the Ministry to extend these facilities to all the public institutions in this country because they are very useful. The place in North—Eastern Province where the Chief has established his office will become a nucleus town population wise. Therefore, telephone facilities there will serve the people of the area.	I would also like to thank the management of Kenya Railways Corporation for the job it is doing, but I have a few other remarks to make in this regard. It is unfortunate although this may be due to our economy's position that we have not extended our railway system in the country. Various feasibility studies have been carried out, one of which related to the Mumias—Bungoma railway line. I urge that this study incorporates Butere, Mumias and Bungoma because these towns are in a sugarcane—growing zone whose development could be enhanced by a railway line. At the moment, most of the sugar produced by Mumias Sugar Company is transported by road, and this is destroying the road there. If the Ministry speeds up the construction of a railway line particularly from Mumias to Bungoma, we will be very grateful. Wananchi are ready to donate the land necessary for the construction of this railway line. Notwithstanding our present economic base, funds should be made available for the construction of this line.Stressing on the point mentioned here by my colleague, hon. Mang'oli, I would like the Minister to know that there is a public outcry from the people of Western Province, particularly those served by the railway line up to Malaba, for the Ministry to increase the number of passenger trains on this line. We are happy that our brothers and sisters in Kisumu have two such trains as are those in Mombasa. During the colonial days, we used to have such service daily, but with the present increased population, we need this service to be restored on a daily basis. Statistics show that the number of travelers in this area has increased, but we get passenger train services only three times a week, and this is very inconvenient to our people. Congestion is very great on the three particular days of the week when we have this passenger train. We would like to get this service in Malaba, through Eldoret, Webuye and Bungoma. We have already approached the Ministry in this respect because this issue is very pertinent to our people. If this service is not going to be offered on a daily basis, we are going to suffer a lot from increased bus fares. At the moment, it costs about Shs.200/= to travel by road from Bungoma to Nairobi. If a passenger train service is installed on a daily basis, this will be within the economic capabilities of these people. We do not want to overstretch this matter, but this is an issue that the Ministry should consider seriously.With these few remarks, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOY: Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika, kwa kunipa nafasi ili niunge mkono Hoja hii ambayo ni muhimu sana. Kwanza, ningependa kumshukuru Waziri wa Wizara hii nzuri kwa kufika hapa na maofisa wake wa ngazi ya juu. Tunawaona maofisa hawa wa gredi ambao wamefunga tai na makoti ya gredi. Ni matumaini yetu kwamba maofisa hawa wamekuja hapa kusikiliza na kuelewa na yale tuyasemayo, bali sio kuwaona waheshimiwa Wabunge wakiongea tu. Wakifika maofisini mwao, maofisa hawa wanafaa kuyatekeleza yale tuyasemayo hapa.Wizara hii ina mashirika ya Serikali kama marine, mojawapo likiwa niKenya Ports Authority. Ni lazima tukisifu kitu kizuri na kusema ubaya wa kile kibaya. Tunaisifu Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation kwa sababu ya uzuri wake, bali sio kwa sababu lina Managing Director mwenye sura nzuri. Kama shirika hili lina mambo mabaya, tutasema ukweli. Shirka hili limesambaza huduma zake kila mahali Kila makao makuu ya wilaya yana huduma za subscriber trunk dialling na.huduma hzi zimefika katika karibu makao makuu ya tarafa yote. Hili ni jambo zuri. Kile ambacho tunaomba kutoka kwa shirika hili ni uangalifu katika ukaguaji wa deni za simu. Kuna watu wengine ambao hutumia trunk calls na wengine ambao wana direct lines ambazo hupimwa na metres. Kuna tabia ya mafundi ambao huja kurekebisha simu kuweka waya na kutumia line yako. Ukija kupa dai la deni ya simu yako, unakuta kwamba ni kubwa sana na haJLi unajua kwamba hukupiga simu mbali. Jambo hili linahitaji kuangaliwa kwa makini. Tunaomba kwamba mafundi hawa wawe wakirekebisha simu tu, bila kupiga simu mbali kama vile Kakamega, Nairobi na kadhalika. Tungependa Mkurugenzi Mkuu aliangalie jambo hili.Kuhusu shirika letu la ndege, Kenya Airways Corporation, ningepenca kusema kwamba ni zuri sana na linasifiwa sana. Ni lazima tulisifu kwa sababu ni letu. Mama yako ni mama yako tu hata kama ana sura mbaya. Lakini, hata tunapolisifu shirika hili, ni lazima tuseme yale mabaya yaliyoko. Shirika hili hutegemea wingi wa wateja wenye kusafiri kwa ndege zake. Ubaya mmoja ambao ningependa kutaja ni kwamba ukipiga simu kwa shirika hili, simu inalia kwa muda mrefu sana bila ye yote kuijibu. Simu yako ikijibiwa, utasikia mtu akikwambia, "Ngoja kidogo" lakini unangoja kwa muda mrefu sana bila cho chote kutokea. Wakati mwingine ni lazima useme, "Mimi ni mhe. Boy" ndipo uambiwe, "Ninaweza kukusaidia?" haraka haraka. Lakini watu wote wi waheshimiwa Wabunge.Bw. Naibu Spika, hili ni kosa kubwa. Ni laaima hawa watu watambue kwasba wate ja ni watu wa znaana. li lazina wajaribu kuongea kwa sinra kwa sababu si kila nitu anaweza kufika kule So in an ge Street, Kenyatta International Conference Centre	na kanhalika. Utaonakwauiba laakampuni yale mengine ya ndege yanafanya biashara nzuri kwa sababu wana uirusiano Erwema na wateja wao. lakini utaona wax any a- kazi wa Kenya Airways hukwaabia tu "We thank you for flying with Kenya Airways." Lakini utaona kwamba wakati awing ine unasafiri k.7a Kenya Airways kwa sababu huna njia nyingine. Ni lazina wafanyakasi wa Kenya Airways watambue kwauiba wateja ni watu muhi~ra.Jambo ling in e ni kwaaba kuchelewa ni kitu cha kawaiaa katika safari za ndege. Lakini utaona kwaaba wafanyakazi wa Kenya Airv7ays' hawapendi kuwaambia jKK.kHg wateja wao wakati kumetoka hali ya kuche1ewesha safari. Kama ndege ina_chelewa yafaa wasafiri waf ahaiaishwe. Kwa hivyo ni lazina saefisa wanaohusika wayachuiiguze aanbo hay a. Utaona kwazfna kuna naelezo raengine ambayo hayato ewi kwa lugha ya Kiswahi 11 na watu wa Kenya Airways  kszna vile uvutaji wa si gar a na kadhalika. Hii ±223: ina_cnyesha kwamba wao anaidharau lugha ya Kiswahili.Bw. Naibu Spika, Kenya Ports Authority ni 3_ ilrika zuri sana. Ni jambo la kutia moyo kuona kwasba huduma za ferry 3 as a zimechukuliwa na Kenya Ports Authority. Kenya Ports Authority ni mwajiri mkubwa katika nchi hii. Lakini utaona kwasba ijapokuwa shirika hilo limeajiri watu wapatao 20.000 ni watu wachache kutoka Mkoa wa 221 Pwani ambao wameajiriwa na shirika hili. Iiili ni jambo la kuvunja moyo. Lakini tukiuliza sisi hua^foiwa kwanba hay a ni mambo ya quota systexa. Sisi hatusemi shirika hili liajiri watu tu kutoka mkoa wa Pwani. Sisi tunataka kupewa nafasi zetu.Je, ni dhambi kusema hivyo?</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. LSvSSR: Si dhambi!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOY: Bw. Naibu opika, sisi tunasematu kwamba ikiwa Kenya Ports Authority wanataka kuajiri watu 5,000 yafaa watu 300 waajiriwe kutoka mkoa wa xccc Pwani. u?un.ataka watu waajiriwe kutoka kila mahali kote nchini. Hasema hivi kwa sababu kuna' watu wengine ambao hawautumii ule utaratibu wa quota system kwa njia mbaya.Twaishukuru Serikali kwa kutuletea ferry mpya. lakini kuna wasi wasi kuhusu uvuini kwamba watu wa miguu watakuwa wakilipishwa kiasi fulani cha pesa wanapoitumia ile ferry. Sisi watu wa Pwani tunataka kulipinga jambo hilo. Idimi namuunga mkono mhe. Said-Hemed katika yale aliy_oyasema kwa sababu yeye hutumia ferry kila siku. Kwa hivyo ni lazima jambo hilo liondolewe. Magari, baiskeli na mikokoteni yafaa yalipishwe. Lakini yafaa mwananchi wa riyayo aachwe aenae bila Iculipa.Bw. ITaibu 3pika, shirika la reli linafanya kasi nzuri sana hasa ya kubeba mizigo na pia watu. lakini jambo la kushangaza ni kwamba soi shirika hili limeajiri w kasi watu wachache kutoka mkoa wa Pwani. Utaona kwamba watu wengi husaf iri hadi mkoa wa Pivani. Sisi tunaunga mkono mpango wa quota system lakini yafaa kila wilaya ifikiriwe. Hii ni kwa sababu watu wengine wanarr-esa kuutumia vibaya mpango huo.Kwa hayo machache, naunga mkono.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

DEPUTY SPEAKER: Proceed, Mr. Kipkorir.</Newspeech>(laughter)<Newspeech>MR.KIPKORIR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we must congratulate His Excellency the President for guiding this nation wisely and for uniting Kenyans. Everybody in this country is enjoying peace, love and unity. Since we have unity in this country we should move forward in terms of development. I congratulate the Minister for Transport and. Communications for the able manner in which he has presented the Vote of his Ministry. The Ministry should install telephone facilities all over the country to enable our people to communicate. We must all work together and support the Government.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we need telephone facilities in areas around Tot Location. The service which exists there now should be improved because, for example, road communication network has deteriorated. In areas such as Sambria(?) Chesoi and Elbombut people need telephone facilities urgently and this has been accordingly recommended through our district development committee. We are only looking forward to having these facilities as soon as possible. We have a small pot office at Kapswar but we need the services improved and we also want to be given Transcriber Trunk Dialling (STD) system.so that we can communicate easily.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is a very beautiful area in Kerio Valley. Those who work in the Kerio Valley Development Authority need our support and we should give them an airstrip so that they can be able to communicate easily with other areas in the country. I, therefore, wish to call upon the Ministry of Trans-port and Communications to improve Tot Airstrip. The communication from Eldoret to Nairobi should be regularised so that we communicate easily. We also would like the airstrip down the Kerio Valley, which is murramed, to be improved so that wananchi can travel to that area and see the scenery for themselves. Most hon. Members have gone there and we would like many wananchi to travel to that area. During the 1985/86 Financial Year, the then Minister for Transport and Communications promised in this House that they were going to improve railway transport from Kambi Samaki to Kerio Valley, but up to now nothing has been done. Wananchi have been waiting to see what the Ministry will do to improve that service in order to enable them to transport the cassava, bananas and many other crops grown in that area.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we need to support our Government, particularly this man who has spoken several times about improving employment opportunities. I would like the Minister to make sure that in future the quota system is applied in employment. Every district should be given its quota so that the local people can be employed. We must thank our Government for the Gilgil Complex because itis a "tremendous part in our development. We must also thank the Government for creating" a peaceful climate because without peace you can never have such a projectMr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we must warn those who are going round opposing Government plans and giving distorted information, particularly church men. Those who are doing that must also come and participate in the development of this nation rather than just keep on criticising. As the President said the other day, it is very saddening to see some people going to undermine university students by giving false information. Those people forgot that some of the students come from poor families and are only interested in education. I wish to appeal to the Government to take action on the people who were inciting students so that we have peaceful development in this country. Everybody should be given an opportunity to enjoy and feel that he is in his own country.</Newspeech><Header>COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR</Header><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Members it gives me great pleasure in well coming His Excellency the President of the Republic of Kenya and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, the Hon. Daniel Toroitich arap Moi, CGH, MP for Baringo Cental who has found time on this very special day to be with us today. Today marks His Excellency the President's 35 years continuous and dedicated service as a Member of this House, first as a Member of Legco, the forrunner of this National Assembly which came into existence1 at Independence1. In Parliamentary language, he is the father of the House'.(Applause)It is, therefore, a great day indeed In our Parliamentary history for not only is His Excellency the President the longest-serving Member of this House but also the he is the President and leader of this nation. His Excellency the President took Oath as a Member of Parliament on 18th October, after having been elected on 16th October, 1955, together with the hon. D.W. Conrey, the hon. ChiefJonathan Nzioka and hon. (Dr) A.G. Walker. Those hon. gentlemen were sworn in at the same time with His Excellency the President in the Old Chamber.Since then, of course, a lot has happened in the political history of our country from colonialism to Independence. Under the first African Govern¬ment of the late Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, President Moi presided over the smooth transit¬ion to steer the country, which he has done so ably under God's guidance and under the Nyayo philosophy of peace, love and unity.Perhaps, if His Excellency the President will allow me, I would like to refresh his memory by quoting from one of the very first debates that he took part in, namely, on 6th December, 1955. Your Excellency, in response to a Motionof domestic servants by one Mrs. Shaw, in opposition you had the following tosay: -"Mr. Speaker, I arise .to oppose this Motion now before ?	Council. I am afraid that the hon. and gracious Lady*	painted the whole picture too rosy and I must be verycritical about the Motion. To introduce a system which is not far from the old condemned kipande does not please anybody especially the African. I suggest that the present system of registration is very comprehensive. If all the employers ensure that the photographs are affixed to the registration certificates, in my opinion, Sir, I feel this is a very comprehensive system."A fear should not arise if employers comply with the existing regulations. In 1948, the Government felt that this kipande system should be abolished, and I do not feel that this Council should accede to this Motion which is now before it. With your permission, Sir, I wish to quote what is in the Registration Laws of Kenya....Your Excellency, you went on to quote as follows:—"A man quoted in these documents should be checked against the identity card of a registration certificate for the order of this document."Your Excellency, I .would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you because then you stood for African dignity. (applause)You have over the years continued to stand for chat dignity and you are not ashamed to tell everybody in the world that you are not ashamed to be what you are, a black man. In congratulating His Excellency, I feel that we are really delighted and honoured to have him in our midst. I would like as many Members as possible during the current debate before the House, if they so wish to facilitate His Excellency the President on this very auspicious day to wish him very many more days, as he continues to serve this country. Thank you.</Newspeech> (applause)<Newspeech>MR. JALANG'0: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to debate on this very important Motion on the Ministry of Transport and Communications. However, before I talk on chat, I would like to join you and all my hon. colleagues in extending very special congratulations to His Excellency the President for 35 years of dedicated service to this country. (applause)I also wish to pray to the Almighty God to continue to guide this nation under His Excellency the President and to give him many more years to lead us in this country.While turning on the Motion under debate, I would like to thank the Ministry of Transport and Communications and particularly the parastatal bodies under it. Let me start by praising the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation by saying that for the first time, since the world began and, more recently, since Kenya attained Independence, my constituency got telephoneservices three months ago. This is in the spirit of Nyayoism, being mindful of others. If we say that we have to praise something which is good, I praise the telephone service that has, at least, been taken to the rural areas. While that is being done, I would like to urge the Ministry to look at each and every institution, especially the schools, market places and health centres. These are the areas the Minister should concentrate on. Right now, as I said, we have a telephone service which was installed three months ago, cut that is at the administrative centre. However, there are many other areas that require this service. I hope and pray that the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation will extend this service to cover each and every institution, not only in my constituency, but in all parts of the rural areas.While still on the telephone services, I wonder whether any senior officials or any hon. Member has ever tried to use the operator service between 6.00 a.m.-and 7.00 a.m. in the morning. That is always a very frustrating period for anybody trying to call the operator through the =30 code. You can wait for an hour for a response on that 900 code at the time I have indicated. I wonder whether it is normally a change of shift between the workers, or whether that is the time the operators decide to take a last nap before they break off for the morning. This has been a very extremely frustrating period for me particularly. Something must be done about it. If we have to continue paying glowing tribute to the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation, a snail thing like this should not be left to spoil the good work being done by the Corporation. This is one parastatal body we are proud of but we do not want such a small thing to affect the good that has so far been done.On transport, I would like the Ministry to utilise the waterways of LakeVictoria. This is one area which is so under-utilised that you find only two oldsteamers plying Lake Victoria. These are waterways given freely by god and theyrequire no maintenance; they have no bumps or potholes and not even any turmacking is required along them. They are freely given by God. I would like to urge theMinistry to utilise this freely given watersay</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order. It is now Five o'clock, hon. Members and, under the Standing Orders of the House, the Minister should be taking the Floor to reply. I assume that the Minister and hon. Members are in agree¬ment that we give him up to 5.30 p.m. to start replying and in order to allow hon. Members, to speak. I would like to request hon. Members to speak for a maximum of five minutes, although the resolution of the House is that each hon. Member speaks for 10 minutes. I would, however, urge that we take as short a time as possible so that as many hon. Members as possible can contribute to this debate.</Newspeech><Newspeech>mr. jalangSo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will summarise by urging the Ministry to increase or introduce modern steamers in Lake Victoria so that instead of taking four hours between Kisumu and Homa 3ay we could have a boat that will take thirty minutes. It is a matter of hardly 20 kilometres between Kisumu and Homa Say. Right now we have a very old steamer that takes four hours between Kisumu and Homa Bay.With those few remarks, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR FINANCE (Mr. Saitoti): Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I would also like to join my hon. colleagues who have spoken by extending our congratulations to His Excellency the President who is in this House this afternoon for having served this august House for 35 years.(applause)The fact that His Excellency the President has served for 35 years inthis august House is an indication without any doubt that he is really the mostaccomplished Parliamentarian that we have. Indeed, he is also our beloved Headof State. We want to state here that that his own very presence, if anything,serves as a testimony to the act that issues in this House are debated freely, openly, clearly and in a democratic manner. But the fact that His Excellencythe President has now served for 35 years, and this fact coincides only a few days after we celebrated the Moi Day, perhaps, it would not be out of order if I were to speak on behalf of the hon. Members to thank His Excellency the President for the dedicated service that he has offered this country over the last 12 years during which time the Nyayo Philosophy has taken deep roots into this country.It has been a period in which we have witnessed unparallel development; a period	In which Nenyano have enjoyed peace andstability. We should however, never at any time take  peace and stability for granted. We should all understand that if we did not have peace in this country, even, we, hon. members, would not be meeting here nor would we have been able to enjoy the development re have had in this country. Peace does not come to a country byitself but results from the country leadership. Indeed, We in    this country are very fortunate that our head of state is a far siftedman, who loves his people and believes truly in the democraticprinciples. It is no wonder, therefore, that our developmentcannot be matched anywhere else in Africa.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we also want to say it here rowand then very clearly for our adverseries that Kenyans all over the country have decided to rally behind our beloved President. The Independence and prosperity Which this country is enjoying are things that not willing whatsoever to sacrifice; Kenyans nail always stand firmly behind their President. We shall do so in the knowledge that those who are trying to cause chaos in the country have nothing to offer they only want to see shedding of blood of innocent people in this country. We, therefore, want to tell those people that as long as his Excellency the President is the leader of this country Kenyans will stand firm end protect this country.We also wont to say it here that en basis of what wehave read of late some of our neighbouring countries are our enemies.Since our beloved President has, on a number of times, statedclearly that Kenya has no wish to interfere in the affairs of other countries other countries should, reciprocate by not interfering in a do not want advice from anybody for we are advised and guided by our beloved President.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I alee want to take thisopportunity fo contend cur security forces for having apprehendedred handed a number of criminal elements who had entered thiscountry with the sole aim of trying to destabilise our country.We hope that if there are others on the run they will too be huntedDown and brought before a court.I want to end my speech by urging hon. Members that we at all tines resolve to stand firmly behind the President, the Nyayo Government and ruling Party Kanu. let us be united, stand firm and be courgeouo and state where we stand; we must entol the virtues of the Nyayo Philosopliy; we must tell our people the best things that have resulted from our Presidents leadership. We should tall: about expansion of education, 3-4-4 system of education, the four public universities, the 40,000  university students, the Nyayo words, the Nyayo Puses and many other things. those are things Kenyans are enjoying. Who else can be able to provide those things?With those few remarks I be to once again commend hisExcellency the president on this very auspices occasion. we wish him good health and  long life so that he may continue to lead this country to greater heights of prosperity.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER COOPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT(Mr. Karume): Ahsante sana, Bv. spika .nwa Innipatia nafasi .iii illnisene nachnche laahusu Hoa hii. laliLni habla sirafanyn IrLvyo.euenda ujiuna na wennanju irivlyu Ptvn.uTn Paishwa Irufnnya Pazi njunu aliyoianza wahati Poloni ali avv. no wonaIlvafriha huwa sawa nnyana.

First of all, Iwould like to say that this is a very important Ministry as it is doing avery important job for the country, and I appeal to then to continue working hard asare doing at the moment. Before I go further, I Would like to joinmy colleagues in congratulating His Excellency the President for the 55 yearslie has been a member of this House. This is not a short tine and scène of us atthe tine he entered this House for the first time, were not qualified on the groundof age to be in this House. Therefore, he has distinguished herself as the fatherof this Nation and a rise leader of this country. Having said that Mr. deputy Speaker. Sir, I would like to take thisopportunity to sound a word of Warning to those bent towards disrupting the peaceand stability that we have natured in this country for so long now. The peoplewho are causing trouble now in this country are amongst us. These are the lotsof koigi wamrere and Iris friends and the hole country condemns them withoutany reservations. The ordinary Kenya citizen is first and foremost reporter of the Nyayo government be a ninju and no in.That is to say that the ordinary Kenyan citizen is loyal to the President.

MEMBERS: Tomboai! Tomboai!</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTERS FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr.K’ombudo):Mr. deputy Speaker, Sir, we do not want to pretend or adopt a holier-than-though attitude. Leaders in this country should learn to be straightforward and fullysupport the Government wholeheartedly. As I speak in this douse, there is noGovernment in Liberia and the innocent Liberians have been dying from the gunsand hunger. As I speak, there is no food or water in Monrovia the capital ofLiberia, nor is there light. This is because the people whose responsibility itis to provide these things have run away for their personal safety at the countryside. Therefore, this is not the age for idealism . I am saying this becauseas we have seen internationally, the Eastern bloc has dropped their ismsand there no advocates of communism in the Eastern bloc anywhere now. Theyhave dropped this ideology in the interests of development of their countriesand for the material wellbeing of their people. Therefore, it also behooves usto sacrifice cur personal desires for the sake of our grandchildren and for the social and economic development of our people. This can only come about if there is peace and stability in this country.with those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILDLIFE (Mr. Gskunju):Mr. deputy Speaker. Sir, I would first of all like to take this opportunity tosupport the Vote of the Ministry of Transport and Communications. In doing so.I would first of all like to join my colleagues in congratulating His Excellencythe President for the 35 years that he has been a Member of this House and forthe various contributions that he has made towards the development, not onlyof deny a, but also of other countries.Mr. deputy Speaker, Sir, I would secondly like to thank the Presidentstarting a Nyayo-Bus Service in this country. This service has assisted our people in Nairobi and other terms in Kenya. I amparticularly grateful to His Excellency's initiative because the charges of the Nyayo buses, have influenced the matatu and private bus owners to charge reasonable fares to our people, Today the matatus and private bus owners are charging fares that are very close to the fares charged by these Nyayo buses even with the increase in the price of petrol. I am grateful to His Excellency the President on behalf of my constituents in Gatundu because today, the Nyayo buses are operating the whole day to and from Gatundu, and quite a number of people in Gatundu who work in Nairobi and other towns are able to go home every-day.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we also have the won en has union and I would like to congratulate our women groups for starting this business, which they have achieved ± through the initiative of His Excellency the President and I would like to thank him very much. We pra to the Almighty Cod to give him more life and good health so that he can continue to guide us. It was only yesterday at a meeting in Gatundu, that my people clearly said that they had nothing to do with the criminals who are out to destroy our peace and stability in this country. He do not want to see the type of bloodshed that we witnessed during the struggle for Independence. Cur place was the heart of this struggle and many of our people died and therefore, we know what chaos and sorrier can bring to us. He do not want to see guns because ire have already seen them in action, that we want is peace and nothing else. He want law and order and wet strongly	condemn people who are out to bring chaos and disorder intothis country.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we in Gatundu join ether Kenyans in supporting the Government and the ruling Party Kanu because we want to be sorely behind His Excellency the President. In contributing to the Vote of the Ministry of Transport and Communications. I would like to cay that because of the economic status of our people, it is important for the Ministry to encourage the use of bicycles and motorcycles.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think it is important that research is carried out into the use of bicycles, we know of very many developed countries whose people use bicycles, motor-cycles, mopeds and rickshaws, which consume less fuel than other types of transport.We would also like to see a lot being done towards improving communications  in the country. Our people should be encouraged even to write letters instead of waiting to make telephone calls. It is important to look at communications not only in respect of trains and buses. People should be ecnouraged to write letters as they used to do before.Finally, I would like to say that we should think of punctuality of bus Jbims—tables and cut down on the time that .people, waste waiting for trains, buses and planes that come late or do not come at all. If we have punctuality, we will become more efficient in improving our economy and living standards.With these few words, I support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.K. KINYANJUI: Ahsante sana, Bv. Naiba Spika kwa kunipa nafasi ili nami niungane na wenzangu kuhusu Voti hii ya Wizara ya Uchukuzi na Mawasiliano.Kwanza, ningependa kumshukuru sana Mtukufu Rais kwa kuwa nasi hapa wakati huu. Miaka 35 ni muda mrefu sana tukiangalia vile dunia ilivyo leo. Ni kweli kwamba watu wengi duniani hawaelewi kwamba Mtukufu Rais wa kenya ndiye aliye na maarifa ya kutosha kushinda mwingine ye yote katika Bunge hili.(Applause)Mtukufu Rais wetu anaelewa na Kenya yetu sana na mwenendo tulio nao katika Afrika. Mungu ametujalia kuwa naye, na anaelewa sana na mambo yalivyo sio katika Kenya peke yake, bali hata Katika Afrika nzima. Kwa hivyo, ninatoa shukrani kubwa sana kwa Mwenyezi Mungu kwa kutupa Mtukufu Rais kuwa kiongozi wa nchi yetu.Kama wenzangu walivyosema, ni kweli kwamba wengi wetu husikia vibaya sana wakati wachache hawaoni vile Afrika ilivyo. Liberia ndiyo iliyokuwa nchi ya kwanza kuwa huru, lakini sasa hivi watu wake hawana la kusema kuhusu vile mambo ya nchi hiyo yalivyo sasa hivi. Tunaon tie ft; am bo yalivyo katika nchi	jirani zetu, .lakirii haya yote yanafanyika kwa sababu watu wachache tu wamepatamadaraka. Watu wengi hawana moyo wa Mtukufu Rais wa unyenyekevu. Rais wetu alikuwa mnyenyekevu kwa hayati Kenyatta. Wengine wetu tunajua kwamba alitewa kwa kuwa mnyenyekevu. Ni kwa sababu hii ninawaomba viongazi waliopo hapa na wale walio nje ya Bunge hili wauige mfano huu mzuri wa Mtukufu Rais wa kuwa wanyenyekevu. Ukijifanya mkubwa, Mungu aliye juu atakuona. Ninamshukuru sana Mtukufu Rais kwa kuwa nasi hapa leo. Pia, ninamshukuru kwa kuwa Mbunge kwa miaka hii yote. Ninamworcba Mungu atujalie kuendelea kuongozwa naye.Kuhusu Wizara ya Uchukuzi na Mawasiliano, ningeomba kitu kimoja. Wakati umefika wa kuondoa magari makubwa barabarani zetu. Ni vibaya sana kuyatumia magari haya wakati ambapo tuna magari ya moshi yanayotumia mafuta kidogo. Magari haya hayatumiwi kule Uplands. Kwa hivyo wakati umefika wa kufikiri juu ya viletunavyoweza kuongeza matumizi yetu ya reli kwa sababu gari moshi halitumii mafuta	mengi wala kuharxbu barabara zetu. Pesa zile tunazotumia kurekebisha barabarani nyingi sana.Kwa hayo machache, Bw. Naibu Spika, naunga mkono.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Members, it is now 5.30 p.m., and I wishto call on the Mover to reply.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Kamotho): Thankyou, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I would also like to join my colleagues incongratulating His Excellency the President on his 35 tireless years of being a hon. Member of Parliament of this august House.(Applause)I would also like to take this opportunity to assure His Excellency the President that we; in the Ministry of Transport and Communications and all in this august House, support him and the Government fully in routing out all political dissidents, criminals and hooligans in our society.I will not say very much because the hon. Members who have spoken on the Vote of the. Ministry of Transport and Communications have all supported the Ministry and made suggestions that are extremely important. First of all I wouldlike to state that as a gesture of the thirty-fifth year of His Excellency the President's parliamentary position, the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation switched on 21,000 new telephone lines in Nairobi City today.(Applause)This is going to remove the congestion which subscribers have been experiencing in the past. I would like to assure hon. Members that all the points they have raised have been taken seriously and what is wrong is rectified. That is why the whole Ministry is here today.I would also like to assure the House that the new complex that was opened by His Excellency the President for the manufacture of highly technological equipment for telephone services will be utilised fully for the benefit of our national economy.Going further, many hon. Members have raised the point of extending services to rural areas, these will be extended not only to divisional headquarters, but also to all major commercial centres in the country. They will get subscriber traunk dialling services. I would also like to assure this House that the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation, which is one of the most decentralised parastatal bodies in this country, will from now on consider engaging local services in all unskilled jobs in district postal services and telecommunications.(Applause)	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, telephone exchanges we willbe installed in the market centres, locations, divisional headquarters as a follow up of our national policy of the District Focus for Rural Development Strategy. The first consideration will go to the local people.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to react to the points raised by hon. Members from the Coast Province about consideration of the Coast people when it comes to employing people in the Kenya Ports Authority and the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications. We know that our national policy of employment 	is merit. But environmental consideration is always taken into	account so that the local people are not forgotten when it comes to	the question of employment. But when you talk about an organizationlike the Kenya Ports Authority, surely an engineer is an engineer irrespective of where he comes from; an accountant is an accountant irrespective of where he comes from. Put for non-skilled workers, the local consideration will be given first priority. Therefore, as I said earlier, I do not want to bore hon. Members particularly on this very important day.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we in the Ministry of Transport and Communications feel greatly honoured to ask for money from this House in the presence of His Excellency the President. It is rather unusual and we therefore feel greatly honoured. I would therefore appeal to the House to give us this money and we will do our best to render to this country, the best service possible. I would also like to re-assure hon. Members that Kenya Airways will look into , whatever points they have raised about delays and so on. They aredoing everything possible to bring this to an end.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Members have also talked about the possibility of increasing cargo space for the export of this country's horticulture and other agricultural products. The Ministry in conduction with the national carrier, the Office of the President and the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Agriculture are deeply looking into this whole area with a view to getting a way of increasing the capacity of our national airline to carry our agricultural products to overseas markets. This is a very important area of our national economy and it has not been forgottenWith, regard to matatus and buses, I would like to remind the hon. Members that as far as the buses are concerned, fares have not been raised above what has been approved by the Government. For matatus, I would like to remind the hon. Members that back in 1973 the matatus were exempted from traffic laws in tills country and unless the House would like us to revisit the samesubject at a later date The Government will not hesitate tolook into the whole matter if matatus continue exploiting wananchi. I would like to assure hon. Members that the views they have express will be looked into.With those few remarks, I beg to move and also request the House to give us the money we are asking for.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order! Ordinarily, under our Standing Orders the Chair should put the question but I will use Standing Order Number One to allow His Excellency the President to	speak; he wishes to speak as the Member for Baringo Central.</Newspeech>(Applause)<Newspeech>HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT (Mr. D.T. arap Moi): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to join the hon. Members of this House to make my own contribution to the debate that has  been going;  on Vote 14 Ministry of Transport and Communi¬cations. I appreciate the debate; congratulations have been showered on those who moved the Motion. Also criticisms have been made. As .it is known in our own: country, from the time we attained our Independence, we are a democratic country. We fought to be free in order to carry out our activities democratically. That is why the words “For the Welfare of Society and the Just Government of Men" are written on that entrance into the Chamber. Of course this does not exclude Women. Therefore I appreciate the debates thathave been going on in the House. Nobody is prevented from criticising the Government because no one would like to entertain evil things. We want to uproot all evil in our society.(Applause)Therefore, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir it is up to	us myselfbeing the Member for Baringo Central  as Members of Parliament to make sure that we are building a stable country that is going to be inherited by our children. We should build a country that is going to be pleasant to all people. But we cannot build such a country out of hatred; we can only build it out of love for humanity.(Applause)Mr. Deputy Speaker. Sir, I still remember thedays when we used to sit as Members of the then Opposition in the other	House. There were six of us African Members ofthe	legislative Council and later on the number wasincreased to eight, We used to criticise what we thought was wrong; we almost criticised every single thing that was brought to the House simply because we wanted to be free.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to express my own cautious words of advice to you all. You are the custodians of the lives of the people living in this country. Your behaviour will naturally indicate how our people behave. We should advice our own people and educate them on how we should build our own country. We need more nationalism than tribalism.(Applause)Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if we succeeded in removing colonialism from this country because of our unity for one purpose  to be free  there is no reason why we should not remain united. If there was no nationalism at that time the colonial Government would have never been removed in this country.(Applause)A lot of things have happened. You have debated the Votes of various Ministries. I expect that every Ministry under the Ministers concerned, will make sure that every penny is properly spent. I also expect every Minister and his Assistant Ministers and Permanent Secretary to be sitting down together to know exactly what goes on in their respective Ministries; to checkwhat goes on every day and to advise their Juniors.You should not allocate an officer an office and leave his there to read newspapers. If such an officer sits in an office to read only newspapers how do you expect him to perform his duties satisfactorily?So, it is imperative that every Ministry must be active and eradicate the wrongs that are taking place. Ministries are not taken in isolation. If blame comes, the Minister at the top will be blamed.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, during this Session, I hope that the Law of Succession with regard to Muslims will be passed. I hope that the Attorney-General has set things in Motion. That law should be dealt along with other out-of-date laws that are being used against our people, and which should be either removed or updated.As to what goes on, I do not want to embark on what you have expressed. Mine is to wish you success in your debates. Criticise as much as you can and congratulate the Ministers and their Ministries for what they have done. Criticise them for the wrongs they have done. You do not have to support somebody whose Ministry has made blunders because he is your friend. Do not do that. When you criticise, you are helping him to adjust his position and to be alert all the time. So, I thank you for congratulating me for being in Parliament for the last 35 years.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have seen quite a lot in the past and I shall continue to see more. Some two or three hon. Members here were not born when I entered politics. Today is a special day because it was a Tuesday, 16th October, 1955, when I was elected and I made a Maiden Speech later. So, I thank God for having enabled me to serve Kenyans for that long period, and I shall continue to serve them. I want to say that all of us as leaders will remain for a certain period, but we should leave this country better than we found it. What goes on in other parts of the world does not please anyone. Those who love children should take care of what they say, what do and what they try to carry out. We thank God because Kenya is still a democratic country and we shall continue to be a democratic country in order to enable our people to say what they want, provided that they say good things and not what can injure others. We are building a country and nobodyelse will build Kenya except ourselves.With those few remarks, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion moved the Minister for Transport and Communications.

MAgakhanU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, although we have agreed topass this vote, you may have noticed that the Minister did not have enoughtime to reply to most of the points that we raised during debate on thisparticular Vote. Therefore, I would like to request the Minister to studyclosely, these issues that we had raised concerning, in particular, the issueregarding the extension of our railways services, which I personally raised.I had in mind the extension of the railway line from Mumias to Bungona and Iam glad to notice that under the item "railways services" some indication ofa second railway project has been made That is good, but we would, like to know there exactlythis second railway project is going to be undertaken. This is one of the issuesthat the Minister did not have enough time to respond to and perhaps he could consider incorporating at least some our requests regarding these issues in the subsequent planning and forward budgeting.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND HOUSING (Mr. Mutiso):Mr. deputy Speaker, Sir, there is something very important that I ought tohave told the Minister when I was participating in debate on this vcte.azdI would like to take this opportunity to inform him that while travellingby train, say for example from Nairobi to Mombasa, you leave Nairobi atabout 7.00 p.m. and arrive at Mombasa at 8.00 a.m. in the morning. That isnearly a 12 hour's journey, but the worrying thing is that there is no stoppingan the way, although the train halts briefly at certain stations along the line.It important for the railways services to provide a reasonable break somewherebetween Nairobi and Mombasa so that passengers can have some refreshments.Similarly, Mr. deputy Speaker, Sir, it is also important that thereshould be some medical facilities in the train just in case somebody falls sickin the train. The Minister should consider introducing a doctors service in train. There have been cases where people have fallen sick in the train but unfortunate there is no doctor in the train to take attend to them. Similarly, there have been cases where expectant mothers have had problems in the train and have had nobody to attend to them. This is an important matter and the Minister should consider is seriously.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: While allowing hon. Nyakiamo to contribute, would hon.

KILIKU: Mr. deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to appeal to the Minister to consider the points that we have raised seriously and to make sure that what needs to be implemented is immediately implemented by h± the officers concerned. We do not want to raise the same point next year and if thechallenged in this House. Hon. Members have contributed very well to the debate on this vote and have made very important points and therefore the Minister should make sure that these points are taken seriously. With those few points, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir., it is not my wish-to comment on what the Minister is going to do, but I wish to remind him of the train to Malaba. It is on record that we have put this issue to the Ministry several times, and the reply has been that the Ministry would work on it, but nothing has yet happened.With regard to postal services and telephone communication in the areas, I would like to say that telephone lines run over certain schools, and yet these schools do not have telephones. I believe that these services can easily be provided to these schools.</Newspeech>(Question put and agreed to) <Header>ADJOURNMENT</Header><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon.

D.M. AMIN: Obviously by next, week it will be ready.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: On a	point of order Mr. Deputy speaker sir this is a normal Questionit is not a Question by private Notice and normally the Ministriesare given these Questions in advance and they ought to have gotthe answer by now. So, I do not see any reason why the AssistantMinister should get away with it and just tell the House that theinformation is not ready. They are so relaxed and they are notprepared to work and this is what they were being reminded by thePresident yesterday.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M.

MWAMZANDI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir it is normal that theOffice of the Clerk gives a perform question are to the ministry and	 the Member of Parliament to enable the minister to answer as soon as possible.In fact , Since the Labour office is very near just up the hill willthe Minister agree with me that there is negligence in handling Parliamentary matters? That is why his Ministry would not bring the information in time. There is a sort of do-not care attitude from the Ministry.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. I.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not agree with the hon. Member that there is negligence of duty in my Ministry.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I still support hon. Mwamzandi because when a Question is put on the Order Paper, the Ministry knows and they are supposed to bring the proper answer to the House on time. If the answer is not ready they would have informed the Clerk so that he does put the Question on the Order Paper. Why should it be there if they cannot answer it?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, sir, as far as the Ministry is concerned we had informed the Clerk.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir There is a serious matter here where the Assistant Minister is accusing the Clerk's office that they have been informed and they still decided to put the Question on the Order Paper. I think this is fabrication. Would I be in a position to ask the Assistant Minister to substantiate? Did they write a letter informing the Clerk that they are not ready to answer? Otherwise he should withdraw that remark immediately.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will not withdraw and in the meantime I am waiting for information to give to the House as far as this Question is concerned.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOY: On a point of order Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister has to replied to hon. Mwamzandi’s Question. He challenged him to substantiate his allegation that they informed the Clerk either through writing or any other meansabout this Question. He should produce evidence here so that we can now that it is the Clerk’s office that decided to put this Question on the Order Paper. I think he wants to buy more time. We want to know whether it is true he informed the Clerk and then the Clerk's office decided to put the Question on the Order Paper. That is the question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M.

AMIN: I apologise.</Newspeech>Question No. 493 Payment of N.S.S.F Dues to Mr. ChepsorMR. arap CHEPKOK	asked the Minister forLabour when Mr. Kigen	R. Chepsor, N.S.S.F.No. 000-804-266, will	be paid his benefitsas per the Ministry's	letter SF/C/W dated 13th June, 1988.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINSITER FOR LABOUR (Mr. D.M. Amin): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Mr. Chepsor applied for his withdrawal benefits on 21st July, 1986 having worked with the Ministry of Transport and Communications, I think, from 1970 to 1986. At the time of applying, he was not qualified for withdrawal benefits since he had not attained the minimum age required of 50 years. The branch manager, Eldoret, forwarded the age assessment form of the claimant and a temporary file was opened for him. On 13th January, 1987, the claimant was requested to forward his retirement letter so that his age could be reviewed, but he did not reply. On 13th July, 1988, a letter Ref. No. FFC/W 00804266/ was written to our branch manager, Eldoret, requesting assist in getting the retirement letter from the claimant. On 24th June, 1988, the branch manager, Eldoret, forwarded letter Ref No. XF Eldoret 606 Vol.XI 113 that the claimant could not forward his retirment letter since it was lost.A letter dated 20th July, 1990 was written to the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Transport and Communications requesting him to forward a satisfied true copy of the claimant's retirement letter. We are still waiting for the reply. The claimant is now qualified for withdrawal benefit, and as soon as we get a satisfied true copy of his retirment letter, his claim will be processed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is why most hon. Members have been complaining about unsatisfactory replies to Questions raised by the hon. Members. It is now the third time that I am asking this Question in the House, having asked the same Question in 1986. I was then told that the man was going to be paid and that the process was on to facilitate the payment. In 1988 I was told the same thing, that due to some technical problems, the man had not been paid. I am now hearing the same answer and that the man is not qualified for the payment. The man actually retired from employment in 1985 after having worked for the Government for almost 40 years. The Assistant Minister, despite having that knowledge, comes to the House and states that the man had not attained the retirement age. Which is the truth now? What age does he require for the man to qualify for the payment?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I said that the man has now attained the required age and we will now process the payment.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think it is time you protected hon. Members. It is really surprising to hear the manner in which the Assistant Minister is replying to the Question. Somebody goes for retirement and needs his benefits but he has been waiting for the last three years. Is that normal?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I said that the first time the man made the claims, he had not attained the required age. However, he has now attained that age and we will process his payment.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Can the Assistant Minister stop misleading the House? The man retired in 1985 on the attainment of 55 years. How could he state in the House today that the man is only now attaining that retirement age, when he did that in 1935?</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR.D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I said that we shall now go on and process his payments.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell the House when he will remit those payments to that man? If he is going tomake those payments immediately he should state so, and if not, then he should stand up and say so.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we shall pay the man within the next two weeks.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is a well known fact that all of us have national identity cards which show the dates on which we were born. Therefore, I put it to the Assistant Minister that if they were following that criteria there would not have been any question at all of assessing anybody's age. Did he, then follow that procedure?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have just said that since the man has attained the required retirement age, we will pay him within the next two weeks.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I still differ with the hon. Assistant Minister. I have it from good sources that when this man went on retirement, he had attained the statutory age of 55 years, in 1985. The Assistant Minister still does not want to address himself to that contention. Why was that man not paid at that time when he retired on attainment of 55 years?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think there is a communication breakdown between the hon. Member and the Assistant Minister. Hon. Chepkok insista that the man retired after attaining the age of 55 years and the Assistant Minister, on the other hand says that the man has now reached the age of 55 years and will be paid his dues. Which is which? Did the man retire from the Civil Service prematurely so that the Ministry had to wait until he is 55 years old to pay him his dues? Is there some confusion?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, according to the records we have at the moment at the National Social Security Fund building, the man has now attained the 55 years and we shall pay him his dues within 14 days from</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if I understood the Assistant Minister, he said that the gentleman in question has just attained the age of 55 years. If that is the case, then will he be paid his salary from 1985 to date?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we shall pay him according to what he is now, a retired man.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOY: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. It is the tendency of this particular Assistant Minister to be bringing incorrect replies to this House. He says that they only pay people retirement benefits when they attain the age of 55 years, while the National Social Security Act was amended £o allow people to retire at the age of 50 years, too. The Assistant Minister is insisting that they could not pay the man because he had not attained the age of 55 years. Do you not think he is trying to imply that hon. Members are like kids, so that they do not even know that the law has been amended and that people are being paid terminal benefits even after attaining the age of 50 years? Now, if that is the case, that some people are being paid when they retire at the age of 50 years, why has the Ministry kept this particular man waiting until he gets to be 55 years of age in order to be paid his retirement benefits?(Hon. D.M. Amin rose in his place)Keti chini wewe.

BOY: No, I am also on a point of order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, do you not think it has been the tendency of the hon. Assistant Minister to be bringing incorrect answers constantly and also buying time for the Speaker to call for the next Question so that he can get away with it?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Muturia): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for the hon. Member toshout down the Assistant Minister by telling him "Keti chini wewe?"</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member was very wrong to use that un-Parliamentary language and should be made to withdraw.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The point of order here was if the Assistant Minister knows that the N.S.S.F. Act was amended so that people can be paid their retirement benefits on attaining 50 years of age. It looks as if the Assistant Minister is ignorant of that fact, in that he is still talking of retirement benefits only being paid on attainment of 55 years. If he is not ignorant, can he accept the correction from the hon. Member from Matuga?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I did not talk of 55 years of age. I just mentioned that the man had now reached the retirement age. That is the language I used</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order. Maybe to clarify the point, Mr. D.M. Amin, it would be good if you had this applicant's identity card with you and you could tell the House the date of birth as indicated therein. I think that would settle the matter.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not have the man's identity card, unless I check back for it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON.

Metto was an Assistant Minister, I was given the same answer that the man would be paid in 14 days. When the Assistant Minister comes back here and gives us "cooked" stories that are not correct, I can tell. I know that the man retired at the age of 55 years. I can bring that identity card to the House tomorrow.MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, according to the regulations,when somebody attains the age of 50 or 55 years, he is supposed to be paid.

KIILU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. could the Ass: Minister tell the House whether there is an alternative to the  birth certificates? The process of obtaining these certifier night be long and this family is suffering. Mould it do if area chief pave a document vouching for Nguvi’s children?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEah: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is not possible our Pensions Department to circumvent the law that was passed this hon. House and which makes it mandatory for birth certificate to be produced prior to the payment of pensions benefits. I once again ask the hon. Member to try his best to assist in t production of these certificates. I sympathise and appreciate problems and difficulties facing the widow, but it would be for us to circumvent the laws of this land in order to come aid muck more quickly than is possible without the birth certificateMR. KUBO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. we know that the is meant to ensure that the children are certified to be thosethe deceased. As hon. Kiilu has suggested, if evidence is pr to show that those children 	see why the Assistant Minister should continue insisting on production,of birth certificates and yet in some areas these certificates are not easy to cone by Would he, therefore, agree with me that, in fact, any notification of birth which is certified by a Government officer should be. enough for that purpose.</Newspeech>		- •<Newspeech>MR.Keah: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I do not think I would want, to commend in detail about that proposal. I can only say	. ..that if the hon. Member produces any of those proposed pieces of evidence we will consider it. But I must reiterate what the law is and so I cannot give a definitive answer as to Whether it is possible or not. I am aware that the procedure for obtaining birth certificates is long, but at the same time, if it is possible, the hon. member can assist by doing some legal work. All I can say	very authoritatively is that lion. Wambua ought to have assisted thelady to £et those birth certificates.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAHEJA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the answerfrom the Assistant minister, is he aware the the wife of the late Nguvi is now	sick and her children have been sent away from school? would he thereforeundertake to speed up the Payment of Pension benefits due to the late Nguvi if I brouht him a letter from the Chief confirming that this lady is actually the wife of the late Nguvi?

I am aware that the procedure for obtaining birth certificates is long, but at the same time, if it is possible, the hon.	Member can assist by doing some legal work.

The AssistantMinister is trying to dodge the question from the Chair by giving an answer inrespect of Kwale in general.	He talks about all the	31 clinical officers in Kwale,	but the Question here does not seek the number of clinical officers in Kwale. TheQuestion before us is specific.	It says that there is a shortage of clinicalofficers in Kinango Hospital, and not in Kwale District.	The fact that theAssistant Minister gives us July, 	1991 means that he does not have a ready answer, and that he is only holding on until the Chair calls the next Question. Would it be in order to ask him to come back either tomorrow or any other day and reply to the specific question of Kinango Hospital?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are specific instructions to the M.O.H. to post-two general and two specialised clinical officers to Kinango Hospital in July,	1991.If you allow me, I will make one specific statement here.	In the caseof specialised officers, such as doctors and clinical officers, we do not deal with individual institutions when we have an M.O.H. in charge of a district. 	What we do</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO: 	On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. 	It is reported that the Assistant Minister, hon. Ogur, caused an uproar in this House yesterday. Today, again, he is causing another uproar, and it is now clear to me that he is only in charge, but not in control, of the Ministry of Health. The Question here is-very simple, and we would have liked to hear from the Assistant Minister whether his M.O.H. told him if the clinical officers in Kinango Hospital are either sufficient or insufficient, on the basis of which he would have answered this Question. 	However, the Assistant Minister does not seem to have consulted the M.O.H. in charge of Kwale District. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. OGUR:	Mr. Deputy-Speaker, Sir, the House should agree with methat the M.O.H.  is in charge of a district and-that when we get a Question like this, we liaise with him and ask him if he could make some necessary possible adjustments in the case of an individual institution such as Kinango Hospital. In the meantime, I am telling the House that when we get two general and two specialised clinical officers in July, 1991, we will instruct the M.0.H. to look specifically into the problem in Kinango Hospital.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. 	The Question here states that there is a shortage of clinical officers in Kinango Hospital right now, and not in July,	1991.

We, Backbenchers, feel that the Chair is being very unfair by trying to protect the Front Bench. 	The Question here is very specific, but the Assistant Minister is tryingto give a contradictory answer every time and the Chair continues to give him more time to hold on to as we wait for the next Question. It is obvious that the reply he is giving us is not satisfactory, and all the Back Bench is asking is that he should give us a fair answer.	He should be given time to look for the rightanswer.	At the moment, the Chair is giving him more time to get away with ananswer that is not correct, and this is unfair.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: 	Before I give Mr. Ogur time to respond, I think this is a very unfair insinuation on the part of hon. Boy because the Chair is on record as having taken hon. Ogur to task in respect of the fact that this Question specifically relates to Kinango Hospital. 	So, I would have expected a better comment from hon. Boy. In any event, as the Assistant Minister says, the  Question specifically asks when the Ministry will post additional clinical officers to the hospital, in response to which the Assistant Minister has said that this will be done in July,	1991.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU:	On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.	We needyour guidance here because, as you can see, we have a problem of people dyingin Kinango Hospital due to a shortage of clinical officers.	Here is an Assistant	-Minister, who is supposed to be conversant with the problem, telling us that he	will post additional clinical officers to-this hospital in July,	1991.	Will thediseases killing these people wait until July,	1991?	We are now in October.	Isthe Assistant Minister satisfied that we should wait until July,1991?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.,OGUR:. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is no justification insaying that patients in Kinango Hospital are dying due to a shortage of clinicalofficers in the hospital because this is not correct.	We have given specificinstructions to the M.O.H. to make possible adjustments now.	We are going topost two general and two specialised clinical officers to this hospital in July, 1991. I say so because even after making justifiable modifications and posting additional clinical officers to Kinango Hospital, there might be a question as to why these officers are transferred to the hospital.

But I am ready to tell the House how machmoney we have spent on each project and the expected date ofcompetion for each project. As I was saying, we have spent some K3hs.12,179,000/- on the Wundanyi Project and we expect that it will be completed early next year.. We have spent almost KShs.41mllion on the Taveta-Oloitokitok Line.	This project has already cost us more thanthe originally estimated figure	KShs.40 million and it is nearingcompletion.  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the survey work has beendone on the Bahari  Lime and we expect a construction team to bedespatched to Bahari any time now. We have spent KShs. 6.3 million on the Malindi-Magarini Line. The estimated total cost of the project is KShs.11.5 million and therefore this means that is still some KShs.5 million to be spent on that project. The work is on-going.	We expect the project to be completed in April, 1991.Survey work has been done on the Msambweni Project and a total of KShs.1511000/- had been spent as at 30th June, 1990.

For example recently, my Ministry,through the Kenya Power and Lighting Company had a major projectin Embakasi. This project was being financed by the Government ofFinland. The project is expected to reinforce the total power supply to the whole country. That is a national project andsince we were given a limited period within which to implement that project it became necessary to move personnel from  some of these projects to that national project. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other factor is that there are cost over runs on projects.	An example is the	Taveta-Olcitokit ok  Line which originally was estimated to	cost KShs.40million but you will find that we have already spent over KShs.41million on that particular project.	That additional KShs.1million on that project has to come from somewhere.	Now, if we do not have the money on hand, we cannot keep people working on	that project thereby spending money which we do not have. So	,	it may be necessary to suspend work" on the project temporarily while looking for additional	funds to complete the project.	So, personnel may be moved from  one project to another due to lack of funds rather than influence from  certain persons.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

I stand on a point of order regarding an answer given by an Assistant Minister for Local Government last week. He mentioned that I encouraged farmers not to pay cess. Through the Chair,  I wish to move a Motion for the Adjournment of the House this afternoon to discuss that matter if the Assistant Minister is not going to apologise. We cannot allow Front benchers to mislead the country. It is not me who collects the cess but, rather, the National Cereals and Produce Board. Hon. Members are always expected to advise the people and not to collect cess. The statement by the Assistant Minister that hon. Members of Parliament keep on inciting farmers not to pay cess is very misleading. 	So, through the Chair, wish to move a Motion for the Adjournment of the House this afternoon.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mureithi): Hon. Chepkok, the procedure is that you must give notice of such intention to the Speaker in writing. So,  if you wish to move a Motion for the Adjournment of the House under Standing Order No. 20, you are at liberty to do so in writing and not verbally in the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: 	On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy, Speaker, Sir. My point of order is in connection with a Question I asked last week concerning the purchasing of a certain farm in Uasin-Gishu District by Lamaon Farm Company Limited.	I was surprised on Saturday	 I had not read the newspapers when an hon. Member of Parliament approached me and asked me whether I had different intentions in asking that Question.	I answered in the negative. On checking in the Kenya Times edition of Saturday,	I realized that there is a write	and I have no quarrel with the write who decided to write some paragraphs with very seriously misleading information. First of all,  the newspaper tries to connect my Question with the views of the late Bishop Alexander Kipsang' Muge.	I deny that this Question had anyrelevance to the views of the late Muge.	I question the intention of thenewspaper to impute that hon. Members feared to name the individual who was supposed to have bought the farm. 	How did the writer get this type of feeling? It was further alleged that there was a powerful individual who, perhaps, was behind the whole purchase and sale of the farm.	How did this writer get sucha feeling and put it on paper?	My Question" was straightforward.	I wanted toknow who bought the farm, when the agreement was arrived at and that was all. When such things are written in newspapers for all people to read, obviously, the people will have different interpretations, gossips, rumour-mongering, suspicion and spoiling of relationship between leaders. Whoever the writer had in mind, he should be able to substantiate, or withdraw the allegation. When we ask Questions in this House, there are specific to the problems of the people. If we knew there was somebody else powerful involved, we couldalso talk to those people. However,  to impute improper motives is in badtaste. I have not followed up on the other issues he has raised, but I would like to address myself this day to this inference to a powerful individual and the connection with the late Bishop Muge. I will not accept such an allegation and,  through the Chair,  I request that this position be corrected and, at the same time,  the reporters should stick to the issues raised here and avoid wide speculation and beating about the bush with wild imaginations. That will not help anyone, but will end up causing chaos and if we condone it, we will end up being gossipers and rumour-mongerers in the House and we are not here for that. So,  I seek your guidance on this.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mureithi): 	I am sure the people concerned have heard and will do what is necessary.</Newspeech> 	 <Newspeech>MR. MALEBE:	On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I rise to draw the attention of the Press to a report, I think it was by the Daily Nation, that there was a tribal clash in Maua Division. 	That was totally wrong as there has never been an incident of clashes among the clans in Igembe Division, particularly in connection to land issues. I am actually requesting the journalists to not just sit on their desks and write stories without knowing where any such incidences have occurred.	This is because this incident occurred in Ntonyiri Division and not in Igembe.	It is up to the reporters who covered such stories to satisfy themselves first on the geography of Kenya as it appears they are not very well conversant with it at present. This is why they just end up writing the wrong names of places in their newspapers. So, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was just raising this small word of caution because my constituents have been asking me about those clan fights, when they have not been in Igembe Constituency. I think the Daily Nationshould correct that impression and come up with an accurate report.	It is known,even as my colleague who has spoken before me has said, that the newspapers are telling lies and are causing a lot of problems to the people.	I think it shouldbe the last caution to the newspapers that the reporters should be getting their information accurately.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER 	(Mr. Mureithi): 	I hope they have heard that,  too,  and will take the necessary action.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: 	On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I rise on a point of order in relation to a Question I asked in this House about two weeks ago in connection with the Ministry of Works.	I asked a Question on road E705 from Makindu to Kiangini.	I had complained that the work on that road had not been completed.	The Assistant Minister in the Ministry told this House that the road had been completed.	I further pressed him to tell the House the name of the contractor who completed the project and he assured the House that he would he bringing the name to the House later on. 	A week has passed by and this is another just about to pass and we are not getting that information. 	Sir, I am made to understand that the same contractor has taken other jobs in other areas and has the tendency of leaving them incomplete.	If we havesomebody like this, who	just goes around collecting public funds without doingthe work he is supposed to be doing,  this House has to be concerned and hon. Members have to ask what can be done, particularly when there are tender awarding exercisesin our particular areas. So, through the Chair,  I am urging the Ministry of Publicworks to come up with a proper answer to that Question.	We were told that the roadis complete but we know otherwise,  that it is not complete as it is a road I use almost everytime I come to Nairobi from home. It would be wrong for anybody to stand up in this House and claim that the road is complete when I can attest to -the fact that it has not been completed. Sir, I also want to raise another point on another Question I asked in the House concerning payments to farmers.	The Question had been directed to theMinistry of Supplies and Marketing. The Assistant Minister rose and told the Housethat the Question had been transferred from that Ministry to another. I am looking for guidance on how this Question can be followed up because we would like to have an answer but nobody seems to be coming up with any.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mureithi):	I hope  those concerned have heard and will take the necessary action.</Newspeech>Let us go on to the next order.        <Header>MOTION</Header><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: 	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the following Motion. THAT, in view of the increasing demand for Kenyan industrial minerals and gemstones both locally and overseas and in order to increase foreign exchange earnings to balance our payments, this House urges the Government to set up a Mineral Advisory Centre to assist indigenous mineral prospectors in financing their activities and marketing their products. The question of the importance of the minerals in this country is long overdue. This is because minerals, particularly industrial minerals, for the back-bone of our natural wealth. The formation of a mineral advisory centre would provide a specific fool point point for potential mineral investors. So far, marketing of minerals their identification and even earning of foreign exchange from minerals has not been formal. The advisory centre would thus endeavour to formalize marketing, identification and investment opportunities in this country. It would in particular provide information regarding mineral resources to pontential investors.Mr. Temporary deputy Speaker, sir, all along we have been asking the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources to amend the Mining Act. As it stands today, is a colorial relic which does not give minerals their due weight so that they can earn foreign exchange for us. If establish, the advisory will also be able to recommend the necessary exchange in and also point out my procedure, or regulatory, might not be in confirity with mineral trade. This centre would also engage professionals like cologiste, mining engineers, project engineers and emlogists be handle mining proposal from potential investors and also direct the investors to appropriate financiers. Today the banks do not Mineral trade; so even if you presented your proposals to a bank totally, it would have no where from which to confirm whether the trade in minerals is viable or not. Therefore, an advisory center would provide the necessary information be Institutions and increase availability of financial  For mineral development   Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, formal mining earning us a lot of foreign exchange. For example, in the five years the country has been able to earn more than 2500 from minerals. But statistics on these earning show that per cent of this figure is contributed by one mineral, soda asg, which is mined somewhere in Najiado District. Ava at the Ministry shows that few precious minerals we have like gemstones have surprisingly over the last 10 years given on 10 million in foreign exchange. Now one wonders what happen bulk of the most precious minerals like gold and other that have in this country. </Newspeech>QUORUM<Newspeech>Dr. WAIBYO: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. We do not have a quorum in the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mureithi): That ring the Division Bell, please</Newspeech>(The Division Bell was)<Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mureithi): we he quorum in the House now; coutinue, Mr. Malebe. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEE: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was saying I note that precious minerals like gold, transanites, did and other seem not giving us much foreign exchange earnings; the last five years we have earned from then only 10 million. We know there is a lot of mineral trade daily in our streets a one wonders where all this money goes.   So, Kr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, you will find, that most of our precious minerals are used for making bangles, rings, earings or even belts and then smuggled cut of the country. This is because you are not going to step anybody  from wearing earings necklaces or hells that are made of old.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have also discovered other precious Minerals sulphurite which is mined in Taite you will find that these particular minerals are in  demand in the Eastern countries. When I recently visited Hong Kong I noticed that the demand for African precious minerals in very high cut it seems that there are no mines in Kenya because they only talk about the 	 South	African precious Minerals, but they never talk about the gemstones that aremined in Kenya. This means that the trade imbalance between our country and those Eastern countries should be checked. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, most of the districts in Kenya would be very rich if the minerals in those districts would be exploited fully and sold in a formal way. For example, we have a lot of gold in West Pokot and we have small scale miners and you will also find that wananchi there have formed small cooperative societies aimed at collecting and selling these Precious stones. There is a lot of minerals in River Turiwel and River . I understand that  there is also a lot of and gold in the Kachelilea area. However, all these minerals   have remained untapped for years and the little that is mined perhaps never reach the market. Then you go through the statistics, you notice that it is not indicated how much gold is worth in this country. Mr. Temporary  Deputy Speaker, Sir, we also have the industrialminerals. These are the minerals a that are mined in bulk and they are us supposed to be used for certain industries in Kenya. We would have made Kenya an industrial country if we were able to tap fully, our industrial minerals. For example, we have a lot of iron ore in Kenya. We have for instance in Tharaka, in Meru District, a lot of iron ore at arimanti. There is also some iron ere in some parts of Kitui District at utha: There are also other areas in the country where there is a lot of iron are. It the moment, Kenya is anticipating in manufacturing the first    be able to intensify the mining of iron ore so that we can be  able to smelt it and use it for the manufacturing of our Nyayo car.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the establishment of the mineral advisory centres will go a long way to create employment opportunity to ourpeople. At the same time, these centres will also offer transfer of technology into our country. I am saying this because when we have foreign investment taking place in this country, we shall be having joint ventures with outside mining experts end consequently, this would bring about the transfer of technology into our country. Our local specialists will be able to work with these foreign experts and in so doing, we shall be able to intensify the transfer of technology into our country.Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other advantage with these mineral advisory centres is that they will bring about the awareness of the important of minerals in this country. We have for example, the "natural sun" which is used to manufacture glass. The Kenya breweries are now using bottles made from local "silk glass" which is mined in the Kilifi area, and along the coast. We could also be self-sufficient in the production of cement in this country if we could encourage the local investors to buy more limestones particularly in Central Kenya, namely, hajiado and so on. Industries should be established in these areas so that the cement, industries would he produced with less inputs so that the price of cement per ton would be reduced. However, since the resources are very far  away from the manufacturing points, you will find that the price of cement has been, escalating from time to time.Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, at the moment, we have for example the Turirwel Dam and since we has have a lot of gold that flows down the Turlrwel River all the way from Lake Turkana, this dam wi11 act as a filtering point for this gold. As we all know, gold is a very heavy material and eventually, you will find that due to siltation, there will be a lot of gold accumulated in the dam itself. I hope that the miners will try to work closely with the dam operators so that after a period of say, two years, they would he ableTo scoop it and filter the gold.Currently, Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the country is not mining a lot of gemstones.This is because there has been a on miningat  our  national parks and I would like to aim appeal to  the Government  to lift this   an which was imposed in 1988. I am  saying this because miners. themselves cannot be poachers.  In fact, if we had regulations governing mining in our national Parks,  the miners would work very closely with the Kenya Game Department and would work as informers to curb Poaching. We cannot classify the miners therefore,  with poachers and therefore, I appeal to Government to lift this ban.  I am saying this because we have a lot of ruby and diamond.  This had should be lifted immediately. In fact, the lifting of this ban is long overdue. I understand a team of Ministers are reviewing this issue  and we expect them to tell us what is happening. We would like to call upon the Government to lift this ban so that our miners are allowed to go back to the national parks.is because most of our mineral reserves are in these national parks.  We  also  have  many  qualified professionals  and, once  this  centre  is  established, they  should be  used to disseminate information to prospectors. This centre will be a focal  point  for all  mineral dealers,  and nobody  will  be afraid of carrying minerals.Even  the  licensing of prospectors will be quite  often and everybodywho  finds precious minerals will be-able  to sell  them openly. Once  this  trade is  made  open,  even  in  the  case  of gold,  the  centre  will  earn a  lot  of money  from it. At  the  moment,  this  trade  is closed due to the cumbersome, provisions of the relevant Act  and prospectors tend to sell minerals  under cover,  in which case, the  Government  fails  to get much-needed  foreign  resources.Once  this  centre  is established,  it will  act as  a strong  industrial  mineral  base  and become  complimentary to  the  Ministry. Finally,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the President  for  having encouraged  the  relevant  council  to  explore  minerals. I  also appreciate  his 35 years  of political  experience,  as  a result of which he  has  been able  to guide  this  country  to  prosperity. I  would  request hon.  Mcharo to  second the  Motion.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  MCHARO: Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.. Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  for giving  me  the  opportunity  to  second  this  very  important  Motion.Before  I  dothat,  however, I would like  to join my colleagues who spoke yesterday  congratulatingHis  Excellency  the  President  on  clocking  35 years  of  very  fruitful  service  as  anhon. Member of Parliament  in  this  country and on  leading this  country so peacefully as  the  President  up  to  this  day. We  would  like  to  pray  to  Almighty  God  to give  himmore  years  to  continue  leading  the  country. I also  join  my colleagues  in  condemningthe  dissidents who are  trying to create  a situation of instability in this country.Whatever deliberations we carry out here,  they are  a result of the peaceful  climatethat has been  created by  His  Excellency  the  President.This  Motion  is  in  line  with  the  Government policy of industrialisationso  as  to  diversity  the  economic  activities  of this  country. The  Mover  understandswell  the  mineral  situation  in this  country because  he  himself  is  a geologist,  and I  think  what  he  says  should be  taken  quite  seriously. He  is  asking  for  the   establishment  of a  mineral  advisory  center in  this  country  to  enable mineral prospectors  in  this  country  to  know where  various  types  of minerals  are. This centre would advise  those  engaged  or-want to  be  engaged in  the mineral  business in  this  country  in a  proper way. We know very well  that this country is  full of mineral  resources,  and  that  these  resources  have  not been properly  exploited. In  fact,  they   have  not  even been  explored properly,  and we  would  like  to see  the Ministry  of  Environment  and Natural  Resources  going all out  to  locate where the different kinds  of minerals  are  in  the  country. When  we  were  young in school, we used  to  hear  of various  types .of minerals  in  Kakamegai,  including gold which we believe  is  still  there,  soda  ash  in  Magadi,  and  many  others  in  different  parts of  the  country. In  my  own  district,  Taita-Taveta District,  for  example,  there  are a lot  of gemstones,  as  has  already  b en  indicated by the Mover  of the  Motion. So, we  would  now  like  to  see  the  Government  doing  everything possible  to  inform  the country  of where  our  various  industrial  minerals,  precious  gemstones  and so  on, are  in  the  country. These  minerals  should  be  located  in geological  maps  so  that if  I  or  any  other wananchi  wish  to  engage  ourselves  in mineral  business may know clearly  where  we  can  find  them  rather  than relying on  mere  guesswork. We  would  like  to  see  as  many  mineral  engineers  as  possible  being trained  in  this  country  so  that  they  can  be  engaged  in mining activities.  The suggested mineral  advisory  centre  would go a  long way  in advising these  engineers and  whoever  else  is  engaged  in  these  activities  and give  them  first-hand information  on  exactly what  they  are  supposed to  do  in mineral  exploitation. This centre  should be  stationed here  in  Nairobi  as  the  headquarters  of other centres to  be  established  where  the  minerals  are  located  in  plenty. I  would  like  to  see such  a  centre  in  Taita-Taveta District  located  somewhere  in Mwatate  or Voi where there  are  a  lot  of gemstones. The  people  there  who  want  to  engage  themselves  in this  business  would  easily  walk  to  this  centre  and seek  the  various  types  of information  they  require. Currently,  I  know  that gemstones  in  my  district are mined in a very haphazard manner. The people  involved  just pick up stones in the hush and justgo  to  the  market where  they sell  them. This  kind of situation has  attraced a lot of conning and many people have  lost a  lot of money this way. So,  we  would  liketo  see  a  mineral  advisory centre  advising the  local people on what kind of mineral they  have  picked up  in the bush. When  they  pick  up  a valuable mineral,  they  should be  advised on  its  value and a company goes  there  to establish a profitable mining business  there. It  is  a  fact  that  our minerals  are being exploited quite a lot by foreigners.  I myself have  seen  foreign prospectors in various parts  of the country looking  for  gemstones,  and  I  believe  that they are making lucrative profits out of  these-minerals. We  would  like  their  activities to be properly controlled,  and the  suggested mineral  advisory centre would do a good job  in controlling them, which would enable  us  to know exactly what kinds of minerals they are exploting and how much  of them they are  selling. This  would also enable  the  country to get its  rightful  share  of the value-of minerals  that are being mined by foreigners by  means  of  relevant  taxation. It  would  also  curtail  our minerals being minedand taken overseas  through dubious channels. One  responsibility of this centrewould be  the monitoring of the  activities  of all those who are engaged in mineral prospecting  so  that  they benefit not only the Central Government,  but  also  local authorities.   Such benefits  would enable  local authorities to render-the required services  in  this  country.  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  we  must look for iron   ore  deposits  in this country  and exploit  them fully.This  is because  iron  ore can assist this  country a great  deal in developing various  industrial  complexes. It  is not  easy to  child the NyayoCars unless We  adequate  iron  ore  deposits  in this country.Weshould not  rely on imported raw materials  for our industries. Weshould go  out  and  exploit own local raw materials  so  as  to  developindustries  in this  country using locally available  raw materials. This  will  enable us to  create more  and more  employment  opportunities for our people. That  is  the  reason why  I  stated earlier on thatthis Motion is  in line  with the  Government's policy of  industrialization. Therefore,  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I urge  this House  to  give  this Motion full  support.The Motion does not require  any amendments. It  is  a very  straightforward Motion. It  isclearly calling for the establishment  of a Mineral Advisory Centreto  give our people advice  regarding the  mining industry. This  Centre will  spearhead the mining activities in this country;  it will  organise  and  regulate the mining industry and trade in this country. It will  advise  on the  training of different kinds ofpeople on how do mining and on how to carry out the marketing activies  of these products  for the  benefit of this  country.With those remarks,  I beg to second the Motion. </Newspeech>(Question proposed) <Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT  MINISTER  FOR  FOREIGN  AFFAIRS  AND INTERNATIONAL  CO-OPERATION (Mr.Munyi): Thank you Mr. TemporaryDeputy  Speaker,  Sir,  for giving me this opportunity  to  make  mycomments   on  this  very  important  Motion which  has  been  moved  byhon.Malebe. First   of  all  I  would  like   to   join my  colleagues  in congratulating  His  Excellency  the  President  at  this  time  when  we are   celebrating  his 35th  year  as  Member  of  Parliament. We   are grateful to His  Excellency  the  President  for  the  way  he  has  led this  country. He  has  promoted  stability  and  peace  both  here within  Kenya  and   also  in  many  parts  of  Africa. Having  said  that,   I  would  like  to  tell  hon.  Members  that Mineral  Advisory  Centre  which  this  Motion  is  urging  the  Government to  establish will   just  be  like  the   Investments  Advisory  Centre. This  particular  Centres  invites  investors  from  other  countries  to our  country  and  look  for  possible   areas  of  investment. It  will be                 the  same  with minerals. I   agree  with  the  Mover  of  the  Motion  when   he  says  that  foreigners  come  to Kenya to  do mineral exploration. because   they  know  that  we  do  not  have  a keen  interest  in mineral prospecting.Let  us  exploit  our  mineral  resources  because  this  will help   our  country  to  grow  economically. We have  got  gemstones  in Kasigau  and  Voi  areas  in  Taita-Taveta District.We have   got   a  lotof  rubies   and  saphires  in  that  area.But  you  will  find  that thosewho  are  benefiting  from  these  minerals  are  foreigners.Mineralprospecting  in  this  country  is  being done  by  foreign companies.So,   we   should   start, as  African, to venture aggressively  into  the  mining  industry. A  good  examplewas  given  by. </Newspeech>QUORUM<Newspeech>DR.  WAMEYO: On a point  of order,  Mr.  Temporary DeputySpeaker,  Sir. While  discussing this very important Motion,  theHouse  has no quorum. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER  (Mr.Mureithi): Ring the Bell. </Newspeech> (The Division Bell was rung) <Newspeech>THE  TEMPORARY  DEPUTY  SPEAKER (Mr..Mureithi):  Order,  hon.  Members.Wehave a quorum  now.Proceed,  Mr.  Munyi. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT  MINISTER  FOR  FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND  INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION(Mr.  Munyi): Thank you  very  much,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir. As  I  was  saying,  when  this proposed  centre  is  established,  a lot of information will  be  given  by prospectors  from  the country;  they  will  be  going  to  the  centre to give  information. Even hon.  Said-Hemed,  the  Assistant Minister  in  the  Ministry of Environment  and  Natural  Resources,  will  agree  with  me  that  the proposed  centre will  be of great  importance. Not  only  that,  he is  also  aware that  countries  like Saudi  Arabia,  the United  Arab  Emirates  and many other Arab countries  are after gemstones  and  they  like gemstones  from  Kenya. Go  to  Dubai  and other  areas  suchas  Oman,  you will  find  that the  people  are after gemstones  from  Kenya. They  canpay  anything  for  rubi  from Kenya. Why  can we  not  take  this  opportunity when thereis peace and stability in Kenya to enable prospectors from those countries buy gemstones  from  Kenya? In  exchange,  we  shall  be  earning foreign exchange. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,  besides having the proposed centre, we can have regional  centres  in the provinces  where  information can be given.   We  can  do  the same  as  we did  when we dealt with the question. of museums.  This centre  will  be  very  important  to  a mwananchi  from  the rural  area who may pick up something  in his garden and wants  it to be verified. Such  items  would  be  checked and  verified  by  our geologists or miners and that  is  for the good of our country. This  is what happens  in countries  like Nigeria,  Libya and the Central African Republic where there were no minerals at independence but where minerals have been  discovered. In  fact, those countries have discovered oil and other industrial minerals. I  do  recall  that the Seconder of the Motion referred to the question Of  finding  iron  ore  in Kenya,  and  I would like to tell him that if you go to areas G like Tharaka in Meru District, there is a very big hill which,  according to reports; contains  a  lot  of  iron ore. That  iron ore could be used properly if the hill was converted  into  an  industrial  factory. Many  people would be  employed  as  a resultof utilising  that  iron ore.Why  do we not  make  use  of that  iron  ore. We haveKenyan geologists  and  miners  who  can move to Tharaka hill  and  start prospectingand  mining.Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir, if you go  to Moi  Avenue,  KimathiStreet  and  the  rest,  you will find a  lot  of  gemstones  being sold  to  tourists.Most  of  those gemstones  are  from Samburu District. If we  can make use of all  theminerals  available in the country,  we would  earn a lot of money. Indeed,  theSouthern.part of Embu District has  a lot of minerals and gemstones  such as  saphire and  others , and  I  think  the hon.  Assistant Minister  taking notes  is  aware of that fact. We should  take maps  and keep  them  in  the Mining Department of the Ministry of Environment  and Natural Resources so that we can use the available data in future.  When,  for  instance,  we get orders  from Bangkok,  which  is  in the Far East, we can  use  that data to extract more gemstones.  We  are  already  selling gemstones to  Bangkok,  but  that  is not enough. We  should  try  and exploit areas  such asNamanga and  others,  and we should  invite prospectors  to mine there. Even  localpeople  should be allowed  to prospect. It  is  only  when  they  are allowed to prospectthat  they  can give very useful  information to the proposed centre so that the Government can map out the areas where mining operations should start. At  the moment,  Sir,  potential  prospectors  fear that if they report or give  information regarding minerals and gemstones  in the country they will get the  negative  response.  But  if an mineral advisory centre is established,  everybody will  be free to give information regarding these very important items. With  those few remarks,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I  beg to support  the Motion. </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR.  MANG'OLI: Thank you  very much,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir, for  giving me  this  opportunity  to contribute to this very important Motion.  I hope  that  the  hon.  Minister is not going to amend this particular Motion because it  is  calling for the establishment  of a very  important  institution to deal with financing  and  marketing mineral  resources. I  hope that  the hon.  Mover of the Motion could leave the Assistant Minister alone so that he can listen to what we are  saying. (Hon. Malebe continued  talking  to hon.  Hemed) Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  a very important Motion and  it  has  come at  the right time. I  only  wish  that  the hon.  Mover  could  leave  thehon.  Assistant  Minister  alone  to  listen  to what  I  am going  to  say. I  wish  todraw  the  attention of the Assistant Miner that there was  a gold mine in Kakamega .but,  because of  the  colonialists  selfishness,  they  made  sure  that the place was abandoned  and  there  is  no more  gold  mining  in  that area. This  proposed  advisory centre  should  be charged with  the  responsibility of looking at those  abandoned areas  where we used  to  have gold. It  should  even go  further  and  look  at  areaslike  Kimilili  where we used  to  have paraffin. This  is  important  because todayour  minerals  are predominantly  being run by  Asians  and Europeans. The  time  hascome  when  the  proposed  centre should  concentrate on  the  indigenisation  of mining in  this  country. I  hope  it  is  not  the  normal  noise  we  make  in  this  House  I  would also  like  to  congratulate  the  Ministry  for  the  good  work  they have  done. I  hope  the  Motion  after  being  passed  is  not  goingto  be  put  in  a  shelf  somewhere  in  the  office. This  has  beenthe  practice  many  times  we  have  asked  Questions  as  to  why  certain Motions  have  not  been  implemented. We  speak  here  loudly  and  clear and  give  the  suggestions  on  how  to  improve  this  particular industry  and  yet  the  Minister  does  not  take  serious  note  of what  we  say  here. It  is  my  sincere  hope  that  the  Minister  who is  in-charge  of  these  minerals,   is  going  to  establish  an advisory  centre  to  cater  for  these  minerals. I  say  this  bearing in  mind  another  centre  which  was  established  on  the  same  line like  the  Industrial  Centre. The  advisory  centre  should  be  ableto  have  good  visions  for this  nation. We  are  looking  at  thesame  time  at  the  possibility  of  creating  more  employment opportunities. We  are  not  going  to  keep  on  allowing  Asians  andEuropens  to  take  money  out  of  this  country. What  this  advisorycentre  will  be  doing  is  to  ensure  that  no  raw  material  is  sent outside  this  country.  It  should  ensure  that  all  the  products are   finished  here  and  marketed  in  our  country  so  that  we  can  get the  total  value  of  the  minerals. Today,   Mr. Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,   if  you  go  to  London  or  the U.S.A/  you  will  see  that  there  is  a  lot  of  money  being  made  on minerals. I  am  referring  to  the  developed  countries  because they  have  made  a  lot  of  money  from  the  Third  World  countries. We  are  telling  them  that  we  have  qualified  personnel  to  run  this Particular  centre.  It  is  my  hope  that  we  are  not  joint  to  be  told that  after  we  have  established  this  centre  there  are  going bring  an  European  or  Asian  come  and  rim  it  because  we  have  qualified Africans  here. I am saying  this  loudly  and  clearbecause  we  should  be  proud  to  be  Africans  now. Mr.   Deputy  Speaker,   I  call  upon  the  Minister  to  realize that  the  minerals  are  almost  second  or  third  to  tea  and  coffee as  far  as  foreign  exchange  earnings  are  concerned. If  this industry  is  properly  controlled  we  will  earn  a  lot  of  foreign exchange. Tourism  depends  on  the  political  status  of  acountry; it  is  not  consistent. This  is  an  area  that  theGovernment  must  put  a  lot  of  emphasis  on  so  that  the  money  that is  realized  from  this  particular  industry  comes  back  to  this country. Some  people  have  collected  minerals  sold  them  for, say  shs.10,000/=  when  the  market  price  overseas  for  the  same mineral  is  between  shs.5  million  to  shs 10  million. I  haverealised  that  one  gramme  of  some  mineral  in  London  fetches  overtwo  million  shillings. The  same  minerals  are  collected  here  bycommon  mwananchi  and  sold  for  only  shs.3,000./=  shillings. Thisparticular  advisory  centre  will  be  charged  with  the  responsibility of  meeting  the  African  needs. This will be  a  very  importanteconomic  centre  and  all  of  us  should  speak  loudly  so that  the Ministry  makes  sure  that  this  industry  is  put  under  the  control of  the  Africans. All  future,   licences,  Mr.   Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,   should  be given  to  Africans  to  enable  them  to  carry  out  this trade instead  of  giving  the  licences  to  people  who  are  not  from  this country.We  are  saying  this  because  we  happen  to  be  Kenyans  and we  cheerish  to  be  Africans. There  is  nothing  wrong  with  beingproud  for being  an  African. This  country  is  great  in  allaspects. Those  of  us  who  had  a  chance  of  going  outside  thiscountry,   can  assure  you  that  there  is  no  other  country  better than  Kenya  either  in  terms  of  democratic  or  otherwise  we  are the  best;   I  can  assure  you.  So,   if  these  things  are  there already,  there are  checks  and balances  in any democratic  system. What  we  are  saying  is  that the  economic benefits shouldbe  transferred  back  to  the  Kenyans  through  such  an Advisory Centre. That  isWhy  the  Office  of  the Vice-President  and Ministry  of Finance  established  the Industrial  Promotion  Centre. We  are  urging  the  Ministry  of Environment  and Natural  Resources  to  establish  the  proposed  Minerals Advisory  Centre whose principal  purpose  will  be  to  finance  the  indigenous  prospectors  and  assist them  in  looking  for  funds  so  that  they  can  have  money  at  their  disposal  to enable  them  to   look  for  these minerals. Secondly, after  enabling  them  tohave  those finances,  the  Centre  should  look  for  the markets. I  am  sure  thatit  would  not  be  good  for  any  Minister  to  stand  up  here  and  call  for  an  amendment  to  such  a good  Motion.                     Sir,   this  is  a  good  Motion  because  it  talks  of  the  indigenous Kenyanand  it  aims  at  transferring our economic  base  to  Africans,  particularly  in  themining  industry. I  am  sure  the  Minister will  stand  up  and  approve  the  Motionso  that  the  Centre  is  established,  probably,  by  the  end  of  this  month. Thisis  because  Kenya  is  on  the  run  and  if  we  have  to  curtail  and  stop  these  people continue  "milking"  this  country,   through  pretexts  that  they  are  expatriates, then  we  have  to  pass this  type  of Motion.  I  say  so  bearing  in mind  that  if  our economy  is  not  in  our  hands,  arm-twisting will  continue  in  the  African  countries. When you  visit  most  parts  of  the  world,  you  find  that  such  countries are  always  looking  for  sources  of  raw  materials  and  they  invest  there  heavily. If  we  develop  the  minerals  industry,   even  the  developing world  will  start  looking to  Kenya,  because  that  is an  important  industry. I  am  sure  God,  who also  created the  African  man,  was  not unjust  to say  that  Africans  should  not discover minerals in  order  to  also have  a  say  in  the  world  affairs. I  am  saying so with due respect. The  other  thing,  on  the  final  note,  is  that  I  would  like  to  take  this opportunity  to congratulate His Excellency  the President for  35 years  of  service  in  this  august House. It  is  very  fitting  that all of us should  carrywhat  is  expected  of  us,  namely, being mindful of other people's welfare His  Excellency  the  President has  done great  things. Some  people outsthis  country  are  against  him  because of his  stand  as an African. He  uncompromising when  it  comes  to being an African  and  that  is why  the outside  world  will  keep  on  trying  to question his  stand. He  is  abovetheir  thinking. All  the  time,  however,  we  shall  continue  to have  theyhooligans  who  advocate  for  things  that are  not possible  even  in  their countries.  Some  of  us  have  been  privileged  to have  visited  foreign  cot and  we  know  for  sure  that  some  of  the  things  they  are  advocating  for never  be  practised  in  the  world  they  come  from. I  believe  Kenya  is  the  best  country  in  Africa  in  term  of  lea food  production  and  many  other  things. With  those  few  remarks,   I  beg  to  support  the  Motion. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT  MINISTER  FOR  ENVIRONMENT  AND  NATURAL  RESOURCES (Mr.Hemed):Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,   I  rise  to  respond  to  the Motion. . through  the  Mines  and  Geology  Department  is  responsible  for  the  minerals development and  deals  With  all  matters  related  to  minerals  from geology to  the  exploitation  of  discovered  commercial  mineral  deposits. This  is the  authority  of  the  Mining  Act. My Ministry  also  licenses  and overseas exports  in  liaison  with  the  Central  Bank  of Kenya, the  Ministry  of Com; the  Customs  and  Excise  Department.  However,  sale  of minerals  within  the between  miners  and  dealers  and  between one  dealer  and  another  is not   Government control. That  is  subject  to  the  principal  of willing-buyer: However, because  minerals  are  not  renewable  natural  resources,  we  are interested  and  we  ensure  that  any  mineral  being  exported  out  of  the  fetch  the  best market  price  to  compensate  the  country  in  foreign  exchange this  non-renewable  resource. For  this  reason,  Sir,  my Ministry,  in liaison with other Gov Ministries,   takes  a  keen  interest and  approves  mineral  exports  by  granting mineral  export  permits  to  approved  exporters. The  Department of Mines  and Geology  of  my  Ministry  has  now decentralised  to  the provinces and  is  in  the process  of  moving  to  the  districts. However,  because  geology  and  mineral occurrences  do  not  follow  administrative  boundaries,  the  geologists  and  mining engineers  who  are  stationed  at  the  provinces  operate  to  the  level  of districts as  well. Even  with  this  decentralisation; there  is  a  gap which  I  believe  could be  filled  by  an  urgency  of  the  type  being  proposed  in  this  Motion. At  present  indigenous  Kenyan  miners  rely on  the Mine  and Geology Department  for  technical  advice. However,  if my  understanding  is  correct,  there  is  a  need  to  establish  a  centre where  indigenous  miners  can  display  their minerals and  also  exchange  ideas. They  would  also  have  independent  consultants  and  advisers to  discuss  their  commercial  problems  and  how  they  can raise money  from  financial institutions  to  finance  their  mining  operations. Further,  and  very  important, is  that  such  a centre would be  the place where overseas prospective mineral bidders  and  tourists  would  visit  to  find  out and  see  for  themselves  the  varieties of gemstones  and  other  minerals  which  are  available  in  Kenya. These  foreignerswould  also  receive  advice on  the proper methods of  taking any minerals which they  would  have  bought without  contravening  the  law.  In  this  way  we  shall minimise  any  losses  of our minerals. Finally,  as  hon.  Members  are  aware,  mineral  resources  development is  both  risky and capital  intensive. Resources  from  the  Government alone would not  be  adequate  for  large-scale mineral  investments  that are  required  to discover the  various  mineral  deposits we  know exist  in  this country. Therefore,   it  isnecessary to  involve  as  many  organisations and  institutions,  both public andprivate,  as  possible  in  this  industry. For  the  above  reasons,  I  support  theMotion  in  principle  with  the following amendments.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I wish to  end  my speech by proposing the  following amendments  to the Motion:— THAT,  in view of the necessity to  increase the  pace  of development  of Kenya's mineral industry in order  to  produce  mineral both for domestic, consumption and for  export  to earn foreign exchange,  this House  resolves  that a Mineral Advisory Centre  be  established when funds  become  available  to advise  and guide Kenyan miners  and mineral  prospectors  on mineral marketing and on how to raise  funds from financial institutions to finance their  operations. With those minor  amendments  I beg to  support  the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL HERITAGE  (Mr. Lalampaa):  Bw.

Naibu Spika wa Muda, naomba kuunga mkono MR. KIPKORIR Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to contribute to this Motion As you are aware, this is a developing and we need to be knowledgeable, we should assist ourgeologists in the exploration of minerals There are many people who are interested in exploiting our minerals but, unfortunately they are unable to do so because of financial constraints It would, therefore, be to our advantage if the Government could assist wananchi to exploit the various varieties of minerals in this countryI have a good example of a place in Kerio Valley where we have a marble, fluorspar and many other varieties of minerals We are very fortunate to have these minerals in the country, and it is high time all Kenyans cooperated in support of the dynamic leadership of His Excellency the President in which he is really concerned about the development of this country It is the duty of each of us to assist in this development by providing services as far out as possible and standing on our own feetIf we establish this centre that has been suggested by the hon. Mover, this will be keeping in with the Presidents advice to be mindful of other peoples welfare He himself has, for example, set aside a Fund particularly to asset Jua Kali artisans So, the Government should assist mineral prospectors, too so as to enhance our development It was only recently that we discovered that we had marble in Kerio Valley I want to the Government to asset marble miners Engineers should be posted to mineral rich areas to exploit prospecting there We have been transporting marble from a certain area in Machakos all the way to Nairobi and up to Eldoret, instead of using the marble that is very close to Eldoret and enhancing the development of the area So, we would like to see the Government install the relevant machinery right in the place where this marble is so that the process of mining the mineral may be cheaper This would also assist local wananchi to get employment If some mining experts were sent to my area, for example, and those with the necessary machinery were encouraged to set up a mining industry there, some many people from the area would get employmentMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, you are also aware that many problems arise in this country It is the duty of all of us, especially thosein the Government who have been given the responsibility of assisting in the development of different Ministries and parastatal bodies, to see that wananchi are satisfied with the Government What I mean is that our youth should not be left frustrated in the street They should rather be assisted When they visit Government offices, they should be helped as much as possible We should take other people s problems as our own so that there may really be respect and satisfaction for the sake of this country’s developmentWe would not like to see certain people giving our people a headache We have seen what happened recently in a certain country, as a result of which the President advised all of us to be united I am very happy that Kenyans have rejected the idea of multipartyism in whichwananchi would be confused We, as the elected leaders of wananchi, are happy to serve our country in whichever capacities have been bestowed on us I also appeal to wananchi to continue to support the President so that the development of our country may be faster When you go to other countries where people have established multipartyism, you find chaos and poverty, and this is not the kind of life we need in our country We want people to be responsible, courageous and united so that Kenya may continue to move forward    	_Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir, I appeal to Ministers and their officers to visit projects in the rural areas. They should go to these projects and find out whether money is being properlyspent we all know that we have the problem of unemployment in this country This is a very serious problem and the Ministry of Manpower Development and Employment should try to, help the country to solve this problemWe are in this House to debate issues and make laws and we urge Government officers in various Government offices to serve ovt people with dedication I say this because there are some officers who think that the Government offices that they occupy are their own property Such people are not very willing to serve the public But they should realise that these are public offices and fcfryxax they must serve the people of this country well	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I touched briefly on the question of the availability of marble in my area The Government should step in and assist our people, Those who will be producing marble in that area will pay cess to the local authority there and this will enable the local authority to have more revenue to finance its operationsWith those few remarks, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech>  	<Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge ) Hon. Members,I think we are running out of time.</Newspeech> 	(Question of the first part of the amendment, that thewords to be left out be left out, put and agreed to) Question of the second part of the amendment, that the words to be inserted in place thereof be inserted be inserted proposedQuestion of the second part of the amendment, that the words to be inserted in place thereof be inserted, put and agreed to)(Question of the Motion as amended proposed)<Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. wabuge): I think it is now time for the Mover to reply.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>Mr. MALEBE: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary DeputySpeaker, Sir I thank all the Members who have spoken on this Motion and in particular the Minister for Environment and rlairural Resources for accepting the Motion in an amended formMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the  Motion as amended is very acceptable This is because the whole essence was to form the Mineral Advisory Centre The Minister has told us that this will be done, when funds become available I know that this is the language spoken by Ministries but to me this is a delaying tactic. However, the Minister has informed me thatthey need time to start going the budgeting for the establishment of this Advisory Centre The Minister has promised the House that they are going to establish this Centre He has told us that the Mineral Advisory Centre will be in operation by 1st July, 1991 and I thank him for that. They have enough time to prepare their estimates ana their budget so that this important Centre can start its operations Then formulating the terms of reference for the MineraJ Advisory Centre the Ministry should realise that there are costs involved Mining is a risky undertaking and it is capital intensive and for this reason the Mineral Advisory Centre should bear  certain costs when it is established Here I am talking about exploration costs This is because feasibility studies will have to be carried out There will also be spa mapping out of the areas wheremineral deposits will be discovered All this should be the responsibility of the Mineral Advisory CentreMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Centre shotild also bear the costs involved in marketing of the products. They should go out and look for markets overseas The Centre should also try to guarantee the investors in the various mining ventures. We have specific markets overseas we have renowned gemstone markets in the United States of America and in the Federal Republic of Germany These are long established gemstone markets, we also have a gemstone market in Hong Kong. This one of ours will be the first such Centre in Africa Since Kenya is a lucrative trading partner of the other African States, our Mineral Advisory Centre Till help other African countxies to develop their mining industries.When the Centre has been established, the c±s±sr Ministry should adDR.ess itself to the issue of taxation I say this because mineral exploration and mining equipment is extremely expensive I would therefore urge the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources  when establishing the terms of reference for this Centre  to request the Office of the VicePresident and Ministry of Finance to exempt mining equipment from duty it should be imported dutyfree so that the indigenous mineral propsector can afford it	  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other aspect which I would like to mention here is that of taxation In mining we have what we call royalties, which is a form of taxation of minerals As far as the centre is concerned, it shou request the Office of the VicePresident and Ministry of Finance to look at the tax on profic only because if the Government dwells on royalties only, then taxation will be escalating all the years similar to that on cigarettes, beer and items of that nature Since minerals are not taken as products like cigaret¬tes or beer, then the taxation on royalties should not be emphasized The Govern¬ment should seek to only tax the taxable profitsThe other issue that I would like to raise is the question of curbing on smuggling We know that the jewellery shops, the curios and antique shops are the areas where gemstones and MINERALS are being pirated or smuggled out of the country Once the mineral advisory centre is established, it should be able to control this pirating and smuggling of our minerals As I said earlier on, during the colonial era, missionaries used to carry gemstones and other minerals under their robes, and that is why you find Vatican City being reknGwned in the world for its riches in these items I think that the part missionaries played in this country was just to collect natural resources in this country and take them to Vatican CityMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the formation of this centre, we also need to streamline the Mining Act In particular, the Minister concerned should come up with an Act to register all geologists As the President said in this House yesterday, there are some laws which have remained unamended for a long time, and the Mining Act is one of them We need an Act which will guide mining engineers, geologists and gemnologists and prospectors so that they can assist the indigenous Africans The word minerals does not confine itself to precious stories We have even nonprecious stones such as the Kisii soft stone which can  earn a lot of money for that district if it operations were streamlined We find most of it in curio shops in Nairobi We also have the kind of stone which is used in the construction industry Some buildings which are very beautiful in Nairobi here are constructed using that stone We have other sorts of local dimension stones like the black granite which coulc be exploited if the facilities were available, and that would reduce the importation of marble from ItalyMr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, some parastatals such as the East African Ceramics, which is now failing, could gain a lot from the establishment of the centre proposed by this Motion The raw material used by this company is clay, which is a form of mineral So, if the facilities were available, then local prospectors would be able to keep such parastatals aliveSir, the other item which is gaining a lot of market today is mineral water We should not be importing mineral water from France while we have a lot of it merely awaiting exploitation At the same time, I would also like to request the Government to have annual reports available to the public It is very rare that you get any annual reports from the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources on geological matters These days they do not seem to be publishing the reports, and I urge them to start updating the reports They should also produce geological maps showing the various locations where minerals can be obtainedMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do thank all hon. Members who supported this Motion, and I also do thank the Ministry for having accepted to establish the Mineral Advisory CentreWith those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the Motion.</Newspeech> <Header>QUORUM</Header><Newspeech>DR..

We did not hear from him and, therefore, sent him a reminder under the same reference on 6th June, 1988 We have now received the information from our area manager, Mombasa that the claimant worked for Lotoko between 19 6 7 to 1969 and final processing of his claim is being made and he shoudl expect his cheque next week on Friday, 26th October, 1990.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

WAMBUA asked the Minister for Water Development when phases two and three of the Kibaoni Water Project will be completed and why did the Ministry removethe construction equipment from Kibaoni before th completion of this project<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Kisiero): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to replyMy Ministry completed the construction on phases two of Kibaoni Water Project during the 1988/89 Financial Year On th other hand, completion of phase three of the project will depend on availability of fundsThe equipment were removed from Kibaoni because implemen¬tation of work on phase three has been suspended until funds ar received from the Machakos Integrated Development Plan (MIDP)</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am surprised to 		 learn from the reply of the Assistant Minister that phase twowas completed in whatever year he mentioned here The completion of phase two did not supply water tot he people who need water in that area because there is no water in that area I wonder how he got the information that phase two was completed, because there is no waterin that area I know that phase onehas got water but not phase two</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KISIERO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in our plans phase two incorporated the construction fo water pipes that served 11 thousand people through 123 connections in Kibaoni Location The Minsitry had planned to provide water to Kibaon Location only, but it was later on found that it was also necessary that water be extended to Kalawa Location Perhaps, this is the area where my colleague is saying that we have not covered the whole place But, as I 	said, we have already completed the designs for the water project	to be extended toe over the whole of Kalawa Location and the money	is supposed to be provided by the European Economic Community (EEC)	through the Machakos Integrated Development Programme As soonas thismoney is received, we shall undertake the final part of this project</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Deptu Speaker, Sir, actually the trenches from a certain area were dug up to Kalawa and some pipes werecovered When are these people going to get water because people were made to dig the trenches? Why did they not check and find out whether there was enough money to take the water up to Kalawa	before they ?,ade people dig the trenches and cover the pipes?</Newspeech> 	 <Newspeech>MR. BOY: Jibu!</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KISIERO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the truth is that thisproject was undertaken by the Ministry of Water Devlopment initially,  and  it was to cover the Kibaoni Location While we were preparing to carry out the third part of it,the EEC had completed phase two of their arrangements with our Government and they were planning to give some more funds at a later stage and so the Ministry could not continueextending this project on its own Initially the Ministry had set aside only Shs.6 million which completed the Kibaoni section of this water project But, as the new design is now to cover the Kalawa Location, we need shs60 million As I said, as soon as this money is receive, we shall certainly complete the bit that has remained</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA I am surprised to hear the Assistant Minister saying that Kibaoni is covered by this project There are some areas in Kibaoni, which he claims to be covered, where we find people have no water at all Can he clarify that?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.KISIERO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,when you start a water project,certainly, it is not possible to take piped ator to ever home in the areaconcerned. However, as I had already indicated we have already suppliedquite a large number of people in this area with water. For example, we have suppliedpeople over an area of 100 square kilometres with water Inother words, we are supplying 11,000 people ith water through some123 connections  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, when Phase III which is the lastphase of this project comes into operation, we shall he able to supply 55,000people over an area of 400 square kilometres of course, this phase will alsoserve other people in areas that were not covered by the kibaoni Mater ProjectMe shall by then be able to increase the total length of water? pipeline supply by an  additional 102 kilometres At the same time, we shall have built 12 additional storage tanks,each of which will be holding 1,150 cubic metres of water. This clearly showsthat the Ministry is doing everything possible to supply the people in thisarea with sufficient water and I would like to assure my colleague hon. Mambuathat when this last phase is completed, we shall have covered a much bigger area.</Newspeech> Mr. J.N. Mungai: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,I think the hon. Assistant Ministry is trying to mislead the House becausewhat the hen Questioner said is that seme of the areas along which some ofthe water pipes are passing do not have water and he wanted to know why thisis the case However, the hon. Assistant Minister says that he has supplied all the area referred to in the Question ith water I think that is a very misleading statement Could he tell us exactly what he means by saying thathe has supplied all the areas with water, when the hen Questioner clearly saysthat some of the areas do not have any water supply.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>Mr. KISEIRO: Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir, her you construct a waterproject, it sometimes becomes necessary to do this phases. I have clearlystated here that we have completed phases one and two of this water project and are nowintending to start phase three. I have stated that when we completethe phase III of this project, the problems of the hon. Member would come to end I would like to take this opportunity to assure him that we are going</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MAKAU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant Ministers reply, that the phase III of this project isgoing to cater, for the renainirg area, could he tell us what is delaying the completion of this phase III.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KISUMU: MR.Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I have already said, the delay is due to the fact that European Economic community has not released the amount of noney required to complete this project under phase III. I indicated earlier that we shall need some extra Shs.6 million to ccnplete phase III of the projects.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Shall we move on to DR..

It also appears that the office of the District CommissionerDusia which perfoms United function of the Public Trustee in an ex-officiccapacity, is not aware of the said matter. Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir my observation of the natter is that itseens that the icsue at hand is purely of a personal nature and should be adDR.essed to the said individuals directly.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker DR..

CHEPKOK asked the VicePresident arid Minister for Finance when ha Mr. Peter Gicharu Manau APMPC ]o 44202, will be paid his benefits as per the Ministrys letter Ref.No.2556l/70 dated 10th april 1990.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT INISTER OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Kariuki) Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to replyI do not know why the hon. Member has a sice d this question becauseas far as our records are concerned, we do not have anybody by the of name Peter Gicharu Kamau, who has not been paid his dues. The only Peter gicharu that we have has already been paid his N.S.S.F dues.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker Dir I think the Assistant Minister is looking for trouble. This is the second time I have called this Questicn in the House. When I asked this Question last year I was told by Hon. Moak who replied TO it that Peter Gicheru Manau is going to be paid his N.S.S.F dues soon. This time, I hope the answer that the Assistant Minister has given is the truth. Could the Assistant Minister tell this how much moneyMr. Peter Gicharu was paid and when he was paid.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KARIUKI Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure the hon. Member that Mr. Kamau was paid his pension gratuity and if the hon. Member wants, he may take down this information vide Treasury cheque No985104, dated 29th August, 1990, which was dispatched to Mr. Kamau on 7thSeptember, 1990, under care of P.0 Box 44, Kapcherop I would also like to add that his monthly pension in arrears from 1st May, 1990 to date will be paid to him as soon as possible</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. JN MUNGAI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir We are grateful for what the hon. Assistant Minister has just said because it appears to be consistent with the answer that was given last year although last year is too far back from now Hovever, it has not been mentioned to us as to how much Mr. Kamau was paid Could the Assistant Minister tell us how much money Mr. Kamau was paid?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KARIUKI Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not think that it is prudent to disclose to the public the financial affairs of a particular individual The hon. Member should, therefore, be satisfied that we have already given Mr. Kamau the cheque whose number I have quoted we do not know whether there are robbers</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER Order, Mr. Kariuki Unfortunately, the Chair differs with you in this matter because this Question is now the property of the House and hon. Members are entitled to know the amont of money in question</Newspeech> (Applause)<Newspeech>MR. KARIUKI Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for your guidance In this case, and having already assured the hon. Member that a cheque has been sent out, I can promise the hon. Member that if he comes to my office I will tell him this amount</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. P.G GODANA On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, once a Question has been put in this House, it remains the property of the House, and so does the answer thereof Is the Assistant Minister in order to refer the hon. Member to his office instead of giving it to the House?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KARIUKI All I am saying, Mr. Deputy Speaker let me admit this is that I do not have the details of the amount of money in questio9n, but the hon. Member that this money has been paid In any case, the Question does not talk about the amount, but when Mr. Kamau is going to be paid whatever is due to him It has now been established that he has been paid all that is due to him</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir The Assistant Minister mentioned the said cheque number, and the House just wants to know how much money was paid by that cheque Is he in order to say that I am asking asking a different question by wanting to know how much money was paid through the cheque whose number he has mentioned?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KARIUKI Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, all I can do now is to promise the House that the next time we meet hers, that is tomorrow, I will give hon. Members an answer relating to this amountAs for the arrears from 1st May, 1990</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER Order, Mr. Kariuki Does it not occur to you as rather strange that your officers gave you the date of the said cheque, the number of the cheque and yet failed to tell you the amount involved?</Newspeech> (Applause)<Newspeech>MR. KARIUKI Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this may seem strange, but I aim sure that when we were preparing this answer, we did not think that it would be important to disclose the personal financial affairs of Mr. Peter Gicharu Kamau but, since you have now advised that this is necessary, I promise to tell this House the amount in question tomorrow</Newspeech> <Newspeech>DR.. MIS0I On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir I appreciate your ruling and thank you very much for assisting the Assistant Minister It is strange that he managed to get the number and the date of the cheque, and not the amount involved In any case, he was similing as he answered this Question, which means that he was not serious So, thcre is something fishy here Is he in order not to divulge the amount in question which ought to have been submitted with thecheque number and the date?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KARIUKI Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir I am not going to aniils thistime so that the hori Member may see how serious I am  by the way, I am always smiling As I said, this amount of money will be divulged tomorrow  I assure the House that a cheque has been sent out</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like the Assistant Minister to tell the House when Mr. Kamaus monthly pension arrears are going to be paid</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KARIUKI Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I said that these arrears will be paid as soon as possible I must say that the delay there has been in the payment of these arrears and the pension itself has not been due to any laxity on the part of the Ministrys staff, but due to the fact that the pensioner himself applied for his benefits late According to the proper regulations, he should have applied for them nine months ago</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. J.N MUNGAI On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir The hon. Questioner said that this Question appeared in this House last year, which is more than nine months ago Probably, the Question was asked last December, although we are normally on recess at that time However, the Assistant minister tells this House that the fault that caused this delay was not the Ministrys but the claimants who allegedly applied for his benefits late Which is which between the two? How late did the claimant apply for these benefits? Could we have the date of the application so that we may know how late it was made?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KARIUKI The procedure involved here, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, is that once somebody retires, he has to go to the Teachers Service Commission, which prepares and submits his claim for benefits In this case, however, the Secretary to the Teachers Service Commission did not submit Mr. Kamaus pension claim to the Princpal Pensions Officer for processing until 22nd June, 1990 The Principal Pensions Officer acknowledged receipt of Mr. Kamaus claim on 29th June, 1990, via the Secretary, Teachers Service Commission, with a copy to Mr. Kamau This claim was processed in the usual manner and settled vide cheque No985104, dated 29th August, 1990</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER Order, Mr. Chepkok The Assistant Minister is replying to another point of order</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KARIUKI fir Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am just saying that this Question was askedlast year, but it was not until June, 1990 that we received the relevant claim forms from the Teachers Service Commission</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, what I am saying is that the Assistant Minister should not take the House for a ride In his answer, he said that Mr. Kamaus monthly pension arrears from 1st May, 1990 to date will be paid at the end of this month I want to know the exact day of this month on which Mr. Kamau is going to be paid</Newspeech>  JIuC  <Newspeech>MR. KARIUKI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, October has 30days So, the end of October is certainly 30th October</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. P.G GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to inform the Assistant Minister, through the Chair, that October has 31 days!</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KARUIKI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, then that means that 31st October will be the end of October</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEKER: We will not move on to Questions by Private Notice</Newspeech> <Header>QUESTIONS BY PRIVATE NOTICE</Header>Payment of Retirement Benefits to Mr. Aloba<Newspeech>DR.. WAMEYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Vice President and Minister for Finance the following Question by Private NoticeWhen will Mr. Juma Ali Aloba, APN/PC.44608, be paid his retirement benefits?</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Kariuki) Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to replyI have very good news for the hon. Member Mr. Ali Aloba will be paid his retirement benefits seven days from today!</Newspeech> <Newspeech>DR.. Wameyo: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, WHILE thanking the Assistant Minister for that answer, let remind him that this reply here was written on 3th October, 1990 Ma? I know whether today here refers to 17th October, 1990, or to 3th October 1990?</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. KARUIKI: Mr. D_eputy Speaker, Sir, I think I was very clear I said that Mr.Aloba will be paid within seven days from now</Newspeech> <Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, nay I know from the Assistant Minister why it has become necessary to raise Questions about pensioners pension and only after the Questions have been raised payments are made and yet in the past payments were being made without Questions being raised in this House What has caused this problem?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KARIUKI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, like I said earlier on, the procedure is that whenever one is about to retire  nine months before he retires  the Ministry that he works for writes to the Pensions Office in the Treasury saying Mr. So and so is going to retire so that the claims of the pensioner can start being processed even a before he retires But what we see these days, and I can give Mr. Alobas case as an example, is that these applications usually come to he Treasury a few months after the person has retired whereas the regulations state very clearly that these applications should be forwarded to the Treasury nine months before retirementWith regard to Mr. Alobas case, he retired on age grounds with effect from 1st April, 1890 The Ministry of Public Works did not forward his retirement papers to this Office until 22nd August 1990 This is contrary to the Service Regulations which require that retirement benefits papers should be received by the Pensions Department nine months before the date of an officers retirement from the Service. It is also noted that the pensioner completed his pension commutation forms on 23rd April, 1990 after fiis retirement This also has contributed to the delay 3o, you cam see that the delay lias been caused by the employing Ministry andthe laid down regulations</Newspeech> <Newspeech> Mr. DEPUTY SPEAKER Very well At Mr. Kilikus request, the second a Question by Private Notice is deferred</Newspeech> (Question deferred)Next Order!<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, SirThis morning, when I was answering Question lio462 by the hon.

I would like to report here that following that meeting, I now have a cheque for hon. Yambua, of Kshs.l9,558 which he can collect from me for the benefit of the widow of the late Mr. Nguvi Thank you very much</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. WASIKE NDOMBI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister clarify this matter, further? Is this the normal onequarter commutation which is normally paid in advance or is it the complete settlement of the payment?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER Mr. Wasike Ndombi, I do not intend to allow debate on that subject. That is just a bit of information which hon. Keah has chosen to provide and the rules do not allow debate on this matter</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to thank the hon.

It also has the responsibility of constructing and maintairg public roads and buildings In addition, the Ministry offers such essential services as materials research and testing, mechanical ana transport operations, provision of electrical services, inventory of Government property and stock, provision of accommodation for all Government Departments and houses for officers including Ministers and Assistant Ministers who do not live in their own houses We also train technicians who form the bulk of my Ministrys personnel and the supply of all the commonly used items to Government Ministries. In a nutshell, those are the areas of operation of my Ministry at the moment.I now wish to present my Ministry’s Vote for consideration by the House. The Heads are grouped into four Sub Votes namely, General Administration ana Planning Building and works Other service and Roads The net total amounts required are K£68,252,480 for Recurrent Expenditure anS K£44,840,400 for Development Expenditure I shall deal with them in that order, commencing with the Recurrent VoteMr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, under Vote R13, Subvote 130  General Administration  I am seeking an approval of K£16,497,589 for general administrat¬ion, planning and supportive services in the headquarters, provincial and district levels Of this amount, I require K£l,981,456 under Head 380  Headquarters Admini stration Services This is to cater for salaries and allowances of the staff at the headquarters, the details of which are listed at page 365 of the Printed Estimates The other items under this Head are the normal support services The Appropriations in Aid of K£15,000 is anticipated to be realised from the sale of boarded vehicles which have been proved unserviceable due to old age and are now uneconomical to runThe next Head in this Subvote is 381  Provincial Administrative Services  in which I am seeking K£4,890,646 This is mainly to cater for administrative services at the provincial level Now, as the House is aware, it is at the provincial level that district projects and activities are monitored and evaluated so that if any laxity is detected from district, then appropriate action can be taken An Appropriations in Aid of K£10,000 is anticipated to be realised from the sale of tender documents and boarded equipment which have proved uneconomical to repairTurning to Head 382  District Administrative Services  I am requesting the sum of K£7,414,822 Hon. Members are no doubt aware that the Government policy of district focus for rural development has taken root It is at the district that a large number of professional and technical staff is based This staff is charged with the responsibility of supervising and management of projects as well as carrying out various maintenance works This modest sum requested, I hope, will go a long way in fulfilling the needs for services required in the rural areas I expect to realise a sura of K£134,000 as AppropriationsinAid from fees charged on various services rendered by niy Ministrys technical staff, sale of tender documents and sale of boardedvehicles which have proved uneconomical to repair over the years I wish to urge hon. Members to participate in the district develop¬ment committees so that they can plan their priorities in the different spheres touchingon my MinistryMr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the next Head of

the services rendered by this branch, the bulk of the money is on Item 500, which is an increase to the Stores Services Revolving Fund The Fund has, over the years, proved inadequate to offer

Department This department is charged with the duties of designing and supervision of construction of Government building programmes It renders professinal and technical services to other Government

surveying work, financial management and control of building work and also processing of tenders and control documents for public works projects For this department, I am seeking a total sum of K£539,370 The AppropriationsinAid of K£8,000 reflects revenue which will be received from contractors on receipt of prequalification tender forms and also from sales of general building specifications and other documentsSir, the next Head in this Subvote is 402  Sturctural Department  which is responsible for civil and structural engineering designs related to building and other specialised design works It also carries out maintenance of sea protection walls, jetties and sewerage disposals in Government institutions I will need a sumof K£668,343 for this departmentMr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the next one is Head 409, which is for the maintenance of Government buildings This department caters for major and minor maintenance work of Government buildings as well as provision of electricity, water and conservancy for Government estates throughout the Republic Given the nature of work involved in the department and taking into account that rents for Govern¬ment houses were recently increased, it is only fair that these houses are properly maintained The amount of K£l,149,739 that I am seeking for for this department is quite modest and I could certainly be happier with a much higher figure When the circumstances permit, I will not hesitate to come back to this House for additional funds at a later date An AppropriationsinAid of K£8,000 is antici ated to be realised from sale of goods and materials from boarded houses  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other head under this Sub Vote is 413  Electrical Department  which is charged with electrical installation in all public buildings I am seeking the approval of K£l,200,320 for this unit, the bulk of which is for personal emoluments, details of which are to be found under page 371 of the Printed Estimates AppropriationsinAid of K£5,000 as misce¬llaneous receipts will be realised The Department also carries out maintenance of essential electrical and mechanical services Such services include mainte¬nance of lifts in Government buildings, hospital equipment such as boilers, laundry and kitchen equipment, pumps and generators in various institutions and other electrical equipment While maintenance funds have been allocated to various Ministries for that purpose, the Department continues to render technical and professional servicesI an now turning to SubVote 133  Other Services, which is comprised of four departments Under Head 418  Government Housing Section  this primarily administers the renting ana leasing of offices and houses for the Government, which is one of the major functions of my Ministry With the expansion of the Government and continued running costs of rent, it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain enough office accommodation for various Ministries and residential accommodation for Ministers and civil servants at a reasonable cost The sum of K£3,725,143, which I am seeking for the Housing Unit, will be barely adequate for the present  leases and I might be forced later on to request for additional funds in order to keep up with anticipated demands for accommodation facilities©The next Head 505 relates to Mechanical and Transport Department, which is a technical arm of the Government, responsible for the repair and maintenance of vehicles, plants and equipment for this Ministry and others As hon. Members are aware, the cost of fares are quite high as their increases are dictated by inflationary trends on the international markets that are beyond our control I am seeking the approval of the	 The bulk of this is for personal emoluments, details of which are on page 272 to 384 of the Printed Estimates This Department caters for the mechanical services in all the districts I expect to realise a sum of K£121,908 as AppropriationsinAid from the sale of boarded vehicles, plant and equipment which are uneconomical to runThe next one is Head 506  Materials 3ranch  which offers supportive services in materials research and testing for various departments of any Ministry, which are charged with the responsibility of building and construction work It also carries out the research and testing for industrial materials in general These services are available to other Ministries, corporations and even to the private sector The main objective of this Department is to ensure that the right quality of locally manufactured materials are used and correct specifications and procedures followed I request for a net sum of K£l,285,165 for this Department. I intend to raise a sum of K£43,000 as AppropriationsinAid from services rendered to the publicMy last one in this SubVote is Head 507 Staff Training Department. This conducts technical courses both preservice and inservice for the technical staff in my Ministry and which constitutes the bulk of the personnel. The Department has training branches in Kisii and Ngong which train supervisors in road construction and maintenance using labour intensive methods, a programme which has been very successful and popular I am requesting for an amount of K£1,342,723 for the Training Department This will realise K£22,000 as AppropriationsinAid from the Directorate of Indu stria! Training as a training levyThe last but not least is SubVote 136  Roads Department  which is popular among hon. Members The major responsibility of this Department comprises of regravelling of gravelled roads, resealing of bitumen roads and grading of roads as well as other routine activities It is of utmost importancethat the resources invested by the Government through my Ministry du first Development Programme be protected. It would be a waste of re if adequate funds for maintenance programmes are not provided for th network throughout the country, where heavy capital has been investment of K£25,495,294 allocated to the Roads Department, only about K£03 will go to the actual maintenance that includes the operation of fer The balance of about K£175 million will be used for the payment of  for professional, technical and other maintenance staff at the headquarter provinces and district levels The other amount is for operating exist like telephone transport, electricity and purchase of tools and so on Most of our roads are in dire need of repairs and it is important they are attended toI am sure hon. Members will agree with me, Sir, that propecture in communication is a prerequisite for the success of the Dist for Rural Development. It is for this reason that I request this su to approve a total of K£25,495,294 for the road subsector I could certainly be happier with a much higher figure when the circumstanct I will not hesitate to come back to this House for additional funds date I intend to raise a sum of K£12,500 as Appropriations in Aid sale of tender documentsI now turn to the Development Estimates I would like to under Sub Vote 130  General Administration and Planning  Henc £10  Branch I require a sum of K£65,000 for the extension and minor of the stores for the Supplies BranchThe next SubVote is 132 Building and Works and I would start with Head 400  Architectural Department I am seeking approK£1,140,000.

As you know we have a road network of 65,000 kilometres of classified roads throughout the Republic, other than those falling without the municipalities. This road network is still the most important mode of transport in Kenya today roads play an important role in the collection and distrubution of industrial and agricultural products within the country They are, therefore, an important input for all sectors of our economy It is thus the Ministrys long objective to build a system of allweather roads and improve transport to facilitate accessibility of all areas in the country throughout the yearIn order to invest in the most effective manner  my Ministry has given priority to maintenance and rehabilitation of existing roads so as to preserve the existing investment Construction of new high priority roads in areas where other development projects are planned and lack of roads would inhibit the implementation of those projects will also be carried out. The construction of classified minor roads to the high potential agricultural and densely populated districts using labourintensi methods in order to create employment in the rural areas will be our major objective. We shall also intensify road safety programs in order to identify the various causes of road accidents on the countrys roads and offer possible solutions to reduce loss of live and property.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, allow me to mention some of the projects and programmes for the road subsector in the 199091 Financial Year They include the reconstruction of the dilapilated major bitumen roads, upgrading of high priority gravelled roads to bitumen standards, the gravelling of earth roads constructed under the rural access roads programmes and construction of bridges Por these projects. I will need a total sum of £101,954,000 out of which Appropriations in Aid to the tune of £59,112,880 will be realised from various donors in form of loans and grants. Therefore, I am seeking approval for a net sum of £41,884,074, which will be utilised for funding the ongoing projects ana projects whose implementation will commence during this financial year The projects to be started are listed on pages 376 to 404 of the printed development estimates.However, I wish to mention a few of the ongoing capital projects, which include construction of the Kilifi Bridge which we hope to open by April next year the rehabilitation of sections of the Mombasa Malaba Road which include the Machakos Turnoff to Ulu, Kabete Limuru, Timboroa Eldoret, Eldoret Turbo, webuye Malaba upgrading to bitumen standards of the ThikaSangondiCarissa Road rehabilitation of the Makutano Murangia Sagana Nyeri Road upgrading to bitumen standards of the Bungoma Chwele Kimilil Road construction to bitumen standards of the Kisii Chemosit and Ndori Owimbi Roads and Misumu Kakamega Road improvement to bitumen standards of Ngong Kiserian Isenya Road Sotik Kamalo River Road and Kabartonjo Kipsaromon Road.	 Some of the projects, whose implementation my Ministryintends to commence in the course of this financial year will include ulu Mtito Andei dualing of Thika Makutano rehabilitation of Lironi Mai Maiu Naivasha Road Kisumu Yala Road Timboroa Nakuru Bahati Mombasa Lungalunga and Machakos Turnoff ot Machakos Town. I have a long list of these projects but time does not allow to read all of them H  I am sure all hon. Memers will be seeing new projects and improvements of our roads in their areas My Ministry will try all it can through the available resources to improve our roads in the countryMr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as you are aware, agricultural roads in agricultural lands, espeically in tea growing areas, also get help from the cess funds which are deducted from them, and I am happy that the country councils have also assisted in providing some the equipment like tippers and graders in their areas and we are all helping one another to improve the s ate of our roads in the countryWith those few remarks, I beg to move</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Kamotho) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chance to sdecond the Vote of my friend, the Minister for Public WorksMr. Deputy speaker, Sir, before I say a few words in connection with the Ministry, I would like to once again thank His Excellency the President for the support he gave to my Ministry yesterday during the rememberance of his 35 years as a Parliamentarian I would like, therefore, to assure His Excellency the Present of our unswerving loyalty, devotion nd dedicatin to duty and also firmness of the party and the Ministry in doing our workSir, I would like to support the Vote of the Ministry of Public Works, first of all because of the importance of the functions and the work that comes under it We all know that the road network and qualify of roads in any country determine the level of the economic development in any nation It is important that we provide roads which would support our level of economic activity Being an agricultural country that totally depends on agricultrue, it is extemely curial that our roads leading to the cashcrop growing areas, whether it is maize, tea, coffee, rice or cotton, should be mainttained to all weather standards This is to ensure that the farmers produce is delivered to the market in time and to ensure that the farmers get their returns property. We are all aware that the other aspect of rural development like the rural electrification and rural telecommunications are going on and to every part and every corner of this RepublicMr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like to affect the Ministry, although they were in the forefront in terms of opening up and improving roads in the rural Kenya, that because of the absurdity of rural electrification and rural telecommunications programmes, some of the equipemnt being taken to some of the market areas, locations and divisions in this coutry require regular attention for road maintenance and repair Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, these are very important installations and some ofthem are security points Therefore, the roads leaking to some of these keyinstallations should be upgraded to all weather standards This will make surethat when we have a blackout or a breakdown cf our telephone facilities, maintananceor repair work can be done as quickly as possibleMr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am glad, that the minister has re-emphasizedthe fact that the ministry is paying a lot of attention in collaboration withthe local authorities and either organizations concerned to make sure that bothtea and coffee roads are maintained to an all weather standard level. I doremember that previously, roads leading to the tea factories were tarmackedI would like to request the ministry to apply pressure or the kinistiy ofAgriculture to ensure that roads leading to coffee factories are also tarmackedI am saying this because the lorries that finally transport the driedcoffee beans from these coffee factories and either trucks that supply the factorieswith inputs like diesel and other implements, are extremely heavy Therefore,unless the roads leading into these factories are of a very high standard,they cannot accommodate these vehicles. I would therefore request the ministerto put a little mere pressure on the ministry of  agriculture and Treasury toensure that the roads leading particularly to the new tea and coffee factoriesare ali tarmacked including those leading to factories previously not served with tarmacked roads.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like to thank the Minister particular because of the utilization of the tolls fund Today, Sir, every read user appreciates the need of toll charges and I would like to thank the minister and his ministry for the good work now being done on the road between Makutano and Muranga towards Sagana. The money frcm the toll station on the Thika Road has done an extremely creditable job. However, I would like to request the ministry to consider reparing the road running from Murunga  to Kangema. This is a very old road which we originally constructed by the Muranga County Council. However, since this road was kanied over is government  	 Public Works this rood is completely work out and because it falls under thegame category of Makutano Muranga Sagana Road, I request the Ministry toconsider repairing that road because it passes through an extremelyrich agricultural area This road, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, also connectswith the highway Road that leads to Nyeri and MeruMr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like to request the Ministiyto do a little more in terms cf the promotion of the road safety councilThe Minister did refer to this point when moving his vote and since this councilfalls under the jurisdiction of both the Ministry of Transport and Communicationsand the Ministry of Public Works, I do know that a lot of accidents which resultin loss of lives along cur roads are sometimes caused by the poor maintenance ofour roads. It may be necessary therefore to ask the local authorities to beresponsible to be reponsible for the repair of potholes on roads which passwithin their areas of jurisdication I am saying this because the Ministrysresponsibilities are very heavy since it is also dealing with intercontinental	highways Therefore, I am sure that the local authorities would be able to repairthese potholes given a little more support As we all know, Mr. Deputy Speaker,Sir prevention is always bettor than cure. In other words, it would bs wise to repair these potholes before they deteriorate rather than waiting until theyeat away our roads If this was done, I am sure that our reads would last longer, and therefore, I ara requesting the ministry to look for ways and means of utilizing some cf the more wealthy local authorities in the repair of these potholes so that they do not rait for the team frcm the Ministry cf Public Morks to repair them Mr. reputy Speaker, Sir, the last point that I would like to makeis to request the Ministry to try end speed up the construction of the dual  carriage way from Thika tollakutano MeWe are aware that the tenders for this jobhave already been awarded and we are anxious waiting fcr this work to start.			  I am saying so because this road is extremely important since it takes are ofa very large areas of this countrvWith those remarks , I beg to second.</Newspeech>       ( Question proposed) <Newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Omido): Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to first of all pay tribute to the minister for the manner in which he has moved his vote and for the manner in which he has been running the affairs cf this ministry Comparably, our roads today are much better than those in nary ether developing country Cne thing, however, whicli I third the ministry ought to consider seriously, is the standard of our roads Perhaps one would ask whether the standard of our roads good enough to cater for the heavy vehicles that are currently using the roads today. I am saying so because in many case, you would find that the trucks that are allowed to use our roads today, are actually causing a lot of damage to these roads You will have noticed, for example, that the road between kiambu and the Escarpment was very good previously, but since these heavy trucks were allowed to use the road, now there are very many potholes Previously, no heavy vehicles were allowed to use the road and no, we are spending a lot of money in the repair of those roads after allowing these trucks to use our roads, The standard of these roads does not warrant the use of heavy vehicles on them and the ministry should take immediate action so that if a vehicle is found to bo too heavy to use our roads, then it is not to use our roadsOn toll charges, I would like to say that there are areas where one passes through three toll stations before reaching ones d destination, which means he has to pay a toll fee for three times If a bus ora track is travelling from Nairobi to kakamega, the Driver has to pay a toll at Naivaska, then at Londiani and finally at kibos before finally reaching kakamega I think this is grossly unfair and a way should be found to remove this unfairness If I have paid a toll fee at Naivaska, I should use the same ticket to cover the whole journey so that it does not look like one is being penalised unfairly. This is very important because many of the people who run lorries and matatus are comaplaining that these charges are too high, especially when one has to go through three toll stations.	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, with regard to roads leading to our farms, I think the hon. Seconder of the Motion said that our country's economy depends mainly on agriculture, in which case, it is important for us to make sure that farmers have good roads by which to deliver their produce, such as milk, eggs, fruits and vegetables. If we do not have good roads in agricultural areas, we make it very difficult for farmers to progress because they encounter a lot of loss. Due to vehicle breakdown, sometimes they are unable to deliver their produce, and this causes a loss in the country's revenue.There are Government estates that fallunder this Ministry, and these estates have been almost completely neglected. I have Mbotela Estate, for example, which is in my constituency. This is a Government estate. I have written letters and seen the officers concerned personally about this estate, but nothing has been done about the matter ever since I came to this Parliament more than 10 years ago. The houses in this estate have not seen a paint, the roads there have not been repaired, the estate has not been cleaned, the lighting there has been in a mess and everything else there has been in a mess for a long time now. The Government employees living there feel that they have neglected. This is a simple matter in which I think the Ministry concerned could get one or two overseers to maintain the estate. If you go there now, you will find that the grass in most of the estate is overgrown because there is nobody to cut it. So, I think something urgent needs to be done about this and other similar estates.These estates need to be upgraded because they were constructed during the colonial days and the floors of the houses there are terrible. In Mbotela, for example, the Ministry tried to renovate the floors. It look some people there who chipped off the floors and left them like that. Nothing has been done about them yet. The toilets there are in a deplorable situation. So,I feel that something should be done about this matter very quickly.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are also access roads in the countryside. The countryside has really developed. We are developing because of better roads, hospitals, schools, and so on. However, if our people cannot move about easily in their cars on rural access roads, we cannot say that our people in the countryside are enjoying the fruits of our Independence. I feel that attention needs to be given to rual access roads, too, some of which have been neglected to suchan extent that they are now impassable. Some bridges have been so neglected that even children find it difficult to cross rivers during the rainy season when going to school. So, I think the Ministry should also give a lot of consideration to rural access roads.Apart from that, I think the Ministry has done a good job and that it really needs this money. I am sure that the House agrees with me that without this money, our roads will not be maintained to the standard we would like them to be.Mr. Deputy Speaker left the ChairThe Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Wabuge) took the ChairWith these few words, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MAKAU: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to air my comments in support of this Ministry's Vote. As has been said earlier, the Ministry of Public Works is very crucial to the economic development of this country. Road infrastructure is very crucial in Kenya, and we would like to urge the Ministry to improve its budget. When you look at the amount of money the Minister is asking this House to approve, it is very clear that more than 70 per cent of the money is going to be spend on employment expenses and that only about 22 per cent or even less than this is going to be spend on the actual tarmacking and maintenance of roads.However, there is one area on which the Ministry should conentrate, that is rural access roads or the Minor Roads Programme. Everybody is aware of the financial constraints that the country is facing. We arc also aware that big projects may not possibly be completed in time. What has been seen of the Minor Roads Programme is that it has opened up agricultural areas, and I hope that other hon. Members have seen this. In my constituency Mbooni, there are many hills and the area is very productive as far as coffee is concerned. Rural access roads have opened up areas that were hitherto inaccessible. Apart from this, we are also aware that this country is facing a very actue unemployment problem.(Hon. Members applauded as the Vice-President and Minister for Finance entered the Chamber)The Minor Roads Programme has created many jobs for the people in countryside, and we would like to urge the Ministry to spend more money on rural access roads because they open up rural agricultural areas and creating employment. I urge the Ministry to make sure that the people employed to manage these roads are paid. Currently, those who have been employed for this purpose, especially in my constituency, have not been paid for the last few months. When you visit other constituencies, you are told that these people have been working, but they are not being paid. I do not know whether this is happening all over the country or not, but I would like the Ministry to look into this matter", especially in respect of Machakos District where such people have not been paid for the last three months. This is demotivating people who are doing a very good job. The situation, not only in Mbooni but also- in other constituencies, has become very awkward. The other very important thing in this programme is that the roads being constructed by these people are more durable because the murrain they use is better than that which is used by some people who are given tenders. Most of our contractors come with inferior murrain, but that which is used by our people is of good quality.Having said that let me say that the Ministry of Public Works should liaise very closely with the Office of the President, especially when it comesto the concept of bringing administration closer to the people by establishing new district and dividional headquarters.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am saying so we hare the proposed "Makue: District which is in the process of "being created. This is a concept "because administration is being brought closer to the people. The Ministry of Public Works should liaise with the c Ministries in this regard. This is because the aim of bringing administration closer to the people is to all people easy access to their District Commissioner. The but for the offices of the new Makueni District are almost complete Ministry of Public Works is involved in makxngsarc making sure it the work is completed on time. But they forgot to cons access roads to that District. This is because the new Distric Headquarters will "be inaccessible during the rainy season. The us who live in that District will not be able to go to Wote who will he the Headquarters of the new district. The Ministry of Public '.Yorks is overseeing the construction of the Headquarter: you will find that the contractors have no access to the constr sites "because the roads are not passable during the rainy season I would like to urge the Ministry to consider, as a matter of urgency, the tarmacking of the road from Tawa to Wote which is about 30 kilometres long while thinking about the major road which may be tarmacked later. This is because when the new district headquarters become operational it will be impossible to all of us, even the Government officers, to reach the headquarte: of that new district during the rainy season. The Minister himself has visited that area and he knows it very well. But me tell him that he was able to reach the new headquarters of that; district because he went there during the dry season. If it was during the wet season, he would not have been able Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. the Ministry should also consider tarmacking another short road, from Tawa Market to Kikima Market in Mbooni Divisional Headquarters, so that administration is brought closer to the people. This is because the whole idea of  creating a new district is to bring administration closer to the people. But we cannot say we have taken administration closer to the people when in fact they have no access to the District Commissioner's office or the District Officer's office. Since the Ministry of Public works is overseeing the construction of these buildings, it should also liaise with the Office of the President They should also think about the roads.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would now like to touch on the question of gravelling the roads in this country. If you go around the rural areas you will find that roads in those areas are in a pathetic situation. I would like to urge the Ministry to make sure that the roads are maintained all the time. You will find that in a large district like Machakos, there are only two graders. You will also find that only one of these two graders is functioning. But I would like to thank the ministry for grading the roads in my constituency recently. However, roads in Machakos District are in a terrible condition. I would like the Minister to tell us what his people in the field stations do. They never come out of their camps even to lock at the road which passes next to their camp. I am speaking about one station near Tawa Market. If you talk to those people they will tell you that they have no money. But why are they stationed there? The Ministry should hire more people to maintain our roads. These people should seal potholes on our roads. They should also construct culverts where they are required.There is no point of sending a grader to repair a road which has been damaged by rain water during the rainy season, when there are no culverts. This is because when the rains come again, the road is washed away again.With those few remarks, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipa nafasi hii ili nami niweze kuiunga mkono Hoja hii. Zwanza ningependa kumshukuru Waziri kwa kazi yake nzuri.

Lakini sasa utaona kwamba maneno yetu Miininn yanaishia kule watu wetu wanak oishi. Haya yote yanatokana na juhudi sa Waziri huyu.Kitu ambacho ningependa kukitaja hapa ni kwamba yafaa Wizara hii ipewe pesa inazohitaji. Lakini yafaa vile vile Wizara hii ihakikishe kwamba pesa hizi zinatumiwa kikamilifu na kwa njia ya haki. Ninasema hivi kwa sababu wilaya nyingine hupewa pesa ambazo hazit oshi na hali wilaya nyingine hupewa pesa nyingi. Mwa hivyo. ni lazima pesa hizi zigawanywe kwa njia nzuri. Pia ningeicmba Wizara hii iweke maanani jambo la usimamizi. Mambc mengi yameharibika kwa sababu hakuna usimamizi mzuri. Barabara nyingi sana huharibiwa na mvua katika sehemu za mashambani na hiyyo basi magari huwa liayawezi kuzitumia barabara hizo. Lakini utaona kwamba baada ya mvua kumalizika, Wizara huchukua mdua mrefu sana kuzitengeneza barabara hizi. Hii ni kwa sababu hakuna nnxmamz usimamizi msuri katika Wizara.Kuhusu ma iengo ya Serikali. na hasa yale ya hospital! hukaa muda mrefu bila ' kurekbishwa.

Nayoa kwaeba wizara ina nia njeaa lakini ukweli ni kwaraba bila ya usiaainizi mvrema tutakuwa txmapitisha pesa hapa na pesa hi so zitslrawa zikisalizika kwa njia s rsasrforc ambazo hazijulihani.Hivi majuzi tuliongea juu ya graders. rTinaishukxara Wizara kwa sababu ilifahya bidii na kuona kwaihba graders mbili simepelekwa kule Kvrale.

Kwa hivyo, naomba matipa yapatikane ili yasaidie kuweka murrain katika barabara zetu.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, vile vile ni muhimu kwa Wizara hii kuona kwamba nyumba zinazoishi afanyakazi wa Serikali zinahifadhiwa sawa sawa. Kwa mf ana, kuna wafanyakazi wa Serikali ambao wanapata taabu sana kwa sababu nyumba wanamoishi zinavuja, vioo vimepasukapasuka na havijarekebishwa kwa miaka kadhaa. Kwa hivyo, ikiwa pesa hizi zitapatikana, naomba tuhakikishe kwamba wafanya kazi wa Serikali wanaishi kwa njia inayotakikana. Tukitaka kupe'nde'za mfanyakazi wa Serikali, basi ni lazima tuonyeshe kwamba tunamtambua kwamba yeye ni mfanyakazi sawasawa na anafanya kazi ya ujenzi wa taifa. Kwa mfano, katika upande wa Kwale kuna nyumba za Serikali ambazo haziishiki kwa sababu ya uchafu. Ni wajibu wa Wizara hii kuhakikisha kwamba nyumba hizi zinahifadhiwa. Mara kwa mara tumeambiwa kwamba pesa zimaisha, lakini ninaamini kwamba kwa ujasiri wa Waziri huyu pesa zinaweza kupatikana wakati wowote. Huyu ni Waziri anayejua kuomba, kusema na watu na kunyenyekea. Nina hakika kwamba Waziri huyu hataweza kutumia lugha hii ya kusema kwamba pesa zi.viewisha kwa sababu anajua kuomba. Kwa hivyo, ni ombi langu kwa sababu nyumba za Serikali, hata zile zinazoishi wafanyakazi wa vyuo vya chini, vitengenezwe kwa sababu hao ndio wanaowe'za kuiinua Wizara hii.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, katika sehemu ya Kinango kuna nyumba moja ya mkuu wa tarafa ambayo hivuja kila mvua inaponyesha. Nilisema jambo hili lakini kwa sababu hakukuwa na pesa rafiki yangu mhe. Waziri hajatenda lolote hadi sasa. Lakini kwa sababu sasa tunapitisha pesa hizi, namwomba ajaribu kuiangalia sehemu ya Kinango kwa sababu tunataka kuishi kama watu wengine.Ni jambo la kustaajabisha kwambas mara nyingi watu ambao wanatoatenda Na hapa ningependa kumshukuru Waziri kwa sababu waTanyakazi wa Wizarahii katika Wilaya ya Kwale ni watu wanaosikiliza na kutii amri za Serikali. Lakini tu ningemwomba Waziri awapatie vifaa maofisa hao kwa sababu hawa ni watu - mabacho wamekosa ni vifaa. Kwa hivyo, pesa zikipatikana, ninamwomba Waziri ahakikishe kwamba wafanyakazi walio katika Wilaya ya Kwale "wamepatiwa vifaa ili barabara zetuziwe nzuri.Jambo linigne ambalo ningetaka kusema ni kwamba sisi tuna miji ya aina mbali mbali. Nikiisifu Wizara hii, ningependa maofisa walio hapa wajua kwamba tungepe'nda miji yetu ite'ngenezwe sawasawa. Barabara zinazoelekea katika miji.yetu zina mashimo me'ngi ambayo ni ya ajabu. Kwanza tunataka maintenance unit katika Wilayaya Kwale ihakikishe kwamba mashimo katika barabara zetu yame zibwa kabisa. Kwa hivyo, ni ombi langu kwamba kwa sababu nimeisifu Wizara hii, kutoka sasa kazi itafanyika vizuri. Nikimshukuru mtu mara nyingi yeye hutukuka kabisa kwa sifa hiyo. Ikiwa nimewasifu maofisa wa Wizara hii jinsi hiyo, wafaa kutoka nje na kuangalia kila mahali ili watu wapate habari kamili kuhusu nchi yetu tukufu.Kwa hayo machache, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, naunga mkono.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Nyagah): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for being able to see me. I have caught your eye and I am thankful to have this opportunity to give my views on matters touching on the Ministry of Public Works. I wish to thank the Minister and his entire staff for the work they have done' and they are continuing to do to provide mtunda ya Uhuru to all Kenyans everywhere.My first appointment as a member of the Government was in the former Minist of Works, Power and Communications, and I can remember how very little we had in the field of roads. Did we drive to Mombasa or Kisumu, Embu or Nyeri on murrain road? Today, what we are asking the Ministry to do is to patch up the poholes, have more access roads tarmacked and to put bridges in a more permanent nature. I would also urge that i the rural areas we need to have more work done by hand, especially the maintenance of the rural access roads. It is the hand workers who know how to put the drainage better than the machinery. It is the people who maini in roads by using their jembes and folks that will not disturb the stable	surface, whereas a grader coming and doing a seemingly good job in about an hour will leave untold harm behind when a small amount of rain falls on that road. It may be necessary to make more use of the road reserves. Perhaps, if more trees were planted as it is in some countries, we shall have both the roads protected from some; of the unnecessary soil erosion. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to see more road¬side camps placed at different place's, at reasonable distances where the people living in them can be able to see what part of the road needs the greates attention. Sometimes we vote money for a stretch of a road, and before the whole road is done, the money is over. With the little money we have available, we should examine^ or inspect the roads carefully and do only those patches which need attention at any particular time. Sir, talking about buildings, the service required in this area is great both in terms of maintenance and putting up new buildings. I think the time has come when we should have simpler buildings put up in such a way that they can either be improved or completed by phases. If we have to house all the civil servants that we post to the divisional or locational headquarters, simpler houses which can be used by those officers should be constructed instead of these officers living behind shops. As money becomes available, finishing of some of these houses can be done. After all, those who used to govern us used to do so from tents and from mud houses and they did it well. We can do it better than them by making use of our local material such as murrain, blocks, cement and things like that, and even sometimes we can use timber for bridges. If we insist on building bridges the way we do today, we shall have only a few bridges at a time and leave very many rivers uncrossable. I do not think there is any crime at all in having some drifts in some rivers instead of having no bridges at all. I remember that there was a Motion in this House many years ago where we were' condemning drifts. I will say that in some places drifts can be considered as a means of crossing. After all, rains do not continue for the whole time; they continue for a while and yet we want to cross from one ridge Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, talking about the sign posts, I have found, particularly in my area and other adjacent ones, that wooden sign posts are normally stolen. These are either stolen by people who can make little doors, windows, tables, chairs and stools for themselves. Why can we not go back to the old system where a block of cement, or stone, was curved and position to indicate the mileages and directions to a given area? Nobody will come and steal such a heavy and ugly looking sign post. Sign posts are required for every crossing to a school, or from one farm to another to indicate the crossing points for livestock, are necessary. Coming back home, let me say that Embu is most unfortunate as we have only two roads. I thank the Minister for the roads that have been made, especi¬ally the one from Kangonde to my Gachoka Constituency to Embu However, there is a road that needs to be done and that is the one from Masinga Dam right across Mwea to join the rest of Kirinyaga. There is a road that could be done from Embu to connect southern and eastern Embu and Meru. They call it Mate Road but it is a road that is known very well. It can be of very good use as it was done of murrm but the time has come for it to be tar acked as people have settled down there.	Talking about hospital buildings and houses or provincial headquarters I think my Embu Provincial Hospital has suffered a lot. The foundations were made and for the last four years or so, nothing seems to be forthcoming. We need that hospital to be given some consideration so that the building is completed. As I speak, I can see the Minister in charge here and I am happy also to note that the Vice-President and Minister for Finance is also here and, therefore, the Treasury is equally within earshot to get my statement.To go back slightly to roads in Embu, let me say that the second road we have is a trunk road to Meru. I do not think we have any road in Embu that we can call an Embu tarmac road, specifically for Embu. The time has come for the Ministry to consider looking into that provision.     Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I started by saying that we done a lot in the field of communications in this country, from the days the areas like Kisumu-Nairobi, Mombasa-Nairobi, Mombasa-Nairobi were not connected by tarmac roads to the present state where we are in.. I remember once upon a time trying to see the connection of tarmac to see the progre of Kericho-Molo, Sigalagala-Kapsabet. Today I am happy to see that some has been done. However, I would like to say that much has been done under political Government and much will be required to be done under the same Government. Then we spoke, and we still speak, and action follows, not laziness or an attitude of not working. Much was spoken then and actio: was necessary to get us Independence was done. However, anybody who this today that we have gone beyond the stage of talking and consulting each for the salvation of this country and thinks that he can bring in guns of violence to this country, or incitement of the people of this country, is a terrible mistake in this country and his road is coated with disaster, people do not see that we need peace in this country. We need unity country.Yesterday we had the greatest joy of seeing the President here been in this House for a very long time so long that I do not recall any I saw a Head of State, a Governor for that matter, sit here and take par debate, as we saw yesterday.(applause)Yesterday was the first day I saw a Head of State take part in a debate with fellow hon. Members, and making a contribution. On top of that cor he urged Kenyans to be united and to maintain peace so that we can do things. To him I give my heartiest congratulations as he starts his 35 service this country as an hon. Member of Parliament.I have seen His Excellency the President in days when things He was being abused and was supervising and representing the biggest area of the lot, with 13 districts. He did a jolly good job of work. I have heard him being accused falsely by some people but he has come out. We must work with him for the good of this country.       On that count, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Chesire): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Public Works for the good work that he has done since taking over the Ministry. Here is a Minister who, at least, has taken heed of our calls in this House that certain things be done in his Ministry. I am glad, as I stand here, to say that I am pleased to see the Kabete-Limuru Road being done right now; the Timboroa Road being done right now and, also the Tirnboroa Eldoret Road and Eldoret Turbo Road. Many others are also being done.It is gratifying to note that one can move to many parts of the country today on roads that have been tarmacked or bituminised. I must congra¬tulate the Ministry for this great work that has been done. This is because time taken to move from one point to another has been greatly shortened. I must really congratulate the Ministry for this great effort and for the work that has been done with the limited resources available.We have a road, for example, from Eldama Ravine to Nyaru and this is one road that is passable and can take one to Eldoret with ease, particularly at this time when the main Nakuru-Eldoret Road is under construction. This is a good alternative. There are many other parts of the country which used to be in accessible but, today, they nave passable roads and I have seen routes that are of tourist attractions along such areas. For example, I can mention the Nakuru-Kabarnet-Iten-Eltioret road which is the most beautiful road in the country. I recommend anybody wanting to see the beauty of this country to travel on a road such as that one. I must really congratulate the Ministry for that. At the same time, going to my area of Uasin Gishu, I must also congratulate the Ministry for the work that is being done in constructing roads and tarmacking the road from Elcoret through Ziwa and terminating at Kitale. This is a rural road covering a very fertile agricultural area, where we grow most of the wheat and maize for this country. The only unfortunate thing is that the contractor who was supposed to complete the job in April, last year, has only done about 65 per cent of the total work. He still has a long way to go. I would like to urge the Ministry to ensure that the contractor is made to complete that job as quickly as possible. I would also like to take this opportunity to tell the Minister that the standard of the road may not be strong enough to carry the heavy traffic that will be using that road. That is a road through which, as I said, there will be a lot of agricultural produce being transported and you must have very heavy traffic on it. I would like to send an early warning to the Ministry that when funds are available, or if they can spare any funds from anywhere, they should do something about increasing the carrying capacity of that road. At the moment, it is very small and it may not last long. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like to urge the Ministry that, since the existing contract is only for about 40 kilometres of the road and there will be another 80 or so to complete the road through to Kitale, it tries and allocates funds so that the whole section of the road is completed without the Ministry having to suspend the work in order to look for funds. While still on this one. I would like to touch on the Eldoret-Turbo Road. This is a high way on which traffic move very fast. As Turbo Town has many people and heavy vehicles enter the town moving very fast, I would like to urge the Minister to put road troughs at Turbo Town. At the moment there is a danger and if the Minister puts speed troughs in a small section within the town this will help wananchi there considerably. I would now want to turn to rural access roads. As I said before areas like Uasin Gishu District used to have large-seal farms. The only roads in these areas used to be those from the main town. In the case of my area, from Eldoret to the farmer's farm house in the case of Trans-Nzoia from Sitale to the farm house Now that most of the land has been cut up into small pieces there is need to have many more rural access roads, particular in Uasin Gishu and Trans-Nzoia districts, so that farmers can move their produce from the farms to the market places more easily. I would also like to join the hon. Member for Kinango in congratulating the Ministry for providing road graders. But we all know that a grader without a tipper cannot do the job very well., This more so during the rainy period because when you put a grader on wet road you worsen the situation: The road becomes more muddy and more difficult to pass on. So the Ministry should finish at it what is doing by making tippers available in all the areas with tippers so that roads can be gravelled. I can assure you that once the rural access roads have been gravelled they will be passable all the time. In the case of Trans-Nzoia I am asking for four tippers to complement the two graders which have supplied so that we can have as many passable roads as possible.Finally, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch on the question of professional services to Government projects. Time and again the Government undertakes huge projects like buildings and roads. We know that the Ministry has many highly qualified professionals like architects, quantity seurveyors, and electricians. One wonders why the Ministry should hire private consultants when it is carrying out major jobs when its officers are doing very little. I urge the Minister to ensure that all public jobs are undertaken by Government professionals because they are as qualified as private consultants. I am sure by doing that the Ministry will save sufficient money to enable it do a few more tarmack roads.With those few remarks I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE VICEr-PRE5ID3iTT AND MINISTER FOR PITTANCE (Prof. Saitoti);- Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. I am happy to contribute to this debate on the Vote of the Ministry of Public Works. This particular Ministry is charged with a very important responsibility in this country, namely the construction and maintenance of roads and public buildings.There is no doubt that over the years this Ministry has done a commendable job. One can actually state without any hesitation that in Africa Kenya has the most elaborate road network which the various important productive areas and administrative centres in this country. Indeed, whenever visitors from other African countries come here they are amazed by the extent to which our roads have developed and maintained. This would not have been possible if it were not for the fact that this Ministry is well managed. I can. say that from the point of view of the Treasury this is one Ministry that we hold in high esteem. It has been able to utilise money allocated to it properly and account for it.Therefore, this Ministry serves as a very good example of how the other Ministries ought to operate.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, not only has this Ministry constructed trunk roads to district and provincial headquarters^but has also been instrumental in the construction of of the access roads, which are the nerve for taking development in the rural areas where the majority of our people live. Much of our economic activities, especially the agricultural ones, take place in the rural areas. It is thus important that we have access roads to ensure that once harvested produce is easily taken to market places, We believe this is important and wish to urge the Ministry to continue with the noble task of constructing and maintaining access roads because they serve our people and provide a major boost in the growth of our economy.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to add only two points as an observation because I think this is very important. This Ministry perhaps needs to utilize mar-power labour as opposed to machinery in the construction of access roads. I am saying this because if more emphasis is made on the use of manpower labour, there are two benefits that would accrue immediately. One, is that today, we are dealing with rath the problem of unemployment and it is a very serious problem. If we use manpower in the construction of these roads as opposed to machinery, that would go along way to reduce unemployment problem in this country. Therefore, we should strive as much as possible- to provide employment opportunities to cur people "wherever we can. This could be done if we were able to use the available manpower that is available locally. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, point number two which is as equally important is that by using the local manpower that is available in the contraction of these access roads as opposed to using machinery, we save our hand currency which would have been used to buy petrol, diesel, spare parts and so on. These are days when we have to be very careful in the way we utilise our fuel because the price of petrol and its products, has gene up very high. It was just the other day that a barrel of petrol was costing only I; dollars but today, the same barrel is costing 40 dollars. That, in itself obliges all cf us to exercise economy wherever we can especially in the usage of fuel. Where we can be able to save one dollar, let us save it so that it can be used for investment which could in turn be able to create employment opportunities to our people.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other area where we should pay a great deal of attention, is the area of maintenance of our roads, we should concentrate, by and large, on the maintenance of the roads that we have already- constructed. I would even dare to say that we should not open up new roads before we repair the existing ones. Me must always ensure that we have good roads in order to improve on our communication and this would bring about equal development. However, we should also understand one very important thing that if we allow the existing roads to deteriorate, then the cost of rehabilitation of these roads in our road network. This entails, of course, making sure that we repair all the potholes on our various roads, We should do the host We can to repair these potholes because if we do not do this, it is going to cost us a lot of money to eventually repair these roads. Let us not get to a position where" we allow our roads to he like a number of roads in some of our neighbouring countries. I do not want to name these countries, but we certainly of certain African countries where the tarmacked roads were left urrepaired for SO long that eventually, they turned into marrum reads. You will find that the marrum on these roads eventually became eroded and these roads have now become impassable. we do not want to get into such a state of affairs and therefore, we should try to x maintain our good road network. The Kenya road network has teen known for its efficiency and has been commended internationally. We should try to maintain this standard on our roads.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that since this Ministry is also involved in the construction of public houses, the Minister for Public "forks, along with the Minister for Lands and Lousing,  should should look for ways and means of providing cheap houses for our people. Cheap house models could actually he developed so that cheap and decent houses could he built for our people. I am saying this because it has become very expensive today for the ordinary person to be able to afford a reasonable house« As a result, we have, a lot of slums mashrocoming all over the country and would to rehabilitate these slums. If you looked at the const of constructing one unit, you would, find it extremely high and ways and 2eans should he looked for in designing cheap house models for cur people, therefore, I appeal to this Ministry and other relevant Ministries to really cctr.e up' with a model of affordable v houses for wananchi. Me want cheap houses to he designed so that wananchi could afford to put them up. This would go a long way in eradicating the ayssore that we have continued to experience in our towns. I know this getting to be way big challenge to this Ministry but since we knew that it being asked by a very capable Minister when we all respect. I have no doubt that this could be completed. We must come with a soution for the eyesore of we see all over the place. Mr. Temporary' Deputy Speaker, Sir, the ether thin; I would like to say here is this: I did a while ago, allude to the fact that the Gulf crisis has brought about a situation where the prices of petroleum products have gone up tremendously from 15 dollars to 40 dollars in a matter of a few weeks. I would like to submit in this August House that in the history of the price increase of oil, the increase has never been as high as it is today. Even curing the oil crisis of 1973, the highest price per barrel was only 33 dollars, and therefore, 40 dollars, is a bit too high. This is a situation which I believe, that all of us Kenyans must understand, because it is an international crisis. which is biting very deep into the world economy. Since we do not have our own oil as yet in Kenya, we must exercise great care in the usage of petrol. Perhaps the Almighty God will one day bless us with oil in Kenya but for the time being, it we do not have it we must import oil which is costing us and ether countries all over the world, a lot of money. Thi crisis has brought about high inflation economy all over the world; it has brought about a recession in the world economy which is going to affect the demand for experts from developing countries. I would like to say that we must understand the crisis the way it is and face it accordingly like others in the rest of the world. In accepting the fact that there is a problem, we must exercise a great deal of economy in all fields wherever we are. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it behooves every Ministry and sector of this economy to exercise a great deal of economy in the usage of fuel. We must cut down our own appetite for imported goods because a let of money is going to go towards the payment of our oil bill and consequently, many things are going to be difficult to afford. With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. HEMA: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir, for giving me this opportunity to support the vote on the Ministry of Public forks. First of all, I would like to thank the Minister for the very good work that he has been doing in this particular Ministry since he was appointed Minister since he took it over. I would particularly like to thank the Minister, for the narruming work that is currently tailing place on some of the roads in my constituency, however, I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to the Ministry to exercise care in the way it utilizes fuel, building materials and so on. I am saying this because there has been a bad habit on part of some officers in the field ,of selling fuel and marrumn As His Excellency the Vice-President has just cautioned us, we have a problem of oil crisis. The Ministry should check on the officers in the field to. eradicate this habit, of selling fuel and marrum.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir, while thanking the Ministry for the good job that they are doing of marruming some roads in my constituency, I would like to inform the Minister that a lot of marrum has been sold to individuals and this has brought about a very" big problem.This paints a very bad picture of the Government, and I urge the Ministry to act on the problem. This is not the first time I am saying, this; I have said once and again in the House. The Ministry should give the matter very serious consideration. The other issue that the Ministry should consider is the fact that when you construct a. road, this road cannot be complete until you construct bridges over the rivers that traverse it. As I talk here now, there are three bridges across roads linking up various places in my constituency but they have not been constructed. One of these bridges is at Chematit, another at Topswerwa and the other at Gitenden (?). In the case of Gitenden (?), some officers were posted to the site where they stayed for two months. Instead of constructing the bridge, they started scooping sand and selling it to various members of the community there. This is a very serious situation, and the only way we can support our Government in such a case is seal such loopholes.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is not the amount of money that we give to the Ministry that matters, but how this money is used. I say this because the way in' which some of the Ministry's contracts are awarded is quite serious. At times, a project is awarded to somebody but, after two months, this award is cancelled as a result of which delay occurs in the completion of the project involved. In turn, the cost of the project is inflated due to the depreciation of our Shilling. So, the Ministry's officers should be consistent such that if I am awarded a contract, this is done through genuine means. When it comes to the awarding of contracts, we should give as much consideration as possible to our indigenous people because when we award such contracts to them, we are sure that the Eoney that is going to be given out by the Ministry will remain in the country. When various Ministries and parastatal bodies award contracts, you find sians winning them, but they go on to use the expertise of African Kenyans, at the end of which the Asians reap a lot of money from our country. We are net experts, but we stress that our people should benefit. We nave may cualified engineers and architects. Why should they not be even these jobs, instead of giving them to outsiders? In talking about these project, it is serious to realise that although some contracts are given to Africans these are normally given to some particular people. Why do not have a system of rotating contracts so that if somebody wins a contract this time, the contract is given to another person next time, and so on? Why should we concentrate on a particular individual? What I am suggesting could increase employment opportunities in the country.We should also consider the quality of work we get. I do not know whether it is due to poor remuneration of engineers or a sort of national culture that our roads deteriorate so fast. Although some of us are not qualified engineers, but when we look at the quality of work that is done on our roads, we find it to be very poor. Deterioration of roads is contributed by the traffic using them, but this is not the only reason; there is also the quality of the work done on the roads. If engineers are paid so little money that they need an extra 10 per cent to subsidise their daily living, they should tell us this so that we may consider increasing their salaries. It is not good to allocate money for the construction of a road this year, and then, after three years, we allocate some more money for the repair of the same road.As far as cess is concerned, I am made to understand that some local authorities have separate accounts in which they keep about 80.per cent of the rates they collect from local communities, and that they are waiting for guidelines from the Ministry of Public Works on what they should do with this money and how best to spend it. I urge the Ministry to make sure that these guidelines are provided within the shortest time possible so that this money may be used quite effectively. If these guidelines had been provided, some local authorities would already have assisted in opening up some rural roads. On several occasions, we have talked about the state of rual roads. We thank the Ministry for the Rural Access Roads Programme, but the Ministry should look again at the design of these roads. The slope on either side of the road may assist in peak surface run—off, but it creates a high erodibility of the road. So, the Ministry should reduce the slope gradient as much as possible such that the road drains off very well and, at the same time, does not erode as fast as to require other expenditure within a short time.The Ministry should also look into the issue of road maintenance. At the moment, the Ministry's officers make one mistake in road maintenance. Instead of opening culverts in various places in such a manner as to divert surface run—off away from the road in manageable amounts, they leave the run—off aside only to open culverts at a certain stage where the water runs into somebody's farm. This causes a lot of erosion of fertile soil. So, the Ministry should consider letting this water flow in manageable amounts. The other issue that we should consider is the question of Government vehicles. We are thankful to His Excellency the President for his novelty idea of instructing this Ministry to maintain Government vehicles. However, there is still a lot to be done as far as Government Ministries are concerned. You realise that if a vehicle gets a small dent, it remains idle for a number of months, which makes the vehicle depreciate so fast that, at the end of the day, the Ministry decides that the vehicle should eventually be bonded and sold. Funny enough not many ordinary people find their way into buying these vehicles. Some of them are bought by Government officers. Today you will see Government officers, a few Patels and Shahs driving vehicles of this sort. So, we urge the Ministry to be very economical in this matter.With those remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support theMotion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Mutwol): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chance to contribute to this very important Motion on the Vote of the Ministry of Public Works. Let it be known that this Ministry is so important that if we were to do away with it today, this would be doing away with all the development that we need in the country. It is actually Ministry of Public Works, and its officers have to work. It is not the Ministry of Public Sleepers, but of Public Works. Howeverthis is not an easy Ministry to operate. Everybody in this country needs to have tarmac, and murrain roads, but it is impossible for the Ministry to do everything at a go.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker., Sir, I am happy to note that the Ministry has "been functioning in a good way. The Ministry has constructed and maintained the good roads that we have in this country. We have better roads when compared to roads in Tanzania or  Uganda. We are far ahead of these countries in terms of good roads. The Ministry of Public Works has tried its best to maintain our roads. It has also built new roads for us.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have a few points which I want the Minister to take note of. Every year I have been requesting the Ministry of Public Works to ban the transportation of logs by road. But you will find that this has continued and as a result, many lives have been lost on our roads. Some of these huge roads break down in the middle of the road thereby blocking the road to other road users. Most of the drivers who drive these long vehicles have a I do hot care attitude". Many people have lost their lives on our roads because of the carelessness on the part of the transporters of wood and logs. If the Minister does not have the powers to stop these people let bring the relevant law here so that we can amend it to make the transportation of logs by rail mandatory. The Kenya Railways Corporation is quite capable of transporting these logs. So we do not see the reason why these logs should be transported at night. I hope the Ministry will take these points seriously. This is because cur roads are getting worse every day because of the transportation of logs by road.The other point, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, regards the replacement of retired workers, particularly in Elgeyo-Marakwet District. We used to have maintenance camps in Elgeyo-Marakwet but these camps are empty now. There are no people. Most of the workers retired but they were never replaced. We have learnt through reliable sources that the newly employed people in Elgeyo Marakwet are taken to other places. We would like the Minister to look into this matter seriously. This is because if a tree falls across the road today, we have to remove it on Marambee basis. Those who used to maintain the roads are no longer there. The Engineer there has written letters and reminders to the Ministry Headquarters asking for permission to replace these workers. I hope that the Ministry will do something about this problem. The Ministry should establish more maintenance camps. It is a good idea to construct good roads. But it ±s makes little sense to construct roads and then neglect them. We must maintain the roads that we have built. That is why we need these workers to work on our roads. Earlier one, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, somebody had talked about bulldozers, graders and tippers. we need them in every district in this country. We have a District works Officer in every district in this country. In most cases the graders, tippers and so on are not serviceable. There should be some mechanics posted to every district to maintain construction machinery. I appeal to the Ministry to give us more graders and tippers in Elgeyc-Marakwet District. The district is quite large: we have Elgeyos and krairwets. So, we need three graders for Elgeyos and three for Marakwets. I have a reason for saying so. The reason is best known to us in the district. MR. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, an hon. Member talked about toll stations. This is the best way of taking us to contribute money towards the maintenance of our roads. I am happy about toll stations and so on. But it reaches a point where taxation becomes somehow embarrassing. You tax people upto a point where the taxpayer says "No" "I have paid at Gilgil; why should I pay at Nakuru, Eldoret or Kakamega on the same day?"  Therefore the Ministry should take note of that. There should be a regulation allowing the Minister to build toll stations at certain intervals. After how many kilometres should you build a road toll station? If you build these toll stations at the interval of 20 kilometres you make the ordinary Kenyans feel that they are being over-taxed. This matter should be looked into very seriously. Those who work at the toll stations should not tell motorists "We have no change." This is a serious matter; they are supposed to get change from the bank not from the motorists. The other point is about road signs, we have nicely tarmacked roads but there are no road signs on those roads. Luring; the colonial days roads used to have signs indicating the distance and so on. The Ministry should instal these road signs to show us very thing. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, when the Minister was moving this Motion, he talked very nicely; I heard him talk about many roads to be tarmacked next year and years to come. Surprisingly enough the Minister did not talk of any road that is to be tarmacked in Elgeyo-Marakwet. I would like to say that the name of the district is Elgeyo-Marakwet but one part of the District has never seen a tarmac road since Independence. I urge the Minister to balance development in the district by tarmacking the roadfrom Iten to Kapsowar. The Minister must "balance development in Elgeyo-Marakwet otherwise the people will think the Minister is biased. We want that road to be tarmacked because we have already passed it in the D.D.C. At one the there was a Presidential Directive to tarmack that road but that directive has never been implemented. The Kerio Valley Road should also be tarmacked. The Minister owes us an explanation as to why that road has not been tarmacked. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in 1934, the NationalYouth Service came there, ready with money, to murrem that road from Kirewar up to West Pokot. But all of a sudden they were moved to another place and we are still for that road to be murramed. Even if it means going to church to pray for them to corns back we will do so. This is because we want that road to be murramed.The ether one is Mitale Kapcherep Road. Kapchercp is a tea growing area: we grow a lot of tea there but the road is terrible. If there is no money to tarmack the road then it should be murramed. So, we are requesting the Ministry to tarmack that road from Mitale to Mapcherop so that this tea growing area can be served well.With those few remarks, I beg to support the Moti on.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIMEMIA: Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipa nafasi hii ili nami niseme machache kuhusu Hoja hii. Kwanza kabisa, nataka kumshukuru Waziri wa Ujenzi kwa vile ameonyesha kwamba anazielewa taabu zetu. Nataka pia kumshukuru Waziri kwa vile' alivyokuja na maofisa wake kutoka katika kila mkoa ili wasikilize mambo tutakayozungumza hapa kuhusu maendeleo ya Wizara hii. Nikianza kwa kugusia barabara zetu, utaona kwamba Wizara inaweza kutengeneza barabara na inaharibika wakati mfupi sana. Uhifadhi wa barabara peke yake umekuwa wa kustaajabisha sana. Hii ni aibu sana. Utaona kwamba hata kukata kikingi na kurudisha mabati yanayowekwa katika kona za barabara imekuwa kazi ambasyo haifanywi ingawa haihitaji ustadi. Hiyo ni kazi ya mkono ambayo inaweza kufanyika kwa urahisi sana. Hii ndiyo sababuunaona kwamba barabara zetu hazina safe guards katika kona. Ningemwonba Waziri achukue hatua ya kuha kikisha kwamba mabati hayo yanarudishwa mara tu yanapogongwa na kutolewa katika barabara. Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, wakati mwingine utashangaa kuona hata nyasi ikimea katika barabara au kando kando ya barabara bila kukatwa. Hiyo si kazi ambyo inahitaji ufundi wowote. Je, wakati nyasi inapomea kando kando ya barabara, wahandisi wetu huwa wakifanya kazi gani? Wakat mwengine unakuta huwezai hata kupita gari lililo mbele yako kwa sababu huoni mbele; huwa umezuiwa na nyasi kando kando ya barabara. Hii ni kazi ambayo inaweza kufanyika kwa mikono, na ningemwomba Waziri ahakikishe kwamba imefanyika. Ni lazima kuwe na watu ambao kazi yao ni kukata nyasi kando kando ya barabara.Kama vile Wahe. Wabunge wenzangu walivyosema hapa, nataka kutilia mkazo juu ya uzibaji wa mashimo katika barabara zetu. Ni lazima kuwe na mtu wa kusimamia kazi hii katika kila sehemu ya bar abara zetu. Ni kwa nini hakuna watu ambao jukumu lao ni kuangalia mahali mashimo yako katika barabara na kuyaziba haraka yanapotokea? Kuhusu toll stations, nataka kusema kwamba tunahitaji kuwa na toll stations kila mahali. Lakini ningepenriekeza kwa Wizara we ikishauriana na viongozi wa sehemu fulani wanapotaka kujenga toll stations. Katika sehemu ya Nakuru Mjini, toll station ilikuwa imejengwa ndani ya mji lakini tume'onana na Waziri mwenyewe na akatusaidia na ikaondolewa hapo. Hatungetaka toll stations zijengwa kama ya Nakuru ilivyokuwa; yafaa ziwe kando kando ya mji. Hali ikiwa hivyo, watu wanaoishi mjini wanalipa pesa nyingi sana. Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, katika toll station ya Gilgil nimeona kwamba stakabadhi ambazo tunapatiwa siku hizi ni ya mwaka uliopita. Ukienda katika sehemu za magharibi ya Kenya, utaona kwamba stakabadhi zinar.otolewa kwa wenye - magari ni zile za mwaka uliopita pia. Je, Wizara inafanya nini? Hata karibu sana niulize Swali hapa Bungeni kuhusu jambo hili kwa sababu hii ni kuonye sha kwamba kuna watu wanaotaka kuiba pesa. Hata ukienda kwa gari langu utakuta stabaddhi niliyo nayo ni ya mwaka uliopita; imepigwa tu mhuri upande wa nyuma kuonyesha ni ya mwaka huu. Je, mwenye kuhesabu hizo pesa atazihesabu namna gani? Labda ni zile stakabadhi za mwaka jana ambazo ziliwekwa huko. Kwa hivyo, nataka kuiuliza Wizara ihakikishe kwamba stakabadhi zinazotolewa ni za mwaka huu. Hatutaki kuona stakabadhi za mwaka uliopita tena. Ukiangalia uparae wa magari, tunaona aibu sana juu yamagari ya Serikali. Kwa mfano, magari mengine" ambayo yanafanya kazi katika Nakuru hata hayana taa na ni yale maovu kabisa. Ningeiuliza Serikali ionyeshe mfano mzuri.' Ikiwa magari ya raia yanashikwa kwa sababu ya kuwa katika hali mbovu, ni kwa nini magari ya Serikali hayawezi kushikwa yakikwa katika hali hiyo hiyo? Hata utaona magari mengine' ya Serikali yakiwa na mabati ambayo yanaanguka ovyo ovyo. Katika Nakuru kuna magari mengine ya Serikali ambayo hayana hata nambari. Hii ni aibu na tungetaka Serikali ionyeshe mfano mzuri kwa wanananchi. Hatutaki kuona magari ya Serikali yakiwa katika hali hii. Kwa sababu Serikai inao makanika na karakana, yafaa iwe ikirekebisha magari yake inavyofaa. Ni juu ya Wizara hii kuhakikisha kwamba magari ya Serikali yame'wekwa katika hali safi; yawe na magurudumu mazuri na pia mataa yanayoona vizuri.Kwa hayo machache, Bw. Naibu Spika Muda, naunga mkono.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. ANASWA: Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipatia nafasi hii ili pia niweze kuyatoa maoni yangu kuhusu Wizara tunayozungumzia hapa leo* Xabla sijafanya hivyo, ningependa kuichukua nafasi hii, kama wenzangu walivyofanya jana, kumpongeza Mtukufu Rais kwa kuwa rawanasiasa wa kwanza katika nchi yetu ya Kenya kutimiza miaka 35 kama Mbunge. Sisi sote tuna fahari kubwa sana ya Mtukufu Rais kwa,kuweza kuchukua muda kama huo kuwa akiliendesha taifa letu kwa njia ambayo kila mtu anafurahia. Mingeomba Mwenyezi Mungu ampe bidiL.na. maisha raarefu ili azidi kui.ienga nchi yetu ya Kenya na pia kuendelea kutuelimisha wengine wetu am'oao ni wageni katika mambo ya siasa na mambo ya uongozi. Nikiacha hapo, ningependa sasa kuongea kuhusu Wizara hii ambayo kila mmoja wetu hapa amejitayarisha kuitolea mnoni. Jambo la kwanza ni kutoa pongezi kwa Waziri wetu, mhe. Timothy Mibei kwa jinsi ambavyo anaiendesha Wizara hii. Hivi majuzi Waziri aliweza kuzuru sehemu mbali mbali za Kenya na kukutana na viongozi wa sehemu 'nizo. Alifika sehemu hizo ili kuwapatia viongozi na wananchi mawaidha mengi na nambo mengine mengi kuhusu Wizara yake. Sisi, hasa viongozi na wananchi wa kutoka Mkoa wa Magharibi, tulifurahi sana alipozuru Kakamega na tukanilaki kwa furaha. Aliweza kutuzungumzia mambo mengi kuhusu Wizara yake na jinsi atakavyoendelea kuiencesha na kuitengeneza ili iwe inatoahuduna nzuri zaidi. Ni Mawaziri wac'nache sana wanaochukua fursa kama hiyo kuzuru sehemu nyingi za nchi na kukutana na wananchi ili kuwapatia mawaidha, na kwa jambo hilo alilofanya Bw. Mibei, ninamtolea shukrani nyingi. Ningeom'oa aendelee kufanya hivyo, na asikomee alipoachia kwa kuwa, kwa njia hiyo, tutaendelea kuwa na maendeleo zaidi kupitia kwa Wizara yake. Vile vile ningependa kuwatolea shukrani maofisa katika Wizara yake kwa jinsi ambavyo wanejaribu wawezavyo kuziangalia sehemu mbali mbali hapa nchini. Nikitoa mfano, unaweza kuona kwamba sehemu nyingi nchini zimepata barabara katika sehemu za mashambani ambapo kuna mambo ya kilimo ili tuweze kuyavuna mavuno mengi, hasa kwa upande wa majan.i chai na mavuno mengine yayayo tuletea per za kigeni tunapoyauza katika nchi za nje. Haya ni mnwazo mnzuri sana Vile vile Bw. Waziri arnejaribu sana kuona kwamba barabara nzuri zimetengenezwa kuelekea sehemu ambazo zina viwanda muhimu. Pia kusahav	kwamba hata kwa upande wa utalii, Wizara hii imeweza kuzitengeneza barabara ili kuwawezesha watalii kuzuru nchi yetu na kutembea kwenye barabara hizo wanapotalii ncni yetu. Ningeomba Wizara iendelee kufanya hivyo, si tukatika sehemu nilizotaja, Lakini katika mahali kwingine kwingi nchini ambako barabara zinahitajika. Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, baada ya kusema hivyo, nina jambo fulani ambalo ningependa kuwafahamisha maofisa katika Wizara ya Ujenzi. mara nyingi utaona kwamba katika mikutano ya maendeleo tunayokuwa nayo katika wilaya, kuna maofisa wanaoonekana hawajajitayarisha katika mipango maalum ya ujenzi. Kwa mfano, tunapozipanga pesa za kuzirekebisha barabara, ama kuchukua murrum na kuishindilia barabarani ili barabara iwe ngumu, utaona kwamba maofisa hao wana- sahau mambo fulani muhimu. Mfano ninaopatiana unawahusu maofisa waliosahau kufanya mpango wa pesa ambazo zingeturnika kui'oeba hiyo murrum ili kuiweka kwenye barabara na iwe ngumu vizuri. Sisi kama wanakarnati wa kamati ya maendeleo wilayani tulikuwa na shuku kubwa sana na mambo kama hayo. Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ni lazima wakati wa mipango maofisa wazingatie kwa maanani kazi wanayopaswa kufanya ili mipango ya maendeleo iweze kutekelezwa ifaavyo. Kwa njia hiyo itaweza kuhakikishwa kuwa kila kitu kinacnohitajika katika ujenzi fulani kimetayarishwa. Kwa njia hiyo kosa kama hilo nililotaja haliwezi kutokea tena na hatuwezi kuwa tukikaa mwaka mmoja tukingojea pesa kama hizo kutengwa tena ili kutekeleza jambo lililopangwa. Ni jambo la kinyume kufanya hivyo na ni aibu kufanya mipango mizuri hivyo ambayo baadaye haitekelezwi. Nawaomba maofisa hao wafanye bidii kuhakikisha kuwa mipango yao yote iko sawa.Vile vile utaona kwamba kati ya maofisa hao, wakati wa kufanya kazi wanakuwa walaghai na hawakai kazini mwao. Mtu anatoka na kwenda kufanya kazi mahali fulani na wakati ule ule anahepa na kwenda kufanya mambo yake binafsi. Huo si ulaghai tu bali pin ni ujanj3 amobo ns tuutaki katika kazi zetu. Pia utaona kuwa kuna maofisa wa kutosna kutskeleza kazi za ujenzi wa nyumba na kndhalika, na wana ujuzi wa kuhakikisha kwamba ujenzi wa nyumba fulani una- weza kufanyika kwa ujuzi ili nyumba kama hiyo iwe ya kudurnu kabisa. Lakini jambo la ajabu ni kwamba utaona kwamba nyumba kama hiyo ambayo imesimamiwa na maofisa hawa, baada ya kujengwa, inamaliza siku kadhaa na inaanza kuwa na nyufa. Hii inafanyika kwa sababu gani na maofisa wanaohusika ni watu waliohitimu ifaavyo? Ni jambo la maana kutilia mkazo ujenzi ufaao ili nyumba zinazojengwa na Wizara hii ziwe ni nyumba zilizojengwa kwa umaarufu.Kwa upande wa pesa alizoomba Bw. Waziri hapa, sisi hapa Bungeni tutazipitisha ili aweze kuzitumia. Lakini ingefaa maofisa wake wachunguze kabisa na kuhakikisha kuwa hakuna nyumba mbovu kamwe zinazojengwa na Wizara hii tena; hatutaki kuwa na nyumba zilizo na nyufa na kuwa na aibu kutokana na kazi iliyofanywa na mafundi wa Serikali. Hii ni aibu kwa Serikali yetu na inawapasa maofisa hao kutilia mkazo jambo la kujenga nyumba ambazo zita simama wima na kuonekana safi katika macho ya wananchi.Pia, kwa upance wa michoro, utaona kwamba kuna michoro mingine inayotoka katika sehemu mbali mbali. Lakini wakciti wa ujenzi, jengo liria- weza kujengwa kutumia michoro kama hiyo ya kutoka sehemu nyingine hivi kwamba jengo likikamilika linakuwa lina kascro fulani. Nikitoa mfano, unaweza kuona kwamba kuna kasoro ya ujenzi kama ule wa kuyatengea magari mahali pa kuwekwa yanapofika katika kituo fulani, yaani parking. Jambo kama hilo likifanyika, unasikia kukisemekana kuwa mcu fulani ndiye aiiyekosea na kwa hivyo ujenzi fulani ubomolewe na kuanzishwa upya. Nina mfano wa soko Liliioko Webuye ambapo Wizara ilifanya ujenzi. Wizara iliutoa mchoro huo mzuri kutoka kv/enye nchi ambazo zina joto jingi. Walipojenga soko hilo, ilikuwa kwamba hewa ve. ikipita vizuri na kuingia kwenye soko. Lakini, baada ya kukamiiika na shahada kuto'lewa kwamba ujenzi ulikuwa umekamilika kabisa, wananchi walianza kulitumia lakini. kwa shida sana kwa sababu kulianza kunyesha mpaka ndani kupitia kwerye mashimo ambayo yalikuwa yameachwa ili kuwe na hewa nzuri. Sasa siku hizi soko hil lirnekaa napo tu bila maana. Ingewapasa maofisa katika Wizara hii kufanya uchunguzi mkali kwenye michoro kama hiyo na kuona itakavyofaa kabla ya kuitumia na kujenga nyumba. Mambo ya hali ya barabara nchiniyamesemwa hapa sana. Tuna aina mbili barabara yaani ile ya lami na ya murrum. Kwa sasa barabara za murrum nchini nazitoshi. Hii ni kwa sababu tuna mashimo mengi sana katika barabara zetu na waendeshaji magari wana shida nyingi sana wanaposafiri na ndipo utaona kuwa kuna mikosi mingi sana barabarani. Ningependa kuwaona maofisa wanaohusika wakihakikisha kwamba barabara yoyote inayojengwa imekuwa ya kuaumu na ambayo haifanyi mikasa kama hiyo ya barabarani kutokea. Kuna ule mpango wa rural access roads ambao kupitia kwake tunapa misaada mingi kutoka nchi za ng'ambo. Kama Wabunge wenzangu walivyotangui kusema hapa, mara nyingi unapata kwamba barabara kama hizo zimejengwa laki nyasi inamea na zinakuwa hazina maana yoyote. Sasa barabara ambayo imejen ifaavyo na caaaaye imee nyasi itakuwa barabara ya aina gani? Hata wananch wakijaribu kubeba mizigo yao wakituniia mikokoteni wanapata taabu sana. Ni jambo la umuhimu kama Wizara ingetafuta pesa za kutosha ili kuzireke'oisha barabara za aina hiyo ili ziwe sawa na zidumu. Pia si pana na kwa kuwa wa siku hizi wamenunua magari makubwa makubwa ingefaa barabara hizo zipanuliw; na hata yale madogo madogo yaweze kupitana bila shida. Bw. Spika wa Muda, utaona kuwa hasa katika mwezi wa Juni huwa mafuta hayapatikani ya kuendesha matrakta. Nikwa nini mipango haifanyiki kuanzia mwanzo wa mwaka ili huduma hizo zinazohitajika zipatikane mwaka we Ni vibaya sana kuwa na vifaa kama hivyo tayari kufanya kazi za maendeleo la kukosekane mafuta ya kuvifanya viendelee na kazi hiyo. Kukosekana kwa mafe jinsi hiyo kunadhihirisha kutopanga vizuri. Wananchi wanatatisika sara kwa njia hiyo.Hikimalizin, ningependa kusema ni vizuri Wizara hii ipate pesa</Newspeech>	 <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILDLIFE (Mr. Awori): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, for giving this opportunity</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. K'Ombudo): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.

K'Ombudo be suspended from the service of the House for two consecutive Sittings, put and agreed to)<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILDLIFE (Mr.Awori): Mr. Temporary Deputy. Speaker, Sir, no country can ever survi in any kind of development without proper, or good, communic system. In his wisdon the President introduced the School M Programme but without a good road system the Nyayo children not have been receiving this milk.Similarly, Mr. Temporary Deputy" 'Speaker, Sir, people require to interact in order to exchange views cut they cannot do this without having good road network in the country above ail, without good roads in the country, the Government would "be completely unable to work. Roads are necessary in order to bring the administration closer to people but this can only be possible if we have good roads. Above all, our economy depends on the state of cur roads a great deal. This is because we in Menya depend on Agriculture and therefore, we need roads to be able to transport our farm produce from our fams to storage centres or to markets. At the same time, we have fishermen in- Kenya and they too need to transport the fish from the lake all the way to the market, and they have to use roads for-this kind of transportation.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, We depend a great deal on tourism and touris require to travel in comfort. 'These tourists come from countries where roads are of a much higher standard. However, I would like to give credit to our Government for the efforts they have been making to open up new roads. I as please to note that some provincial heads are here and I would like them to accept cur sincere thanks for the good work they are doing out there. However, there is the question of maitenance of roads which is a very, vital question. Most hon. Members who have spoken before, nave voiced their concern about the deteriorating state of affairs of our roads. It is alright to open up new roads and to gravel, tarmac or grade them, but unless these roads are maintained, all the funds that are used to construct these reads, are going to be wasted.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. it is always surprising to see how a small pothole the week, develops into a huge pothole the following week, however, while potholes on our roads continue to get from bad to worse, one still notices many read camps in various areas and one wonders what they are supposed to be doing. I would like to call upon the provincial heads who are here today, to emphasize to their district heads that there must be a road team in motion all the time to check where these potholes are begining to develop so that they can arrest the situation before it gets worse.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, what I would I like to see is a maitenace training school not only to teach our people about road maintenance, but also of machinery. In 3usia for instance, we have, two graders but half of the time, these graders are out of action because they are not properly maintained. I would like to call upon the officers in the field to put more emphasis in the maintenance of machinery.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, time has come when the major roads must be made dual-carriage-way. Today, we do not have a dual-carriage-way on any major road and efforts should be made to make sure that the road from Mairobi to Mombasa, for example, or from Mairobi to Misumu are made dual carriage-ways. In this way we are going to save the lives of our people. Sometimes, it is terrible when you are driving on some of these roads, to see a big tardier coming towards you and you have to use your driving ingenuity to be able to continue with your journey. Lack of good roads in this country is now taking away the hard currency that we have. Due to the poor state of our roads, quite a number of vehicles break down from time to time, Mhen these vehicles break down, they have to be repaired and therefore, spares have to be purchased and this consumes our hard currency. Mis Excellency the Vice-President has warned us about the escalating prince of Missel, petrol and petroleum products. Me has informed us that the current price of petrol is 40 dollars per barrel and this is the highest price so far. Motorists tend to consume more diesel or petrol than it is necessary, and the Ministry should ensure that this does not happen.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, coming closer heme to Busia. I would like to ask my colleague the Minister for Public Dorks to give Dusia District, at least one tamacked road. At the moment, we do- not have a single tarmacked road in Dusia. What we have is an international road passing through Dusia and although this road is tarmacked and one of the best roads in Menya, we do not have a single tarmackid road in Dusia. Me were pa promised that the road from Miumias to Dusia would be tarmacked and I would like to know whatever happened to the funds that had been voted for the tarmacking of this road.Similarly, we have the road from Eumala to Erwambwa, namely, CBO,should he tarmacked because it is important to Kenya economically. The samething applies to the road from Dusia to Maiaba. Busia, as we all knew, is a border district and there is a security element involved and therefore, we would like, if possible, although 2 we have a finance constraint, money to be made available so that these roads could be tarmacked. If there is not enough money to tarmack these roads, at least they should be gravelled. As far as I know, during the last eight years, there has only been 41 kilometres of gravelled roads and I appeal to the Minister to extend this work so that we can also enjoy good roads.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are other services which this renderse and that is, the maintenance of public buildings. I have in mind the maintenance of the Kenyatta International Conference Centre. We know the importance of tourism in this country. At the moment, we are depending on cur wildlife to attract tourists to this country, but there is another form of tourism that we have not yet tapped and that is in the area of conferences. In order to do that we must have proper facilities for conferences. Me would therefore like the Kenyatta International Conference Centre to be properly maintained so that we can then attract tourists. Finally, Mr. Temporary. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say something about the disabled in this country. Today, the disabled people in this country- are having a great deal of difficulties in getting access to public buildings. There is, for instance, a small girl who is employed in the President's Office by name of Phillis. This girl depends entirely on the mercy of other people to lift her in her wheelchair and then negotiate the steps right up to her office in the morning. Often, she has to forego lunch because there is no one to carry her down those stairs until evening. Ten per cent of cur population today is disabled and because of our Government, these people have attained a very high level of education and quite a number of them have obtained employment in Government offices. However, to get into those offices, is quite a problem. In know of another girl, who, although is employed and gets a salary ever month,unable to go to her office everyday simply due to lack of proper access for the disabled into these buildings. I would like to suggest to this Ministry to make a programme for all public buildings where no ramps have been rovided, that they do provide them now.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Ninamshukuru pia "kwa kuja hapa na maofisa wake wa gredi ambao wamejaa pale mbele kutoka upande mmoja wa kiti hadi mwisho wake.

Pesa hiz-i hazitoshi ukihesabu vile nchi yetu ilivyo kubwa na vile watu wengi wanahitaji barabara zenye lami na vitu v.ingine.(Noise)Bwi Naibu Spika wa Muda, nakuomba unilinde kutokana na waheshimiwa Wabunge fulani hapa ambao wamepandi: ia sauti kiasi kwamba sisikiki.Ningeomba Wizara hii iongezwe pesa katika Bajeti yake kwa sababu zile ambazo. inaomba kupewa sasa hivi ni kidogo sana. Hata ingawa Wizara hii ni nzuri sana, Waziri wake ni razuri sana na maofij wake pia ni wazuri sana, bado kuna-mambo machache ambayo ni lazima tuyaseme hapa ili maofisa hawa wayasikie. Ninashindwa ni kwa nini Wizara inaanzisha mradi wa maendeleo unaochukua miaka nenda, miaka rudi kutekelezwa. Kuna mradi wa kutengeneza barabara kutoka Machakos, kupitia Konza, huku ikielekea Mombasa. Tulipewa njia nyingine kando ya barabara ya kutumia wakati barabara yenyewe inapotengenezwa na kampuni ya ujenzi iitwayo ' Crescent. Kila siku tunatumia barabara hii ya kando na tunamwagikiwa na vumbi kutoka asubuhi hadi jioni. Ndipo tunataka kujua ni kwa nini, ikiwa pesa za kumaliza ujenzi wa barabara kuu haziku tayari, kampuni hii ilikubaliwa kutengeneza barabara ya kando ndefu kiasi cha kilometa 50? Magari yanayoitumia barabara hii huvunjika windscreens, mataa na vifaa vingine kila siku, na wasafiri wanaokwenga Mombasa huwa inconvenienced sana. Ni kwa nini Wizara haingoji mpaka. pesa ziwe tayari ndipo waiambie kampuni hii ifanye kazi?        Jambo lingine ni kwamba tunawaomba maofisa hawa, badala ya kukaa ndani ya maofisi yao yenye air conditioners-hapa Nairobi kila siku, watembee uwanjani wakati mwingine ndipo wajionee vile mambo yalivyo. Wakiendelea kukaa katika maofisa yao yaliyo katika orofa ya 12 au 13 kila siku bila kwenda kukagua kazi uwanjani, itakuwa kwamba sisi' hapa tunaongea, nao wanaandika tuyasemayo, mpaka tunarudi hapa mwaka mwingine na kusoma Bajeti.     Kuna barabara fulani kule Mombasa itokayo kwenye check point ya Kwale hadi Maganyakulo ambayo imekuwa nyembamba sana ukiangalia hesabu ya magari yanayoitumia kila siku. Hadi leo, kumekuwa na ajali saba kwenye check point ya Ng'ombeni ambapo barabara hii ni nyembamba sana. Aliyekuwa Mbunge wa sehemu hiyo, Bw. Mwakileo, amewahi kupata ajali hapo na Wazugnu fular.i pia walipata ajali mahali hapo, lakini hakuna anayejali, huku ikingojewa siku ile Katibu wa Kudumu akatakapokwenda huko na kupokelewa na macfisa wote wa Ujenzi. Kabla mambo kama haya hayajatokea, tungependa maofisa wa Wizara hii wawe vakitembelea sehemu ambako barabara zimeharibika kidogo na kuzirekebisha. Hii ni kazi ndogo sana ambayo haihitaji pesa nyingi wala kungoja. Sidings zikirekebishwa kidogo tu, ajali za barabarani zitapungua, lakini ianonekana kwamba tunapenda sana kutuma rambirambi kwa mtu aliyefariki. Tunapoendelea kutuma rambirambi ajali nyingine hutokea, halafu tunaanza "kuimba", "Pengo aliloacha mtu huyu haiizibiki." Lakini ingefaa tujizuie kutuma rambirambi kwa kutengeneza barabara zetu.Kile kinachonishangaza ni swala la kuanza mradi ambao hatuuwezi, kama Rural Access Roads Programme. Tumekwishatumia pesa nyingi tayari katika mradi huu, lakini ukiangalia barabara zetu kutoka mwisho mmoja wa nchi yetu hadi mwingine utaona kwamba hali yake haifai. Waheshimiwa Wabunge wengi hapa wanataka kuongea juu ya hali mbaya ya barabara za kwao. Waziri anasifiwa sana kwa kutengeneza rural access roads mahali kwingi, lakini akijenga nyumba harudi kuiangalia tena? Ni kweli kwamba mtu asipoziba, atajenga nyumba. Culverts zilizowekwa kwenye rural access roads zimekwishatwaliwa na maji. Murram yote iliyowekwa imetwaliwa pia, na rural access roads hizi zote unasikia habari yake zimemea nyasi kiasi kwamba siyo access roads tena, bali ni vichaka ambavyo havieleweki.      Ajabu nyingine, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ni kwamba hata wafanyakazi wanaotengr neza barabara hizi hawalipwi wakati ufaao. Niliutembelea mradi fulani kule kwetu na nikakuta kwamba wafanyakazi wake walikuwa wamegoma. Ilinilazimu kuingilia jambo hili na nikakuta kwamba wafanyakazi hao walikuwa wamegoma kwa sababu msimamizi wao alikuwa hajawapa pesa zao. Tunakubali kwamba hatuwezi kuwa na pesa za kutosheleza kila mradi, lakini ni kwa nini miradi haipangwi vizuri kiasi kwamba ofisa anayesimamia miradi ya Rural Access Roads Programme anaweza kuwalipa watu wake kuanzia tarehe 15 hadi tarehe 15? Wafanyakazi hawa ni wananchi na ingefaa wawe wakilipwa pesa zao wakati ufaao. Kuna kisehemu kidogo cha barabara itokayo Mkongani hadi Kwale ambacho kinazuia barabara nzima kutumiwa, na hali pesa zinazohitajiwa ili kukirekebisha kisehemu hiki si nyingi. Tunahitaji tu mapipa mawili ya murram, lakini tukisema hivi, tunaambiwa kwamba kazi hii tafanywa wakati ambapo pesa zitapatikana. Hii ndiyo sababu tunasema kwamba Waziri anafaa kuongezwa pesa kidogo.Jambo lingine ni kwamba kuna tabia ya kuwapa watu binafsi kandarasi za kuweka murram katika barabara au malori ya watu binafsi kutumiwa kufanyia kazi hii. Hapo ndipo unakuta kwamba of isa msimamizi wa kazi anatumia jina la rafiki yake huku yeye mwenyewe akiweka murram katika barabara hizi. Ni kwa nini tuwatumie watu au vifaa vyao binafsi katika kazi hii na hali hatuna pesa za kutosha? Jambo hili linahitaji kuangaliwa kwa sababu ni mojawapo ya yale yaitwayo "ongeza tumbo". Jambo lingine, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ni kuhusu urekebishaji na utunzaji wa vifaa vya ujenzi. Wizara hii hununua vifaa visuri kama vile graders, caterpillars malori na kaahalika.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: We we umeviona vifaa hivyo?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOY: Ndio, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda. Hata kule kwetu KWale kumeletwa grader mpya. Tunamshukuru Waziri kwa kutununulia vifaa vipya vya ujenzi. lakini utaona kwamba utunzaji ha urekebishaji wa vifaa vya Wizara hii si mzuri. Kwa mfano " grader ya Wizara ambayo imemaliza mwaka mmoja inaonekana .kuwa ya samani kushinda ya kampuni ya mtu binafsi ambayo ina umri wa miaka mitano hivi. Utaona kwamba vifaa vya ujenzi vya makampuni ya ujenzi kama vile Mugoya  Construction Company au Crescent Construction Company vinatunzwa vyema kushinda vile vya Wizara yetu ya Ujenzi. Je, ni Kwa nini Wizara inashindwa kuvitunza vifaa vyetu vya ujenzi? Hili ni jambo muhimu sana.Jambo lingine linahusu utoaji wa tenders. Haya ni mambo ambayo yanahusu pesa nyingi na hayafai kuachwa mikononi mwa maofisa wa Wizara peke yake. Utaona kwamba ujenzi wa barabara unaweza kuanza lakini pesa zimalizike hata kabla kazi haijaisha. Ni lazima mambo haya yaangaliwe kwa makini. Hii ni kwa sababu katika jambo hili la kutoa tenders pana "Mtoto na Mjomba wake". Hii inaonyesha kwamba kuna mambo ambayo hayaeleweki.Kwa hayo machache, naomba kuunga mkon o.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Dr. Onyonka'): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I like to express my gratitude to the Chair for afford opportunity to comment on this very important Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, protect the back side of the Chamber is turning into another</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge}: Order I Can we have silence please. I</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVEL (Dr. Onycnka): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, t which is in charge of roads in the country, I must say a very good job. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if some do not want to sit in the House they can go and shout:Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, roads have vital role in the development of this country, like to say that the strategy adopted by our Government 20 years ago, which gave emphasis to road development opening up of the country, has played a vital role i national development. Given the present situation, I have suggestions that I would like to make to my colleague to hon. Minister for Public Works who is also my good The first relates to issues that have already been touc upon by many previous speakers and this is with regard maintenance and particularly given the fact that this c a road toll system. The implication is that funds coll a toll station are intendedMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it appears that we have a "Kamkunji" on the other side of the House and I thought it was supposed to have been cleaned up today and is not operational</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Order! Order! I think hon. Members are conversant with the Standing Orders of the House I You are supposed to tone down your voices while having your consultations. You should not make noise to an extent where the Member on the Floor cannot be heard. He should be heard in absolute silence.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Dr. Onyonka): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me that protection.I think it is bad economics and bad financial management to construct such beautiful, roads and then we are unable to maintain them especially when have an existing road toll system through which we can collect financial resources.Today we have ample evidence from which we could learn, that it does not make sense to let a small pothole develop into a major hole. That has often resulted in many motor vehicles getting involved in accidents as drivers have desperately tried to avoid the huge potholes. It causes less money to take timely action to rectify the situation on many of our roads.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, at this particular juncture, the country does not have enough money or resources to spend heavily on road mainten¬ance given the other demands. It is, therefore, in my opinion, common sense that it is better to deal with these mall potholes before they develop into major gulleys. A typical example that I am very fond of and which I keep on repeatedly keep on mentioneing to the department concerned relates to the road from Ahero to Kisii. This has been one of the best roads in the contry for many years but it is in a very poor state at the moment. We have maintenance gangs around the place, but I am always amazed if not puzzled by the fact that these guys will seal one hole, jump three holes in the middle, seal the fourth one, jump another five and seal the eighth or the nineth one, something that does not make sense at all. The state of the road could be improved at a minimal cost if action was taken at the right time to fill off most of the potholes. Last week the road was in an appalling condition, especially between Sondu and Kabondo. Whereas they have done maintenance on the other sections, between Oyugis and Kabondo the road is in a real deplorable condition. I find it quite unacceptable that the chaps concerned will fill off one hole and leave five other holes within a one—mile area. The problem is simply one of management. With due regard to the Minister for Public Works, I feel that we do not seem to have enough supervision of the people working on these roads. They seem to do practically what they please, and I think it is unfair for those of us who pay the toll every time we pass on these roads.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is better to design roads with where very shoddy jobs have been done. Money has been paid and, within a period of about six months, the: road peels off. This was notably the case with the Sotik-Kisii road which had to be resurfaced within a period of just about three weeks. Money had been paid and, to me, that is a waste. The Sotik-Jamji road was done by a certain company nearly 20 years ago and, despite the few potholes on it, it still remains one of the best stretches of road to be found in this country. It provides a typical example of what good work means when it comes to road construction.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we do realize that there is not always enough money to meet certain specifications which, of course, means a longer durability for some of these roads. But I think it is incumbent upon some of our professional people to show concern for this country. Too often we have had certificates of completion, of jobs which have not been completed, and I think this is tragic. When we say that we are serious it is obviously common sense that a road is poorly done it does not require the professional engineer to say so. Some of these roads have peeled off within weeks and yet the professional man has appended his signature to this project saying that it has been well done and complete and, therefore, the Government should effect payment. I think that is disastrous for us.Sir, one hon. Member has referred to the rural access roads, and I wish to point out that these are among the best roads that the Ministry has ever constructed. At least, contrary to what hon. Boy was saying, these are the best roads we have in Kisii District today. They are practically passable throughout the year and we would have liked TO have more of them. At this juncture, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Minister and his staff for the much better job they are doing at the moment than was the case last year. They have been provided with new equip¬ment and they are proving that with better equipment they are able to do a better job. It is, therefore, our expectation that with the new equipment they will be able to improve further on the existing roads. However, I also would wish to add my voice to the very major problem relating to the whole question of maintenance of roads. We have too many graders at the moment that are not function¬ing. I think we have developed the necessary mechanical and technological capacity to be able to repair most of this equipment. One of the problems I am aware of is that the necessary spares to maintain this equipment do not seem to be provided for in our budgeting. I think this is a major shot coming that we should re-examine; we must provide enough money for the importation of the necessary spare parts to be able to operate the equipment. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in this connection, there is even a bigger problem within the local authorities which own graders or tractors. They seem to be totally incapable of even providing the very elementary services this equipment requires to operate. I was wondering whether the time has not come for the Ministry, working in consultation with the local authorities, to set up maintenance units for all the equipment that is presently owned by the local authorities. Many local authorities alive bought tractors but they are not using them at the moment.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion. Thank you. </newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Nang'ole): Bw. 	Naibu Spika wa Muda, nakushukuru sana kwa kunipatia nafasi hii ili nami niungars  na Wahe.

No. 2 6775, Employer No. 236632, since his retire-ment in 1979.<newspeech> THE MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Mibei): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Minister for Labour I beg to reply. There is difficulty in answering this Question because the N.S.S.F membership numbers have nine digits and the number given for Mr. Mutua Kaloki has only got five digits. I would therefore appeal to the hon. Member to advise Mr. Mutua Kaloki to provide the correct N. S.S.F. membership number or alternatively to obtain a full set of  his fingers-prints to enable the Ministry of Labour to get his correct number.</newspeech><newspeech> MR. EKIDOR: I thought every contributor of N.S.S.F has a personal number in. I am sure the Minister has that file in his Ministry. Is it in order for the Minister to come and ask the contributor to bring another number when they have that number in their file?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MIBEI: We do not deny that Mr. Mutua Kaloki has a membership number. But, the number given by the hon. Member is a wrong number and it is not possible to trace on unless he gives us the right number.</newspeech><newspeech>DR. MISIO: Can the Minister assure this House whether Mutua Kaloki was indeed employed and paid his N.S.S.F. contribution: and therefore is known by the Minister for Labour as one who request has benefits?</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. MIBEI: The question of benefits does not arise at the moment. We are at the moment trying to identify the correct number so that we can know how much he is entitled to receive.</newspeech> </subheader> DR MISOI: On a point of order Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I do agree with the Minister that we have to identify the correct number so that we can ask how much he is entitled to. Is this the correct person known by the Ministry?</newspeech> <newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: They do not know!</newspeech> <newspeech> MR. MIBEI: I think that question should be directed to the hon.</newspeech> <newspeech> MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I would like a little clarification here Mr. Mibei. There is also a number referring to the employer, is this number also similarly wrong?</newspeech> <newspeech> MR. MIBEI: The answer given was that the number should have nine digits and so I think that they must have skipped that.</newspeech> Question No. 515Payment of Retirement Benefits to Mr. King'ori<newspeech> MR.

Question 505 Payment of House Allowance to Miss Ronoh.</newspeech> <newspeech> MR. arap CHEPKOK asked the Minister for Education when Miss Rosemary Ronoh of Tambach Secondary School,be paid her house allowance as per Board of Governor's Minute No. 2/39/9/1, dated 25th July, 1989.</newspeech> <newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Arnayo): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. Miss Rosemary Ronoh an Assistant House Keeper, Tambach Secondary School, will be paid her house allowance as soon as the relevant papers reach the Ministry's headquarters.</newspeech> <Newspeech> MR. arap CHEPKOK: Can the Assistant Minister, tell theHouse how long .it will take because as of now it this has taken one anda half year to process?</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR. AMAYO: It might be necessary at this juncture to explain the circumstances. Rosemary Ronoh is an Assistant Housekeeper at Tambach Secondary School and HER house allowance ought to have been paid from last year. However the relevant claim forms the landlord's certificate and the receipts relating to the house allowance in question have not reached theMinistry's headquarters, and we have accordingly asked the Provincial EducationOfficer,Rift Valley, to urgently forward the necessary papers to the Ministryso that we may effectively pay Miss Ronoh.</Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I still insist that the Assistant Minister should tell the House when Miss Ronoh is going to be paid. Since the Board of Governors met on 25th July, 1989 up to this day, Miss Ronoh has not been paid her house allowance although she has already filled the necessary forms and forwarded them through the Provincial Education Officer and, in any case, I do not see any reason why the Assistant Minister should refer the whole matter to the Provincial Education Officer.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are not disputing the fact that Miss Ronoh has not been paid because it is true that she has not been paid. The relevant documents were to be scrutinized and forwarded to us. We have now requested the Provincial Education Officer forwarded so that this question does not arise again. However, it is difficult to say whether payment will be made tomorrow or next week. As soon as the Provincial Education Officer forwards these documents to us, we will effectively pay Miss Ronoh.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, is the Assistant Minister telling us that the Provincial Education Officer has failed to sent these documents to the Ministry and that the said Board of Governors has approved payment of this house allowance?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think it would be appropriate to explain to hon. Dr. Misoi what we are talking about here. The Board of Governors recommended that Miss Ronoh be paid house allowance, the Ministry has, in principle, agreed to pay Miss Ronoh this house allowance and all that we now require are the relevant documents. As soon as we get them, we will pay Miss Ronoh.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. P.G. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would assume that when this Question was sent to the Ministry, the Ministry got in touch with its officer. in the field, that is the Provincial and the District Education Officers of the - area. Could the Assistant Minister give us the reason for the delay and why these papers have not reached the Ministry's headquarters up to now?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I explained earlier that all that we want to get are the forms: in question, .the landlord certificate</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. AMAYO: Mr. deputy Speaker, Sir, I am responding to a point of order, and I think I should go on.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, Mr. Amayo that was not a point of order.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the Assistant Minister is misleading the House. The letter I have here is addressed to the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education. How come that the forms in question were taken to the Provincial Education Officer, Rift Valley, without the relevant receipts?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was interrupted when trying to make a full explanation. So, I think I will have to combine the two issues. These papers were sent direct to the Ministry for scrutiny, and this is why we are asking the Provincial Education Officer to release the documents to us so that we may pay Miss Ronoh. There is no dispute in that.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the Assistant Minister is meandering trying to dodge the question. If the Provincial Education Officer to whom these papers were forwarded falls under the Ministry of Education, how come the Provincial Education Officer has not forwarded them to the Ministry's headquarters? Does the Assistant Minister agree with me that there is inefficiency in the Ministry?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is no meandering involved here. The fact that we have instructed the Provincial Education Officer to forward these documents to us as soon as possible means that we, as a Ministry, have accepted responsibility for the delay involved. We are not trying to say that the Ministry's headquarters is clean and that it is the Provincial EducationOfficer who is not clean. The Ministry accepted responsibility for this delay, and asked the Provincial Education Officer to give us the relevant documents so .that this lady may be paid. There is no question about this.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant -Minister in order to say what he has said when the hon. Questioner has shown him a letter written to the Permanent Secretary. Who is bigger between •the Permanent Secretary and the Provincial Education Officer?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not know what letter hon. Chepkok is talking about. I do not have a copy of any letter to the Permanent Secretary, and I do not even know whether that letter is genuine or not.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. P.G. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the Assistant  Minister is evading the question. When this particular Question was forwarded to the Ministry, the Ministry should have got in touch with the Provincial Education Officer concerned to find out the reason for the delay in payment. Could he now tell us what reason he was given by the Provincial Education Officer for this delay?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not know what I am expected to say further in this regard after we, as a Ministry, have accepted responsibility for this delay.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister himself says that he does not know certain things here, which means that he has failed in his job. Why should he answer the Question if there are certain facts that he does not know?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not know whether hon. Bidu was giving me additional information or rising on a point of order. However, what I said I do not know is whether the letter hon. Chepkok is referring to was actually addressed to the Permanent Secretary or not.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the letter the Board of Governors wrote to the Permanent Secretary is dated 25th July, 1989, and requests the Ministry to pay Miss Ronoh. It reads:"This is  to confirm that the above-named person is an employee of this school and is accommodated outside the school compound as the school has no houses.Please, consider her for house allowance. Thankyou.The letter is addressed to the-Permanent Secretary, and the relevant forms are attached to it.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. AMAYO:  Mr. Deputy Speaker., Sir, maybe that letter was writtenby hon. Chepkok because he has not told us the signatory to it. In any case,all we are saying- is that the Ministry accepted-in principle that it would pay Miss Ronoh house allowance in compliance with the recommendation made by the Board—of—Governors of Tambach Secondary School, and there is no dispute in this. However, there was delay in scrutinising the relevant documents, and this is why we have given instructions to the Provincial Education Officer to forward these documents to us. As soon as these documents are received in our Ministry, we will pay Miss Ronoh her house allowance in arrears.</Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR. WAMBUA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is some confusion here because we are told that the Board-of—Governors that was supposed to house this teacher reported that there was no house in the school for this teacher.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is your point of order, Mr. Wambua? MR. WAMBUA: My point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, is that the said papers have been under scrutiny since July, 1989 up to now. Are they going to be scrutinised for a whole year or more before this teacher is paid her house allowance?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not know what point of order to respond to here because I think the hon. Member has merely asked a supplementary question.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let me be helpful here, Mr. Amayo. I think you should address yourself to hon. P.G. Godana's question relating to the cause of this delay. I think that is what the hon. Members of the Back Bench want to know.</Newspeech> (Applause) <Newspeech>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir you will agree with me that before I could respond to hon. P.G. Godana's question, other points of order were raised- So, these latter points of order superseded the earlier question.We admit here that we wanted to receive the relevant house allowance claim forms, the land lord certificated and the receipts that Miss Ronoh wasgiven for paying house rent. That is what</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. CHPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am responding to a point of order, and would request hon. Chepkok to allow me to let me finish what I am saying before he raises another point of order.All we are saying is that delay occurred in our getting these three sets of documents and that we have instructed our officer in Nakuru to provide the .documents so that we may pay this house allowance in arrears.</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>DR.

Next Order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER,  OFFICE 0F THE VICEPRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Kariuki): On a point .of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Yester¬day while answering a Question by hon. Chepkok, I mentioned that a Mr. Gicheru Kamau had beer: paid his pension benefits vide Treasury cheque No. 985105, dated 29th August, 1990. Hon.. Chepkok was, however, not satisfied and wanted me to state the amount on the cheque.As I said yesterday, Sir, I did not think it prudent to divulge for public consumption the intimate financial affairs of an individual unless it is absolutely necessary. While I would not wish to challenge the Chairs ruling on the matter, I wish to seek your indulgence to request hon. Chepkok and the House to reconsider that matter and ponder as to whether it will be to the bene¬fit and interest of Mr. Kamau, a pensioner, to have the amount he received as commuted pension gratuity to be divulged to the public. I am of the opinion, as in many other cases that the Pensions Department has faced, that the pensioners do not like the details of their pensions divulged to the public except to those who must know.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sure that ho. Chepkok and the House would like to see the Department doing its best for Mr. Kamau. In this case, I do not believe that divulging the; actual amount received by Mr. Kamau is to his best interest. I, therefore, urge hon. Members to be satisfied with the fact that Mr. Kamau has been paid his dues and that he is satisfied himself. Of course, he he was not satisfied that would be a different matter. Divulging the amount would create a precedence where even peoples bank balances, insurance covers and tax returns may be subject of Parliamentary Questions which have to be answered. I, therefore, appeal to the Chair to reconsider the whole question again. However, if, in your wisdom, you think I should go ahead and say the figure publicly, then I will very reluctantly have to oblige.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Unfortunately, Mr. Kariuki, the Chair did make a ruling yesterday that since this Question is the property of the House, the amount should be mentioned. The fact that the particular gentleman in question did approach hon. Chepkok and indicated that he .should table this Question on his behalf, makes us assume that he wanted the matter to be brought before the House, thereby. becoming the property of the House. I did not see the relevance between this matter and bank balances because those are matters which are covered under the Banking Act and the secrecy related to them. It is only yesterday when your colleague gave us a figure for another pensioner. So, unfortunately, the Chair having made a ruling, you have absolutely no way out of it, Mr. Kariuki.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICEPRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Kariuki): In that case, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I wish to say that the amount paid to Mr. Kamau was KShs.76,800.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIS0I: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Ido not intend to have that matter pursued any further. What is your point of order?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIS0I: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, after you have given a ruling, hon. Members seem to justify that ruling. There: is no point of justifying a ruling that has been given in this House. According to me, that is not in order because once you give a ruling it becomes binding.</Newspeech>(Hon. Kariuki stood up)<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Kariuki, do you wish to say something about that?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICEPRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Kariuki): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do wish to respond to that because what I was doing was merely making a request to the Chair to reconsider the matter. The Chair has reconsidered the matter and ruled that I must answer the question. I did not find anything wrong with making a request to you.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon. Chepkok. The: Chair does not wish to open debate on that subject. Shall we have the next Order?</Newspeech><Headerh>COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY  </Headerh>(Order for Committee read being 14th Allotted Day)<Headerh>MOTION </Headerh>THAT, Mr. Speaker do not leave the Chair Vote 13  Ministry of Public Works (The Minister for Public Works on 17.10.90) (Resumption of Debate interrupted on 17.10.90)<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this Motion. But, before I do that, let me join my colleagues in congratulating His Excellency the President for the dedicated service he has given this country for 35 years. as a Member of Parliament, including 12 years as the President of this country. During his leadership, this country has undergone tremendous development both in Harambee contributions and ideological contributions by him. His Excellency is a man who is tireless in serving his people and we must all give him the necessary support so that he can continue to lead us without looking back.  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Kenyans cannot, and should not, be expectedto have mercy on people who think that they can topple this government by force.Having said that, Sir, I wish to state that the Ministry of Public Works is a very important one. Roads, too, are a very important aspect of the development of any country because, without good roads, we cannot move our produce from the places they are produced to the market. In the rural areas, if the roads are not passable, it does not matter how hard you work in your farm because all that effort will be brought to nought if you cannot transport your produceto market areas for sale. If you are in an area where  roads are impassable, you will not be encouraged to produce a lot because you would not know where to take it. I am saying this because I want to urge: the Ministry of Public Works to consider areas that have  a high potential of productivity to have very good roads.Sir, I come from an area in Tigania which feeds almost the entire Meru District. The areas called Mbeu and Mikinduri are the lower ones where we get most of our maize, beans, bananas and coffee. As I am talking now, the bridges between Meru and Mikinduri have collapsed, and this happens every time after harvest. Bridges made of timber cannot carry the load of the lorries that ply that route on daily basis transporting the: produce from those areas to the market places such as Meru town. The Ministry of Public Works has indicated that it intends to tarmac the Meru Mikinduri Kianjai road, and I do thank them very much.  For two consecutive years we have seen about Ksh.4 million allocated for the tarmacking of this road. I am informed that that money has been used for surveying and T am happy that the Minister has that good intention. However, I would urge that the tarmacking be done as soon as possible. When the rains come my people cannot reach Meru Town. If they have to, you can imagine the fares they are charged so that where under normal circumstances they are charged Ksh.7.00 but when the road is so impassable, they have to pay some Ksh.40.00 to the Matatu owners for the journey from Mikinduri to Meru Town. This is because the roads are impassable and the only matatus that can ply the route during such times are Land Rovers and the owners have to charge that much because of wear and tear.Sir, I am happy that the Ministry has agreed to do something about this road, but I am only urging that it be done as soon as possible. In any case, since the Thuci Nkubu Road was tarmacked, we have not had any other roads tarmacked in Meru District. It is well known that Meru District is almost the size of some provinces. Some of our constituencies are as big as some districts. So, when tarmack roads are being constructed all over the country, we should also be considered. We are very grateful to the President and the Nyayo Government for ordering the tarmacking of Thuci Nkubu Road. However, since then, and that is about five years ago, not even one kilometre of tarmack has been seen. Every Mery person is crying for the tarmacking of those roads in very productive areas so that we can transport our tea and coffee as well as other goods without breaking the bridges. I am happy that this is being done now. I am not complaining, but I would want it to be done as soon as possible.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we will be happy if the Meru Mikinduri Road is connected to the Maua one. This is because Maua is going to be the headquarters of a new district, and you can imagine of a district headquarters without any tarmack roads  For the same reasons, let also thank the Ministry for the  When such programmes are put into effect, the wananchi benefit from the payments they get after working. I can assure you that the roads that are done using tractors and other heavy machinery are not as good as those minor roads that are made by wananchi themselves. Sometimes you cannot believe that a particular road was cone using human hands. I encourage the Ministry to continue having more of those minor roads programmes so that more roads can be built in the rural areas, especially using the money that we are paying to the local authorities for the same purpose.Sir, I must say that most of our roads go to waste immediately after completion. The Ministry has not thought of employing people, at least a small number, who can remain on the roads after they have been tarrnacked so as to continue checking on where bushes are encroaching on the roads, or where branches have fallen on the roads and, therefore, likely to spoil such roads. After murmuring a road, they just leave that road and two years later, you find that Government funds have been wasted absolutely. This is because after those two years, all the murrum will have been washed off by the rains as there are no drainages and nobody on the roads for maintenance work. After all the murrum has been washed away, that is when we start talking of murruming.it again. .	 Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to urge the Ministry of Public Works officials to consider the drainage aspect whenever they are murruming a road. At the same time, they should make a provision for maintenance staff who can be retained on such roads on permanent basis.</Newspeech>(The red light was put on)<Newspeech>THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I think your time is up.</Newspeech>vTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think I still have 10 minutes to go.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, I think your time is already up as the red light has been put on.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BULYAAR: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for thisopportunity to join my colleagues in congratulating the Minister for Public Works for the able manner in which he has presented the Ministrys Vote. This Ministry has done a lot in our country and it is one of the Ministries whose services are required everywhere, from the provincial level right up to the divisional level. While thanking the Ministry for the good work that has been done all over the country, and especially areas where we have seen roads being tarmacked, I think it would be fair to mention further that districts like Turkana now have tarmack roads which they did not have some time previously.However, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to request the Minister to consider districts like Marsabit where you can travel for hundreds of kilometres without seeing any tarmack road. When the money is being allocated for each district, they should consider the provision of tarmack roads in such areas that do not have any. The Ministry should also consider the provision of maintenance machinery and equipment. It is about 500 kilometres from Marsabit to Moyale and there is no sign of any tarmack. road. These are areas through the which the Nairobi Addis Ababa road passes and there is need for constant road maintenance.Sir, the Minister should consider Marsabit District in the provision of graders which are new so that those roads are made passable throughout the year. Currently, people who have lorries which have normally been bought using loans, have problems in that those lorries get spoilt before the owners have completed the repayment of the loans. It is very discouraging to the wananchi in those areas because of the nature of the roads. Most of them regret  why they had to take the loans in the first place. This is because, instead of making profits in the business deals, they just incur losses.We thank the Ministry  that there are plans to tarmack the Moyale IsioloRoad and we hope it will be done. However, while awaiting for that implementation,we would like the Ministry to assist their department in Marsabit District to haveenough machinery so that they can maintain the roads there. Marsabit is one of the biggest districts and with very little funds, very little will be done due to the size.  At the same time, the little funds allocated in the districts should be properly accounted for by .the officers. Whenever we raise Questions here, we are told that implementations will be done when funds become available. However, when you go to the districts, you will note that contracts have been given to private individuals while the Ministry has tippers and graders which can be used. That only goes to waste the  little money that the Ministry has without accomplishing much.  •Therefore, the Ministry officials should use the little resources they have economically. In fact, instead of hiring contractors the Ministry can use the money to buy graders and tippers and have the work done by its officials.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Ministry has also done a lot in housing and, I think  we should commend it for its wonderful, performance. We must also thank its officers for they always been helping other Ministries in the implementation and supervision ox project work; this has ensured the success of many projects.Let me say something about rural access roads. There are many rural access roads in my constituency that became impassable during the rainy season. The road from Maralal to Loyahgarani should be maintained  because loyahgarani is a tourist centre. we should have been getting many tourists  in that area but that road is in poor  condition. I would thus like the Ministry, in conjugation with the Ministry of Tourism and wildlife  to consider setting aside some money to do the worst portion of this road which is about30 kilometres. Unless this is done most of the tourists, who use small vehicles, will continue to find it hard to reach loyangarani.  With those few remarks I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

First of all, I would like to congratulate the Minister for the able manner in which he moved this vote considering the justifiable demands being made from every part of the country for upgrading our roads. However, I would like to say something with regard' to roads in my constituency. In General, Kbita Constituency, apart from Uyatike, is one of the areas in Kenya, where the state of roads is very poort indeed. I am saying this because it is not- a joke for one to say h that when you want to go to Kbita, you can only do so by lake.However, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am thankful to the Ministry since for the last one month, we have seen graders working in Mbita and now roads from Homa-5ay to libit a are now paseable and I am grateful to the Minister for this. However, I would like to request the Minister to make sure that the road from libit a ton Sinao  D210  which is a very famous road, and another road from Sindo to Liagunga and on to Karungu and Kuhuru, are graded". These reads are regarded as security roads .in our area and I therefore appeal to the Minister to ensure that the good work that is now being done on other roads by the Ministry, is done on our roads so that all areas in my constituency can be accessible.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have heard it being said by some officers ass of the Ministry at HomaBay that they will continue to grade the Magunga- Byadhiwa/Kitawa Road where a very big hospital is being built with the assistance of the African Development Bank. The permanent Secretary has been to these areas and therefore he knows what I am talking about. At the present moment, the International Centre for Insects, physiology and Ecology has its headquarters at Mbita. They have also opened another centre at a Place calle Nyagwepe and to get there, one has to pass through Sindo but the road leading to this place is not very good I am saying this because International Centre for InsectsPhysiology and Ecology (ICIPE) is trying to open up these areas for agricultural purposes and it would not be good if	sis the representatives£ of the people in the area, cannot request you to look into this problem.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mbita is veil known for its fish production. As we all know, we have coffee and tea roads in this country and I do notBee why we cannot have fish roads as well, and I would like to appeal to theMinister to consider this. At the moment, they are doing very good work onsome of the roads in Mbita, but as soon as the rains start, all these roads will"be impassable and none of the vehicles that transport fish from Mbita will beable to pass on these roads. These vehicles have damaged our roads from timeto. time. During our discussions at the sub-district development committee, asuggestion was made that these heavy vehicles should be charged a road tollbecause they have been 2 damaging our roads. Therefore, I would like to requestthe Minister, through the Chair, to consider this request, vie have already discussed this issue in the figheries department and they too: have agreed that this wouldbe a move worthy looking into. I am saying this "because once these fish trailerpass on our roads, they should be able to pay some toll fees so that this moneycan be used to maintain our roads.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say something about the ruralaccess roads. Last year, our district development committee recommendedthat some Shs.100,000/- be set aside for a ring-road to be constructed in theMfangano Island. This is one of our biggest island- and part" of my family is livingon this island and the people living here produce a lot of food, fruits and soone, but the roads in: the island are impassable. This island has an airstripbut there are no proper roads there. Therefore, the South Nyanza DistrictDevelopment Committee recommended that some She100,000/- be set aside a forthe construction of access roads in this island. It would be a pitty to havethis money being returned to Treasury at the end of the Financial Year and therefore, I would like to appeal to the Minister to make sure that something is done with it.called Usao where the Government has "been good enough to put up a very good Health Centre. The ring-road passing through passes about five kilometres away and although the Ministry is trying to complete this road, something should be done to make sure that there is an access road to this health centre. There is another Road C19 which leaves Katito and goes all the way to Mr. Mbita. I would  like to take this opportunity to thank the Government through the Ministry concerned for tarmacking part of this road from Katito to Kendo-Bay . I understand that the section from Kehdu-Bay to Homa-Bay will soon be tarmacked and I appeal to the Minister to expedite this work, When this road is completed, one would be able to drive from Kericho to Soma-Bay within two hours.Once the construction of this road is completed up to Mbita, it will mean that I will be able to take 2.5 hours to travel from kericho to Mbita. What a wonderful thing it would be! It would open up the country completely.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I started by paying tribute to the Ministry for the good job-it has been doing in Mbita since last month. Road class D 210 is so important to us that I will repeat that something ought to be done to it. Hon. Ogur asked me to push this point-because it will benefit, him because it	starts from Mbita and passes through Karungu up to Muhuru Bay.One other point that I want to bring to the attention of the Ministry concerned is that we have quite a number of health centres that this Government has given us,, one of which has been built next to the National Youth Service Centre on the road from Sindu to Maguga. It is only about three kilometres from the main road to the centre in the hills. I request that something be done to make it possible for people to use that health centre. However, when the rains come, thesteep road is spoiled. The Rural Access Roads Programme can assist us here.I approached the Minister for Public works to visit Mbita, and I repeat the same request through you. I see the Minister looking at you and I in turn, and this means that the request has already been accepted. If the Minister" accepts to accompany me round my constituency, I will be very grateful. Thank you very much.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.TEBER: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to make my contribution to this very important Vote of the Ministry of Public Works. I would like to start by thanking the Minister for the way he moved his Ministry's Vote. The Minister is sincere and able. Since he took over the running of this Ministry, he has managed to make some progress as far as roads are concerned. There has been much improvement in the building and maintenance of roads in the country in general. Of late, there has been marked improvement in the grading of roads in my constituency, and I think this due to fact that new machinery Was recently bought by the Ministry.My constituency produces a lot of tea and is blessed with a lot of rains. However, most of the roads, there become impassable during the rainy season. At present,we have a problem with our foreign exchange earnings, because of the escalating cost of petroleum products and unless we increase our exports, our Kenya Shilling will continue to deteriorate in value when compared to other currencies./Mr. Deputy Speaker left the Chair/ /The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mureithi) took the Chair/ In order to develop, we need a good road network so that we can get our goods to the market in time. Unless tea gets to the market and is processed in time, its quality deteriorates.Perhaps, I should inform the Minister that in my constituency, we. have eight tea factories and that unless our roads there are of a high standard, we are likely to lose a lot of money which would otherwise be realised from the sale of tea. Rural access roads are necessary and should be maintained. At present, my county, council is getting a lot of money in the form of cess because my district is agriculturally rich. I have seen that Kipsigis County Council has of late bought a number of vehicles and earth—moving machinery. So, I request the Ministry to liaise with this local authority and get our roads maintained all weather throughout the district.I think time has come for the Ministry to establish depots at the divisional level. We have engineers, some of whom I think are not fully occupied in their offices. These engineers should be used to man depots in divisions. With many vehicles in use in the maintenance of roads, matters are now easy. These vehicles should be stationed in divisions. Sometimes, these vehicles have to move long distances to get to the field of operation. So, they should not be moved to the headquarters after work on a daily basis. The Ministry should think of building tents to enable its officers to stay in the dield for some time or until they complete their work.Our roads have developed many potholes as has been seen by those ofus who travelalong the Nairobi—Nakuru—Kericho Road. These potholes are dangerous, especially at night, and I think the Ministry should install road signs to.', indicate that there are potholes in certain places so that we may drive more carefully when we come to these places. With regard to the tarmacking of roads, a certain road was recently recommended by the relevant district development committee (D.D.C.) for tarmacking in my constituency. The length of this road is about 70 kilometres, and I know that it may take a bit of time before it is tarmacked fully. However, I urge the Ministry to see that the road is, at least, murramed or made all-weather so that our goods may reach the market without difficulties. I also think that the Ministry should take keen interest in and supervise the construction of tarmac roads. When roads are built , they should be able to last as long as possible. I say this because we have seen roads that have been constructed by people who merely want money and who do shoddy jobs, as a result of which the roads they construct do not last long enough.There are many rivers in my place, and I think the Ministry, in liaison with the local county council and wananchi, should put bridges across them. People have lost their lives in such places because these rivers are dangerous during the rainy season. A certain bridge was recommended for construction at Kiptui and, since the Minister is my neighbour in Buret, I think he will take keen interest in seeing to it that this bridge is built to link our two constituencies.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is a bridge that was washed, array by  heavy rains some time back and the Ministry has taken a long time to repair that bridge; it has taken more than six months now. It has cut off the whole location. However, I am happy that action is now being taken and I hope that construction work will be speeded up so that wananchi do not continue to suffer.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as the cost of fuel keeps on rising our roads must be properly maintained because if vehicles get stuck in mud it means that motorists will have to use a lot of fuel and at the same time the vehicle may break down which means that further foreign exchange will be required to purchase spare parts.;When it comes to housing I think the Ministry should design cheap houses using local materials so that wananchi can obtain building plans from the Ministry. The Ministry should supervise the construction of schools. I have seen storey buildings for schools in. some areas of this country; Our engineers should design  good storey buildings for our schools and these buildings must "be constructed to the required standards.I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency the President for having served this country for more than 35 years; actually he has served as a Member of Parliament for 35 years. But before he joined politics he was a teacher. So, soon or later His Excellency the President is going to celebrate 50 years of service to this country; he  had been a teacher for more than 15 years before he joined politics. We have seen steady progress during his time; he has led this country with dedication and we would like to congratulate him.Few remarks. I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIEEE: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to support this Vote of the Ministry of Public Works. The amount of money the Ministry. is requesting for is too little  Kshs.100 million. I say this because the roads in Kenya are too many; We do not have sufficient sat equipment to enable us to construct and maintain roads. The Ministry does not have sufficient manpower. For example, in Meru we have Ntonyiri and Igembe Divisions which are served by just one officer. This officer is not able to serve both  Divisions at the same time. So, I would like to request the Ministry to employ another officer to serve Ntonyiri Division so that the officer who is there now can continue to serve Igembe Division  to avoid a g "tug of Y7ar between the two Divisions.The equipment available in Kenya is not enough to maintain 1 our roads. I would like the Ministry to look into the issue of purchasing more equipment  more graders, tippers, tractors and so on. The Ministry bought some tractors last year and they were distributed to various parts of ± Kenya. The Minister promised to acquire more tractors to be supplied to the parts of Kenya which did not get any tractors from the first consignment. He said that such areas would be given preference in future but I as things stand today, there seems to be no improvement. The areas which did not get the new tractors are still lagging behind. They only have sea old and unserviceable equipment.I would like that the Ministry is doing its best to rehabilitate old equipment but the pace at which the exercise is being carried out is very slow; A district like Meru which is ±s as large as some provinces in this country is not adequately served due to lack of equipment Currently we have one D4 which is the district; it is even requiredThe machine keeps of breaking down because it is very old it "breaks down after working a few kilometres of road,' So, I would request the Ministry to ask for more equipment during the next Budget, This is "because the Ministry of Public Works cannot serve this country well without road construction equipment.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other point that I would like to touch on here regards the road toll charges. We are paying a lot in toll charges. In fact the rates were increased the other day. For example, when I am driving to my constituency, I pay KShs.60/- every weekend.' I would expect that money to "be used to improve the roads where the toll stations are situated."' Last year I mentioned something about the Thika-Makatano junction. I understand that although tenders have been given, these tenders have been given to one Asian  contractor but we have not seen him on the site. The Ministry should award tenders to companies that will honour those tenders. So, I hope that this particular company is adequately equipped to start working on that project. It is not wise to give tenders to companies that do not have resources. So, I believe that the Ministry had looked into the capability of this contractor before awarding him the contract.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, one cause of accidents on our roads is lack of road signs and markings.Last year I did draw the attention of the- Ministry to the necessity of markingthe Meru-Maua road, and I do not know whether it was done although today I findsome' spots of markings in the middle of the road. There are no continuous lineson the road, and I do not know whether this was just white—washing so that theMinistry can say that they did the road markings. In fact, I would say thatthere was no marking done on the road at all. So, if the Ministry allocatedany money for marking this road, it should find out what happened to that money.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, looking at the Estimates, I seethat there is a budget of K£1 million for agricultural produce roads and, likewise, K£1 million for tourist roads from USAID. That is under Items 462 and 463. Most of the agricultural areas lie around Mr. Kenya, Mt. Elgon and South Nyanza, but you find that we are having a lot of problems with tea roads because if we have only one grader available, then I wonder how this budget of K£1 million for agricultural produce roads will be utilised. One machine is not really able to do the roads in the tea areas. I do, however, congratulate the Ministry because they have started constructing bridges along the road that joins Maua Division and other three divisions. I have in mind Road E813, which is an agricultural produce road. A portion of this K£1 million should be used to open up the road because it has been forgotten for more than 20 years. If constructed, the road will connect us with Kitui, Kibwezi and Mombasa, thereby shortening the time one takes to travel from Maua to Mombasa.The other thing that I would like to request the Ministry to do is to consider having a grader per each division in the whole country. Those graders so provided should remain at the divisonal headquarters to that they can maintain the roads on a regular basis.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the cost-sharing element should also be looked at carefully because we have some good donors who would wish to produce fuel. If the Ministry can availa the machinery fuel would be available If the Ministry accepts the policy of cost-sharing, then more roads could be opened, particularly in the security areas, In my area we have a donor who is willing to give fuel; all he requires is the' equipment. This would be a good gesture for cost-sharing. That is up to the Ministry to decide. Indeed, the community would even be willing to hire graders from the Ministry and open up the roads. So, if this facility could be availed, the Ministry would be assisted by the "local- people. That is why I am saying that the cost-snaring element should be looked at carefully by the Ministry.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we do not seem to have enough staff in the divisions  You find that we have only one road foreman and we would like the staff at the divisional level increased.With those few remarks, Mr. temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to support the Vote for the Ministry of Public Works. This is a very important Ministry in the sense that transport and communication are depended on its performance. Movement from production areas to market centres and other public utility centres is depended on how well this Ministry works.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has done very well; it has tried tomaintain the road network which has been constructed up to today within the limits of the available finances. At the same time, the Ministry has tried to expand roads to new areas to help farmers and open up the hinter¬land of the country. There has been noted some deterioration of workmanship, especially in relation to tarmacked roads. It is not convincing that once a tarmacked road is completed you start seeing potholes within two years. We may blame the heavy traffic; overloading and so on, but these are factors which are foreseen during the construction of a road. A tannack road, being too expensive to construct, should have a snelf life of over five years. The usage road should be taken seriously during construction. One omission is that the contractors who win the tenders tend to economise too much, using less and less material to construct in order to increase the profit margin. This can be avoided if the Ministry deployed its experts to supervise the construction of the roads. It does not make any sense to test a road once it is completed and then later you have a lot of complications because the road has been constructed to a very low standard. If you set up standards for a road, you should ensure that those standards are complied with.Having said that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Ministry for having started the work of rehabilitating the Eldoret- Timboroa road, which is going on very well at the moment. I also wish to congratu¬late Stroppa (?) company for the way they Eire doing the job and for ensuring that much of the labour comes from the area. There was a time we were a bit worried because the managers attempted to import people from other places. This should not be allowed, and it is not acceptable. If you are a manager and you are working in Kisii or Kericho districts, then the labour and mannual work should be done by the people from that locality, except for technicians and other experts. I would like, however, to thank them for doing a good job.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, regarding the other types of road works like murraming, we have noted that some Ministry officials use soil. I know that murrain itself is soil, but there is a certain type of murram which is eligible for murraming a road. It is odd that it happens that you put soil on top of the road and then you say that it is tarmacked. As soon as it rains, that soil is washed awayand the road becomes muddy. It is also very important for the Ministry to maintain certain specifications on the types of soil they use for murraming roads.I am happy that in m, area some of the roads have been improved, but I call for the Ministry's support to maintain the Bayete-Platiu-Eldoret road.the Ministry please take that into account? That should also include the road from Mukundoi to Moi University through Mgeria. Since the university was opened, there has been only one road, and the one I am talking about is shorter and should, be maintained to facilitate movement from Eldoret to the University. The shorter the routes the better, especially during these days of high fuel costs.Sir, I would also like to commend the Ministry for the work they do with regard-to rural access, roads or minor road" projects. They are doing a good job, especially when they use human labour. The Ministry should continue, and if the people want the roads improved they should undertake to do some work themselves and then the Ministry can chip in either with some machinery or equip¬ment and help in the murraming. This will open up newer areas and facilitate development in the countryside.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, talking about road construction equipment, these are very expensive machines. It has happened that some contractors do ot have the equipment, yet they win tenders. When they win the tenders, as such, you find that there is a delay in completing the work. That leads to excessive costs.The Ministry should also be very careful in the selection and awarding of tenders. This is because there are some contractors who tend for very many jobs while they cannot do them all at the same time. In the end, if they are given many of those jobs, they will not be able to. complete the roads on time. I am particularly complaining about the Lessos Keses Road which has been under construction for a very long time. I have also asked a Question in the House and the other day when I went there, I found that the contractor had oved in is with his machines but after about two days, he disappeared. Nobody knows where he is but, I am sure, he is somewhere doing something similar. I have heard that he has similar concerns in Nyanza, Machakos and so on.Sir, this is a very costly thing for the Ministry and it should take action to ensure that the contractors do their job. At the same time, when the Ministry imports equipment, or such equipment is donated, it should be ensured that spares are made available. This can ensure that there are technicians in the country who can be repairing such equipment when they break down in the districts. In that way, even after a machine has broken down, it can be repaired immediately and put back to use.I would also like to thank the Ministry for the work it has done especially in the maintenance of Government houses. It is very important for the Ministry to have a routine watch on such houses so that they are repaired before they deteriorate and it becomes costly to rehabilitate them. Now that we have the local authorities' cases and services charges, it should be the policy of the Government to ensure that such funds are channelled to road improvement in the rural areas. It should be reflected in the budgets of the various local authorities for such implementation of road programmes so that where the Ministry does not have enough money, then the local authorities can step in and assist the people in the rural areas.I would also like to call upon the Ministry to help the Bayete Kipkabus Road. This is a very important road in an area that is highly productive and itis an old one which was being used by the colonialists. I would request the Ministry to look into the road with a view to tarmacking it. The local district development committee has made it a priority and it is only a question of locating the funds. Along with that is the Rivatex Ndalat Road which goes up to Nandi District. This is another important road to farmers and commuters who come to Eldoret for work.In conclussion I would like to congratulate. His Excellency the Presiden for completing 35 years of fruitful service to this country as an hon. Member, a service that cannot be challenged by any living politician at the moment. Those who have funny ideas should forget them and know that we have a President who has worth. We know what he has done for this country. It is disappo9nting to hear that a country like Norway, which is supposed to be democratic, is maintaining people who want to cause chaos in this country by allowing them to move out of their country and coming here with weapons to destabilise this country. I wonder what democracy they are talking about.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is unfair and; indeed, a shame to hear the Ambassador saying that he would like to bring a lawyer from outside to come and defend a fugitive who has been arrested here, as if we have no laws.Those lawyers from other countries can only operate if they comply to the laws of this country. I am happy that the Government has turned down that request.We have qualified lawyers in the country. Of course, Mrs. Wamwere is sayingthat her husband should be accorded justice and support by peace-loving people. I How can you talk of justice when the man himself was caught trying to cause injustices to the people? This, is ridiculous. If the lady was interested in Kenya, she should have been here so that we can suffer together. We cannot allow that.I would also like to congratulate the British Parliamentarians who have come to Kenya to see what we are doing for themselves. They are doing a good job and I could call them standard bearers of democracy, these are the people we want to come here and learn from us so that they can go back to their country with first-hand information. They will be able to inform their colleagues back home on what is really happening in Kenya.At the same time, we should be able, as hon. Members, be able to travel to other foreign countries so that we can meet other Members of Parlia¬ment, Congressmen and so on. We can talk to them and understand their problems and explain what it is that they do not understand from us. We will speak a similar Parliamentary language. Why should we just sit here? I know that our foreign embassies and commissions are doing a good job, but we must have a very strong public relations approach in order to inform the other countries of our position. We cannot have people running up and down and becoming experts on Kenyan affairs. What expertise do they have? What positions have some of them held in this country as politicians? With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMINO: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute on this Ministry's Vote. I would like to begin by commending the Ministry for the successful Rural Access Roads Programme. This is a programme that is opening up a country and giving jobs to those at the village levels and I would like to suggest that, in addition to paying the workers a stipend, they should consider supplementing that with food. For example, that can be done through the World Food Programme so that when there is no money to pay them, their meagre wages, as it sometimes happens, there will be something, at least, to eat.I would also like to suggest that this is a programme that can very easily be taken up and expanded, even using Kanu youth wingers. This is because it is a project that is helping to open up the countryside. We should urge the Ministry to extend their training even to those who are not in their employ so that wananchi, on their own, can also construct roads leading to their schools, markets and so on, However, Sir, let me also request that all projects started under this programme should be completed. To cite an example, we have Usare bridge in my constituency which was completed some two years ago but it has not been connected to the rest of the road so that gradually it is being underminedby the river and I do not think it will last long if it is not completed in time.I would also like to turn to the construction of roads. A long time back we used to see the Ministry of Public Works itself undertaking construction of roads and; indeed, even of buildings. However, now they do not do that as all such construction goes to private contractors. While I have no particular quarrel with that approach, I believe the Ministry cannot justify the employment of all those engineers, technicians and having all such equipment if they cannot under¬take such work themselves. In many other countries people have now moved away from tarmack to concrete roads. If we produce cement in this country, the use of cement for concrete roads ought to give us an impact to expand the cement industry by starting even new factories.The District Focus for Rural Development strategy, to me, means more than just having small projects being undertaken at the district level. I think the Ministry ought to evolve a policy which also requires contracts to be awarded only to contractors emanating from the districts where the projects are located so as to enable the money,so earned to circulate in the local vicinity. I think that till help to strengthen more the district strategy.If you travel around the country, like most of us do, you will seethat Government buildings are in a shocking state of disrepair. I think itis timely to reason that the longer you take to maintain a building the moreit will eventually cost you to repair it. I would like to urge the Ministryto ensure that Government buildings, are regularly maintained so that they can live the length of their lives as originally designed.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry also rents out private houses and offices for use by civil servants. The Ministry is the worst paymaster on record. I would like the Minister to take particular note of this because, when the Ministry rents accommodation from a mwananchi, as a Government, the Ministry later tells the mwananchi that there is no money to pay him for the accommodation and that is a shameful matter. The Ministry ought to save us from this regular embarrassment.Sir, there also seems to be a move away from the Kenyanisation of consultants so that the services of expatriates is retained. We have enough manpower produced by our universities that should be given first priority. There is no reason why an expatriate should come here as an engineer or an architect and given any job whatsoever. If you went to the United Kingdom and found that the Minister is an Englishman, and the Chief Architect is an Englishman, an African architect would never be registered, leave alone get a job. That is exactly the same position we should adopt in respect of the expatriates coming into this country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry ought to expand the road network in this country and make more roads all-weather, partiuclarly in the rural areas, because the food that feeds this nation comes from there; and that food must be transported to the market, which be in Kisumu, Nairobi or Mombasa for export. Unless the countryside, where food is grown, is adequately served there arises wastage because the food will not reach the maket consequent upon that the farmer is frustrated and we ought to avoid this if we can.The Ministry also builds, or supervises the constructionof Government buildings. You can see at the moment that the construction industry seems to be buoyant." But there are very few private projects being undertaken; most of the projecis seem to be public sector jobs. That is really not a good measure of the buoyancy of the economy or, indeed, that of the construction industry. I would like to suggest that the Ministry should reach a stage when it should stop building ITS own houses and encourage wananchi to build houses for it to rent and ensure that it pays the rent.The point is simply  this: At the end of the day, although we want to develop this nation, we must also develop its nationals. It in respect of Ministries like Public Works that this can be seen to be done actually on the ground. That is why I would like to suggest to the Minister to consider very seriously the issue of stopping at one stage the construction of public buildings so that the private sector can invest and help to promote the nationals.The policy of renting houses civil servants also ought to be reviewed.I would like to suggest,for Minister's consideration,that. it makes some money available to saving and loan institutions, housing and finance companies and buidling societies toconstruct houses with a proviso that a certain of the houses constructed be reserved for purchase by civil servants as this will help in not only stabilising the Civil Service by giving individual officers their own homes, but will also increase the housing stocky, which is all for  the good of the whole nation.with those few remarks, I wish to support.MR.A.K.KINYANJUI Ahsante sana, Bw.

Ikiwa barabara zetu nyingi za lami zitakuwa na mashimo basi tutakuwa na shida.Nakumbuka na barabara katika sehemu zenye michai ambazo silikuwa zinatusaidia sana. lio j a wapo ya mimea ambayo inatupatia pesa nyingi za kigeni ni chai - hat a sasa chai imeisiiinda kahawa. Ningemwomba Waziri kuwa na mpango wa kuzirekebisha barabara hizi kote nchini kabla hazijaharibika zaidi. Gliai inapokosa ES njia ya kuisafirisha na	kuharioika tunapotezapesa nyingi za kigeni. Ewa hivyo, tukizirekebisha barabara hizi tutafaidika sanas: kwa sababu hizi sinapitia katika sehemu zenye kukuza aina nyingine za mimea." Tumekuwa tukipendekeza vrs katika kamati za naendeleo ya wilaya kurekebishwa kwa barabara hizi oila ya chochote kuxanyika na sasa tunataka kuona vitendo.Jambo lingine ni kwamba barabara hizi s za mashambani zina faida nyingi sana, k na kwa sababu hii tunataka barabara hizi sitengewe pesa zaidiBali .na barabara kx hizi kutusaidia pia utengenesaji wake utatoa kazi kwa watu wa 33hesu za mashambani. hapa, npami Tri watazitia maanani sana barabara hizi ndogo, ingawa simaanishi kvraxiba hatuna haja na barabara kubwa.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ingefa wizara hii ishirikiane na VTizara ya Ochukuzi na Mawasiliano ni kuona barabara setu zinatumiwa na magari ya uzito uliokusudiwa. Utaona kwamba tumeire- kebisha barabara ya kutoka Nairobi hadi Sisumu kupitia iTakuru iiara nyingi lakini bado nl mbaya kwa sababu ya kutumivra na nag ax a makubvra. Haifai Serika.l i. kukubalias gari la tani 15 kutumia barabara iliyosudiwa kwa gx magari ya tani 10 k.?a sababu barabara hiyo itaharibika haraka.Kwa hivyo, kuna haja kubva ya Serikali yetu tukufu kufikiria kuyaondoa magari makubwa-makubwa kutoka kwa barabara zetu kwa sababu zitaendelea kuharibu barabara zetu. Hivyo ni kusema kwamba hat a pesa ambazo Waziri anataka Bunge hili lipitishe, karibu zote zitatumiva kwaJ kuzirekebisha barabara hizi. Kwa hivyo, ningeiomba wizara hii, na Serikali kwa jumla, ifiki rie jinsi tunavyowez; kuzihifadhi barabara zetu.Jaabo lingine aabalo ningetaka kusema kwamba, Serikali yetu tukufu inatilia maanani sana mapendekezo yayaofanywa kamati za maendeleo wilay arid. Katika sehemu ya Kiambu, tuna ile barabara inayotoka Githunguri hadi Kagwi na kuendelea mpaka Limuru, Uinaishukuru Wizara hii kwa kutengeneza barabara hii, na ingawa hai jamalizika, natumaini kwamba vfizara itaendelea na kazi yake nzuri na kuimaliza. Yile vile, ninaishukuru xi ifizara kwa kuite— ngeneza ile barabara inayopitia hospitali ya Kijabe. Tunaashukuru pia Mtukufu Rais kwa sababu alipopitia kule Kijabe, alisema barabara ya kuingia EEK katika hospitali hii ni lazima itengenezwe.Ningetaka baada ya kusema hivyo, kuingia kwa upande wa urekebishaji wa magari. Katika wilaya ya Kiarabu peke yake, tuna matrakta 9 lakini ajabu ni kwamba matrakta hayo yote yameharibika isipokuwa mo ja peke yake ambayo inafanya kazi. Hivyo ni kusema kwamba wale waianyakazi tunaowaajiri kuyatuaia matrakta haya  wanalipwa mishahara ya bure. Ni lazima waziri ajaribu kutenga pesa za kutosha ili kuweza kuyarekebisha matrakta haya ili tuweze kufanya kazi kwa njia inayofaa.Kwa hayo machache, naunga mkono.<newspeech> TEE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRYOF FINANCE (Mr. Keah): Thank you very, much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,for giving me this opportunity to make my contribution to this debate. I wouldlike to say straightaway that I support this Motion and in so doing, I would liketo make one or two observations. First of all, I would like to  acknowledgetthe fact that this Ministiy has a herculean task in the construction industry and making sure that our economy is mobile. I am saying this because it is through.road communication that, in fact, we can enhance the mobility and performance of our economy.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, I would like to Minister thank the for putting, up the kilifi Bridge, which is a very important land markand an economic aspect of development, not only in kilifi District, but alsoin the northern coast. I would also at this juncture, point out that the Kilifibridge, without the tarmacking of the Mariakani/kaloleni/Mavweni Road, is likewearning a pair of trousers without having shoes on and walking bare foot.I am saying this because when one travels from Nairobi toMalindi, one noticesthat this bridge would enhance the smooth running of traffic towards Malindiand the northern coast. However, not having the Marikani/Kaloleni Road tarmacked,this to some extent will creat some kind of a bottle-neck because it means thatpeople will still have to drive all the way to Mombasa and then on to Malindiwhich is a much longer route. Therefore, I would like to appeal to the hon.Minister to try as much as possible to give this particular road a priority inhis programme. This road has been given priority since early 1970s ana it tis surprising that today, nearly 20 years, the road has not yet been taraacked.I am however pleased to note, that  recently, there was a vote in the budget for murraming this road but we know that murram these days takes only two years to wear out. Therefore, I urge the Minister to make sure that this road is tarmacked. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, having said that, I would like to touch on the question of the road policy that we have in this country. As we are all aware, bad roads create a heavier wear and tear on the motors-vehicles. At the same time, these roads are a waste of fuel and therefore, they are a liability to the Treasury and to our economy at large. Therefore, it is important for the Ministry to ensure that the maintenance programme is, in fact, well utilized throughout the country in order to ensure that our roads are well maintained. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate theMinistry for the way they are running the rural access road programme. However, I would like to make one observation with regard to the frequent breakdown of road machinery. Proper maintenance of this equipment means that more and more people would be utilized for this programme. I would like to urge, the Minister to make enough provision in his budget to ensure in one stretch of so many kilometres, there is probably one or two people responsible for the  maintenance of the road. I do not know whether that is scientific enough, but it is a suggestion all the same. This would ensure that these roads are properly maintains We do have graders going over these roads once a year but once it rains, the road is washed away immediately and it remains impassable for the rest of the year. This is not good enough and something really ought to be done.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like to mention here that the Ministry of Public works has done a very tremendous job for putting up the so calle "Graduation Court". "When one passes by this building, one notices it is a master-piece of excellency and I would like to congratulate themfor doing such a good job. The University has now changed its face entirely and this indeed  a job well done although I do not know how much it cost.Having said that, I would like to make a two or three more points. The first point is with regard to the roads toll policy in this country. I would like to take this opportunity to ask the hon. Minister to review the placing of the road toll station situated in Mariakani Town. we havethe Kilifi District Development Committee are totally opposed to the contruction of this toll station and the Army Unit at Mariakani has opposed this. It has also been opposed by the Kenya Research Institute and it also appears that everybody is  opposed to the construction of this toll station.This particular toll station is about to be constructed about half akilometre from the centre of Mariakani. You can see how this toll stationis going to inconveniencece wananchi coming to work everyday and we thank the LAST LINE OF THIS (PAGE 556)NOT READABLE and we did suggest to this teaa that this toll station should be takenaway from the urban portion cf Nariakani in order to save wananchi fromthe difficulties and incoveniences of having to pay toll fees in the morning, twiceat  lunch time and once again in the evening when going home. So,this toll station should be moved away from the town in order to capture more\of the highway traffic rather than the local Mariakani traffic. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would now like to talk about the fuel conservation measures that we ought to embark on voluntarily in this country. With the Gulf crisis, it is obvous from recent months that oil prices must go up in this country. So, we should educate ourselves to take some fuel conservation measures. I have alredy talked about road maintenance, which, one of these measures. However, I also think that we must certainly reduce the joy rides that we enjoy and try some bullying, method if we are goingto save our high fuel bill. This is a point that should be taken seriously by everybody. If we save our high fuel bill, we can put more money into road-construction and other development priorities in the country.I would now like to touch upon one very special point of accountability. This Parliament is going to vote to the Ministry over Shs.100 million for use during the currrent financial year. This money is not enough due to our budgetary constraints, but the little that we vote to the Ministry should certainly be spent on priorities and the items it is budgeted for. This particular Ministry has been talked about in the past, with people saying that funds have not been used for the purposes for which they were voted. So, I urge the Ministry to be very vigilant in making sure that its funds are adequately accounted for and all bills and liabilities that the Ministry incurs are actually settled in time. Time and again, we have had complaints from the public of people not having been paid by the Ministry. If we follow the Budget, everybody will be paid his dues save, of course, in cases of unforeseen circumstances and wanton price rises. I would really like to hammer home this point of accountability to this House and the whole nation of the funds that we vote here.With these remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank you very much and beg to support. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda kwa kazi arnbayo imefanya njia yote kutoka makao makuu yake hadi wilayani. Sasa hivi, tuna provincial engineers LAST LINE OF THIS PAGE 558 IS NOT READABLEkazi nzuri sana. Kuna tarafa mbili katika Turkana Kaskazini, mojawapo ikiwa ni Lokichoggio, na ile nyingine Kibichi. Tangu tarafa hizi z.ianzishwe, hazijapata barabara ya kuziunganisha. Tarafa hizi zinapakana na nchi mbili jiranx, na watu wake wana taabu inayohusu usalaraa. Wakati dawa za mifugo zinapopelekwa kule, wale wanaohusika huwa na taabu ya mahali pa kupitia. Hatuna njia ya kufuatilia mifugo yetu wakati inapotoroshwa na wezi wa mifugo kutoka nchi jirani. Ni vigurou hata kwa maofisa wa'Serikali walio huko kuifuata mifugo hii. Kwa hivyo, Waziri atatwambia wakati wa kujibu ni lini .atamtuma engineer wake kuchunguza uwezekano wa kujenga barabara ya kuunganisha tarafa hizi mbili. Sasa hivi, hapana barabara yo yote inayounganisha tarafa za Lokichoggio, Kibichi na Lokitaung. Kutoka makao makuu ya wilaya hadi Kibichi ni kilometa 400, na ukitaka kwenda Lokichoggio, ni lazima usafiri kutoka Kibichi hadi Lodwar ndipo uanze kutafuta paJLe Lokichoggio ipo kwa sababu hapana barabara za mkato baina ya tarafa hizi. Turaeongea mambo haya katika kamati yetu ya maendeleo ya wilaya, lakini Wizara haijamtuma surveyor hata nunoja huko kuangalia ni wapi barabara inapoweza kupitia. tunachotaka ni grader ya kutupasulia barabara ya kutuwezesha kuwapelekea watu wetu dawa za watu na za wanyama. Itatuwezesha pia kufuatilia mifugo yetu iki-ibiwa na wahuni.Kitu kingine ambacho Wizara hii inasahau ni viwanja vya ndege. Wakati mwingine, Serikali hutujna mishahara huko kwa ndege, lakini hivi sasa hapana uwanja wa ndege wo wote mzuri huko. Uwanja wa ndege wa Kibichi uuneharibika na hapana njia ya kuwapelekea askari huko mshahara isipokuwa kwa kusafiri kwa gari kutoka Lodwar, safari ambayo inachukua siku mbili. Uwanja wa ndege wa Kamathia ndio mbaya zaidi, na wafanyakazi wsLLio huko wanalazimika kutembea kwa miguu umbaili mkubwa sana kwenda kupokea mishahara yao. Sijui kama viwanja hivi viko katika mipango ya Wizara au Wizara ndiyo iliyosaJiau Turkana. Ingefaa Waziri aiangalie wilaya hii ambayo iko mpakani kwa sababu tuna mambo fuleini yanayotukabili huko ambayo hatuwezi kuyasema hapa kwa sababu ya usalama.Kwa hayo machache, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, naunga mkono. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Dr. B.A. Godana) : Thank you verymuch, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this debate. Naturally, I stand to support the Vote of the Ministry of Public Works, but, firstly, let me join the ranks of my colleagues who have spoken before me today and earlier in congratulating His Excellency the President on the occasion of the thirty—fifth anniversary of his parliamentary career, a career whose track record has definitely been very brilliant and because of which he has been able to serve this country as a parliamentarian in virtually all the roles that hon. Members of. this.House could possibly, serve in.. He was initially a Back-bencher, and later became a freedom fighter during the colonial period, a Member of the then Opposition, a Member of the Government, a Cabinet Minister, a Vice—President and, in the last 12 years, the Father of the Nation, that is the President ofthe Republic. We congratulate him on his achievement, and it is my personal prayer that he continues to lead the country in the same style of equity that he has introduced during his leadership. I would like to say that it is also my prayer that God continues to give the guidance necessary to lead this country to faur greater heights.Turning to the matters right at hand, needless to say, the Ministry of Public Works is very important because one key department of the Ministry is concerned with the contraction and maintenance of roads. This makes the Ministry very important because it deals with communication. Roads are the most elementary form of communication. They are the most original form of communication between individuals and communities- Therefore, it is very important, if we are to bring development to the people in the remote corners of this country, that we, firstly and foremost, communicate with our centres of guidance. The construction and, particularly, the maintenace of rual roads in this country has left a lot to be desired, especially in some of the remoter areas. I think it is time the Ministry's headquarters devised new ways of correcting past failures. I know that colossal sums of money are spent annually on raod maintenance, but it is a pity to know that so much money has been spent when, in fact, nothing has been done on the ground. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is a joke in my place of somebody mining some minerals on the roadside coming to the Ministry's headquarters and complaining that the road is in a very im bad state and being shown files of the last three or four years and the amount of money spent on that road and the person cannot remember a single occasion when the particular section concerned was repaired.I would like to suggest to the Ministry  and the Minister is here that perhaps it is time that Recurrent Expenditure was used not for the  purpose of paying salaries but for the purpose of maintaining our roads. That is recurrent expenditure as distinct from Development Expenditure for financing new development projects. This expenditure should be subjected to close supervision and scrutiny by the D.D.C. It would be useful for example, if there were circulars requiring district level officers not only to inform their D.D.C.s about the amounts voted for the maintenance of specific roads annually but in fact to Table their expenditures. This is because very often we are told at the end of the  financial year that so much has been spent and we know as a matter of fact that nothing has been done. Two years ago, I remember looking at the current Developmentplan for Marsabit District. I went to look at the section dealingwith roads„ There was a sub-section dealing with the road leadingto North Horr. The plan said that about l8 sites had been identifiedand earmarked for the construction of slabs - cementing of veryrocky portions of the roads. This exercise is not expensive and ittends to keep the problem at bay for a longer time. Tha plan saidthat about 60 per cant of the job had been 	completedLAST LINE OF THIS PAGE 561 IS NOT READABLE  we were told two years later that the programme was going to resume  after 1933, out to-date the programme has not resumed. WHAT I know is that even the small construction camp there has "been demolished; the iron sheets have "been removed. This tends to	suggest, that no more work is envisaged on on that particular road.	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is unfortunate thatwe seem to be going to expensive technology when executing some development projects or doing maintenance work. You will find that Non-Governmental Organisations and church groups trying to get to remote communities resort to the use of</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mureithi) : Order!  It is now time for the Mover to reply</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER POR PIBLIC WORKS (Mr. Mibei) : Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.Before I respond, to the various points raised during the debate on this Vote, I would like to take this opportunity to than all hon.Members who have contributed to this lively debate on the Vote of my Ministry. In particular I was very grateful to know the different details which hon. Members have touched upon. There have been positive comments about the performance of my Ministry. I think that will go a long way in motivating our officer so that they can continue to improve the various aspects cf my Ministry. I would like to acknowledge and accept the encouraging remarks, especially from His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if you look at the Civil Servants Bench you will find that all the top officers of my Ministry are here. Also the top officers from the provinces are here. They have taken note of the comments raised by hon.Members of Parliament. I am happy that I have qualified officers; qualified engineers who are university graduates who are patriotic and who are ready to offer their knowledge for the improvement of the different activities of the MinistryMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, sometime last year, Iattended a seminar on road maintenance. The seminar was held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and it was  sponsored by the World Dank. So, you can see that I acquired some knowledge which may enable me to supervise some of the construction work that we undertakeMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in my response, I have lumped together, where feasible, some of the comments raised. Nearly all the Members of Parliament who spoke talked of lack timely maintenance of roads including pothole patching. I will first of all consider the bitumen roads. It is accepted that several roads are potholed and show signs of deterioration. But I would like to assure hon. Members that the Government, using donor and toll funds has already awarded major road rehabilitation contracts which will save the roads from further deterioration.Contracts have been awarded for work on the following roads:-Kabete-Limuru Road -  work is going on; Timboroa-Eldoret Road; Eldoret-Turbo Road; webuye-Malaba; Machakos-turaoff to  Konsa; Makutano-Sagana-Murang'a and Nyeri-Rironi-Mahimahiu-Naivasha Road; Kisuzru-Yala Road and so on.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am happy also to report that plans are at an advanced stage for awarding tenders for work on Kisii-Kilgoris Road; Kericho-Sotik Road;Migori-Isabania Road; Mtwapa-Kilifi Road; Mombasa-Lunga lunga Road; Waa-Kwale Road: MAU Summit-ITakuru-Bahat i; .Ahero-Eisii. Road and so on This will involve rehabilitation and, re sealing as-appropriate.Work is also going on on the Nunguni Road.:- I have not mentioned all the roads; there are many more. The intervention will give a major face-lift to the road system in the Republic.1with regard to the patching of potholes, and the clearing of roadside bushes, my Ministry has given firm instructions to all the field staff to act immediately the potholes appear and to use suitable materials. Those who will not comply with the instructions will face disciplinary action in accordance with the Civil Service Regulations.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, on the question of gravelled and earth roads, I wish to say that following recent procurement of new graders and the rehabilitation of some of the existing ones; it will now be possible for the Ministry to carry out enhanced timely grading of roads. As hon. Members correctly noted, tippers are no readily available. However, I assure them that plans for procurement of tippers are at an advanced stage, and I promise that each district will get one new tipper for the use in patching of gravelled roads. This should not take long.Sir, the Ministry is also in the process of exploring the possibility of using labour-intensive maintenance as suggested by the hon. Vice-President and Minister for Finance and other hon. Members of Parliament. This is because we should also take steps in an effort to save foreign exchange and also create job opportunities.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, on the question of the intallation of bridges, culverts, metre drains and other drainage facilities, hon. Makau's and hon. Kirwa's observations were noted. The objective of the Ministry has been to open up the roads in order to allow accessibility and then to follow that up with the installation of drainage structures depending on the availability of funds. All districts have been provided with culvert manufacturing equipment, and this is a continuous exercise. I wish to assure the hon. Members that my Ministry has an on—going bridging programme covering 100 bridges annually accord¬ing to district development committee priorities and also availability of funds.Sir, the other point that was reised by hon. Members was the premature failure of roads. It is admitted that a few of the recently constructed trunk roads have experienced early failures. The reasons for this early failures have been carefully investigated and found to be due mainly to excessive overloading. In view of this, the Government has resumed the axel-load controls on all the major roads.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, nearly all Members who spoke raised the question of the expansion of labour-intensive minor roads programme. My Ministry is proceeding with the programme in all the 28 agricultural districts. Funds are now beinsought to expand the programme in other districts where labour is readily available. In fact, Taita/Taveta, Kajiado and Samburu districts have been included in this year's programme.The other point which was raised by hon. Awori and others was on dualling of trunk roads and construction of new roads. My Ministry is constantly reviewing the traffic volume on all the major roads with a view to dualling them. At present, plans are advanced for dualling Thika-Makutano road while designs are being finalised for dualling of Nairobi-Athi River-Machakos turn of road. Preliminary design work is in progress for the Mombasa—Mazeras road. Meanwhile, the dualling of Westlands—Limuru road is on-going. I am sure that hon. Members who take that route have witnessed the work going on.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, with regard to new feeder roads, plans are finalised for the construction of the Mumias-Busia road, Narck-Mau Narok and Rodi Kopany—fCarungu roads. Other top priority roads countrywide will follow.On the question of toll stations which was raised by hon. Omido, hon. Kimeraia and others, I wish to say that the frequency of toll stations is under a careful scrutiny by my Ministry. Only those which are viable are constructed. When hon. Keah was contributing, he complained about the location of a certain toll station, and I wish to state that the Ministry has decided to remove that particular toll station from Mariakani town to the weighbridge side.There were also some allegations of fraudulent practices at toll stations, and my Ministry will take the appropriate action after investigating the matter. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Kirwa alleged that there was theft of Government stores. I would like to appeal to hon. Members that when they have any information on these allegations, they should be patriotic enough to alert the police for the necessary and timely action. The Ministry itself does not condone such malpractices. Any member of staff caught stealing Government stores is dealt with according to regulations and according to the law.On the question of lack of staff in road camps, which was raised by hon. Mutwol, it is true that the Ministry has no-t been replacing all the staff who have retired recently. The reason for this is that the Ministry intends to hire more casual staff for road maintenance activities since casual service is cheaper for the Government. However, in Elgeyo/Marakwet District, the Ministry replaced five of the retired staff in July this year. Other replacements will be considered on their own merit.Sir, with regard to lack of supervisory staff, I wish to inform hon. Members that the Ministry has recently completed.a major exercise of promoting road oversers and foremen to fill the existing vacancies. I am sure that there will be some improvement in the overseeing of the going on work.Hon. Bidu and other hon. Members raised some points about the allocation of road maintenance funds. The allocation of road maintenance funds to the districts is based on the classified road length and maintenance work load which varry from district to district, such that you cannot say that you should allocate equal funds to each district.There cannot be equal allocation of funds to all the areas as even the length of the roads is not the same.Now, with regard to the utilisation of crop cess funds, especially from tea, the district development committees have been issued with clear and specific directives on what should be done. I was surprised to hear from an hon. Member that nothing is being done in that respect. We get reports that roads leading to tea factories are being improved. Even in Kiam'ou and other tea-growing areas, that is happening. I hope the hon. Member who spoke has visited the areas of late, because there is a lot of improvement going on using the cess fees from tea.We will also investigate and where found feasible, we shall utilise resources from local authorities in the maintenance of equipment and roads. Of  course we shall need to have appropriate consultations with those concerned.I remember hon. A.K. Kimemia and others expressing the wish that roadsafety should be enhanced. I agree with him. The road rehabilitation, maintenance and repair programme mentioned will make s. major impact on road safety. Although there is a tendency by our people to drive very fast on a good road, this should not be the case because we have heard of requests for road bumps to reduce the speeding on roads. I wish to appeal once again to road users, especially drivers to be careful when driving on roads. they should be mindful of other road users.On the road maintenance equipment, it is true that we have, and are still experiencing, some difficulties with our. road maintenance equipment. However, I assure the House that efforts are being made to acquire new equipment as well as upgrading what we already have. For example, in'1989, the Roads Department received some maintenance equipment under the Japanese Commodity Aid Programme. We received 40 pick-ups, 40 motor graders and 24 fuel tankers. All these equipment have been jallocated to the grading units in the districts countrywide.During 1989 3-tonne Isuzu flats(?) were purchased solely for patchingof potholes on pavec roads. We distributed them to the provincial headquarters. During the 1990/91 Financial Year,	and distributed to all the districts in the Republic. It is also intended to procure 107 pieces of equipment for resealing, bridging and grading units, which will include 24 tippers under the World Bank Second Highway Sector Loan.During 1989/90 Financial Year, the Roads Department set aside some Ksh20 million under Recurrent Expenditure towards the repair of Komatsu equipment in North-Eastern Province and also Tana River and Lamu Districts. During this current financial year, Ksh.16 million has been set aside for the same purpose. So, when we are wall equipped, I am sure all hon. [Members will see changes and improvements on their roads.We have also proposed the rehabilitation of mechanical equipment. We have 110 Champion graders and most of them are unserviceable. We are only awaiting a memorandum of understanding to be signed between the Government of Kenya and Canada so that we can rehabilitate 90 such graders through the financing from Canadian grants. That can be done anytime from now. We also have 265 catterpillar equipment in three classes. There acei.l\95 graders and 90 dozers as well as 50 loaae Most of these equipment were procured in the early 1970's under a World Bank loan. They are now virtually grounded and require major repairs. We have made a proposal for a rehabilitation of, at least, 200 of them which we are soon submitting to a donor for financing.We have created an inspectorate team by strengthening the department with senior officers "at all levels who have been assigned the responsibility of ensuring efficient supervision of maintenance works and projects. I hope that soon there will be no more complaints of laxity among our officers.Now, there was a suggestion about support to indi genous contractors. This is already being done as we have created a deliberate bias for 10 per cent cost for all projects quoted for by indigenous contractors. We also register only indigenous contractors up to Category "C" which is limited-to a contract of Ksh20 million.There was also a proposal that we should have a standard cheap design of a model'house. Wehave noted that and we will work closely with the Ministry of Lands on this. We intend to come up with improved designs on different areas with-climatic conditions and family sizes et cetera being considered. Once that has been done we will come up with the designs applicable to wananchi at a token fee.Now, there has been a point raised about consu ltants. I agree with the hon. Members that we have committed, or rather, we have qualified staff. What I can say on this is that we have a committee that deals with the appointment of consultants to ensure a favourable distribution of projects. We hope that they will improve on that.Now, out of a total of 2,000 projects which the Ministry is currently engaged in, only four per cent of these are given to outside consultants and our objective is to undertake the total Ministry's workload.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, on the maintenanceof Government buildings the Ministry is doing, its best to utilisethe available resources to upgrade the maintenance of Governmenthouses. we are aware that the resources made available to us forthat purpose are limited but we intend to efficiently and effectively _utilise  whatever funds we receive.I would also like to assure hon- Omido that within the resources available to us we will try to upgrade street lighting in Government estates in Nairobi.In order to assist schools and hospitals in the rural 	areas in supervision of construction I would appeal to the committeesto contact our offices in the districts to let them know which and where buildings are to be constructed: Supervision is not automatic and so my officer have to be made aware of the construction plans.I thank all the hon. Members for their contributions ana assure  them that they will be seeing changes in their areas.

DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is there anybody from the Ministy of Foreign Affairs? Next Question.Question No. 451 Payment of Pension Increases to Postal WorkersMR. BIDU asked the Minsiter for Transport . and Communications what has delayed the payment of the pension increase to the pensioners of the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation with effect fron (increases) Amendment Act, 1990.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Mutwol): Mr. Deptuty Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Kenya Posts and Telecommunications has paid pension increases in 1980, 1987 and lately this year. In March, 1990, the Minister approved the corporation's pension increases and the same were subsequently gazetted via Legal Notice No. 15 9 of 6th April, 1990. The corporations pensionerys started getting their increase pension from 1st July, 1990. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: While thanking the assistant Minister for his reply, I would wish him to tell this House why it has taken so long when we know the Bill was passed some time ago? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTWOL: Mr. Deputy Speaker, sir, it took so long because of the nature of procedures that we had to follow from the Ministry to the Attorney General's Chambers and then back to us. After that the Ministry gazetting them and that is why it took a bit of time. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMINO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, since Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Pension Fund is, in fact, funded and not administered by the Ministry what role has the Ministry got in the dispensation of the funds? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTWOL: Mr. Deputy Speaker, can the hon. Member repeat the question once again? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMINO: The pension scheme for the corporation's workers is funded but not administered like that of the civil servants. In view of that what role has the Minister got to play in the payment of the pension? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTWOL: Unless, hon. Omino has forgotten the laws that are eracted in this House; he should be aware that gazettement must be done before any increases are effected. That is why I said the dalay was due to the gazettement and the time taken by the Attorney General's Chambers. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTUA: Is the Assistant Minister ashamed because it is not only in this Ministry, but in all the other Ministries where pensioners do not get their dues in time? What are you dong to rectify the sitution? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTWOL: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we will make sure that we speed up the payment of pension benefits in every Ministry. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.BIDU: Sicne the gazettement has already been done; could the Assistant Minister tell this House how many ex-employees of the corporation have been paid so far now ever since that gazettement was made? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTWOL: Numerically, I do not have that figure, but... </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of orde,r Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Hon. Omino asked a question and the Assistant Minister assumed that hon. Omino has forgotten the laws. Is it possible that the Assistant Minister did not understand the question from hon. Omino or was the reply right? Because I think he did not understand the question and if .... </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: You are quite right, Mr. Mwamzandi. I share thsoe sentiments. I have got the feeling that the Assistant Minister did not quite get the supplementary question by hon. Omino and perhaps., for the benefit of the Assistant Minister, could you repeat that supplementary question? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTWOL: I cannot repeat the question because.I do not remember it now. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPTuy speaker: Hon. Omino, you wanted to know the role of your Ministry. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMINO: My question was simply this: The pension scheme of the Post Office, is funded, in other words it is contributory The employee a portion and the Post Office pays-another portion. Once the gazettee notice has appeared here the postal authorities are bound to implement it. The Assistant Minister's answer was that they had togazettee the increase and they had to involve the Attorney General's Chambers which in my view quite frankly was unecessary. My question was: If, in fact, the pension scheme, or contributory as it is, what role did they have to Play before implementation of a low which has already been passed by this House? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTWOL: Our role here was to approve it. This was an increase; it.was not the useual pension. An increase of pension must go through certain stages. So, the Post Office must bring it to the Ministry for approval and then take it to the Attorney- General for his approval. After that we have to gazettee it as usual. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Next Question. </Newspeech>Question No. 466Payment of Survivors Benefit to the Late Maiti's KinBw. A.K.

Naibu Spika, naomba kujibu.Ni kweli jamii ya marehemu, Bw. Maimba Maiti, hawajalipwa marupurupu yao yaani survivors benefits. Hii nikutokana na sababu ya kwamba, mareheme, Bw. Maimba Maiti, hakuwa ametambulisha •ni nani angelipwa hayo marupurupu, yaani next of kin hakuonyesha.Kwa hivyo, jamii ya marehemeu huyu ameombwa ajaze fomu za kudai hizo pesa na wazipeleke kwa mkuu wa.wilaya ile nay atujulishe ni nani atalipwa hayo marupurupe.Shirika la Posta na Simu linagojea hii ifanyike ile walipe ahayo marupurupu. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

KIMEMIA: Wasiri Msaidizi amesema ati Bw. Maiti atajaza fomu nyinge. He, amesahau ati Bw. Maiti amekufa? Ataijaza namna gani? Form ziko lakini Waziri Musaidizi haja ziangalia katika office yate inasemekana kwamba bibi yake ndiye angearithi maly ya Mme wake, Fomu imeandikwa namna hivyo. Je, hi kwa nini Waziri Msaidizi analipotoza Bunge hili? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Naibu Spika. Wasiri Msaidizi analipotoza Bunge hilie. Kwanza alisema fomu haiko na sasa anasema kwamba katika	haikuiazwa next of kin. Sasa nilipi analoptuarnbia;. ni fomu haiko au fomu haikujazwa ni nani angemrithi marehemu? Ingefaa tuelezewe ile tuweze kujua. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTWOL: Sikusema fomu iko. Inawezekana uwe na fomu lakin usahau kujaza your next of kin. Lakini kwa wakati huu hiyo fomu haiko. Ni kwa sababu hiyo tunamwuliza bibi yake aende akamwone mkuu wa wilaya. Hiyo ni kawaida. Watu wengi hufanya hivyo na wakkuu wa wilay huongea nao na kuwajulisha ni akina nani watalipwa uritho. Wakuu wa wilay huandikia barua. Walileta hizo barua pamoja na fomu. wnalipwa pesa zao. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Naibu Spika. Waziri Msaidizi anali potosha Bunge hili kwa sababu anajua wazi kwamba katika Idara ya Posta na Simu huwezi kupata nambari ya kuajairiwa kabla ya kujaza fomu za kuajiriwa. Je, huyu _ mtu alipata nambari ya kuajiriwa namna gani bila kujaza hizo fomu? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTWOL: Bw. Naibu Spika, inawezekana kwamba huyu mfanyakazi alijaza fomu za kuajiriwa na akapata nambari yake, lakini huenda ikawa hakujaza mahali panapohitaji majina ya jamii yake. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

KILIKU asked the Minister for Labour why the management of Kenya Meat Commission, based at Makupa Cold Storage, terminated the services of eight emplo¬yees on 18th July, 1990.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. D.M. Amin): Mr.. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The eight employees were employed by the Kenya Meat Commission, based at Makupa Cold Storage, on casual basis at the rate of KShs.30/- per day. The payments were mutually agreed to be paid on weekly basis. On 17th July, 1990, the eight employees refused to take their weekly earnings claiming that they were being underpaid. However, the management terminated their services on 18th July, 1990,on the grounds of shortage, of work at the factory.Our investigations have, however, revealed that their refusal to take their earnings and their claim of underpayment-must have contributed to their termination of services. The Labour Officer, Mombasa, has established 	that the employees were being underpaid in that they were being paid KShs.30/- per day instead of KShs.40/- per day as from 1st June, 1990, and KShs.30/- per day instead of KShs.34.40 per day. previous to 1st June, 1990. The labour officer has, therefore, claimed from the management the arrears accordingly and one week's pay in lieu of notice. The management has agreed to pay the arrears as per notice that expires on 31st October, 1990. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell this House why the Kenya Meat Commission employed these eight people for so long as casuals? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is true that these eight people were employed on casual basis for many years. However, they were paid according to the casual rates. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Kiliku. I had given the Floor to Mr.Mwamzandi. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for how many years should one be employed continuously as a casual and after how long should one's service be converted to permanent terms? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, these employees were on casual basis. They were supposed to have their terms converted to permanent basis after every six years, but they were being employed on and off. As such, they were never employed on permanent terms. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Sir, could the Assistant Minister now tell this House what arrangements he is making to ensure that those Ministries employing people as casuals for many years without considering taking them on permanent basis must pay terminal benefits? Keeping employees on casual basis for many years is just one way of denying them terminal benefits once they reitire or they are sacked. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have written to the manage¬ment and tneyhave agreed to pay the arrears before 31st October.1980 If they do not pay, then the Ministry will take appropriate action. </Newspeech>Question No. 481<header> Utilization of Schools' Activity Funds in Machakos </header> MR. WAMBUA asked the Minister for Education:-(a)	how much money, in terms of activity fees, has been collected from all the primary schools in Machakos District between 1988, 1989 and June, 1990, and how has this money been utilized; and(b)	who the signatories of the bank accounts where this money (reffered to in 'a') is deposited are.(Hon. Karauri consulted the Clerk-at-Table)<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Karauri. I am sure you can afford to take the Business of the House more seriously than that. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it in order to the Assistant Minister, after a Question has been asked, to go loitering around? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Machakos District Primary Schools Activities Association was charged with the duty of collecting activity fees from parents in 1988, 1989 and 1990. The Association collected the funds and they were all utilised. In 1988, the Association collected KShs.718,480/- and spent a total of KShs.807,471/- to organise school activities from zones to national level. There was a deficit of KShs.88,991/ in 1988, and in 1987, there was another deficit of KShs.42,109/-. Therefore, as at December, 1988, the Association had a total deficit of KShs.131,100/-.In 1989, a total of KShs.870,450/- was collected from parents, and the Association spent KShs.1,069,472/- to run all the school activities in the district up to the national level. There was an overexpenditure of KShs.199,022 in 1989, plus the deficits of 1987 and 1988 of KShs.131,100/-. Therefore, the total deficit from 1987 to 1989 was KShs. 330.122/-.During this year, a total of KShs.1,556,960/- was collected from parents and the expenditure incurred during the organisation of school activities from zones to the national level was KShs.1,739,977.20. The overexpenditure was KShs.183,017.20.The bank signatories of the Machakos District Primary Schools Activities Association account are the District Education Officer, Mr. W.W. Wanjau; a parent in Machakos Primary School, Mr. B.K. Katiku and the Kenya National Union of Teachers Executive Secretary, Machakos Brank, Mr. P.M. Kavisi. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while I thank, the Assistant Mini¬ster for Education for that reply, I do not quite agree withthe figures he has given the House; he did not do thorough research. I am saying this because the money collected in Machakos District for school activities in 1988, 1989 and 1990 does not amount to'the total he has mentioned. This money is collected per class, and in 1988 there were over 10,000 classes in all primary schools in Machakos District. The chargeable amount was KShs.180/- per class. If you multiply that alone, it does not amount to the figure the Assistant Minister has given here. In 1989 there were over 12,000 classes</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon. Wambua. What is your questio?was this money audited? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member may thinkthat when students are asked to pay money, all of them do so. That may notbe the case. Sometimes, headmasters have problems collecting this money.we cannot, therefore, assume that so much money was collected from everyclass. Sometimes there is cash ortfall and I believe that that is WHAThappened. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.WAMBUA: Sir, I disagree with the Assistant Minister's reply. Collection of this money is not done in a proper manner because it is presented to the headmaster by parents for onward transmission to APSI'S and to the district education officer. The Assistant Minister should also know that receipts are not issued for the money so collected since it is public funds. Has the Assistant Minister established why receipts are not issued? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the hon. Member is demanding that there should be receipts for this aoney, then it is a matter that we can look into. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR..MATE: The Assistant Minister talked of over-expenditure and deficits. Now, where they did they get money to spend since they had collected less than what was spent? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: District education boards always have some money and if schools have not been able to raise all the money required for various activities, that money can be directed to that direction. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATE: we know there are specific votes for district education offices and district education boards. Can he tell us where this money was actually got from? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: I have already answered that question. I said that the	 shortfall was met by the district education board. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GODANA: The hon. Questioner has alleged that proper receipts were not issued when these funds were collected and the Assistant Minister in his reply put conditions to the effect "If the hon. Member wants the receipts ...." Can the Assistant Minister confirm now that proper receipts were actually issued for the money so collected? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: If the school committee decided that each studen should bay, say, Xshs.10.00, we do not give receipts to every studentyjj who pays that money. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: On a point of order, Sir. I am not asking for a receipt for individual students, but for all the money paid to the headmaster for onward transmission to APSI. When APSI takes this money to the district education officer, a receipt should also be issued. Why was that not done? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: If the hon. Member is talking about headmasters being given receipts by APSI's which in turn should be given receipts for the money so presented  to the district education officers, then we will look into that. If receipts are not given, the teachers accounts for the money collected from every class and the money is banked. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Karauri, do you realise that hon. C-odana is asking for commitment in this regard. This is a serious matter on public accountability. Can you be explicit? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Sir, I understood the question properly and that is why I have said that we will look into that matter. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKAU: Can the Assistant Minister confirm tha collection these funds has been going on without receipts being issued? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: I suspect that receipts were not being issued for collected funds in Machakos District and that is why I have said that we axe going to look into this matter. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to smile over this matter which is very serious and which is affecting schools all over Kenya? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Sir, I do not have to cry to be seen to be serious.With all seriousness, we will ensure that receipts are issued in the future. MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Next Question. </Newspeech>	Question No. 490<header> Slaughter House for Sololo Township</header> MR. GOBAITA asked the Minister for Local Governmentthat since there is no slaughter house in Sololo Township, what plans he has to provide this vital facility.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERIiMKNT (Mr. wagura) : Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Ministry has approved Kshs.30,000.00 for the construction of a slaughter house at Sololo Township. The construction can start any time1now since the funds are available. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GODANA: While thanking the Assistant Minister for that reply, can he tell us when the work will start and when it will be completed? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

MOHAMED: Can the Assistant Minister tell the type of slaughter house a sum of Kshs.30,000.00 can construct? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Kshs.30,000.00 is a lot of money in respect of this  particular county council. MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Next Question. </Newspeech> Question No. 473<header>Pollution Control in Ithanji Dam</header> MR. MWAURA asked the Minister for Environment and Katural resources that since the water of Ithanji Dam in Tigoni Location is being used for domestic consumption and realising that the dam is polluted to a dangerous level, what urgent measures is he Ministry taking to control and prevent further pollution of this dam.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES(Mr. Hemed): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Pollution of water and, indeed, the general environmental degradation in the Republic is a matter of great concern to my Ministry. The pollution of water of Ithanji Dam in Tigoni Location is, therefore, no exception and hence urgent action is necessary. Immediately the Ministry's attention was drawn to the problem, a request was made to the Ministries  with legal instruments requiring them to invoke the appropriate sections of the law in taking action against th9 companies, firms and individuals involved in polluting the dam.The Ministries involved are Water Development under the Water Act; Health under the Public Health Act, Local Government  under the Limuru Town Council.By-Laws .and.Industry My Ministry has no legal instruments at the moment to enforce environment control.The hon. Member should be congratulated for bringing this matter to my Ministry's attention which is of vital importance to the well-being of wananchi in Limuru. The Limuru Environment Committee of which he is a member and the others around the country should remain vigilant to assist my Ministry in matters of environment protection and development. </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. MWAURA: Mr.. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while thankin the Assistant Minister for that reply, would he tell the House what the  Ministries with legal authority have done since he passed, on the matter to them? </Newspeech>MR. SAID-HEMED: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we only advised the Ministries - through a communication - on 8th October, 1990 and they are in the process of taking the necessary action.MR. GALGALLO: Arising from the reply by the AssistantMinister Pollution of rivers by effluents from factories isvery rampant in this country.we have raised this issue in this House several times in the past. What steps is the Ministry taking to ensure that the people of this country live in an environment that is free of pollution?<Newspeech>MR. SAID-HEMED: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, my Ministry, at the moment, is quite powerless. There is no law that we can use to implement these matters, The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources is currently operating without any legal instruments  to control and enforce measures on the environment. To perform this function, therefore, the Ministry is dependent upon other Ministries with legal instruments such as the Public Health Act, the Water Act and the Local Government By-laws and Industrial Legislation. These are considered inadequate and therefore action is under way to make the Ministry self-sufficient in terms of enforcement of law. A Paper has been sent to the Government and once it is approved it will be brought here for enactment. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to talk about a "Paper" here? Could he tell us whether they have  drafted a  Bill to be Tabled in this House for enactment in order to give then power to deal with pollution in the country? I say this because a Paper, cannot enable them to do anything. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SAID-HEMED: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we will Table a Bill here soon. The draft Bill is now being studied by the relevant Government Ministries and once it is approved it will be brought here for enactment. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GALGALLO: On a point ox order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. In 1988 we asked this Ministry to bring a Bill here for enactment to	give them powers to control pollution in this country. Doeshe now agree with me that is out of negligence on their part that they have not been able to Table such a Bill until now? what is the name of that Bill they propose to bring to the House for enactment? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SAID-HEMED: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we should not look at the past; we should look at the future. we as a Ministry are determined to control pollution in this country. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: I do appreciate the problem the Ministry is currently facing. Is the Ministry proposing to Table a Bill in this House? V7e are ready to pass that Bill to become a law to empower the Ministry to deal with pollution in this country. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Kubo's QUESTION. </Newspeech> Question No. 403 <header>Provision of Television Reception In laveta</header> MR. BIDU, on behalf of Mr. Kubo, asked the Minister for Information and Broadcasting in view of the fact that Taveta Division is now served by electricity and that television receiption is not provided for, what steps the Ministry is taking to enable Taveta residents watch the K.B.C. television.<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING- (Mr. Kanyi) : Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.It is not true that Taveta Division is not provided  with television receiption. However, the television signals transmitted from Mazeras to Taveta and its environs are weak.My Ministry is well aware that most rural parts of Kenya receive either poor television signals or none at all. The Kenya Broadcasting Corporation has already undertaken a study aimed at  providing total and effective television coverage for Kenya. This will be implemented as soon as funds are available. The Government ana the K.B.C. will continue to seek the necessary funds for the modernisation of television receiption or upgrading the servicing of the existing equipment. when this is done television viewers in  Taveta Division and many other rural areas will be able to have better television receiption. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister is telling us that he is looking for funds so as to modernise television receiption in the country. Could he go further and tell us how far he has gone in this matter because the situation is pathetic in the rural areas where people are unable to watch K.B.C. Television? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KANYI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say here that television services are very expensive to run. At present the K.B.C. has embarked on the improvement of radio reception countrywide. There are no funds at present to enable the K.B.C. to embark on television reception improvement at the same time. However, after completing the radio reception improvement, and when funds become available, television reception will be improved. This will enable residents of Taveta Division to watch K.B.C. television programmes more clearly</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, while thanking theMinister for his reply He has used the expression "when fundsbecome available". That is the language they are fond of using. When will that money be available? Can he tell us the financial year when money will become available? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KANYI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the current Financial Year is taking care of radio network. As soon as we are through with that programme, which is a very, very involving programme and which will cost the Kenya Government about KShs.2.4 billion, we shall then look into the television network. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Minister in order to just make general statements, as if he is not in command of his Ministry? He should be specific and tell us what time he expects to take for the radio and television network to be completed and his budgetary proposals for the same. Being in command of the Ministry, he should have all the relevant information at his fingertips. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KANYI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the tenders have been invited for the radio networks. It is estimated that that work may take up to two or three years. It is only after that work has been completed that the Ministry will embark on the television network. </Newspeech>Question No. 506 Registration of a Kenyan Student in the U.S.S.R:MR.

Allocation of Commercial Plots in Kinango and Msambweni TownshipsAllocation of Commercial Plots in Kinango and Msambweni Townships</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Local Government the following Question by Private Notice.(a)	When were the commercial plots in Msambweni and Kinango Townships advertised and allocated?(b)	Could the Minister provide a list of all the people, allocated these plots referred to in cart (a) above? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is there nobody from the Ministry of LocalGovernment? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. There is an Assistant Minister from that Ministry here, hon. Wagura: just seated. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Wagura): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for the Assistant Minister to just sit down when you were calling on  him to stand up and reply to the Question?	Is it not in order forhim, before he replies, to apologise? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Wagura): Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was looking for the written reply to the Question. With your permission, now, I will proceed and reply to hon. Mwamzandi's Question. (a) The Kwale County Council has never advertised plots forallocation in Kinango and Msambweni Townships. In Msambweni Township, theland is privately owned and intended use of such plots is made on a private .basis. Therefore, the only role the Council played in this area was theissuance of licences for the business being carried out by individual's.((b) In Kinango the Township is expanding but whenever thereis a proposal for expansion, we approach the clans. There are two clansthere; namely, the Mayota and Namakala. Those clans are normally approachedwhen there are proposals for the extension of the town. The Council has no powers to allocate any plots. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has said that the plots were not advertised and that, further, there are no business plots in that area. Could he confirm or deny the fact that the land previously owned by the Associated Sugar Company have already been allocated to friends of the officials, of the Council? If the answer is in the affirmative, could he nullify that allocation immediately? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, what I know is that we have a ten-acre plot which is next to Kinango Police Station. However, this plot has not been allocated to anybody. If any plots have been allocated to any¬body, then that exercise is null and void. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has been misled. Plots in that Township have already been allocated. The only assurance he can give us is that he will abide by his promise that the allocation will be nullified. The local people will thank him for that. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is that a question, really? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, what I said is that we are not aware of any plot allocation. However, if we find out that some people have been allocated plots, which has not gone through the proper allocation system, the exercise will be nullified. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to know what allocation procedures the Ministry follows in townships. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, recently the Ministry sent out circulars to all local authorities showing them that a proper procedure must be followed on the allocation of plots. Sc, I do not expect any local authority working by any other procedure than what we circulated to them. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GALGALLO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Mwamzandi hasrepeatedly stated that plots in those two areas have been allocated toindividuals. The Assistant Minister, on the other hand, is denying any.such knowledge of the possibility of the plots having been allocated. Can we get an assurance from the Ministry that should any such exercise have been carried out in those areas, there will be an immediate nullification? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the assurance has already been given that no such allocation has been carried out in those two areas. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, going by the reply that the Ministry has given here, it appears there were no efforts made to find out the true position of the plots in question. Could the Assistant Minister give an undertaking he is going to investigate the matter so that he can return to the House with proper information? He should carry out such investigations so that, if he establishes the truth of whit. I am telling him, he should nullify that allocation. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I said before, In Msambweni we have no plots at all, not even for utilities, schools and such institutions. That is why I said that we have 10 acres under a certain sugar company which has not been resolved as to whether it should belong to Kwale County Council. As I said earlier, if there are some plots which have been allocated without authority, they will be nullified. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister appears to have misled. In Msambwenijust near the Msambweni Police Station, there are plots there which he is denying knowledge of.. I think he has been completely misled through the replies he has been given. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Speaker. Sir, I have said that if those plots have been allocated the exercise will be cancelled we will not allow some people to take land as they wish. </Newspeech>Frequent Water Shortage in Mbirikani Area<Newspeech>MR. KILIKU Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Water Development the following Question by Private Notice.What urgent steps is the Ministry taking to find a solution to the frequent water shortages in Mbirikani area of Changamwe Constituency? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DSVELOBEENT (Mr. Mwita): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.My Ministry is in the process of replacing the two-inchpipe which supplies water to Mbirikani area with a four-inchpipe. The bigger pipey whose work will be completed within a month from now is expected to solve the water shortage problems of the area. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

First I want to thank the Government for supplying food to my area where it is in short supply However would like to ask the Government to supply more food to Embogut and kerio Valley.Secondly, I would like to ask the Attorney-General to intervene in land cases in my area which have taken to court contrary to the President's directive that land cases be heard by elders. As a result, wananchi are suffering because they do not have money to pay advocates and fare to and from the courts. I want the Attorney-General to ensure the President's directive is followed by having these cases taken back to elders. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Kipkorir.

DEPUTY SPEAKER; Mr. Kiliku, I thought the Chair was explicit in this matter. To enbale the hon. Attorney-General to properly address his mind to the issues hon. Kipkorir was  attempting to raise, I was only advising hon. Kipkorir to put substantive questions addressing specific land cases in which apparently justice nary not have done, or may not have been seen to be done, in his constituency, or elsewhere, so that the Attorney- General may, at least, have the matter clear in his mind before he can come to respond. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  arap CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR.

Members have seen from their copies of 19,90/91 of Development Expenditure, the gross expenditure for my Ministry will be K£63,537,375, which will include Appropriations-in-Aid of K£40,464,375.   The net expenditure under Vote 20 is therefore K£23,073,000. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  CHEPKOK:  On a point of order,  Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir. Could the Minister be asked to  speak closer to the Microphone so that we can hear what he  wants to  say? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT  (Mr.  Okwanyo): Mr.  Deputy Speaker,Sir,  the net  expenditure under Vote  20 is  therefore K£123,073,000 The estimates of the recurrent expenditure are on page 625 to 643 and the gross  expenditure amounts to  K£23,714,963 which includes Appropriations-in-Aid of K£12,483,875. The net requirement under Vote 20 is therefore K£121,231,090. Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I am therefore  seeking approval of this House for the overall  expenditure of   K£87,252,340 to enable my Ministry to to meet  the cost  of development and recurrent expenditures during the 1990/91  financial year.  As hon. Members are aware,  water is one of our most important  resources. Our daily activities,  whether at home,  in industries, in agriculture,  in livestock development  or in the construction industry,  depend to  a large  extent on the availability of water.  Water should therefore be adequatel,   supplied for our  survival.  Indeed,  water is a vital  ingredience that cannot be foregone in order to meet other needs. Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  my Ministry has been  given important responsibility of providing good quality water throughout  the Republic. We have  endeavoured to  supply this commodity to both rural  and urban areas aiming to ensure that everybody has had access to water within a reasonable distance. At  independence,  we  started with very few water programmes but today,  Kenya has many water projects and programmes of all  sizes in various. parts of the country. It  is our declared commitment to provide water to wananchi in an exhautive inventory of all  the  water supplies Projects and programmes. Has been done  to ensure that the eventual achievements of desired goal of provision of water to all  the sector of the economy. Large, mediumand small water  schemes,  boreholes and so on,  have  indeed visibly increasedour  source  of water  since Kenya became independent.Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  water must be treated from allother natural resources because it  is important,  not only to human lives  but also for agriculture,  livestock and industrial  development. It  should thereforebe  zealously guarded against wastage, vandalism and loss. We need to make maximumuse of the existing facilities of water and conserve as much of it as possible, and expand the existing water projects, Unfortunately,  artificial Shortages have been caused by vandalism as was recently done in   Karai, Kirigiti,            in Kiambu last week.  Whereas, my Ministry will do its best towards the provision of water,  my appeal  to hon. Members is for them to condemn vandalism whenever they hold barazas in their prospective constituencies. Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  a while Kenya is not endowed with ambundant water resources,  we have to meet the needs of the country. His Excellency the President has entrusted my Ministry with this gigantic responsibility of delivering water to the nation  and we  shall endeavour to exel in this task. In our endeavour to supply water to all wananchi we have learned a lot. We have for instance,  learnt  that  we limited funds and lack of qualified personnel to contend with and therefore, we cannot plan and implement projects  successfully. We have been faced with a problem of inadequate maitenance team in the already existing projects. However,  we have realised first priority Should be given to the people. While pursuing  the idea of clean water throughout  the country,  we realize that many people in the rural  areas still continue to trek for miles in  such of untreated water from river,  dams,  lakes and springs. Indeed people would be happier to have the  same water nearer to  their home than to trek for long distances for hours,  which would be spent in their welfare and social activities.[Mr.  Deputy Speakerleft the Chair ][The  Temporary Deputy  Speaker  (Mr. Wabuge)  took the  Chair]With this realisation,  I am seeking authority to spend  the  indicated development funds  in  the Development Vote  on various programmes, including feasibility studies, planning and designing of water projects -  £1,805,475;  construction  of water supply  in  both rural  and urban areas - £19,788,983; construction of sewagesystems -  £30,000;  surface  and ground  investigation and pollution control -£2,999,250;  water  conservation  and am construction  - £2,385,000;  and  training of water  development staff - £430,000. Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  the  provision of the  Development Fund also-includes  £33,637,167, which will  be  spent by the  National Water Conservation and._ Pipeline  Corporation. This  Corporation became  fully  operational  on 1st  July, 1989.Prior  to  the  establishment of the Corporation in 1989,  the  Ministry  of WaterDevelopment was  the water undertaker for all projects,  some of which are nowbeing  extended,  operated and managed by the Corporation./Mr.  Deputy Speaker left  the  Chair//The  Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr.Wabuge) took  the  Chair/From  its  inception,  the Corporation adopted the  integrated developmentapproach  in  supply  and conservation of water resources. The  first  step  in  thisdirection was  to  carry  out  road  investments,  studies of dams  and large pipelines,medium-size water  supplies  in  both  urban and rural areas. Secondly,  theCorporation addressed itself to the  issue of financial management and effective operation and maintenance. Indeed,  the  establishment of the  Corporation has certainly  strengthened my Ministry  in its  effort to provide potable water to. wananchi  in  our beloved Republic. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  Kenya is not endowed with abudant water. Sources  of water must,  therefore,  be keenly  explored and protected againstpollution. Hon.  Members will  notice  that there  is a provision of £2.999,250  forsurface  and ground water exploration under Budgetary Head 893. From  the  sameallocation,  some  money will be  spent on the National Water Quality  and Monitoring Programme. The  ground water  resources  development  in  the  country started  in 1927when  the  first borehole was  drilled  in  Nairobi. To  date,  approximately 8,000 boreholes  have  been  drilled at  an average  of 200 boreholes  per year  by  the  30 or  so  licensed borehole contractors,  including  the Ministry of Water Development itself. Water  is  needed  in  virtually  all  human  endeavour.  Sources  of water supply  must,  therefore,  be  identified  in  the  initial  stages  of  any  planning  for development. Surface  water  is  another  source  which  is  widely used  throughout  theRepublic. It must,  therefore,  be  protected  against  drying up. This  source  isalready  threatened by  the  prevalent  soil erosion,  I discriminate cutting down of  trees  and  continous  activities  of uncovering  the  land surface,  as well as poor road  drainage  and  poor  cultivation  pricatices,  all  of which  tend  to  cause  our water  catchment  areas  to hold  less  and  less  water. In  order  to regulate  the  extraction of water  from  the  five catchment areas  in  the  country,  the Ministry  will  continue  to make  use  of  the  catchment boards which  make  their  recommendations  to  the  Water Apportionment Board. It  isimportant  for hon.  Members  to  know  the  five  catchment  areas. These  are  LakeVictoria  Catchment. This  comprises  the  entire  catchment which  drains  into  Lake Victoria  via numerous  rivers  and  streams. Some  of  these  rivers  are  Yala,  Kuja and  Nzoia  -  Rift Valley  Catchment -  This  covers  the  closed  drainages  which discharge  into all  the big and small  lakes  in Rift Valley -  Athi  River CatchmentThis  catchment drains  the  southern slopes  of the  Aberdares  and the wastern side of Rift Valley and  discharges  into the  Indian Ocean - Tana  River Catchment -This  catchment drains  the  eastern slopes  of the  Aberdares Range,  the  southern slopes  of Mt.  Kenya and water  flows  into  the  Indian Ocean -  Ewaso  Nyiro Catchment -Its  wates  originate-from  the northern slopes  of the  Aberdares Range  and Mt.  Kennya, as  well  as  lesser mountain masses or uplands  in  the north and north-east. The waters  flow  to  the  Lorian Swamp and other depressions which mark their normal downstream extent. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  before the construction of any project  is there  is  need to  do feasibility  studies,  planning and design.  The  population  to  be  serve must  be  known,  the  source  and  quality  of water  must  identified  and the  topography  of the  area  the  project will be  constructed  in must be  studied. Armed with  this  information,  it  is  easier  to  plan  and  design aproject  suitable  for  a given  area. The  Ministry,  therefore,  intends  to  spend£1,805,475  for  this  purpose. My Ministry  intends  to  spend  £19,788,983  for  the  construction  of water  supplies  in  rural  and urban  centres.  It  also  intends  to  spend  a  further sum of  £30,000  in  the  construction  of sewerage  systems. Training plays an  important role  in  the  improvement of personnel. skills  in  the  country. It  is  for  this  reason  that  the  Kenya Water  Institute  wasstarted.It  provides  local  training  for  technical  and  craft  apprentice  courses.My  Ministry  would  like  to  spend  £430,000  towards  expanding and improving training facilities  in  the  Kenya Water  Institute. Although  the  Ministry has  done  a lot  towards  the provision of water to  wananchi  in  this  country,  a  lot  still  remains  to be  done. Apart  from financial  limitations  in our effort  to provide  this  vital  commodity,  there  is the  man—made  problem of polluting the  existing resources. In  addition  to  the throwing of garbage  into rivers,  lakes  and other  water sources,  there  is an immense  problem of  industrial  effluent being carelessly  discharged by  some industries. There  is  need,  therefore,  to protect  our  water  resources  frompollution.   This calls for   effective   management   of   effluent   which   originatesfrom   industries, urban   and   agricultural areas   and   discharges intosurface   or   ground   water  courses. In   order   to   control   pollution,therefore, no industry   should   be   allowed   to   becomeoperational ifwaste   water treatment   facilities are not   provided. All the sewerageworks for either industrial   or   domestic   wastes should   be   welloperated   or   maintained.Having   discussed   the expenditure under development   vote - D 20,I  now   wish to  turn   to   the recurrent vote - R 20.In   this respect, I   am   seeking   authority from   this House tospend   K£23,714,965-00   on   recurrent expenditure of   my   Ministry. Fromthis   amount,   K£17,294,812-00  which  is  73  per   cent   of   the   allocation, will   be spent   on   personnel   costs. The   balance,  which   constitutes27 per   cent is for   operational   expenses under   the   various   budgetaryheads.Mr. Deputy   Speaker, leaving   aside the   cost   of implementation  of   water   projects, the   operation   and   maintenance of   such facilitiesare very   expensive.It   costs a lot   of   money   to   buy spares   and  machinery. It  is therefore, my   considered   opinion, that   communityparticipation in   the   running   of   water supplies   be   considered. Itis   no longer   possible for the Government to maintain these watersupplies   without involving the   community in   cost-sharing. Thiswill   encourage them   to   care   more for such installations as theirown   properties.In the connection, I   would like to   use   this forum   tourge hon. Members to   ask their   constituents to   clear their   waterbills.  promptly. Obviously Mr. Deputy   Speaker,Sir, one   cannot   eat/ones   cake   and still   have it. Another   cake   must  be  baked if   thefirst  one  tasted  sweet. Similarly, water  bills  must be  settled to  enable  the  Ministry  to  operate  and  maintain  steadily  the  flow of  piped  water.  Chemicals,   fuels  and  electricity  are  indispensible in  the production  of  water  and  operation  and  also  maintenance  of any  water  supply. The  cost  of  this  input  can  only be  met  ifwananchi  pay  their  water  bills  without  delay. As  hon. Members.have  already  noted  from  the  printed  estimates  of  the recurrent  expenditure,  the  Ministry is  expected  to  finance  some  of  its  expenditure  through  the  appropriatiors-in-aid. This  is  the  moneywe  are  supposed  to  collect  from  water  consumers. Unfortunatelv,the  number  of  defaulters  for  water  consumers  is  very  high  indeed. In  this  connection,   I  have  decided  and, indeed  I  have  instructed, my  officers  to  disconnect  all  the  defaulting  consumers. Mr.Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,   one  of  the  main  obstacles  in the Ministry's  operation  and  maintenance  of  water supplies  is  the  use of  inappropriate  technological  equipment  some  of  which are complicated and expensive. With this  in  mind, we  have  started  a  research  division aimed at coming out with a solution on how to solve this problem. There  is  a  need to  use  simple,   inexpensive  jet  efficient  technologies for  we  still  need  to  cover  vast  areas  to meet this  demand  for  clean drinking  water. We cannot afford  to adopt whatever  is  in  the  market without first examining the prevailing  conditions. The  Research Division  is,   therefore,  expected to come up with  a  solution  on  how  to  provide  low-cost water  supply  systems  in view of the  fact  that  funds  available  for water development are not adequate.In  this connection,  I  have  in mind harvesting of rain water through  the roof catchment, wells,  hand  pumps and gravity-flow system that can be  implemented with community participation, thereby,  supplementing Government  efforts. The  Research Division is  also  expected to  explore  whether  the  Ministry  should  utilise  jua  kali  industry in  fabricating  some  of  the  spares  and  parts  that have hitherto  been  ordered  from abroad. With the  authority  of  the  House, the  Research Division will  spend  K£172,360 during  the 1990/91  Financial  Year  under  the  relevant Vote. Mr.Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  as  I  mentioned  earlier,  my  Ministry is  entrusted  with  the  great  task  or responsibility  of providing water  to  the  wananchi  in  this  country. In doing so,  various  guidelines  must be  followed  as  laiddown  by  the Government. The  development  of  any  water  project  in  the  country must,therefore,  be  in  conformity  with what-has  been  agreed  upon  by  the  district  development committee. I  have,  therefore,  directed my  district water engineers  to  atten district  development  committee  meetings  personally  and  give  guidelines  on  matters related  to  water projects. They  should  give  guidelines  on how best  to plan,design  and  implement water  projects. A  well  planned water project  should  includethe  full  community  in  the  service area. Community  involvement  is  necessary  toavoid  problems  found  in operation  and  maintenance  of  some  of  the  water  projects in  some  parts  of our  country. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  having outlined  in detail  the  intended actitities  of my  Ministry during the  1990/91  Financial  Year,  it  is  my  hope  that this  House  will  approve  the expenditure of K£87,252,340 on both Current and Development Estimate's  for  the same year. In  conclusion,  Sir,   I  wish  to  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  all  those donor  countries whose governments have generously donated funds towards water development  in this  country. Most of  these  funds have been in the form of grantsto  the Government. This  is  highly  appreciated,  and we  say a big thank you tothem  all. Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  may  I  also pay  tribute  to the officers of my  Ministry  in  whom  I  have great faith as  they have demonstrated  that theyare  capable  of achieving the targets that have been set by  the Government.  I would  also like to pay tribute  to His Excellency  the President  for his  continued. interest,  support  and guidance  in  our endeavours  to  provide clean water to all Kenyans. I  believe  that as we continue  to  be guided  by  the Nyayo philosophy of peace,  love and unity; and with  the support of this House , my  Ministry will  play its  parts  in  improving the qualify  of  life by  improving the  quality of water in this  country  and  by  providing wananchi  with enough  water  all  the  time.  With  those  few remarks,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I  now beg to  move. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE  TEMPORARY  DEPUTY  SPEAKER (Mr.  Wabuge): Yes,  Mr.  Ngei. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  MINISTER FOR MANPOWER  DEVELOPMENT AND  EMPLOYMENT (Mr.  Ngei): Mr. Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  MINISTER  FOR  WATER  DEVELOPMENT (Mr.  Okwanyo): Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I would have wished  that hon.

In  any  case,  I  am sure that we are all going to havean opportunity  to  say  something about this very important Motion that I stand to  second. Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I  will have very  few things  to say about  this  very  important Ministry.  The  first one  is  to make  a statement about what  the Ministry has  been doing over the last one or two years.   We must first accept  that  hon  Okwanyo  and his  team,  headed  by  the Permanent Secretary,  have been going  all  over the country over the last few months trying to exactly determine  the problems  in every  corner.    - - Previously,  this Ministry had inefficient staff who were not workingin accordance with the Nyayo philosophy. Because  of the recent visit by theMinister for Water Development   and his team, quite  a few improvements havebeen noticed and we must congratulate  them for that. Water is very importantand this Ministry must be given support by every peace  loving Kenyan. Wateris life and if a proposal was put to me that we stop other development projects in one financial year so that we give all  the available money to the Ministry of Water Development,  I would answer in the affirmative. Water is the key to all aspects of development. For example,  we must have water for the sustainance of our  lives,  for  our livestock,  for  agriculture,  industry and so on Apart from giving a few suggestions to the Minister and his team,I think this is a vote.. which we must approve without much problems. We knowthat  the national cake is very small and that we must share it equally,but I  think that  it is important for every district and divisional  headquarters to have clean water for home consumption and for other development activities.  It  is important for the Ministry to move in immediately and supply water to those areas that do not have constant water supply. If this is not done,  developmentin the country will not be even. This is because there  is no investor who will put his money in any district headquarters or otherwise if there is no guarantee of constant  supply of water. We must  also bear in mind that  the Minister is operating within given cealing. Be  does not have a free hand to start water projects all overthe  country. He has to go by priority and I think when proposals are beingmade  to this Ministry, DDCs must understand that the Minister has a limited budget and he  must be guided properly about such priorities in order to avoid disappointment.    I  would also like  to  take this opportunity to comment on the  speech made by the President  on Kenyaita Day. Kenyans must accept the fact  that they have a devoted father in the name of His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi. The People I  talked to and I were very proud with regard to  the stance taken by our father of the nation in   respect of two particular issues  that he touched on on that day;  namely,  interference by foreigners in the  internal affairs of this country and  the question of refugees.  The President has  often said that he will not compromise or negotiate  the dignity and the  security of the people of Kenya. He  stood firmon that particular  issue. I am not referring to any particular country, butto all  foreigners either  from within or  from without. These People  shouldtake  the Presidential message  clearly, and if we have to invite suggestions on any issues,  we will do so at our time. I  am sure  all Kenyans were very happy with the sentiments expressed by the President. On the question of refugees,  I  would like  to say that the directive made by the President was timely because many people seem to have  taken Kenya ns for granted. We have  treated outsiders very well and Kenya has hosted many international meetings;  we have allowed refugees into this country, we have given them food and jobs. We  have done all this in the spiritof being mindful of the welfare of other people. These people have takenthis  treatment to be a right and we must support the President’s directive to the  effect  that all refugees should be repatriated to  theirland. The  facilities currently being used by these refugees should be reserved for  the people of this country. This is because we cannot go onlooking after people who are not grateful to the President and the people this country. - ::,   7: 7      ,',                   .

Speaker,  Sir, forallowing me  to  speak  on this Motion. Yesterday Kangundo waselevated to the  status  of  a Town Council. I thank hon.  Mbori,  theAssistant Minister for Local Government  and Mr. Watere  and Mr. Mwan.govya for sitting for hours at Tala to listen to us. We  arevery grateful that we have been promoted. Kangundo TownCouncil will come  into  being very  soon. Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I would like  to congratulate  His-Excellency the President  for  the  work he us  done for us with the  help  of the  Italian Government.  I  am referring to the  Nol Turesh Water Project which is  supplying water to Kajiado, Athi River Township,  Kona and  Machakos towns. I would also like to thank the  Minister  for  Water Development  for  the  good work done by his Ministry. We  are very grateful to His Excellency the President  for all this  work. Mr.Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  we would like  Kangundo to be  supplied with water  from this Project. Kangundo  is only about 17  miles  from the  main pipeline  and  I would like  the people  of Kangundo to  be  allowed to taste  this  water from Mount  Kilimanjaro. Mr.Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have a beautiful dams in Kathiani. I was  asked by the President,  when I was Minister for  Water Development,  to  construct this  dam  which has a total capacity  of 196  million cubic  metres  of water.   The  dam can hold a lot  of water. These  dam   supplies water  to Kathaana,  Syathani,_andmany  other places. We  are  grateful that  the Minister went  to  seethis dam which has provided water to to KathiianiHospital too.       - .7.7277.  - So,  M r. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  you can see that we have  a lot  of water in Kangundo Constituency. There  is  alsoanother dam which is being constructed by a French Companyacross Athi  and  Juja Rivers. Tala and Kangundo towns are  onlyabout 12  miles  away  from that dam. The water  from that dam shouldbe  supplied to Matuu Farmers Co-operative Society and to Talaand Kangundo.We  have  another water  scheme  which was discarded. This isthe  Donyo  Sabuk Water  Scheme. We would like that  scheme to berehabilitated. I am asking the  Minister  for Water Development tolook into this matter. We  also have many boreholes  in Kangundo area;   Another dam should be  constructed across Kathithya Maa River which is  a very big river. The  Ministry  should  construct that  dam in order to  supply Kangundo  and Tala townships with  sufficient water. We  have 46 boreholes  in my area which are capable  ofproducing about 3,500  gallons  of water per hour. That  is quite alot  of water.We  also want  electricity. I would like  to  congratulatethe  Minister for Energy  for  supplying us with electricity. Thereis  electricity  everywhere  in Kangundo  Constituency. We  thereforewant  these  boreholes to be  electrified  so that  they can serve  us more  efficiently. Kathiiani  Dam supplies water to Kakuyuni,  Mwala,Kawethei  and  so  on. I want the Minister   to provide  us withelectrical equipment  to  enable  us  to  pump  water  from these  boreholes.  I urge hon. Members  of Parliament  to  come  to Kangundo and donate KShs.200/- each which will go towards the construction  of these water projects.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir, we  need this money to enable us to purchase_ equipment that will enable us topump water from these  boreholes. We  are  also  getting a lot  of,rain water in that  area.  We  also want  industries and  residential homes  to be established in Kangundo. It  takes  one hour to  drive  from Nairobi to Machakos; it  also  takes  one hour to drive  from Nairobi to Thika. But  it  takes  only 30 minutes to drive  from Nairobito Tala Town.   We have  a lot  of land there which can be put to user   We want  our area to develop fast.  Members of Parliament should  build homes  in Kangundo  and Tala.  I request  hon. Mwenje who  is  my friend to come  and build a home in Kangundo.  This is  a great and important  matter. I want people  to build homes  and  start living in Kangundo because  it  is  only 30 minutes drive  from Nairobi. You can work in Nairobi  and sleep in Kangundo. Why  do you have  to travel all the  way from Nairobi to Machakos  and Thika when. Kangundo is  so near? __-Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir, I  am  appealing  to  hon.  Membersto  support this  Motion. Let them  also  take  time  and  come to  my  KangundoConstituency  during  public  rallies  and  going around  to  see the  developments in  the  area. I  would be  very  happy   to  have  hon.  Members  coming  thee  and  I am  sure  hon.  Nassir,  who has  been wanting  to  come  to  visit Kangundo, will  do that. All  hon.  Members  are  welcome. I  would  like  Kangundo  Constituency  to go  up  in  a big  way  like  Nairobi  is  coming up. With  those  few  remarks,   I  beg  to  support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  SOI:  Thank  you  very  much, Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir, for  giving  me  this  chance  to  say  a  few  things  on  the Motion  on  the  Ministry of  Water  Development.  I  have  two  divisions  in  Chepalungu Constituency  and in  1989  I  put a Question  in  this  House  concerning  the  rehabilitation  of  the Chepalungu  Water Scheme,  which was  commissioned  in  1975  but  later on  just  left to  lie  idle. Chepalungu  is  a  place  with a  lot  of dairy  cows  but  it  is  notcovered  by  streams. People  have  to  walk many miles  to get water  for consumption. The  biggest  problem  is  that  there  was  a water supply,  which was  lateron  neglected. Sir,  when  I  put  the Question  in  1989,   the  reply  was  to  the  effect that  the  rehabilitation of Chepalungu Water Scheme would  be carried out  in the  forthcoming  Budgetary allocation.  That  time  has  already  come but  nothinghas  been  done. When  I  got  that  reply  from  the  Minister,  I  respected  him  andexpected  the development  to  take  place  as  promised. I  now  call  upon  him  tomake  reference  to  that promise  in  his  reply  to  the  Motion. It  is  importantfor  the  Minister  to  note  that  there  is  only  one  engine  when  they  used  to be two  engines. The  single  engine  is  pumping water  from  the  Nyangaresi  River but,  when  it  recently  rained,  the dam where  the engine  is was  spoiled  and I  call  upon  the  Ministry  to  look  into  that that  is  an  emergency  case.  There  is  another  division  called Sigor  and water development  .   '     ..   'projects  are going on  there. I  went around there  last week and  found outthat  water  could  be pumped  but  that  the  officers  there had not been given an  "OK"  to  spend  the  money they  had  to start pumping  the water. They  are waiting  for approval  for  the  expenditure and  so  that they  can  install their meters  to  show  how  much water  is  being used by  the  individual  users. I  call upon  the  Minister  to  instruct his  officers  to do what is possible to connect the  supply  of water  to  the  homes of  the users. There  is  another pending project,  namely,  the Longisa-Sigor  water Scheme. This  Scheme  was  surveyed  and completed  in 1978  but,  up  to  now,  nothinghas  been done. The  whole  of Bomet,  Sigor,  Chepalungu Divisions have  no waterSupply  by  the  Ministry. You  can  imagine  our  feelings  for  not having beenassisted to get water  supplies  since  our attainment of Independence  in  1963. I  request  that  the  Ministry does  not  forget  some  areas  whenever  they  are making district  plans. They  should  ensure  that  all  areas  are  covered,  moreespecially  the  dry areas  in  Kericho  District,  which are  in  the  south. Ithas  to  be  realised  also  that  it  is  very  difficult nowadays  to have  people agreeing  to  let you  pass  water pipes  through  their  farms  in order to draw water  from  the  rivers. I  would  also  like  to  urge  the Ministry  to  include  the schools  in their  water  programmes.  There  is  no  point developing water  projects,  say  from  a  river,   and  distributing  it  over  distances  of up  to  20  miles  while  excluding the  schools  along  such  lines. I  think  the  schools  are public  institutions and  must  be  Considered without  having  to make  requirements  for  them  to  supply the  pipes  themselves,  and  so  on. This  will  remove  the  necessity  of  teachershaving  to  send  pupils  to  the  rivers  to  collect water  for  them. That  is  acurrent  problem  and  I  hope  the  Ministry  will  now  start  addressing  itself  to the  schools'  water  requirements  whenever  there  are  water  projects  all  over the  country. The  same  could  apply  to  the  market  centres,   too.  Sir,   let me  also mention that there  are settlement schemes  in my constituency.  During. the  colonial days,  there was water in  these  settlement. schemes  but,  during  the  survey  exercises,  some  other plans were conceived which meant the  removal  of some  of  the water pipes  and  new roads were also constructed. Water schemes  are  now  required  there. I  think  there are more  than 15  settlement schemes  in ,my  constituency  and  the  survey  work has  been  completed  in  all of  them. However,  none  of  them  have  been  developed. I  am  requesting  the  Ministry  to  look into  the  question  of  providing  those  settlement  schemes with water,  as  those  are our  main  sources  of milk. If  you  go  to  any  hotel  in  Nairobi,  you  will  find  milkthat  has  come  from  the  Sotik  Milk  Factory. However,  if  such  people  do not  havewater  in  the  settlement  schemes,  the milk  supply will be  threatened. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr.Wabuge): Okay, we have  a quorum now;  continue Mr. Soi. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.SOI: Mr;  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I think Ishould mention  something about the National Water Conservation andPipeline Corporation.

MATHU:  Thank you,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir. I rise to support my colleagues in supporting the vote for the Ministry of Water Development I would like to say, first of all,  this Ministry   touches on all other Government Ministry. This is a Ministry, without which the services in the entire country, would come  to  a standstill. Therefore, it is true to say that this is a very important Ministry and the Minister should take very seriously,  the views made by hon. Members in this House regarding this particular Ministry.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  if today we had enough water in this country,  Kenyas development would move very fast. Every year,  a lot ofwater goes wasted into Lake Victoria  and causes  a lot of havocin the Kanu Plains. We hope that the Ministry is going  to tell when this wateris going  to be diverted to. Timboroa so that the whole of the Rift Valley dry areas,  would be  supplied with water from Timboroa.  This point has been raised many time in the past by hon.  Members in this House.  If today, we had a Timboroa  water Scheme, the flooding menace in the Kano Plains would disappear once andfor all  and the whole of the Rift Valley would change.   - _ _ .   Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I would like to make another point in supporting this vote.  I do not understand why certain people do not pay their water bills.  I do not understand either,  why certain parastatalsand Government departments year after year fail  to pay their water bills. While this continues to happen, you will find that  the ordinary mwananchi is normally threatened if he does not pay his water bill. These people go to his house and say,  "If you do not pay your bill we are going to disconnect the water". Often, you will  find that  these bills have been inflated and donot  record the true Position of water consumption. I would like  to  appealto the Minister to make  sure that  these bills are properly recorded. In this age  of the computer,  there  should be no  reason why an ordinary mwananchi living  a small house  should received a water bill of Shs.5,000/- or more. This problem should be solved once and for all. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I would now like to turn to  the question of investment is  Excellency the President has been encouraging foreign investors to Come to Kenya to invest here in order to help in reducing unemployment problem. However,  it is true  that we cannot  expand our industries unless we have available water. At the  Coast,  we have two major water projects. Die have  for example,  the Sabaki water Project which was started many years  ago,  but  this project does not work daring  the rainy season  Today,  even when  t here is a lot  of rain water,  there is no water in the Pipes and this is something for which the  engineers who designed the Sabaki  Water Projects,  will  remain condemned. This problem has been caused by silting in the river during the rainy season, when silt  gets into the pipes and the water cannot get to Mombasa. When you come to  the Msima Springs water Projector,  you will find that it does not supply enough water to Mombasa and we have been appealing to Government to do  something about  these two water projects,  particularly,  in  support  of tourism in this area. Those people who would like  to invest in the tourism industry,  require  enough water and it  is a shame that  a hotel can go for a week without any fresh water. So,  it is important for this Ministry to appeal to  the Treasury to give them additional funds so that they can deal with these very urgent issues. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  when investors are invited into this country,  they just do not come straightaway. They  first made a survey visit in which they go round the Kenya Coast,  Kisumu,  Nyeru,  Embu and so on to find out whether there is enough water in those places to warrant the establishment of an industry there. At the moment, due to population increase,  there is no doubt that we need more and more water. I have mention two water projects at the coast,  that  is the Msima Spring water Project and the Sabaki River water Project. I would like to say that the pipes installed in these two projects are not enough. We need a new pipeline from Msima to Mombasa because at the moment, the Mombasa population is not receiving enough water. I would also like to mention here  that we need to prevent soil erosion in this country which is at  the moment, causing  disaster in our development. Today,we are hoping  to generate power at Kindaruma. During  the  rains, a  lot of soil  is washed off into dams. So,  a  national programme  should be  organised  to  take  care of river banks  so that soil from the banks  does  not get  into rivers. If  we  do not do  this,  at  one  time  our dams  will have,  not  water,  but soil and  the millions  of shillings  that we  are spending in digging  these  dams  will  have  been  wasted. So,  it  is  very  important  for  the Ministry  to Water Development  to address  itself especially  to the  drier areas of the  country. When  you  visit  North-Eastern Province,  you  find that  the  whole  ofit  is  dry. So,  the  Ministry  should be  given sufficient  funds  to  take  care  ofsuch  areas.Finally,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  let  me  support  HisExcellency  the  President on  his  speech on Kenyatta Day. It  is  important  forKenyans  to  stand  behind  our  President. Kenya's  sovereignty  cannot  be  compromised.The  speech  that  was  delivered by  the  Head of State  on  Kenyatta Day  should  reach all  the  world. We  should  tell  our  genuine  friends  that  we  are  a  free  nation. Those  who  want  to  interfere  with us  must also know that our  President speaks for 25  million Kenyans,  and we  are behind him. Kenya  is  an  "island"  of peacein  Africa,  but  there  are  those  who go on  asking,   "Why  is  Kenya so peaceful? Weshould  now  divert  our  minds  and  try  to  subvert  this country  because  it  has  been peaceful  for  too  long now. It  is  important;  therefore,  for  all  Kenyans  to  be aware  that  we  are being made  a  target, of those  who have had problems  and who would  like  Kenya  to  join  them. We  should  tell  them that  Kenya  will  remain peaceful  because  we  will  depend  our  Independence  with  whatever  means  available. Every  Kenyan must  stand  up  to  ensure  that our royalty  to  the  President  and  to the  Party  remains our  first  and foremost objective. The  Press  should  inform  the whole  world  that  Kenyans  are  behind President Moi. (Applause)     Let  us  tell  the  British  Broadcasting Corporation,  the  Voice  of America and  RadioSouth  Africa that Kenya is  free  and all  Kenyans  are  behind His Excellency  thePresident. Let us  assure  those  who visit us  that  they will enjoy our sunshine,beaches and wildlife, but do not let them  interfere  with  our hard-won freedom.' We  have  enjoyed this  freedom  within the  last  27  years,  and we will  continue  to defend  it. Let me  end my  contribution by  requesting the Ministry of Water Development  to remember that all Kenyans,  especially those  in drier areas,  want  fresh water. The  Ministry  should  seek  more  planners who  can plan better water catchment  areas. With  those  few  remarks,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  OMINO: Thank  you,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  for givingme  an  opportunity  to  contribute  to this  debate. As  has repeated been  said,water  is  critical  in  our  lives,  our  livestock and crops. If we  had water everywherethroughout  the country, we would eliminate or,  at least,  reduce considerably waterborne  diseases. We  would also  save  a  lot of the  time spent by our womenfolkdrawing water  from rivers  to be  used  in  doing productive work. Of course,  werecognise  that women  provid6  about 60  or 70  per  cent  of the  labour  force  in theagricultural  sector  of our economy. So,  giving them water close  to  their homeswould be  a  distinct  contribution to the productivity of our country. Water  is  also a raw  material  for all  industries.  Therefore,  when industrialists  order  their raw materials,  be  it cotton or steel,  water ranks at  the  same  level  as  these raw materials. So,  water  is  critical  in ourdevelopment. When  you  look  at  the  Ministry's  Votes,  you see  that  if you takeinflation  into  consideration,  what the Ministry  is now getting is  less than what it got  10  years  ago. So,  I  would  like  to urge  the Minister to put  in a strong bid  for  additional  funding because what it is being provided with now is not enough  to  maintain  a good level  of development such that the Ministry will provide  water  to  all  homes  by  the  year 2000. This  particular year  is  adeadline  to which not  only  the  Kenya Government,  but also  the  internationalcommunity  is  committed. This  commitment  was  reached  at  a  special meeting ofthe  United  Nations  in 1979.The  Ministry  ought  to  have  a  policy  of providing each district with drilling rigs  to  enable wananchi  to drill their own boreholes. Equally,  theMinistry  ought  to have  in every  district dam construction units so  that wananchi who  want  to  construct dams may have  access  to  the  relevant equipment. There  is no  way,  given  the  best will  in  the  world,  in which the Government can on its  own provide  water  to  every  citizen  of this  Republic  by  the  year 2000. So,  all ourefforts,  as  individuals,  should  be  taken  into  account  in providing the  rightequipment and assessing the  policy of providing water by  the year 2000.Lake  Victoria  is  the  second biggest  fresh-water  lakes  in  the  world,and  it  is our  rivers  that  contribute  this  fresh  water. These  rivers  flowbecause  we  have  been  able  to  preserve  our  forests. The  Ministry  ought  to  makesure  that  this  lake  serves  Kenyans-in  the  same  ratio  is  water  is  contributed to it. There  are  agreements  that were  probably  entered  into  long before  we  became independent  and  they  ought  to  be  looked  at  critically  so  that our  interests  are first  taken  care  of. We  must  have  unqualified  rights  to  use  our rivers  init serving  our  people. This  is  why  I  was  glad  to  hear  hon.  Mahihu talk  aboutNyando  River. we  must really  make  use  of this  river  if only  to save  the  peopledownstream  from  the  annual  floods  that  they  are  subjected to. The  damage  thatthis  river  does  to the people  living downstream  is  immense  and costly  to  the nation  because  these  people  have  to be  fed  from time  to  time. This  applies  toother  rivers  as  well. It  is  important that we  plan  the  use  of our riverscarefully. There  is  a mistaken notion that water  is  ever  available,  but  sometimesit  disappears. So,  we  must  conserve  it much  in  the  same  way as we  conserveother  resources  that are  critical  in  life  support. This  Ministry,  as  the Ministry of Public Works, continues to employ  a large number of consultants.There  is  no  reason why,  in  1990,  we should contine  to employ expatriate  consultants  because  the  country has a sufficient number of experienced and  well  educated Kenyan consultants. Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,   the  same  applies  to  contractors. There  is  no  reason why  the  Kenya Government  should now employ an  expatriate contractor  to  be  paid  by  funds  from  the  Exchequer. That  money  ought  to  be  paidto  local  contractors  so  that  it  is  retained  within  this  country. I  hope thatthe  Ministry  will  formulate  adequate  policy  to ensure  that all  the money from the  Exchequer  is  used  toemploy  only  Kenyans  because we cannot continue to emplcw people  whose governments  ahve  shown by  acts  and by word  that  they  are  hostile to  us. Sir,   there  is yet another problem  to which I would  like to draw the Ministry's  attention. It  is  all  very  well  to  supply  clean  and  portable waterto  the  people  in  the  countryside. But when you consider  certain  areas  likeKabete here  or Kajuli  in my  constituency,  the holdings are so small  that the Ministry must now  start giving serious  consideration on sewage dispoSal.  If you  have  half  an  acre  or  one  acre  of  land,  you  cannot really  build  a  septic  tank because you  are  going  to  be  a nuisance  to your neighbours. If  everybody's  holding is  small,  the problem  becomes  totally  untenable,  and I  hope  that  the Ministry will  formulate adequate  policy  so  that  they  can provide  sewage disposal  system all  through  the  rural  areas  where  the holdings are  extremely small. Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,Sir,  we have certain areas  in  this  country which  are  short  of water  and  which,  having exploited everything that  is available in years  to  come, will  be  in  deficit. So, the  Ministry  should  start  thinking of how  to  physically  transfer water from Lake Victoria or from other areas which have  surplus water  to  those  areas which are running into deficit. Nairobi  is a good  example;  I  do  not know whether we will  have  sufficient water  in Nairobi the year 1930 most of .   still  that should not stop us  from being concerned with what is going to happen to our  future  generations. Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  to my knowledge,  the Ministry of Water Development has enough staff and equipment to construct small water schemes Such-as dams. But  these days we hardly see them in the countryside. If  that equipment  is  available and  I  know  it  is  because  I  worked  in that Ministry it should be  put  to  use  and  if  the  Ministry  does  not  have  the funds  it should make the  fact  known  to wananchi  so  that  those who  would  wish  to  hire  those  equipment for  either  drilling  boreholes  or  constructing dams  are  given  the equipment  at a fee. With  those few remarks,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,   I  beg  to support the Motion. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE  MINISTER  FOR  AGRICULTURE (Mr.  Mwangale): Mr.  Temporary  DeputySpeaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank you  very  much  for noticing me. I  would  liketo  also thank  the Minister  for Water Development  and his  staff  for  the  way  they have  prepared  their  presentation  to  this House.  It  was  especially  a very  detailed. explanation which  includes  the  objectives  for which  the Ministry  was  established, and  I  thank  the  Minister  for  the way his  Ministry  has  recognised  the  importance of water  conservation. Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  one of the most  important  sectors in water development is  for us  to realise  that until our water catchment areas are properly  conserved,  then  the future water supply  in  this  country will  be  in danger. The Minister mentioned  five catchment areas,  and all  I want to say  is that  the Ministry of Water Development,  the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources  and  the Ministry of Reclamation and Development of Arid,  Semi-Arid and Wastelands have a lot in common and they must continue to work closely.  The permanent secretaries  in  those  three Ministries must co-ordinate their efforts to ensure  that the  funds which are made available to them directly concerned with that purpose. Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  as  I have said many times before, most  of us  always  think of water  in terms of only  20 per  cent of the  total  area, or what we  call  the green belt of this country. Out of the 41 districts of thiscountry, 20  are  those  that lie  in the main rainfall catchment areas. The  restof the  country,  which  is 40 per cent,  is in the semi arid and semi-arid area,which  includes  Rift Valley,  Eastern and North Eastern provinces. Coast  Provinceis,-to  some  very  small extent, within  the this category. Let me  appeal  to mycolleagues  here,  especially Ministers  in  the Front-Bench, that if we are going to  use  the  resources  of this  country  completely in the  future,our planning of the  development of the  country mustconsistently look at the-semi-arid and arid areas  and  be  able to  determine  how the  resources base which  is  so  large in these areas  can  be used. One way  of doing  that  is  to  ensure  that  the water resourcesin  the  arid and  semi-arid  areas  are  taken  care  of. I,  therefore,  would  liketo  support  the  programmes  which are  mainly  in  the  semi-arid and arid  areas. At  this  juncture,  Sir,  let  me  say  that  I  woud like to  see  more  borehole's and  more  studies  done  on  these  areas  to  determine  the  suitable  areas,   identify them  and  ensure that  funds are made' available  to  sink  borehole's  there. For example,  the Uaso Nyiro River,  which disappears  suddenly  in  the Lorian\FAimarand then  surefaces  again somewhere down  the line towards  the Tana River,  should be looked  into. A  proper  and  thorough  study  should  be  done  in  this  area. We  are told  that the Lorian Swamp  contains underground water equivalent to 50  times  the total  amount of water  in  Lake Naivasha. This  study was  done  by,   I  think,  a British  team  some  time back  and  nobodyhas  come up  during  the course  of.the  last ten  to  15 years  to do  a proper  study on  the place.  I  believe  that we  can get enough water  to supply  to  these arid  and semi-arid areas where we have more than fifty per cent of Kenya's livestock. Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  we  are talking about  the  development  of a major  water reservoir at Timboroa.I  am  sure  some people will  ask why water  should be taken from this side and put up a water reservoir  in Timboroa. It  is- because  that water  is essential  for gravitational  flow  into the drier areas of this  country. Let us  think of the  drier areas of this country all  the  time becase the  rate  at which  this  country  is  expanding  in terms of population,  in another eight  to  10 years we will  have  a population  of  about 40  million  people. Inanother 10  to  15 years  later we will  have doubled  that population. Th onlyarea where we can expand is in the arid and semi-arid areas.  Specific studies should be done on our lakes,  like,  Lak For  example,  if you go to other countries,  Sir, you will note that carried out studies on their various lakes to find out the and flora around them,  their  catchment areas and the animals life those  lakes. Studies  should be  carried out on lakes Naivasna 2Bogoria, Baringo, Turkana and so on.I wish we  could allocate more funds to the Ministry of Development if we had enough. But I believe  that  if this allocat K£87  million is properly spent,  we will be able  to know the type of  base that we have in terms of water.The  other point  is on industrial pollution. Fortunately  country has not industrialised well enoll& to be able to talk aboutpollution of our rivers,  lakes and oceans. But I  think it  is  importwe define the standards   we would like maintained as far as pollution is concerned in to  ensure that we do not destroy our water resourceI beg to  support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Nassir): Asante  sana, Bw.

"  <Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT  MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING  (Mr. Mwenje): Thank you  very much,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  for giving me  this opportunity  to  talk  on  the Motion  on  the Ministry  of Water Development. The  first  thing  I  would  like  to  remind  the Minister for Water Development, and  which  everybody  is  apprehensive  about,  is whether the Ministry still  stands by  its  original  policy of every  home  having piped water  by  the year 2000. Bythe  time  the  Minister  replies,  we  also expect him  to  tell  us whether the publicshould. continue  waiting and  assuming  that  that policy  is still being adhered  to.When  we  talk  of water,  we  realise  that  it  is  a very essential commodity. I  happen  to  come  from  a constituency  in Nairobi  City  and. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  CHEPKOK: On  a  point  of order,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir.Why  does  the  Assistant Minister  appear  to  be  doubting what  is a collective responsibility  while  he  is  an  Assistant Minister himself? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT  MINISTER  FOR  SUPPLIES  AND MARKETING  (Mr.  Mwenje): Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,   it  is  clear  that  the  hon.  Member  is  totally misguided  and  does  not  understand  our  responsibilities  here. I  have  to  put  ithere  for  the  Minister  to-respond. I  know we  have  a collective  responsibility,  butI  am  not  the  Minister  for Water Development. I  hope   hon.  Chepkok will  be guided. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  CHEPKOK: On  a  point  of order,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir.Hon.  Mwenje  has  not answered  my question  as  to why  he  is  doubting that collective responsibility. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT  MINISTER  FOR  SUPPLIES  AND  MARKETING  (Mr. Mwenje):  Mr. Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  may  I  put  the  position  clear. I  did  not doubt the  collective  responsibility.  All  I  said  is  that  the  Minister  should  mention, when  he  rises  to  respond  to  this  Motion,   the  position  as  regards  the  provision  of piped  water  to  all  Kenyans  by  the year 2000. It  was  mentioned  earlier,  but  Iam  only  seeking  a..confirmation whether  the  position  still  stands. I  could  say  itbut  it  is  not  my  responsibility  to  say  it. It  is  the  Minister  for Water Development's  responsibility  to  state  that  for his Ministry.      Coming  to Nairobi,  in which  I  represent Embakasi  constituency,  itcan  be  said  that  there  is  sufficient  water  in  the City. However,   there  is  anassumption  that  there  is  water  in  every part of  the City. The  time  has  comewhen  water  supplies  should:be  extended,  particularly  in  the Eastlands  area, to  Kayole,  Njiru  and  Ruai  areas. I  know  that  the  Nairobi  City  Commission acts  as  the  agency  of  the  Ministry  in  the  provision  of water  supplies,  and the  Ministry  should,  therefore,  urge  the Commission  to  take  this  request, because  people  are  currently  moving  from  the City  Centre  towards  the East-                    lands  areas,  where  they  are  now  settling. As  those  people  are  now  settlingthere  with  serious  water  problems,  the  Ministry  should  advise  the  City  Commission  to  make  water  supply  extensions  to  those  areas  I  have mentioned,  especially  using  Chania  III. We  also  have  newly-settled  in  areas,  like Soweto,  where  there  is no water.  I  would  appeal  to   the  Nairobi  City Commission,  and  the Minister for  Water  Development,   to   go  into  these  areas how, as they also need water. At  the  same  time,  the  Commission  should  recheck  the  water  pressures  within Nairobi.I  am  appealing  to  the Minister  to look  into  the  position  because the  pressure  of water  going  to  Embakasi  is  so  low  that  in  some  houses  water cannot go  to upper  rooms. Something  should  be  done  now  to  check  on  that pressure  of water,  particularly  to  Embakasi  village  and  the  Airport  itself.  The  Ministry  of Water  Development  has  become  so  important  to  us. We  are  looking  forward  to  a  time when  the whole  country  will  be  having  plenty. of  water  so  that  people  can  even  carry out much more  irrigation  schemes.  This is  the  time  when  Kenya  will  be  able  to  claim  to  be  self-sufficient  in  food  and also  have  enough  for  export. The  Ministry  of Water Development must,   therefore, come  up  with  a crash  programme,  in conjunction with the Ministry of Reclamation and  Development of Arid  and Semi-Arid  and Wastelands so  that proper irrigation schemes  can  be  introduced all over the country. Although  there  are  some areas  "where  there  are  water projects,  like  in Kandara,  Kigumo and Kangema,  the Ministry  still  requires  to  do more extensive water supply schemes  so  that we can  do  proper  farming. We  want  to  be  able  to move on  fastenough  to reach  more  people. The  other  issue  I  would  like  to  touch on  is  on  the National Water Conservation  and Pipeline  corporation. Very  few people  know  about  thiscorporation. In  the  Minister's  statement,  we  expect  to be  told what  thebody  is  doing. I  think  the  corporation  should  be  more  extensive  so  thatits  impact  can  be  felt  all  over  the  country,  not  just as  a parastatal  body that  people  do  not know  about. We  need  more  enlightening by  the  Ministry on  the  operations  of  this  new  parastatal body. The  question  of pollution  was  mentioned  here."   It  is  true that some  rivers  are  very  polluted.  A  good  example  is the Nairobi  River.  I  do not  know  whether we  have  an  Act  of  Parliament  to  protect  the  river,  or  we should  enact  one  here. Most  of  the  industrial  concerns  spill  their waste into  such  rivers  and,  despite  being  advised  on  alternative  methods,   they still  continue  to  pollute  the  rivers. So, these rivers need to be protected because there are people who, although they do not drink that water, use this water to wash and grow crops.This is why pollution of these rivers must be prevented. The day all of us will have water we will all be farmers and be self-sufficient in whatever we will be doing.Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, despite that we have people who want to mess around with our country; we are lucky in that we have had good infrastructure and peace which have enabled    us to get far. If in addition, we get water we will be able to move faster in development. It is for this reason that I want to thank the Government for maintaining peace. The day this peace will be interfered with we will not be able to do farming and other things. So, no matter how much money somebody brings us we should be prepared to resist any attempts to interfere with our peace.This is why we should support the Government in its decision to close the Norwegian Embassy in this country for it seems to care more about an individual rather than the 25 million Kenyans. This embassy supports Mr. Wamwere who wants to kill anybody instead of minding about the welfare of the 25 million Kenyans.We know we have the so called Norad sponsored projects, but we had better eat githeri in peace instead of eating bread in a chaotic country. We therefore support the President in his endeavours to maintain peace in this country now and in the future.With those few remarks, I beg to supports</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Naibu Spika wa Muda kwa kunipatia nafasiili niunge ink o no voti hii ja Wizara ya Maji anbayo ni Viz ax a y a maana sana. ZTi kweli kwasba naji ni nruhimu sana kwa naisha ya binadaau na wanyasa na hat a nimea. Hivyo rd kusema kwamba bila kuwa na maji hairuwezi kuva na maisha kat jka duni a "hii. Kwa hivyo, Wiz'ara hii kazi nguuru na muhiinu sana ya kuwapatia maji wanadaaiu, wanyama na hata mimea. Ningetaka kuiomba Wizara hii ijaribu sana kuitekereza niradi ya magi kote nchini. Ni ns Ninaposema hivyo, ninafahaniu wazi kwamba kiasi cha pesa ambacho imepatiwe ni kidogo. Lakini ni vigusru kuwapatia pesa zaidi kwa sababuj tuna iiizara nyingine anbazo pia zinahitaji pesa. Hata hivyo, nirigeioinba Wizaxa ihakikishe kwamba kile kiwango cha pesa watakachopata, waaekitumia kwa njia inayofaa. Kwanza, ni lazima uyi wajaribu kuitekeleza niradi ambayo ilikuwa imeanzishwa na ambayo sasa haijakalimishwa. Tungetaka miradi hii kwanza ikaoilishwe kabla ya  Hizara kuianzisha niradi mipya.Jambo la pili ambalo ningetaka kusema ni kwaniba ni wajibu wa wizara hii kuhakikisha kwaniba watu wa Kenya. wanapata maji kama wanavyostahili. Ujia moja ya kufanya hivi ni kuyazuia maji ya avua. Kwa wakati huu, svua iaeanza kunyesha na tayari naji ya nvua yaaeaza kutiririka cure na rjchukua udongo wetu hadi Bara Hindi na pahali pengine. Huu udongo wetu ukichukuliwa, hatutaupata tena. Sana Tunafahamu kwamba iaekuwa kazi ngusu sana kuchimba visima, na ingefaa kama wizara ingejaribu kuwapatia wananchi maji kuwa kutengeneza mabwawa ya maji, hasa katika sehemu kavu. Ni kweli kwamba katika sehemu hizo kuna maji aya mvua na wanaweza hi ajra Laaxa kuyazuilia ili kuwasaidia wananchi katika sehemu hizi. Ninasema hivyo kwa sababu kuchiaba visima huchukua muda nrefu sana na yale naji yanayopatikana huenda ikawa hayatoshi baada ya kutumia pesa nyingi kwa kazi hiyo. Kwa hivyo, ngekuwa vizuri kama Wizara hii ingejaribu kuwapatia wananchi maji kwa njia ya mabwawa.Vile vile, ingeiomoa Wizara hii ihakikishe kwamba yale mabwawa yaliyoko sasa yanaondolewa mchanga. rlasema hivyo kwa sababu mengi ya naowawa haya yamejaa schanga na kwa hivyo. ni lazima kamati sa niaendsieo nilayaniili wananchi waveze kupata naji ya kutosha. Pi a ningetaka kuioiaba Wizara Hiiichunguze ni taabu gani sascs ineingia katika Mto Uaso IJyiro. ITinasema kay hivyo kwa sababu nto huu. inaendelea kupungua. Mi alia, michache iliyopita, ato huu ulikuwa mkubwa sana na ninaiikiri kwaaba Uaso liyiro orth Development Authority vatajiunga na Wizara hii ili kuhakikisha kwsuaba. uchunguzi kamili unafanyva kukusu mto huu. ftasema hivyo kwa sababu inaonekana kwanba rnaji ya mto huu yanatoveka. Kuna sehemu VariViaa azibapo nrrr ato huu umeansa v rjVa kukauka na ni wajibu wa Wizara hii kufanya uchunguzia kuanzia kingo cha mto huu katika ailima ya Aberdares hadi mwisho wake ili kujua ni.kwa nini rnaji ya mto huu yanapungua. Pengine kuna watu aabao wanafanya unyunyizaji haraau . katika mto huu na ni lazima watu hawa waambiwe sak waukomeshe intindo huo. Janbo hili likiachiliwa liendelee, wengine walioko kule chini hawataweza kupata rnaji ya kutosha. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu kuna wananchi wengi ambao wanautusia mto huu katika nyanda cha chini na ikiwa wengine wataruhusiwa kzm fanya unyunyizaji haxaau wa mashanba, kwa kutumia mashiney;kubwa na mifereji mikubwa-mikubwa bila ruhusa, basie uchunguzi ni laziaa ufanywe ili kuhakikishe kwainba watu wengine hawataunia.Vile vile, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda ningetaka kuwaornba wananchi walio na nyumba za mabati, wahakikishe kwanfoa wanatega naji ya mvua ili kuweza irupata aaji ya kutosha. Jaabo hili iz. litaisaidia vfisara sana kwa sababu wananchi watakuwa na maji ya kutosha ya kutumia nyunbani. Kama tunavyofaha.rru sehemu kubwa ya Kenya ni avu ingawa kuna tsV rotuba nzuri. ICitu ninachokosa katika sehemu hizi ni maji na kwa hivyo, fisara ikijaribu kupeleka rnaji katika seherauix hizi na kunyunyizia rzashamba maji, wananchi watakuza vyakula vya kutosha vya kutuaia nyumbani na vingine vya kupeleka ng'asbo ili kuweza kupata pesa za kigeni.Jambo la swisho ambalo ningetaka kusenia ni kwsaba,ninaipongeza Serikali ya yayo ya kuuvunja uhusiano wa Xibalosi na Serikali ya ITorway. Nina sea a hivyo kwa sababu hatuwesi xsxa kuikubalia Serikali hiyo kuuchezea uhuru vetu. Kenyan integrity is not for sale. Kwa hivyo, ha wave si kututisha kwa kusema kwasba wataondoa usaidisi wao au watawatafutia wahalifu nawekili	katika hoti.Sisi hatujayaingilia saaabo ya kindani ya Serikali ya jTorvay na kwa hivyo, hatutski wao wain°iliea masibo yetu.

It is shameful for me, coming from near the lake, to ask the Ministry of Water Development in Nairobi to provide water, in Nyatike. Nyatike has several locations, including West Karungu and East Karungu. These latter locations have no river at all. Water falls down from the clouds and runs into the lake, leaving us without any water throughout the year. Throughout our lives, there has never been a river there and in no way will a river "germinate" there. If rivers were to germinate, we would hopefully wait for the day when a river would germinate in West Karungu and East Karungu Locations. We, therefore, have to request the Ministry of Water Development to bring water to us. This does not have to be piped water. Dam and roof water is all right. All I need is some water in Nyatike. Nyatike is not merely semi-arid, but really arid, but you always hear of floods there. These floods are caused by water coming down from Kisii highlands. It passes through Nyatike quickly and disappears into the lake with our soil. Even the small dams that we used to have during the colonial time are now full of sandy soil brought by running rain water.There is one dam in front of my mother's home near Muhuru Bay which is nearly full of soil now. Probably, the Ministry will bring a machine and scoop out the mud in the dam. There is another little one near Abade Girls High School which is also nearly full of sandy soil. Only a little water can be seen in this dam. School children in all the schools there have to go to the lake with a basin to fetch water. Sometimes, they fetch dirty water that you may find nearby only for a week or so. I need water in Nyatike because even the cattle there are merely "skeletons". they have to go looking for pasture on top of the hill and travel back to the lake, 17 kilometres away, for water.It is awkward for me to ask the Ministry of Water Development here in Nairobi to go to Nyatike, near the lakeshore to give me, not piped water, but drinking water for my people and their livestock. During the dry season our women have to leave their bedrooms to scratch for water in the very bad rivers in Yatike. They wait there with their calabashes and pots to get water from thesand in the river beds. Who looks after these matters? Nyatike was created at the same time as other areas, and the Government should have known that this is one of the most dangerous areas to look after. There was Karungu Water Project which I think was very serious. A lot of money was poured there, but the project is now disappearing and yet nobody is following it up. I hope that the Ministry will now take up the matter and find out what happened to this project. There is also-am area called Nyakori, which is very well situated and where a dam would do very well for our animals. There is a small hill near Winjo next to the Kenya Tanzania border. This is another suitable area for a dam. On top of North Kathiro, there is a place called Ndhiwa which really needs water for both human and animal consumption. These are the natural realities of the problems that I am experiencing. All the same, I am very lucky because the present Minister for Water Development was at one time the Member of Parliament for this area. So, he can geographically describe the situation there and identify all these areas I am quoting to this House.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, one more point is that in Nyatike, which used to be called Macalder Division, there is no water. The old pipes that were left behind by the colonialists dried up and got broken. The same thing happened to the pipes that were left behind by the miners. There is no water there even for the District Officer or the police. Right now, I am trying to build a small school there, but I aim beginning to wonder what its pupils will be drinking. What about the teachers? This is the real problem. Water comes down from the clouds and some from Kisii and runs away to the lake, leaving the people without any drinking water. In Nyatike, we do not know what else to do but to look after our animals. We keep the primitive cattle with long tails and horns, but they need ordinary water to drink. This is all I am asking forfrom the Ministry. Otherwise, I support the Ministry's Vote.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to the Vote of the Ministry of Water Development. First of all. I would like to urge the Ministry to ensure that if there are anyprojects that it has not completed it seriously considers completing them firstbefore it starts new ones. I say this because there is some disparity in theprojects run by the Ministry and those that are run by private contractors.There are high chances of any project run by the Ministry being left to stalljust due to lack of finance. This is a serious situation that the Ministry oughtto put right so that we may complete all our projects.The other issue is that the Ministry should consider the possibilityof harnessing gravity flow and. giving water to our people. With the recentincrease in oil prices, the best way of getting water to our people is usinggravity flow. Instead of taking up a project just like that, the Ministry shouldcarry out a serious feasibility study into the possibility of using gravity flowin many of our areas. It is not necessary to keep all the water we have. Many of our people draw water from natural streams and if this water is harnessed in a hygienic way, our people will have it without much of a problem.The other issue the Ministry should look into is the possibility of rehabilitating old water projects. There has been a tendency of the Ministry embarking on new projects while there are some projects that were going on in the past but are no longer in existence. The Ministry should think about keeping aside some little finance to take care of these old projects. The colonialists used to have some water projects-in their farms in the White Highlands, but when Africans took over these farms, due to lack of management, some of these projects ceased to exist. The Ministry should think of a way of trying to rehabilitate some of these projects for the benefit of our people.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, looking at the Ministry of Water Development, one sees that much is yet to be done to do with the study of water projects. While we encourage this kind of undertaking, the Ministry should not just carry studies every year. When you look at Cherangani's vote, there has been a lot of studies done year in and year out and nothing has taken off the ground.  So, what we need is a concerted effort to see to it that some of these studies that were carried out over three years ago have really yielded something for our people. We should not keep on carrying out studies without getting any¬thing tangible for our people.The other issue is that in terms of construction of dams and some dredges, the Ministry should intensify their efforts in trying to use some labour instead of using machinery all the time. We know of some grand projects in either China or Tanzania where labour intensive methods have been used and where the work has been cheap and provided employment to people. The same thing can be done in our Ministry of Water Development. It is just a matter of the Ministry thinking of better ways of amassing human labour instead of using machines all the time.In terms of machinery, Mr. Temporary deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Water Development has a lot of machinery but the major problem has been that the Ministry has not been seriously undertaking major projects in construction and some of this machinery has been lying idle.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other issue that I feel the Ministry should undertake is the management of catchment areas. When I talk of management of catchment areas I mean all those areas which get water from the rain or which get rain water and becomes surface run off. In terms of management of these areas, one thing they should try is to control soil erosion in conjunction with the relevant Ministries. They should also try to ensure that this water, wherever it the sea. does not carry a lot of silt into the river base.That way, the rivers will not dry within a short time. I believe that this is the responsibility of this particular Ministry.Sir, in conjunction with the Ministry of Public Works, the Ministry of Water Development must seriously consider the diversion of water away from the roads such that this water does not get into people's farms and carry a lot of good soil.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other issue I would like to touch on as far as this Ministry is concerned is on the management of water. Many local authorities have done very well in terms of management -of water, and I think the Ministry should try to borrow a leaf from them to ensure that it does something in this direction. The Ministry can even transfer some of the responsibilities it has to the local authorities. If they can do so well in the collection of rents, why can they not do just as well in the collection of water rates and remit the same to the Ministry of Water Development?Sir, I am happy that the Ministry has been very vigorous in chasing some of its debtors and they have collected a lot of money as far as water bills are concerned. While we urge the Ministry to do even better about this, the same Appropriations-in-Aid, once collected, should be remitted to the Government in good time. I would also like to urge "the Minister to tour many more places and ensure that many of the projects that are already at a standstill get off the ground.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.MR. MANG'OLI: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this short time to contribute towards this Motion. My concern with this Ministry is that a time will come when we will reject its Vote because we are not seeing any tangible projects coming off the ground. The time has come when we must get serious. We cannot be coming here year after year to vote moneyfor the Ministry and no tangible projects are seen in the districts. I say so with due respect. There is a project called. Muchi/Khalala Water Project which has been used by the Ministry officers to ask for money and yet it is not taking off. There is also the Makemo/Makutano/Ndivisi project where we have just seen pipes running through the location but without water. The schools in the area have no water.Since Webuye is now a Municipal Council, the supply of watershould be improved. We do net rant to repeat what we are saying now nextyear. He are fed up and we are almost giving up. According to theWater Act, water for human consumption is supposed to be clean. Forexample, the water at the Kibitoli Water Project which passes through37 hose has not been treated for the last three years, lie are survivingthrough the grace of God and yet the Act says that water should betreated at an interval of sis months. This water has never been treatedand that is why we have such diseases as cholera, typhoid and so on. Forexample, many students because of using untreated water. The Ministry shouldtake what we are saying here seriously.I am sure that the Minister is going to do all he can to ensure thatwhat we are saying is implemented. The projects appearing in the Estimateshave been reflected year after year and money provided but they are not takingoff the ground. The wananchi are asking us where these projects are.The Minister should answer these questions. Those projects which havetaken off the ground should be completed so that wananchi can benefit.The Minister is aware of the importance of water and rain watershould be harnessed for use during the dry season cut nothing is being donein this respect. Should we come and shout here with nothing being done?	If we pass this vote and nothing happens by next year in terms of development projects, ifI will still be in this House I will move a Motion to stop this budget.We should be told what the funds we voted have done.For example, a water project was stationed at Malakisi instead ofMount Blgon where there is gravity. I am wondering why this happened.This is public money which should be accounted for. I as now being askedby ay constituents when muji-kalaia Project will be off the ground Whatis happening with Makusea Ndivisi Water Project? Why does Ndivisi Secondary School continue fetching Water from river when pass through it? piped water?</Newspeech><Header>ADJOURMENT</Header><Newspeech>THE TEMPRORY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mureithi): Hon.

Simply because the child was so young the mother had to accompany him into hospital. The child was therefore admitted from 5th to		L1th of August. When the child was discharged Florence Komea was supposed	up to 18th of August. My Question is; why were her services terminated when her child was sick?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYALO: The reasons for termination; was because thelady in question never told anybody of her whereabouts.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIILU: Since the hon.

KILIKU: While thanking the Minister for her rein¬statement, could he assure this House that Miss Florence Koraen will not lose any of her benefits because of that termination of her services from that very short time?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYALO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, she will not lose any of her benefits.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEPKOK: While thanking the Minister I would like to tell him that since a letter was given by a doctor at the hospital to allow Miss Florence Komen to accompany her child into the hospital that day, the manager at the airport should not have sacked her. I am telling the Minister to caution his officers because Florence had been reporting to the Ministry every now and then, but her request was not granted even after producing the doctors letter. The Minister should, therefore, be looking into such cases because it was wrong for Florence to suffer for one year simply because her child was sick.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

We have to protect our industries against smuggled second-hand clothes.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.KILIKU: On a point of order, Sir. Is the Minister in order to talk about smuggled clothes instead of second-hand clothes? We cannot encourage people to buy smuggled goods in this country.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYALO: It is true that those clothes are smuggled and if the hon. Member has any prove to the contrary, he should inform the House accordingly.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

KIALO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is a different question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GODA1IA: On a point of order, Sir. Is the Minister in order to challenge hon.

KYALO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I made a statement.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Sir. I do not know the  criteria the Minister is using in licensing the sale of these clothes in± the country. If the wananchi in Nyamira District are not allowed to trade in second-hand clothes, why is this business allowed in open markets in Nairobi and Mombasa?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYALO: The Government has not issued any licence for the sale of second-hand clothes. If any hon. Member has a licence of that nature, he can Table it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: The Minister should take this matter seriously because we see the sale of these clothes in Gikomba and elsewhere in the country. If he believes that kind of situation does not arise, he should carry out investigations and inform the House accordingly. If he finds out that these clothes are being sold, what measures will he takes to either legalise or stop the sale of second-hand clothes throughout the country?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYALO: The Government has eradicated, the smuggling of second-hand clothes into this country.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Sir. I think the Minister- has misled the House because the Government has not eradicated the smuggling of second-hand clothes into this country. The Government has only stopped the importation of second-hand clothes into this country. Why is the Minister saying that smuggling of these clothes has been stopped as if it were legalised?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYALO: I said that most of these clothes are smuggled into the country.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Sir, we cannot allow the Minister to term the wananchi of this country 'smugglers'. Can the Minister substantiate his allegations that second-hand clothes are smuggled into this country? We represent wananchi in this House and we should protect their dignity. Can the Minister withdraw or substantiate that remark? As far as I know, wananchi in Changamwe are not smugglers.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYALO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, no import licence has been issued for the importation of second-hand clothes.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: We must move on. Let Mr. Boy's point of order be the last supplementary question on this matter.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOY: On a point of order, Sir. The Minister did not respond to Mr. Kiliku’s point of order. Sir, the Minister should know that all second¬hand need not be imported. The question is: Can the Minister substantiate his allegation that all second-hand clothes being sold in the country havebeen smuggled here? If he cannot do that, he should withdraw that remark. why is it that only Back Benchers are asked to withdraw certain remarks and not Members of the Front Bench?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

DEPUTY SPEAKER: Next Question.</Newspeech>Question No. 485Pension of Pension Benefits to Messrs Ngila ana MuindiMR. WAMBUA asked the Vice-President and Minister for Finance that since Messrs John K. Ngila, APN/ PC.No. 21787 and Michael M. Muindi, APN/PC. No. 19OIO, have been paid their August, 1990 monthly pension benefits in lumpsum form without Ihdicating the increments from July, whether/	1986,/he could provide a breakdown indicating the increasesawarded to these pensioners with effect from July, I9S0 as outlined in the Pensions (increase) Amendment Act of 1990<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRYOF FINANCE (Mr. Keah): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The analysis required under this Question is as follows:From 1st July, 1986, the pension of Mr. Ngila was raised from Kshs. 787.10per month to Kshs. 860.45 Per month. From 1st July, 1987? the pension ofMr. Ngila was raised from Kshs.860.45 per month to Kshs.943.50 permonth. Calculating those arrears from the1st of July, 1986 to August1990, gives you arrears of Kshs.7,439.05 which was paid to Mr.Ngilavide cheque dated 2nd October, 1990 according to the payment voucher.In so far as Mr. Muindi is concerned, he pension was increasedon 1st July, 1936 from Kshs.1,850.55 to Kshs.2,021.90. From 1st July, 1987,it was increased from Kshs.2,021.90 to Kshs.2,193.60 hence totallingarrears amounting to Kshs.16,613.05 which was paid to him.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

BIDU asked the Minister for Health, in view of the fact that Kinango Hospital has expanded and the number of patients has  increased, what action the Ministry is taking to instal a microbiology equipment in the laboratory.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur) : Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.While my Ministry appreciates the necessity to expand laboratory services in the Microbiology Department at Kinango Hospital, the space available for laboratory facilities does not allow the Ministry to do this at the moment. This is because the is no proper laboratory building in Kinango Hospital as of now. T two rooms currently used for laboratory services were initially for out-patient clinical officer and a dressing room which were converted to serve the purposes temporarily. So, we are unable to carry out this exercise at the moment because of the shortage of space.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Sir. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as usual, the Assistant Minister is unable to give a good reply to a Question. The truth of the matter is that the microbiology equipment at Kinango Hospital was taken away for repair.But that equip¬ment has not been replaced. The Assistant Minister is now tailing us another story; that they are unable to instal micro¬biology equipment at the Hospital because of lack of space. Could the Assistant Minister tell us where they took the original microbiology equipment?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in his Question hon. 3idu wants us to tell him whether we would expand laboratory facilities at Kinango Hospital and I am saying that we are unable to carry out such an exercise because there is no room. I am not aware of the removal of microbiology equipment from Kinango Hospital to another place.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOY: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is only answering one part of the Question. The last part of the question reads as follows:"What action is the Ministry taking to instal microbiology equipment in the laboratory?"The hon. Questioner says that the equipment was there and that it was taken away for repairs. But the Assistant Minister here says he is not aware of the removal of that machine. Gould he go and carry out thorough investigations -and report back to the House  with a proper answer?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: .Just you respond to that point of order, Mr. Ogur, is it possible to confirm what equipment was removed from the Hospital?

BIDU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, a microbiology equipment was removed from	Kinango Hospital; it was takenaway for repairs but- it was never replaced. I personally visited the Hospital. We, as representatives of the people, have a duty to ± visit all institutions in the country. I personally went to that Hospital and I got this information from personnel who work in the laborary; I was inside the laborary room and I was told that the microbiology equipment was removed from that room and taken away for repairs.

OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, We have never used this type of equipment in Kinango Hospital at all. It is not possible to install that type of equipment in the laboratory because there is no space.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Mate.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATS: We are in a difficult situation here and we need the guidance of the Chair. The hon. Questioner insists that this machine was there and it was taken away for repairs. But the Assistant Minister states firmly that they have never used that type of machine in Kinango Hospital. Would it be in order to appoint several Members of Parliament here to go there and carry out some investigations and then we expel the two S2sszxhx hon. Members from this House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON.

The equipment we are talking about needs a special room</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! For further avoidance of doubt, Mr. Ogur, would you kindly find out from the Ministry what kind of equipment was removed from Kinango Hospital? It may very well be that it is not what you are talking about. It does appear that certain form of equipment was actually physically removed from Kinango Hospital. Could you kindly find out what it was? If it turns out that microbiology equipment was removed from the Hospital then you will have a bit of a problem, Mr. Ogur.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it appears rather odd that when the Ministry of Health is informing the House that microbiology equipment cannot be used there because there is noRoom We are unable to install that type of equipment in thatlaboratory because there is no room.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order! Mr. Ogur, I thought I made it clear that it is important that you find outwhat equipment was actually removed as the very first step beforeyou can address the rest of the Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. As usual the Assistant Minister is giving another unsatisfactory answer. What are we going to do with him? Could the Chair use Standing Order Number One to throw the Assistant Minister out of this Chamber?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if an hon. Member who wants to be given a good answer for the benefit of his constituents makes such an insinuation, then it means that his intention is not to get help from the Ministry. It is not even specified here what type of microbiology equipment was removed from Kinango Hospital. I will go back and find out if there was any microbiology equipment that was removed from that Hospital. I it was removed then it must have been there and there must have been a room for it. But there has never been any room for that type of equipment and therefore the question of removing that equipment does not arise in the first place.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. We are asking these questions because according to our Standing Orders the Assistant Minister should seek more information. The Chair has ruled that the Assistant Minister should go and find out the kind of machine that was removed from there and then come back and report to this House. But the Assistant Minister is trying to insist that we cannot have micro-biology equipment in a district hospital. Is it in order for the Assistant Minister to challengethe ruling of the Chair? Or, are the Ministers above the Chair?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Kiliku, for the benefit of the House, let me make it absolutely clear that when Questions are put here the burden is on the Fronts-Bench to even have conferences with the personnel in their Ministries and try to apprise themselves fully So that they can then anticipate supplementary questions of this type and that will be beneficial to this House and the country. I have been to a place where hon. Members simply ask a Minister, What are your engagements today? From there any kind of question is then asked. So, it is important for the Front Bench to sincerely prepare for supplementary questions.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEWA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, on the same question the Assistant Minister is not quite straightforward. Could he first of all confirm whether there is a laboratory or not in this hospital? This is because micro-biology is only an aspect of a laboratory: there is pathology, histology and so on. So, If there is a laboratory in this hospital, then the question of there not being room for a micro-biology section does not arise.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as far as we know an hospital of the category of Kinango District Hospital must have a laboratory department out not necessarily a micro—biology room.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Ogur! Mr. lewa's question is very explicit and simple. Please do not anticipate a situation; either you know there is a laboratory or you do not know. But if you say there must be a laboratory you are now assuming too much.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, perhaps, due to ignorance of some of our hon. Members do not know how a laboratory is established.</Newspeech>(several members stood on a point of order) <Newspeech>MR.DEPUTY SPEAKER: Shall we listen to hon. Ogur?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, by the word "ignorance" I mean somebody not knowing what laboratory equipment for micro¬biology is like. I admit that there exists a small laboratory room in that hospital, which would not be enough for a micro-biology equipment. If the House wants me to check and confirm later whether the hospital had micro-biology at any one± time, I will do so.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Will the Assistant Minister withdraw the world "ignorance" because it is unparliamentarily?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Ogur, use of the word "ignorance" brought with it a certain amount of unrest among the hon. Members, especially, as it refers to hon. Lewa, who is a qualified pharmacist. Could you kindly withdraw this word?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister used the word "ignorance" two or three times. Can he withraw it and apologise because it is very unparlia-mentary?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: The Chair will be satisfied with a withrawal of the word without an apology.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the word "ignorance" is unparliamentary, I withdraw it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Matei Hon, Members, at this stage I think even if you do not like what somebody is saying you should really respect his right to say it. So when an hon. Member is talking, please give him time to finish.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATS: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir; I think the hon. Assistant Minister is trying to withdraw the word conditionally because he using the word "if" Can he withdraw unconditionally?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I withdraw the word "ignorance".</Newspeech>Question Ho. 516 <Header>Refund of the Late Tore's Cash Deposit</Header>MR. P.G. GO DANA asked the Minister for Health what steps is taking to pay the dependants of the late Kosi Kilicha Tore an amount of 3hs2,52S/- deposited by the deceased when he was a patient at the I.D.H. as acknowledged by the 2.iinistry's letter, ref IDH/SV//63/123 9 dated l7th February, 1984 and receipt No 5523.63, dated 17th February, 1984.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur):  Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.I Wish to inform the hon. Member that arrangements have been made to pay the dependant, Mr. Ngolo Sora, of the late Tore, of P.O. Box 2022, Marsabit, Shs.1.250/- through the District Commiasioner, Marsabit, and not Shs.2,528/- as indicated by the hon. Member. This is the balance of Shs.l,278/- which was brought to the deceased by Mr. Adam Sototicha, Id/No. 0964992/63, at the Nairobi City Commission (NCC) where the deceased was working This Shs.l,250/- was found, on the deceased body when he died and was handed over to Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH)for safe-keeping till the next of kin was traced. Before he died they had spent Shs.23/- leaving a balance	days later, a Mr. Adam Katalicha, the same person who had brought the Shs.l,278/- to the deceased, from the NCC came to take the balance of Shs.1,250/- as the next of Sin, but he could not be given the money because he could not prove that he was the next of kin. A letter, ref. IDR/SR/33/l23, dated 10th February, 1934. was written to the NCC to confirm if Adam Katalicha was the next of kin, but up todate there has never been any confirmation of the next of kin. The figure of Shs.2,523, therefore, seems to be the sum of the salary balance of Shs. 1,278/- brought to the deceased by Mr. Adam and the balance of the same salary Shs.1,250/- which was found on the body of the deceased.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P. G. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Question is based on a letter that was written by the medical, social workers, IDH, on 15th February, 1984, to the Chief Accountant, NCC, in which they clearly pointed that the deceased had deposited Shs.1,250/- to the IDH for safe-keeping and also that Khs. 1,278/- had been sent by the NCC as the deceased's salary to IDH. That is why the Question contains the total sum of Shs.2,523/-. Could the Assistant Minister, therefore, put the record straight and arrange to pay the remaining amount to the dependants of the deceased?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Hr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, through our own investigations, we have already found that the money due to the deceased less what he had used Before he died; was claimed by a Mr. Adam, who did not prove beyond any reasonable doubt that he was actually the next of kin. The* balance thereof, is awaiting collection and this is the only amount we are able to account for. However, my Ministry will go through the file and I would at this juncture like to invite the hon. Member to our office, so that we could together look through the file to his satisfaction.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it may be of benefit to the House if I could read a copy of that letter which I referred to earlier. This letter was written from the Infectious Diseases Hospital, P.O. Box 20725, Nairobi, dated 16th February, 1984, and addressed to the Chief Accountant, NairobiCity Commission, City Treasurers Department, P.O. Box 30075, Nairobi, and  this is what it says:-</Newspeech>Dear Sir,	RE: KOSI KILICHA TORE (DECEASED)I kindly ask you to furnish us with the information from your employment records, the next of kin of the above mentioned deceased. Your office submitted to us a sum of Shs.1,278/-, as the salary of the above mentioned person. We have in our custody a sume of Shs.1,250/- which the deceased left with us. These amount was brought to us by Mr. Adam Botolija P.oaa ID/No.0964992/63, who is also your employee.Please advise us whether we can release this money to Mr. Adam Botolija Roba who claims to the deceased closest relative.Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, it 1s quite clear from this letter that the two sets of amounts, that is Shs.1,273/- and 5hs.l,250/-, are separate amounts, the total of which should be paid to the next of kin of the deceased.<Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the hon. . Member for providing us with that additional information. If he actually did receive the letter from the Nairobi City Commission addressed to the Infectious Diseases Hospital, which is a department within the Ministry of Health, I would like to assure him that there is no problem at all in co-ordina¬ting the figure. As far as our records go, however, the amount of money thatwas due for the deceased salary, was reduced by the amount that the deceased had used before he passed away. The balance thereof, can only be given to the next of kin when so proved by either the Member of parliament or by the administration. There is no argument regarding the amount to be paid as long as the next of kin has been established.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not think there is any need to bring the City Commission into this matter because they sent the amount of money that was supposed to be the salary of the deceased. The point I am trying to raise here is with regard to the amount that the deceased deposited at the hospital. Secondly, there is no point in saying that the next of kin has not been established because this has already been done by the district commissioner's office, Marsabit  from where the Assistant Minister obtained the name of the next of kin he has referred to Therefore, could he make arrangements to pay the Shs.1,273 to the next of kin?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, who availed himself and claimed to be the next of kin, could not prove beyond any reasonable doubt that he was, in fact the next of kin. He did not have any documents to prove this. If Mr. Adaa is the real next of kin and he is proved by us to be the right person, we will hand over the balance to him.</Newspeech><Newspeech>ME. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Next Question./Newspeech>Question No.497 <Header>Payment of N.S.S.F. Dues to Messrs. Suleman and Abdalla</Header>" MR. KILIIU asked the Minister for Labour what has delayed the payment of N.S.S.F. benefits to Messrs. Atibo Suleman, N.S.S.F. No	W/01232543l/9 and Hassan Abdalla, N.S.S.F. No.20l624503.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Amin): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. (a) Mr. Atibo Suleman Payment for N.S.S.F. benefits has been delayed because he applied for his benefits under a different name, namely, Atibo Suleman Hodoma instead of Atibo Suleman, the name that he registered himself at the N.S.S.F. This claimant had not also forwarded his retirement letter when submitting his application. However, his claim has now been processed andhe should receive his cheque by Wednesday 31st October, 1990.(b) According to our records, Mr. Abdalla has not applied for his benefits and should be advised to apply after which he will be paid in the normal way.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have a letter here from the Manager, Mr. S.W. Mutunga from the N.S.S.F. Mombasa requesting the N.S.S.F. headquarters to pay Mr. Hassan Abdlla his benefits because he had applied for his N.S.S.F benefits. I have a copy of this letter here with me and I do know why the Assistant Minister is telling the House that Mr. Abdalla has not applied for his N.S.S.F. benefits.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOY: This particular Assistant Minister is fond of giving us the wrong information all the time.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AMIN: That particular letter is not available in our office and if the hon. Member could produce it, obvious, we shall follow up the Ratter and be able to pay the claimant.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant Minister1 reply regarding Mr. Suleman's benefits, could, he tell this House how much is due to him?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I cannot confirm the amount at this stage but if the hon. Member wants to know the figure, he could come to our office at the time of payment and we shall provide with the information.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MWAMZANDI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the letter that has beenreferred by hon. Kiliku was written from the Labour Office, Mombasa, and theAssistant Minister now says that if the hon. Member produces the copy of that letter, then they would pay the claimant. Does this mean that his Ministry does not keep a record of their correspondence?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that letter was allegedly written by our Labour Office in Mombasa, but it is not available at the Headquarters and this is why I said that if the hon. Member could be co-operative enough to give me the copy he has, obviously, we shall pay the claimant.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOY: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the letter which hon. kiliku has referred to is date 10th April, 1990. Is the .Assistant Minister in order to tell us that since that date, this letter has not reached their office here in Nairobi. Furthermore, the letter clearly says that the application forms for Mr. Hassan have been submitted to the Head Office. Is the Assistant Minister therefore in order to say that they have not received this letter and that they do not know anything about it?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not disagree that the letter was written. It could have been written, yes, but what I am saying is that we have not yet received it at the Head Office and I have categorically said that we are ready to assist in this matter, if the hon. Member would be co-operativeEnough, to give us the copy of that letter which he is claims he has.On a point of order,</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOY: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have always found ourselves ina dilemma whenever Questions directed to this particular Ministry are beinganswered in this House, especially when this particular Assistant Minister,is the one answering the Questions. It seems that he never does his properly and whenever he comes here, he just reads answers written by their officers without caring to do some extra homework. Is this really in order? The hon. Questioner has done his homework properly, and has even produced a letter to support his case. It is most unfortunate that this Assistant Minister stands up and says that this letter is not available in his office when it is quite clear that it was written on 10th April, 1990. Is the Assistant Minister s really in order to bring half-baked replies to this House. He has a strange way of going round-about question with intention of buying time So that the Chair can eventually call up the next question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>ME. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is not at all true to say that I do not do my homework. I have done my homework in this particular question and I know what I am talking about I have categorically said that we have not received any application forms for Mr. Hassan and if the hon. Member has a copy of the letter allegedly sent to our Office from Mombasa labour Office, let him give it to me and I will follow up the matter.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. How could the Chair help hon. Members when a Ministry is not capable of giving proper replies and needs to be reprimanded? In the case of the Ministry of Labour, we ask many questions, but when we are told, that the person concerned is going to be paid the following day, this does not happen. If we want to reprimand this Ministry, how should we do it?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the hon. Member</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, my point of order is directed to the Chair and not to the Assistant Minister.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Mwamzandi, you place the Chair in an awkward position. The Chair can choose to respond to a point of order to sleep over it. In this particular case, the Chair can only restate the necessity for Ministries to be do thorough research before hon. Members of the Front Bench come here to answer Questions. If an undertaking is made in this House that a certain action is going to be taken, for example to pay salaries or accrued money, and this does not happen, this is a very serious matter.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOY: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I would not like to go against your ruling, but there is a certain tendency that has been going on every day in the case of Assistant Minister. They bring here unsatisfactory answers and wait for the Chair to call the next Question, at which the point the earlier Questions "dies". What we are asking is how the Chair can help us in such cases. When the next Question is called, the Back Bench can do nothing about the earlier Question. What can we do to ensure that Assistant Ministers do not take the House lightly in future? They should remember what happened to one Minister who has just walked out, and take the House and the Back Bench seriously. What I am talking about happened last week and this week, and it might happen again next week. Because we want Assistant Ministers to take us seriously, we want to get a ruling, from the Chair since it is the Chair that controls all of us here.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. This is a very serious allegation on the part of hon. Boy Juma Boy. The answers we bring here originate from the Questions asked byhon. Members. So far, the research done by respective Ministries are adequate and fit to be given to this House.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Ogur! That goes directly against the spirit of the Chair. If you have been asked to go and check on what kind of equipment was physically removed from Kinango Hospital, you cannot be heard to say that answers are always adequate because this is not so.(Applause)On the other hand, however, some answers are adequate. It is not true that all Ministries give unsatisfactory answers. Where there have been unsatisfactory answers, the Chair is on record as having given proper directives in each case. So, let us not argue about this. Let everybody take their business seriously, especially in respect of the Business appearing in this House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. ole Kaparo): on a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. My point of order relates to the various points of order raised by hon. Boy and company in relation to a blanket allegation that Ministries are not giving proper answers here. There are instances where hon. Members of the Back Bench themselves put Questions that are incorrect as a result of which the Ministers here give the correct position which Back-benchers cannot point out. Is it in order for hon. Members to blame the Government wholesale</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: This matter must be settled. I take kindly the observation made by hon. ole Kaparo. We, obviously, cannot come here to carry out witch-hunting or issue blanket condemnation. I personally do not like the word "condemnation" because it is actually not the best of the terms to be used here. I have just made it clear that when the answers given by certain Ministries are seen to be inadequate, the Chair has always pointed out the deficiencies involved with a view to having satisfactory answers brought to this House. Where some Ministries have done well, the Chair has said so. The Chair cannot take part in the process of putting Questions nor in answering them. So, all that I am saying is that both the Front and the Back Benches should take the Business of the House seriously. That is the end of the matter.</Newspeech>Question No. 430	<Header>Erection of Dykes Along River Lumi</Header>	MR. KUBO asked the Minister for Water Development when the Ministry will complete the erection of dykes along Lumi River basin in order to protect the affected area from floods.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Mwita): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Due to the large amount of money that is required so as to erect dykes along Lumi River, the project needs external funding. A friendly country has already shown some interest and its representatives have just completed a feasibility study of flood control and drainage of Taita Division. As at now, my Ministry is waiting for the reaction of the country after analysing the report of the study.Meanwhile, my Ministry has, since 1975, been involved in small-scale flood protection projects in the irrigation schemes in the low—lying areas of Lumi River basin. This involved the construction of a 13-kilometre main drainage canal along the right bank of Lumi River and small canals in the irrigation schemes. Currently, my Ministry is constructing another storm drain canal, nine kilometres long, that will, on completion, open up 1,300 hectares for irrigation farming.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I take this opportunity to thank the Assistant Minister who, incidentally, toured the place in question with his Minister, the other Assistant Minister and the Permanent Secretary. I am sure the Assistant Minister is fully aware of what I am talking about. However, while I appreciate what the Ministry is doing, I would like to inform the Assistant Minister that although he and his officers have started doing the necessary work we know that there is an excavator that has been doing this work since 1975 the excavator in use has always been breaking down. Could the Assistant Minister seriously consider the idea of bringing in another excavator that can do the work faster than is the case right now?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWITA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is true that the excavator in question is very old and has been breaking down from time to time, but wheneverit has broken down, we have always repaired it. In fact, we have just repaired it and it is now doing a reasonable job. At the same time, however, we are going to consider buying a new excavator when funds become available.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister says that he is going to consider buying a new excavator, but this is a very serious issue that has been reviewed by the relevant district development committee. Even the Coast Provincial Evaluation and Monitoring Committee has been to the project and seen the slow rate at which this work is being done. So, all I am doing is to request the Assistant Minister to look at this matter more seriously because it affects the lives of very many people in Taita Division.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWITA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question here relates to funding and I want to assure the hon. Member that we are going to look into this matter very seriously.</Newspeech>Question No. 503 Alleviation of Water Shortage in GarsenMR. WAKOLE asked the Minister for Water Development since the residents of Garsen, Tarasaa and Ngao in Tana River District have been facing serious water shortages for the last one year, what plans the Ministry has to resolve this problem forthwith.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Mwita): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Garsen water supply is expected to operate at full capacity in two weeks' time when my Ministry will have completed major repairs on the intake engine. At present, the residents of Tarasaa and Ngao are well catered for.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAKOLE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for that reply, is he aware that from Tarasaa to the river where people fetch water is five miles?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWITA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not know what the hon. Member is trying to get at because all I know is that Tarasaa and Ngao are well looked after; they have no problem as far as water supply is concerned.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAKOLE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, from Tarasaa to where the people fetch water is about five miles. What urgent steps , is the Ministry taking so that the water is brought nearer to the people?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWITA: Sir, I do not know what the hon. Member is trying to get at. I know that the distance is there, but the water for the two towns of Ngao and Tarasaa have no problem. What problem is there?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

TSC/ADM/75/C0/Vol./10, dated 9th April, addressed to the Headmaster, Waa Secondary. School by the Secretary, Tea Service Commission?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): Mr. Deputy Sir, I beg to reply.The Teachers Service Commission will pay the benefits as soon receive the death certificate or a certified copy of the certificate.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEWA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am surprised to hear the because I, personally, have been involved in the issue of Mr. Murima who working for four months, died in January. Since then, I have been visii Teachers Service Commission and I have been writing to them as a follow my visits. There has been no time when I have been requested to supply which would assist to settle this issue. I am wondering whether this is serious as the Assistant Minister is putting it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, he may not have been request but if the Question came to the Ministry, I am now requesting him to sup with a certified photostat copy of the death certificate and the dues wi paid.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEWA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, is. it usual that even when a Member of Parliament is personally taking the initiative of doing the necessary for a case like this, the Teachers Service Commission ignores the correspondence and waits until a Question is put here before action is taken?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would not know who, in particular the hon. Member saw at the Teachers Service Commission. However, since we received the Question, we are giving him the right answer. If he brings the document I have mentioned to me, I will personally take the matter up with the Teachers Service Commission and ensure that the benefits are paid.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think what the Assistant Minister is giving us here is something which should have been said either through a tele¬phone call or through a letter. Did the Ministry take any action when they were informed that this person had passed away? Did they write or telephone to ask the death certificate to be taken to the Teachers Service Commission?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: No, Sir. I accept that the Teachers Service Commission may not have done that; maybe, it was an oversight. However, I have now informed the hon. Member what is required.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

This problem will be solved once the second Mzmima Pipeline is laid. Meanwhile, my Ministry has been encouraging high rise building owners to provide stand-by taps at the highest level that wate</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIILU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Can the Assistant Minister tell the House which Question he is answering. My Question concerns Masinga Constituency but he is referring to something else which I do not understand. Is he actually answering my Question?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Mwita): Mr. Deputy Speaker, may I apologise to you and the hon. Member because I do not have the  correct answer with me?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Can you repeat what you have just said, hon. Mwita?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Mwita): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I just apologised because I do not have the correct answer to this Question at the moment.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: You' see, this is what the Chair precisely meant, that surely when an attempt is made to answer the wrong Question is a .matter riot to be taken lightly. So, may I request the Minister for Water Development to do a little bit better than that? Mr. Kiilu, do you have any objection to what the hon. Assistant Minister has requested?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIILU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in actual fact, it has been a habit of some Assistant Ministers to answer Questions here without doing their homework. That is the reason why, in most cases, they make a lot of mistakes. How come that the Assistant Minister was answering a different Question from the one I put to the Ministry? Why did he not do his homework Where did he get that answer from?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Mwita): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, with due respect to the hon. Member, I have admitted that it is my fault. When I left my office, I thought I was going to answer Mr. Kiliku's Question and, therefore, I brought with me the reply to Mr. Kiliku's Question instead of the one to Mr. Kiilu's Question. I do apologise to the hon.Member.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIILU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell the House when he is going to bring the correct answer? He should know that Kiliku and Kiilu are two different people. I do not think hon. Kiliku had such a Question as the one the Assistant Minister is trying to pretend to be' answering.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: In any event, it does appear that by the time you will be ready with the answer to this Question it will have been rendered obsolete because the rains are already with us. This is why it should have been answered at the time it was asked. It does refer to "the current dry season" and, therefore, since the rains are here with us, it may very well be that it will not be of any relevance at the time you come to answer it. What do you have to say?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWITA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, since I already have the answer somewhere, I can even answer it tomorrow.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Very well.</Newspeech><Header>POINTS OF ORDER</Header><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Nassir) Naomba ruhusa, Bw.. Naibu.Spika, ili nizungumze juu ya mambo yanayoihusu nchi na yanayosikitisha na anfoayo .yanaweza kuleta hasara kuowa bapa Kenya. Kuna mtindo unaenaelea siku hizi wa kuvafukuza wanafunzi waislanm kutoka shule wanaovaa buiboi au kitambaa kichwani. Mtindo huu ulianzia hapa Nairobi ambapo iTtfanafunzi amoja alifukuswa kutoka Kalsa School kwa sababu' ya mavazi haya. Malalamishi haya yalipomfikia Waziri wa "Elimu, alijaribu kusuluhisha jambo hili.Jusi, jambo hili lilitokea tena Changanrwe Primary School, Mombasa.MbungeKwa bahati, nhewa sehemu hiyo, Bw. Kiliku, aliuliza swali hilo hapa Bangeni na pia wazasi wa mwanafunzi huyo wakapeleka kesi kortini. Jaibo h_ili limetokea tena katika mawakilisho ya mhe. Eemed katika shale inayoitwa The Star of the Sea School. Sasa mhe. Eenied  ahashugh olikaina jambo hili.Tuinekubali hapa Kenya kwamba hatutakuwa na tofauti ya kidini. Pia tumekubali kwamba watu wa dheheba mbali mbali watachanganyana kila pahali hata shuleni bila kuingiliana. Tumekucaliana kwamba tutaishi kwa umoja kwa sababa kila shule hapa Kenya ina vianafunsi kutoka dhehebu mbali mbali. Msimamo vra Serikali unajulikana kuhusu jambo hili na pengine wale wanafanya vitendo hi! wanataka kuliharibu jinan nzuri la Serikali. If there is anybody in Kenya who thinks the muslims are a minority, he is fooling him¬self because we are over seven million people. Kwa hivyo mtu asifanye ujeurina afikirie riwamba waislanra ni wachache kwa sababu tutawasumbua ipasavyo.iiaxarx hii ya. laijariou kuleta xofauxi ncni.ni ra njia kiaini imeonekana katika nchi nyingi na machaxuko mengi yametokea kwa sababa ya kudharau madhehebu nengir.e. Ni lazima kila shule nchini iipatie Viizara ya Elimu kanuni za shule. Hii ni kwa sababu ninajua hakuna kanuni zinazosema kwamba nrusianiu aiLmkristo akiingia hii shule, kwa mzano. asifanye hivi au vile. Sisi viongozi ni lazima tuwe macho juu ya jambo hili.ano</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): On a point of order, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: Hon. Nassir is on another point of order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri); I know. The Chair has allowed me to raise my point of order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I will allow that point of order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): Sir, it is very surprising for an Assistant Minister to stand here and attack the Ministry for Education. A Question was raised in a± this House by hon. Kiliku with regard to some students who were not allowed to attend classes in Changamwe Secondary School because they were wearing veils. The Ministry directed that they be re-admitted to school. Is it proper, Sir, for an Assistant Minister in the same Government to stand here and attack the Ministry of Education instead of consulting the Minister for Education? when I was answering that Question, I made it very clear that the Ministry of Education does not allow any head of a school to expel a student because she is wearing a muslim veil.. The main uniform is worn by all students and muslims can wear the veil if they so desire.Now, is it proper for the Assistant Minister to attack a-'Ministry instead of consulting the Minister in charge?</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: On a point of order, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Obviously, it is not the intention of the. Chair to allow discussion of this sort to take place now because flarin, of tempers does not help anybody. I will only allow hon. Nassir since he is the one who started it all to say something in response to remarks made by hon. Karauri.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MHHSTER FOR IZ5F0RMATI0N AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Nassir): Asante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika.

Nitayaondoa matamshi hayo lakini nitasema yale ninayo kwanza.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: Eapana.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: This is a very simple matter, hon. Nassir. All of us have moments of anxiety and when we lost our tempers. It may have been one of those moments. Can you just withdraw that remark?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Nassir Eaya, Bw. Naibu Spika, nimeyaondoa matamshi hayo. Ni a yangu haikuwa kuituka: Serikali wala wizara ya Elimu. Nilikuwa nikiieleza Wizara yale mambo yanae- ndelea katika The Star of the Sea School, Mombasa. Ninavyozungumza sasa, wanafunzi wanane wamefukuzwa shule. Juzi, nilizungumza na mwalimu mkuu wa shule hiyo juu ya jambo hili na akanieleza "Shule hii ni ya Kikristo na hatutaki wanafunzi wavae 22 mavasi ya Kiislamu. Kuna ubaya gaai kuieleza Wizara kwamba sheria inavunjwa hapa na pale? Wizara imejulishwa janbo hili, kesi zimepelekwa kortini na hali wanafunzi wanaendelea kufukuswa shuleni. Mimi karaa muislamu, nimefanya kosa gani kwa kusema vile tunavyo tendewa vibaya? we need protection in respect of our daughters.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: The House taken note of that matter. I would say that the matter has been settled temporarily because I am sure the Ministry has noted hon. Nassir' s sentiments'. Now, that this issue has been raised, discussion! is open on that particular subject.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: On a point of order, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I am afraid not that subject. That subjectis closed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): Sir, with all due respect I would like to Know who hon. Nassir was referring to whenhe used the word "mjinga".</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Karauri, the hon. Nassir has just wit that unparliamentary remark.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: Did he apologise?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEFUTY SPEAKER: Order! I hope hon. Nassir realises that I was on the Chair when he made that remark. Let us be a little bit more serious and stick to the Standing Orders of this House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: On a point of order, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: No more discussion on this matter.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER.: What is year point of order, Mr. Mwacharo KUBO?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, my point of order is in connexion with our Parliamentary procedures. I still insist that it is wrong for any Member of the Front Bench to stand here and start attacking another Government Ministry. There are very many other ways of doing this. This is a very dangerous precedent. It is dangerous for any Assistant Minister to stand in this House and start attacking the policy of another Ministry without even trying to find out what happened. That can be very dangerous for our future in this country. I am not saying that it is quite okay for Muslims to be discriminated against; that is wrong. But I am saying that there is many other way of handling these matters. This matter could have been raised by .a Back-bencher. My point is that in future there should be no confrontation between Members of the Front Bench.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. Said-Hemed): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. what is going on here is not fair at all. Hon. Nassi has never attacked* the Ministry of Education over this matter. Hon. Kubo can look at the HANSARD; hon. Nassir has never attacked the Ministry of Education. In fact he has praised the Ministry of Education by saying that</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! The kind of clarificationalthoughyou are attempting to make is rather obvious. This is because although Idid concur with hon. mwacharo Kubo that the Front Bench should not sbe seen to be differing on matters of policy I do appreciate the fact that hon. Shariff Nassir just raised a point which did not amount to an attack :n the Ministry of Education. Thatwas not an attack and I hope that hon. Karauri will realise that hon. Nassir was not "attacking" the Ministry. That is a wrong terminology. But indeed there is a concern about what is happening in terms of discrimination and so on. However, hon. Mwacharo KUBO'S remark is also timely; let it not appear that the Front Bench is in conflict one against the other.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri) : On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Not on this matter, Mr. Karauri.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Naibu Spika. Nidhamu- yangu ni k.vamba jana wakati mhe. Nassir alikuwa akizunguinza- hapa juu ya Ho.ja ya Wizara ya vliradi ya Llaji, yeye alisema k.vamba yeye si sawa na wale machifu na manaibu wa machifu smbao mimi hupenda kuwachesea. Pia alisema.kwamba yafaa wakati u.jao V/abunge wawewakipimwa kabla ya kuingia ia nclani ya Bunge ili wale ambao- #wamelewa pombe wakataswe wasiingie hapa. Ni nani al i yemwambia mhe. Nassir kwamba si si Wabunge huja hapa tukiwa walevi? Je, ana wesa kuyaondoa hayo matamshi?</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order! The Chair will not permit any discussion on that matter. That happened yesterday. Hon. Chepkok, you had then the time to stand on your two feet and challenge what hon. Nassir said then. Let us not have ill will between us.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>Mr. CHEPKOK: Bw. Naibu Spika, sikuwesa kuianya hivyo kwa sababu nine. Nassir alikuwa ametoka nje Alik.venda nje sar tu oaada ya ienocix kumaliza kusema yale aliyoyasema. Kva hivyo . utaona kwamba singeweza kasimama kva jambo la nidhamu wakati mhe. Nassir alikuwa kale nje. Ikiwa its mhe. Nassir anajua kwamba mimi nimekuwa nikiwachezea machifu na anaibu wa machifu ningetaka athibitishe jambo liilo mara moja.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I think hon. Nassir has heard the 2 sentiments expressed by hon. Chepkok. So, I think we should let the matter rest there.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Bw. Naibu Spika, ikiwa mhe. Nassir hawezikuyaondoa hayo matamshi yake, ningetaka kusema hivi Kumbe walewaisiamu wenzake ambo walimfukuza kutoka dini ya Uislamu walikuwa na haki ya kufanya hivyo?</Newspeech>(Prolonged laughter)<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order! Order! It has now become obvious</Newspeech>(More laughter)<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER:	Order! It has now becomeobvious that the intention of hon. Chepkok was to even the score and I suppose he is now a lot happier than when he first began!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Jambo la nidha.nu, Bw. Naibu Spika. Mimi nashangaa kusikia kwamba mhe. Nassir alifukuswa kwenye dini ya Uislamu na hali juzi alikuwa amek.venda kule Mecca rhirrr kuhijil Yafaa, Bw. Naibu Spika, utufafanulie zaidi.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is that the- only thing you had to say, hon. Kiliku?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Bw. Naibu Spika, kwa vile jina langu lilitajwa na mhe. Karauri, nilionelea kwamba kulingana na Kanuni sa Bunge hili yafaa niseme machache. Sijui Izama Kiti Id taniruhusu ni s eme mac hac he.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Kiliku, I will not permit you to do that. This is because in any event, hon. Karauri did not refer to you in a derogatory manner. If anything, he did quote, as the authority, the Question that you had brought before the House and which the Ministry of Education tackled as highlight in the policy position ox the Ministry.Hon. Members, the Chair has received a representation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation that they would wish hon. Bidu's Motion deferred. This is because	I think they are involved in some technicalconsultations over this particular matter and when they, advise us to go ahead then I will, at that time, ask hon. Bidu,first to give Notice of Motion. This is because the way he did it yesterday afternoon was a little irregular; it was well past the time allocated for giving Notices of Motions.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WABUGE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I do appreciate the sentiments expressed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation, through the Chair.But what perturbs me is the fact that you have told us that they have requested that the Motion be deferred. May be they are having consultations with the parties concerned. You have gone further to say that after they have given us the green light to go ahead you will ask hon. Bidu to give Notice of the Motion. I do not know what that means because Notice of this Motion was given yesterday. If I am not wrong, this Motion was taken before the Sessional Committee and the Sessional Committee arrived at the decision that this Motion should appear on the Order Paper today. The Government has already taken a decision and all that Parliament should do now is to endorse the action already taken by the Government. This is because the Executive and the legislature are two different institutions. In this respect the Executive has already taken a decision and all that the Legislature is trying to do is to endorsethe action Taken by the Government. The idea here is to strengthen that action. I do not know why the Ministry wants this Motion to be deferred. If the decision taken by the Government is endorsed by Parliament that will place the Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation in a strong position.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I take the sentiments expressed by hon. Wafula Wabuge. I can only wish that the Minister was in the House to further elaborate. But we did receive a verbal communication regarding this matter. I think the Minister is somewhere in Nakuru and it is his very strong wish that this Motion be deferred.As regards the technical point about giving of Notice of Motion, I quite agree with hon. Wfula Wabuge. But I. think for the avoidance of doubt hon. Ali Bidu would be in a better standing if before discussing the Motion whenever it next appears on the Order  Paper he could stand up in the morning and ± gives Notice of the Motion. I think that would be curative of the earlier position because one could stand up and say that the Notice of Motion was irregularly given. So, that was my advice to hon.' Bidu.' I do not think it is a very serious point. This is because as a matter of fact I was myself in the Chair and I could very well accept, if the Minister was ready, the debate on this Motion to continue. I think hon. Members will bear with the Minister over this matter.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Oil a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.We have heard that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and InternationalCooperation has asked that the House defer discussion on this Motion, but whatever appears on the Order Paper is regard as the property ofthis House. There must, therefore, be a consesus as to whether theHouse agrees to that request or not. We are eager to discuss thismatter; the embassy the Minister says he is holding consultationswith has already been ordered to closes down and its officialsleave the country. I think it is a little improper for the Houseto be asked to defer debate on this Motion. The h House should beasked whether it accents the request to defer debate on this Motion>and if it does not accept that request we should continue with our discussions the Motion. We will not need the Minister toreply; we only need to support the decision taken by the Government.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Mwamsandi, I would like the Vice—President and Minister for Finance to say something about this Motion since he is also the Chairman of the Sessional Committee.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR FINANCE (Prof. Saitoti): Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Indeed, yesterday the Sessional Committee received notification of this Motion and g agreed it be discussed. But in the light of the communication the Chair	from the Minister for Foreign Affairs andInternational Cooperation, I would urge the hon. Members to accept that communication in good faith. If the Minister has asked for postponement of debate on this Motion he must be having some very good reasons. I hope that when he comes he will be able to		explain to this hon. House why it -was necessary for him to ask fordeterrent of debate of the Motion. So, urge hon. Members to accept the Minister's request in good faith. Thank you, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

BOY: Ahsante saii Naibu Spika pilikuwa nikiombakwamba kamati teule iundwe kuchunguza swala la. mask.vata katikakoa wa Pwani ambako kuna shida hii. Nililigawanya swala la maskwatana nikaongea kwa kirefu kohusu mask.vata walio katika ardhi ya watubinafsi. Sasa nataka kuongea juu ya maskwata walio katika ardhiya Serikali. Tatlizo lililoko ni kwamba mar a nyingi Serikaliihapofanya mpango wa kuwasaidia maskwata unaharibiwa na maofisawenye hila. Serikali huwa inaliweka swala la maskwata katika mikonoya maofisa wa utawala ambapo mkuu wa wilaya hutoa mamlaka k.vamkuu wa tarafa naye mkuu wa tarafa anamwachia chifu wa.jibu wakuwasaidia mask.vata. lakini n mara nyingi machifu huwa na orodhaya watu wasio maskwata ambao huwa amefanya mipango fulani nao. Kwasababu hii wakati Serikali inapoanzisha makao utaona watu wasiomaskwata wanapewa ardhi katika makao hayo. Kva nfano, katika mpangowa makao wa Iviagarini kuna mtu anayeitwa Llbuta Yitu ambaye ameishi Llagarini kwa mud a murefu. Lakini wakati mpango wa makaowa Iviagarini ulipoanzishwa ploti yake numbari 1267 ilipewaBw. Isaac Kirimi, nayo ploti 190 ya Eitsao Ndsulo ilipewa.B.w. Johnson Karioki. Sasa hatu.jui npango huu uliku\wya wa kuuasaidia maskwata au ulikuwa wa kusaidia watu ambao hawakuwa msaskwata. Huu ni axano tu 77a yale yanayoianyika.Bw. Naibu Spika, svrala la Easkwata katika ardhi ya . Serikali liniesidi kutatiza kwa sababu kila ofisa mara syingi huwa watu wake zaz. ambao anataka wapewe ardhi na njia hiyo saskr.vata r;a kweli hurra. wanakosa nafasi ya kupata ardhi. Sasa imebaki" aiaka mivrLli turudi ksva vzananchi, ambao bado ni aaskwata, na kuvraoraba na ni makosa kwetu kuomba kura na kupata uheshimivya kutoka kwa watu ambao wanaendelea kwa saskvyata.Kwa hivyo, tunataka kulitatua tatizo hili ill rrananchi iyaone kuwa waliwacb.agua watu waaaowafikiria. Tunataka kamati teule ya Wabunge na si ya maoxisa wa utawala ambao hawawa.jall jvananchi kwa sababu hawachanguliwi nao kama sisi. Turne kana hiyo itapendekesa suluhisho toxauti kvra sehemu. mbali mbali kama Syale na Malindi kwa sababu matatizo ya klla sehemu ni tofauti na natatizo ya sehesra nyingine. Ninaposeima hapa kule Enale kuna maskwata wanaofuga kondoo na mbuzi na jana tulienda kumwona Waziri wa gredi. kuhusu natatizo yao</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. NDZAI: Jambo la nidhanu, Bw. Naibu Spika. Ingarra ninaunga mkono kabisa yale she Boy anayosema, anawesa kutueleza toxauti baina ya wasiri wa "gredi" na Waziri asiye wa Gredi?Ntu wa gredi, ni mtu mwenye cheo cha juu. Kuna pia ng'ombe wa gredi, yaani ngombe va kali ya juu. Ninavyosema kwamba huyu waziri rd Waziri wa gredi, hivyo si iaisema ana cheo cha juu kuwashinda Mawaziri WOrgine, lakini kwa maoni yangu, ninafikiria kwamba huyu. Waziri amefikia cheo cha hali ya juu sana. Ninasema hivyo kwa sababtu tulipolipeleka jambo hili kwa Waziri huyu, tuliambiwa tulipeleka janbo hilo kwa administration. Sasa hapo ndipo pana hataxi kubwa kwa sababu maskwota wanafukuzwa. Jambo linalofanyika katika lile shainba la Serikali liitvalo "Sheep and Goat Farm", kule kwale ni i kwamba orodha ya majina ya maskwota iliyoko si ile orodha iliyoko katika afisi ya Mkuu wa Vfilaya Kwale. Hivyo ni kusema kuna orodJha mara mbili ambazo hazikubaliani. Vfakati huu Bunge hili likifungwa na tfabunge kuambiwa waingie katika uc haguzi mpya, sisi kweli tutaweza kurudi tena kapa Bungeni. Ni lazima tuwasaidie hawa wananchi na kama hatuwezi kuwasaidia basi tuwaambie wazi kwamba hatuwezi kuwasaidia. Wale smbao ni Mawaziri wa Serikali ambao wanapeperusha benaera, wasisahau jinsi walivyoyapata aadaraka hayo. Zwanza walichaguliwa katika Sunge hili baada ya uchaguzi wa Mlolongo, na baadaye wakachaguliwa na Xtukufu Rais kuwa Mawaziri. Hivyo ni kusema kama wananchi hawangewachagua, wahangekuwa Mawaziri.Ni lazima walielewe janibo hili.Bw. Haiku Spika, hii ndiyo sababtu tungetaka kamati teule ya wabunge iundwe ili kulichungua jambo hili. Ajabu ni kwamba kuna tabia ya wbunge wa Viti vya Mbele kulipinga jambo kama hili na sijui ni kwa nini S3 wanafanya hivyo. Jambo hili liaekubaliwa chini ya Kanuni zetu za 3unge. Hivyo ni kusema kwamba kamati kama hiyo inetiliwa nguvu na inaweza kuundwa na kutumiwa nje ili kuchunguza jambo lolote na kurudisha ripoti yake katika Bnge hili Kuna dhsmbi gani kwa kufanya hivyo? Sisi sote tulichaguliwa katika Sunge hili ili kuwakilisha maslaM ya v.'ananchi watukufu, na tangu tulipoupata Uhum wetu, sasa ni oiaka 27 na ni jambo la aibu kuendelea kuzungumza jj juu ya tatizo la maskwota na liwa hivyo, ni lazima suluhisho la kudusiu lipatikane; zjl ni lazima sisi kama vawakilishi wa wananchi, tuweze kuyatoa saoni yetu. Hatutaki nia ya luibadilisha Iloja hii iwe nia ya koiua. Ikiwa Waziri 3± ana nia ya kuiua Hoja hii, heri angekunsbuka kwamba ucfcaguzi wa mlolongo unsangojsa mnamo nwaka.1993 na yeye paaioja na wengine hapa, watatokwa na jasho. Hii ni kwa saiiaifct sababu .wananchi wanasikia yote yanayOseaa katika 3unge hili kwa makini sana. Kwa hivyo, waziri asichukuliwe na emotion na kwenda haraka haxaka. Ni lazima tukuabuke kwaaoa kipindi chetu si cha aiaka aitano na ni lasima oaada ya suda huo, turudi kwa wananchi. Kwa hivyo, -faziri asijidai kwa kuketi katika ~i± kiti cha mbele na kupigwa picha ya televisheni ya presidential Press Unit. 2Ji lazisna afahamu kwamba madaraka hayo aaepatiwa na wananchi. Usifikiii yuko pale kwa sababu ya uhohari wako, la, ni kwa sababu ya aadaraka i uliyopewa na w?-nanchi na muda wako sasa ukaribu kwisha.Kwa hivyo, ningewaomba Mawaziri waiunga mkono Hoja hii ill tume hii iwese kuundwa. ITinasesa hivyo kwa sababu wao ndio muhimu sana. Pia, ningewaomba Viazunge wenzangu walioko katika Viti vya 2Tyuma, waunge mkono Hoja hii oil a kusita kwa sababu tatizo la maskwota linaeleweka vizuri. Kwa hivyo, ni lazima Wizara iyasikilize rcaoni yetu ili kamati ya wabunge kaaa kumi au 20 iundwe ili kulichunguza jambo hili na kutoa ripoti kwa 3unge hili tukufu.Kwa hayo machache, ningewaomba 5 Mawaziri wenye gredi ya juu, kama mhe Nassir na wenza Damoja na wabunge wenzangu, riaiunga nacsoa mkono Hoja hii. i;ingekuomba, Bw. Naidu Spika,Bw. Kirwa aniafiki katika Hoja hii.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. MIRWA: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chance to contribute to this important Motion. I am saying this is a very important Motion because it touches on a very serious social problem that we have in our country at the moment, While the Motion strictly talks about the squatters' problem at the Coast, the solution that is going to be found to this problem, is going to effect squatters throughout the county. I am saying , this because the squatters problem, although it may be a unique problem in certain areas, is a general problem in this country.	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, time is now ripe for a select committee to be selected since this is a problem that has been lingering ever the years. I am saying this because these squatters have been increasing in population year after year. The issue at hand is of genuine squatters. At the moment, there is a problem of identifying genuine squatters. This problem has been made worse by people who misuse their posizious to require plots tamarent to settle the landless. For example, if a piece 0f land has been identified and set aside to settle the landless, you will find, that within a few days, somepeople have taken possession of that land and put up houses roofed withcorrugated iron sheets and you wonder where these people have been squatting.This people have money to build good houses and one wonders where squatterslike themselves got the money from. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as we look at this squatters issue, we must seriously consider what is the largest size of land that one should own in this country. I am saying this because it is important for us to know whether it is  economically viable for an individual to own large tracts of land while there are many other Kenyans who do not own even a single plot. The issue of squatters has been brought about by the escalating price of land, within a very short period, you find that a piece of land may escalate by 2 Shs.10,000 per a acre or even more. So, this select committee will also address itself to the question of land pricing in this country and explore the possibility of asking Government to subsidize to the cost of land so that the landless can afford to buy a piece of land at a reasonable price.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is also the issue of absent landlords; people who have acquired large tracts of land which lie idle for years. This select committee will endeavour to find out who these people are with a viewto recommending to Government that such land be taken over to settle the landlessThis committee should also consider the possibility of locating land where someof these landless people could be settled, He can all remember that immediatelyafter independence, there were certain people settled in the Mwea areaand other areas in the country. These areas were marginal in terms of production and they are now doing something good to this country. The committee will take up the responsibility of looking for ways and means of settling the landless The Government should on its part, set aside funds to provide water in some of these marginal areas so that they could be used to settle wananchi. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other issue that we ought to look into very seriously really, is the question of creating awareness in our people’s minds about the seriousness of selling land. I am saying this because there are some people who have been made landless due to sale of land some of their relatives. For example, if a husband decides to sell the Only piece of land he has, his family is going to be rendered landless. This is a very serious matter and I think Government should step in so that wananchi are not rendered landless due to careless sale of land.The other point which I would like to xx raise is about squatters in forest areas. We know that many squatters have been evicted from forest areas although the Government has tried to look for an alternative way of settling these people. However, the practice of evicting these people have not been proper. So, it is for this select committee to consider cases where the landless have been evicted with a few to looking for alternative land on which to settle these people, Some of these forest areas have not been clearly gazetted as forest areas and therefore, there is a lot of confusion in that some people say that this is a no-man's land, only later to be evicted by the Government.These are the issues that we should look at in terms of the select committee. The other reason why I believe this select committee should be there is that we hon. Member's of Parliament elected by our people, and we are going to give this problem a human touch, an aspect the Administration cannot provide. As has been said by the Mover of the Motion, the Administration is concerned with the exigencies of solving the problem, and not with the human suffering experienced by the people who are removed from these pieces of land. So, it is time this House appointed a select committee to look into this problem. This social problem does not relate to Coast Province alone; it touches on the political aspect of our country since it relates to people who can easily be manipulated by the detractors of our establishment.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this House can also look for ways of trying to reduce the creation of more squatters. As much as we would like to solve this problem, it is not always going to be possible to give land to every person in the country. What is important, however, is what we should do so that if somebody does not have a piece of land, he can get gainful employment somewhere. Even if somebody does not have a piece of land, it is important that he is usefully employed somewhere. The other issue is that the public, too, should learn how to live without a piece of land, being aware of the policy established by this House in appointing a select committee. There are some squatters who, having known that a certain piece of land is going to demarcated, move into it within a short time of six months or so. These are the people who give a lot of problems to the Government in sorting out who is a true squatter and who is not. In the end, you find that many true squatters are flushed out of the place even though they may have been living there for more than 40 years.The House should seriously consider ways of land allocation because there are many people who end up having double allocation. You will find that plot No. 150, for example, is allocated to Mr. A and, after a short time, it is allocated to a different person. This is an issue with regard to which the proposed select committee could find ways of trying to strengthen the system so that double allocation does not arise. The Ministry should also look at the laws of this country to ensure that before somebody is given a plot by the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Physical Planning, he gets a letter to show that the piece of land is. wants is not occupied by somebody else. Some people have been rendered squatters because they get an allocation of, say, 200 acres of land from the Ministry's headquarters, but when they go to the ground, they find that there are other people who have been living there and even paid some money to the land office in the district. These people are thereby rendered squatters. This is the issue that the Ho use should address itself to once it appoints a select committee.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is also the issue of land acquisition in dubious ways. Just because a piece of land has not been registered under anybody's name, somebody organises himself and gets a title deed from the Ministry's headquarters, but when hegoes to the ground he finds that somebody else has been living there for the last 40 years and he calls him a squatter whereas it is he himself who should squat on the latter person's land because he came in only two or so days ago. This issue cannot be solved by the Administration because some of the people involved are so powerful that the Administration does not have teeth strong enough to bite them. This is why it is timely to form a select committee of the House.For many, years now, there has not been a select committee of the House, and the only way in which we can impart our image to the public and show that we are still accountable to the public is by having a select committee. We know that all hon. Members of this House support the Government fully and that the findings they are going to come up with will give us better solutions to this squatter problem. This is the issue at hand, and the Minister should look at it in that particular light. It is not a matter of confrontation between the Back and the Front Benches; it is an issue that we need to solve as a country.With these remarks, Sir, I beg to second the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Nassir): Bw. Naibu Spika, mambo ya skwata katika Mkoa wa Pwani hayatamalizika sasa kwa sababu hatujakuwa tayari kuyamaliza./Wr. Deputy Speaker left the Chair//The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Tuva) took the Chair/Kuna maelfu ya ekari za ardhi kule Lamu, Kwale na Kilifi ambako wananchi ambao wamekuwa wakiishi ndani yake kwa miaka mingi bado huitwa maskwata. Watu hawa walizaliwa huko na bado wanaishi huko, lakini bado wanaitwa maskwata na hali wao si maskwata. Hawa ni watu ambao bado hawajapata hati za kumilki ardhi hiyo. Ikiwa Wizara haiendi kuwagawanyia watu hawa ardhi hiyo na kuwapa hati za kuimilki ninawasikitikia. Ninawaonea huruma watu wa Kwale, Kilifi na Lamu ambao wamekuwa wakiishi huko maisha yao yote' na hawataji hata kuvuka barabara ya Mombasa-Nairobi Wengine wao hata hawaujui Mji wa Nairobi kwa sababu wanaamini kwamba pale walipo ndipo kwao. Ni sawa sawa kuv/a na tume teule, lakini tunafaa kuondoa ile taabu" iliyoko kwanza. Taabu iliyopo inahusu ugawanyaji wa mashamba yaliyomo kwa wananchi wanaoishi ndani yake. Baada ya kupigania Uhuru, tulikuwa na msimamo uliowaelekeza watu kurudi mashambani wakalime. Ninaiomba Wizara iwe na settlement schemes ambako watu wetu watakwenda kulima. Maskwata wa Pwani hawawei kumalizika kwa sababu kila settlement scheme inapoundwa, hatufikirii kuwapa maskwata hawa ardhi hiyo kwanza. Tunawaona Wakenya wengine ndugu zetu wakija na kupewa ardhi hii. Tunakubali kwamba sote ni Wakenya, lakini ni lini tutakapotatua tatizo la maskwata kule Pwani ikiwa hawapewi nafasi ya kwanza? Mhe. Tuva mwenyewe, hata ingawa ni mhe. Mbunge, atakuja kustaafu siku fulani na ni lazima awe na pahali pa kulima. Mambo nivivyo hivyo kwa mhe. Keah na Shariff Nassir Nkiwatafuta maskwata wote na kuwaweka katika mipango ya raakao, basi hakutakuwa na taabu. Yafaa pia Waziri mwenyewe achukulie masilahi ya wenzake katika Mkoa wa Pwani ambao ni maskwata na awakatie mashamba na kuwapa vyeti vy.a kumiliki mashamba kwa sababu hiyo ni njia moja ya kuwasaidia. Mpaka sasa kuna maskwata ambao wanakalia ardhi ya Serikali Hata ikiwa mtu ana shamba lake, hawezi kuja kabisa ni yake mpaka apatiwe hati ya kulimiliki. Ukienda Lamu, Kilifi au Mtwapa utamsikia maskini wa Mungu akisema ana shamba na huku hana hati ya kulimiki. Kama ni hivyo huna shamba; hilo ni shamba la Serikali. Kwa hivyo, sisi Wahe. Wabunge kutoka Mkoa wa Pwani tuna jukumu la kuhakikisha kwamba wajukuu wetu hawa- takuja kulia katika makaburi" yetu. Kama halutekelezi wajibu wetu vizuri, watoto wetu na wajukuu wetu watakuja kulia na hakutakuwa na makaburi wakati huo. Kwa hivyo, tuna jukumu kubwa la kuiomba Serikali yetu tukufu ihaikikishe kwamba mashamba yamekatwa na watu wamepatiwa vyeti vya kuyamiliki.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, nataka kukariri tena kwamba ikiwa kuna mipango ya makao yafaa Wizara iwatafute maskwata kokote waliko na kuwaweka huko na kuwapati hati za kumiliki mashamba ili waweze kuishi huko. Katika Mkoa wa Pwani tuna shida kwa sababu maskwata walio huko si watu asili wa sehemu hiyo. Kenya ni moja, lakini maskwata wengine wengi ni wa kujibandika. Kwa sababu maskwata wa kujibandika ni wengi, wale maskwata wa kweli wamekuwa hawawezi kupata haki. Kwa hivyo, ni lazima tuwe watu wa kusema ukweli na kuwaonyesha watu wetu mahali panapofaa kuwa wakiishi. Ni lazima ndugu zetu wa Mkoa wa Pwani watupilie mbali mtindo wa zamani wa kusema, kwa mfano, hawawezi kwenda mahali kama vile Magarini au Lamu. Tukika taa sisi, kuna wenzetu ambao watayachukua mashamba hayo na hakutakuwa mtu wa kulilia. Kwa hivyo, kila mhe. Mbunge, akijua kwamba kwake kuna mipango ya makao au kuna mashamba yanayopeanwa, basi ni juu yake kuwaambia wenzake wayachukue ili sote tuishi sawasawa.Bw. Naiibu Spika, uteuzi wa kacati ya kuchunguza matatizo ya maskwata katika Mkoa wa Pwani imeundwa mara ya kwanza na ya pili na nilikuwa mwanakamati.Tulitoa mapendekezo yetu lakini kitu kikubwa ni kwetu we'nyewe\ kila upande wa Mkoa wa Pwani, kuhakikisha kwamba ndugu zetu wamepata ardhi na wale hawajapewa hati za kuyamiliki mashamba yao waililie ofisi ya Waziri huyu ili wapewe hati hizo. Ikiwa ni mtu wa Lamu na anajua kwamba ardhi ya kwao haijakatwa, yafaa alisema jambo hilo peke yake. Hata akisema mambo mengine kama ya afya au elimu na watu wake wawe hawana hati za kumiliki mashamba, basi huyo si kiongozi. Ikiwa kwa mfano, watu wa Kwale hawana hati za kumiliki mashamba, basi huko hakuna viongozi. Ikiwa watu wa Kilifi hawana hati za kumiliki ardhi na huwezi kwenda kwa Waziri -kumwomba awapatie hati hizo, basi una makosa. Hakuna. mtu yeyote, awe tfaziri au mhe. Mbunge, atakayeweza kuukimbia ukweli.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, mambo haya yalinitokea katika Mombasa siku moja. Lakini leo katika Mombasa na Majengo kila mtu ana hati ya kumiliki ardhi yake. Nimesema kwamba kila mtu ambaye ameishi mahali fulani kwa miaka mingi ni lazima apewe hati ya kumiliki ardhi yake. Hakuna maan ya mtu kuwa na ardhi kubwa kama shetani na huku hailirai. Mtu akiwa na ardhi kubwa, anafaa kuwa na kama nyumba 150 na achukue kodi. Kwa hivyo, kila tunapozungumza, ni lazima haya mambo ya ardhi tuyatilie mkazo; tuungamane sisi wenyewe Wahe. Wabunge wa Pwani-na tuseme kwa sauti moja kwa Wizara. Serikali yetu inatupenda na hakuna mtu katika Serikali anayekataa upewe haki yako. Ikiwa wewe mwenyewe kama kiongozi utasimama kwa jukwaa tu na uanze kuongea maneno ya maskwata na hakuna kitu unacho- fanya, basi haina maana. Kwa hivyo, mimi naunga mkono vitendo na si kamati; * kamati za Mkoa wa Pwani zimeundwa nyingi. Ni lazima viongozi wa Mkoa wa Pwani tuungamane na tumwendee Waziri wetu kwa sababu anajua udhaifu wetu ni nini.Kwa hayo machache, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, naunga mkono.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Mbela): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to speak on this Motion.

Carry on, hon. Minister.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Mbela): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. If it makes my hon. colleagues happier, I am quite prepared to speak in Kiswahili.Kwanza ningetaka kukushukuru, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipatia nafasi hii ili kujibu yale machache ambayo nime sikia Wahe. Wabunge wenzangu wakisema juu ya Hoja hii. Ningetaka pia kumshukuru mhe. Boy kwa kuileta Hoja hii. Hoja yenyewe inashikamana na ile sera ya Serikali kuhusu maskwata. Jambo hili limekubalika na hata Mtukufu Rais mwenyewe amekwishatoa amri. Kitendo kilionekana katika Wilaya ya Kilifi kufuatana na amri Mtukufu Rais aliyotoa rowaka wa 1986 kuhusu maskw.ata. Siku hiyo katika Wilaya ya Kilifi tulio zaidi ya hati 2,000 za kumiliki mashamba kwa watu waliokuwa maskwata katika ardhi ya Serikali. Katika sherehe hiyo, kuna hati 54 ambazo nilisimamisha zisitolewe baada yakupekuapekua na kupata kwamba, kama vile mhe. Boy alivyosema, kulikuwa na watu wengine ambao si maskwata halali ambao walikuwa wamejichukulia mashamba. Ajabu nyingine ni kwamb majina yaliyosomwa hapa leo ni baadhi ya majina niliyo kuwa nimeona, na sielewi walikuwa wamezipata hizo hati namna gani baada ya mimi kukataa kuzipeleka kwa Mtukufu Rais zitolewe.Hilo ni jambo ambalo nitachunguza kwa sababu sitaki haki za wanannchi ziondolewe. Jambo lingine, ni kwamba kuna matatizo ambayo husababisnwa na maofisa wetu. Unapata mara nying ile orodha abayo imetayarishwa na chifu huwa ni tofauti na ile ya ukweli. Hambo hilo huleta shida kwa sababu mara nyingi ule mpango tunaotumia kupata majina ni tofauti kwa sababu tunatumiakarnati tofauti tofauti. Ikiwa kamati haituambii ukweli inakuwa ni vigumu katika Wizara kuweza kukataa kila jambo. Kuhusu yale maploti 54 niliyotaja wakati niiipokuwa huko Kilifi nilitaja majina ya wenyewe na baadayi mi kahakikisha kwamba hawakuwa wakiishi katika ile ardhi na hawakuwa na hala ya kupewa hiyo ardhi. Lakin sijui kutakuwa na njia gani ya kuweza kuhakiisha kwamba machifu na machifi wasaidzi wanatayarisha orodha za kweli. Kabla sijawalaumu machifu na machifu wasaidizi kupita kiasi ningetaka kusema kwamba hata kati ya wale maskwota wenyewe kuna wengine ambao si halali. Wakisikia kwamba kuna mpango wa kupeana ardhi mahali wanakuha upesi na kuanza kuipiga bei ile ardhi ambayo wanatazamia kupatiwa. Wakisha fanya hivyo huwa tayari kuiuza hiyo ardhi. Hilio ni jambo ambalo linatupatiia wasiwasi kwa sababu tungetaka kuwasaidia wale ambao ni maskwota wa kweli. Lakin karaa kuna maskwota wa bandia ambao haja yao ni kuifanyia biashara ile ardhi, kile wanachofanya ni kuharibi haki ya wenzao.Katika. Sagarini Settelement Scheme, kumekuwa na mchanganyiko wa wale, wananchi walioko kule na wananchi wengine ambao wametoka sehemu nyingine. Amri ambayo nimetoa ni kwamba mwananchi yeyote ambaye amekwisha lima na ana nyumba yake. hataondolewa mahali pate na ni sharti aonyeshwe mipaka ya ploti yake ili aendelee kulima ikiwa si skwota wa bandia. Nafasi nyingine zikipatikana basi ni heri watu wachaganwe kwa sababu hanuna scheme yoyote katika Wizara ambayo ni ya kabila moja. Tungetaka watu wengi wawe wametoka shememu ile, lakini tutakuwa wachache kutoka sehemu nyingine. Hao wale wachachi ni sharti waitumia ile ardhi na kuhakikisha kwamba wanazalisha chakula sawasawa. Hatutaki wale ambao wanachukua letters of allotment na kungojea wastaafu kutoka utumishi wa serikali ili waende kulima au kwenda kutumia zile hatiza kuimiliki ardhi kupata mikopo katika banki na baadaye kuuza.Kuna maneno yalisemwa kuhusu sehemu ya Lamu. Hili ni tatizo ambalo lina ni husu sana kwa sababu linanipa wasiwasi. Lakini ningetaka vile bile niombe watu wa Lamu wahakikishe kwamba wanapopatiwa ardhi wanaikubali na kuiganyia kazi. Zaidi ya asiii mia 90 ya wale ambao wamepatiwa ardhi' kutoka Lamu, wamepewa state land kwa sababu hakuna trust lands. Wengi wao hawajakubali kuhamia katika ardhi hiyo .na hawaoendi wengine wepewe ardhi hiyo. Je, kama hawaitaki na kawataki kwende kuilima kuna haja gani kila wakati wao kusema kwamba wanataka ardhi ifanywe trust land? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT- MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Nassir) Jambo la nidhaaiu, 3w. Naibu Spika wa Muda. Kule ninakotoka, watu ambao wameishi. huko maishani mwao, bado hawa jagagwigwa aashaoiba kama kule Kericho, Murang'a na kadhalika. Ingefaa, kwa mfano, wakaaji wa Lamu wapatiwe mashamba Lainu lakini si watu kutoka sehemu nyingine.<Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER: That is a point of information, hon. Nassir, and not a point of order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LANDS AND HOUSING (Mr. Mbela): Asante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Mud a. Eafikiri tunaelewana na mhe. Nassir. Nilisema kwamba karaa mwananchi ameishi katika sehemu fulani kwa nrada unaofaa, oasi ingefaq apatiwe ardhi hiyo. Shida iliyoko ni kwamba wenzetu kule Lamu wanapopati: ardhi, hawataki kuihamia sehemu hiyo na kuendeleza kilimo. Kuna sehemu wanapenda lakini haziwatoshi. Siku hizi, huwezi kufanya kiliao cha maana katika hekari moja la shamba. Lakini mwananchi wa sehemi ataridhika na hekari moja ya shamba ambapo atakuza miogo michache. Sisi tungeperida wapate kiwango cha chini cha hekari tano ambapo watafanya kiliino cha maana kwa manufaaya familia nzisa.Mhe. Boy aliongsa juu ya shamba ambalo linatumiwa kwa utafiti naWizara ya Ustawi wa Mifugo na ambayo tungependa kugagwa ili iwe kama settlement Wakati watu wengine waliposikia kwamba tuna mpango huu, waliingilia sehemu hii bila kufuata taratibu zozote. Kwa sababu hii, Serikali ilisica misha mpango huu. na hata wale watu waliokuwa wakiishi huko kwa njia ya haki, walitolewa wote. liilikuwa nineanza kutafuta suluhisho juu ya jambo hili na kama hakungekuwa na i Hoja hii mbele ya Bunge hili, ningekuwa kariba kupata jawabu. Hia yangu ilikuwa ni kuhakikisha kwamba wale watu ambao wameishi katika sehemu hii zaidi ya miaka 15 hawahamishwi.Kwa vile swala hili limekubaiiwa na Serikali na shida hii haikokatika LScoa wa Pwani peke yake, ningependa tuifikirie Kenya nzima tunapoi jadili Hoja hii. Kwa vile Mtukufu Rais petoa zas amri tufanye kasi hii. hakuna haja kwa macni yangu ya kudena kamati itakayotoa pendskezo kwa June na hstinaye kwa ili Rais; ili atoa amri nyingine  Ile amri alitoa mwarzoni nolo itafanya kazi. Tungehimiswa tufanye kazi hi i haraka hadala ya kuuliswa tuunde kamati teule ya kuchunguza jambo hili. Wizara yangu inakubaliana na kiini cha Hoja hii lakini ningependa kufanya marekebisho. rnadogo ambayo ningeiomba Bunge hili liyakubali. Baada ya marekebisho, Hoja hii itakuwa hivi:-"Tunapozidi kuipongesa Serikali kwa juhudi za kutatua ma tatiso ya maskwata kote nchini walakini ongezelco la Hoja kuhusu hali na rnatatizo ya maskwata nchini ladhihirisha. kuzoroteka kwa hali yao; Bunge hili lapendekeza Wizara ya Ardhi na Nyumba iharakishe kusuluhishwa kwa tatiso hili nchini kote Kenya kaambatana na aari ya Serikali"Naomba kupendekezo.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WABUGE: Thank you, Sir. I would like to speak on the amendment which seeks us to base our discussions on the whole country as opposed to Coast Province. Squatters are becoming a problem in this country. Squatters are loyal to the Government ana the leadership of this country. If there is anybody who supports this Government, then they are the squatters. The Government should take the plight of squatters seriously.For example, the problem of squatters has become acute in Trans Nzoia District and it is now a security risk. This problem would have been minimised if the squatters were not displaced. For example, when the Government acquired settlement areas, instead of settling the squatters cn site, they were chased away and new people brought in. Those who were brought in had some land somewhere and their interest was to acquire plots and left them idle for several years. Those who were given these plots later sold them. In other words, they wanted those plots for speculation purposes. This is what is happening in Trans Uzoia District. For example, there is a farm known as Maritati? Muchua where plots were allocate to outsiders who are now selling them.The Minister should make a policy statement to the effect that those who are allocated plots in settlement areas should not sell them and if one wishes to sell his, he should surrender it to the Ministry for re¬allocation. If this is done, the problem of squatters will be minimised. Many people who were living in forests in Trans Nzoia District have been asked to move out and they are now roaming about and they do not have a place to put up homes. For example, they do not have a place to bury their dead. This is a serious issue and I would like to appeal to the Minister to speed up this matter in accordance with the Presidential directive so that this problem can be solved once and for all.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like the Minister to make a policy statement regarding land transactions in this country. He should make it mandatory that from now and onwards before any land transactions are carried out, the people who have been residing on that particular land or farm as squatters or workers should be given first priority. Secondly, he should make it clear that anybody buying a farm because there is that principle of willing buyer willing seller should not chase away or evict the people he finds on the land. In fact the arrangement should be that before the new owner of the land takes over the land he should set aside a portion of that land for the people who are living on that land as squatters, I say this because what happens is that a person buys a farm and what he does the next day is to evict all those people who had been working for the previous landlord. He does this knowing very well that these people have nowhere else to go. These cases are very prevalent in my district; people are zc being chased away and their crops destroyed, Their huts are rased to the ground with bulldozers k just because the new landlord does not want those people to squat on that land. This is a very serious matter and the Government should see to it that nobody plays about with citizens of this country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would now like to touch on the selection of squatters people who deserve to be given land. Surely at one time we said that district select committees should be constituted and that these committees should be chaired by district commissioners. But what has been happening of late is that, these plots have been dished out in here in Nairobi. Even the district commissioners with their select committee do not know who is going to settle on that land. When you ask the district commissioner he tells you that it is the Minister for Lands and Housing who is selecting these people, I So, I urge the Minister to make sure that from today no allocation of land will be done in Nairobi and that it should be done in the districts. Members of Parliament should become members of those select committees to ensure that the people who are being selected are genuinely landless.This country has been Independent for the last 26-27 years and it is wrong for a Kenyan to be called a squatter in  his own country. It is high time that the word "squatter" disappeared completely from our vocabulary. Some land in Trans-Nsoia has been set aside for afforestation and the people have nowhere to	go. I know that the Government wants us to plant more trees. Also the Government wants people. But there is no Government without people. Although the Government wants trees, the first and foremost tiling is to Lave people. If we want trees then let it be the policy of the Government that anybody who Las land should set aside about one quarter of his land and plant trees on it. So. if a person is given two acres of land he should be asked to put aside just one quarter and put it under trees.With those few remarks, I second the amendment.</Newspeech>(Question of the first part of the amendment, that the words to be left out be left out proposed) <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE(Mr. Keah): Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipa nafasi ili niweze kuiunga skono Hoja hii kana ilivyo rekebishwa. Kwanza kabisa ningependa kusema kwamba Mtukufu Rais mwenyewe ametoa maagizo mara kwa sara kuhusu mambo ya maskwata. Ningependa kumshukuru Nitukufu Rais kwa kut oa amri watu wa Kilifi wapewe ardhi. Yeye mwenyewe alikuja Zilifi na kuongoza sherehe za kutolewa kwa hati za kumiliki ardhi kwa watu wa Kilifi. Hawa ni watu ambao walikuwa wakiishi kwenye" ardhi ya Serikali.Kuna mambo fulani anbayo yanatusumbua migaz mioyo sisi watu wa wilaya ya Kilifi. Napendekeza neno "squatter11 rirrr lilaaniwe kabisa. Yafaa neno kama hili liache kutumiwa kabisa hapa Kenya. Hi ni kwa sababu hili ni neno ambalo sisi wenyewe tumelitunga ili kuweza kuwaumiza watu wengine. Tumelibuni neno hili ili kuwaumiza. wale ambao hawana uwezo wa kuweza kujitetea. rTinasema hivi kwa sababu watu wa Kilifi wamekuwa wakiikalia ardhi yao tangu enzi za mababu na mh maoatu. Inafahamika wasi wazi kwamba wakazi wa wilaya ya Kilifi ni wale watu wa Kiji Kenda; wao wamejaa wilaya ya Kilifi. Lakini utaona kwamba watu hawa ambao W3m±ka±x wameikali; ardhi yao tangu jadi sasa wanaitwa "maskwata". Yafaa neno hili litokomee kabisa. lisiwe vinywani vya Wakenya. Hi lazima neno hilo litokomezwe kabisa ikiwa tunataka kudumisha na kutenda haki katika nchi ya Kenya.Katika wilaya ya Kilifi tunakabiliwa na matatizo kadha wa kadha na mehgi ya matatizo haya ni ya utawala. ITingependa kumshukuru Waziri mwenzangu nuie. IJbela lava hatua aiiyochukua kule Kilifi ya kuzikagua kwa is nakini zile hati sa kumiliki ardhi kabla ya hati hi so liutolewa kwa wananchi. Kaziri aliweza kugundua kwamba baadhi ya watu waliokuwa Baadhi ya watu haw a walikuwa ni maoxisa wa kupima mashamba.Inajina yao yalikuwa katika ile orodha ya maskwata. Je, hi ni haki? Kwa hivyo, mi ml namshukuru Waziri kwa hatua aliyo- chukua. Pia ningependa kumhimiza asidi kutekelesa wajibu wake kama Waziri wa Ardhi na Nyumba kwa moyo thabiti. Yafaa awe akivichungaza vitendo vya maofisa wetu wa utawala na hasa wale walio katika Wizara yake pamoja na wale walioko katika wilaya na ambao wanafanya kazi ya kupima mashamba. Yeye ana haki ya kuwang'oa maofisa wale wafisadi.Jambo la kushangaza ni k.vamba watu wanaogawiwa mashamba kwenye ardhi ya Serikali kule Kilifi huwa wametoka hapa Nairobi. Yaonekana kwamba watu wanaoishi kule Kilifi watu wa Miji Kenda-wamesahaulika. Ninaongea juu ya Miji Kenda; yaani Charo, Katana, Darna, Kanze na Farisa ambao wanaishi pale. Watu wa kutoka hapa Nairobi wanapewa ardhi kule Kilifi. Je, ni kwa nini kila atu anataka kwenda kuishi kule Pwani? Je ni kwa nini kila mtu anataka kwenda kuishi kule Kilifi? Ni kwa nini kila mtu anataka kwenda koishi Lamu? Ni kwa nini kila mtu anataka kwenda kuishi Kwale?Kwa nini kila mtu anataka kwenda Taita? Hingetaka kumwuliza Waziri na amenyesha kwamba anaiweza kazi hii ahakikishe kwamba Ndama, Karisa, Kanze na Katana wanapewa nafasi ya kwanza kule Kilifi; hakikisha Mdigo na riauruma wanapewa nafasi ya kwanza kule Kwale; kwamba Mtaita anapewa nafasi ya kwanza kule Taita; kwamba Ifoajuni amepewa nafasi ya kwanza kule kwao Lamu na kwamba Mpokomo anapewa nafasi ya kwanza kule Tana River. Hilo ni jambo ambalo tuna taka kuona linafanyika ikiwa tunataka kuonyesha haki katika Kenya.	Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, tuna shangaa kuona watu wengi wakipewa ardhi huko Pwani. Tunanwunga Waziri awaondoe watu ambao wamepta ardhi Pwani na ambao si wenyeji wa huko. Ingawa wao ni Wakenya hatutaki wawakoseshe watu wa Pwani nafasi ya kupata ardhi. Watu wa Pwani wana haki pia ya kupata ploti ufuoni mwa pahali na kujenga hoteli ili nao watajirikeo kwa vile Karisa au Ndama hawajaenda kuchukua ardhi katika sehemu za watu wengine ni lazima Waziri aone wanapata nafasi ya kwanza huko kwao.Jambo lingine ni kuhusu mipango ya makao; mara nyingi utaona maofisa wa mipango ya makao wana tabia ya kuwaondoa watu ambao wamepanda miti kama minazi wanaondolewa mahali pao na hali hawawezi kuondoka na miti yao. Hinaomba ikiwezekana mtu ambaye ana miti apewe sehemu ambayo amekuwa akituaia na wengine wamepewe ploti mahali pengine.Pia kuna swala la absentee landlords ambao wana tabia ya kuuza ardhi waliopata wakati wa "Mwambao wa Pwani" bileya kujali aasilaiii ya wananchi walioko katika ardhi hiyo. Ningemwomba Waziri kuona kwamba ardhi kama hii haiusiwi mtu mwingine isipckuwa yule ambaye amekuwa akiitumiao Mfano mzuri ni sehemu ya Junju na kule Kilifi ambako tuna watu katika lokeshini nzima na watu waliomo hawajui hiyo ni ardhi ya watu binafsi. Namwomba wasiri ahakikishe kwamba wananchi haoa hawatateswa wakati wenyewe wata poiusa.Pi a ningetaka Waziri aone kwamba wakuu wa tarafa na machifu hawawanyanyasi wananchi. Rais ameagiza wananchi wasinya nyaswe. lakini katika Malindi kumekuwa na visa vya unyanyazajio lakini mimi kama Mwenyeniti wa Kanu wa wilaya hiyo nimepata malalaji mengi ya kuondolewa kwa wananchi kutoka katika ardhi kama wanyamax katika Kenya huru.Kwa hayo machache naunga mkono.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.KILIKU: Ahsante ssa sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda. Ninamshukuru Waziri kwa sababu ya kazi yake nzuri ambayo tunaona dalili zake. Jambo moja ni kwamba sasa watu wa Chaani na Liikindani watapata hati za kumilki mashambani na hawatalcuwa maskwata tena. Kitu ningependa kumfahamisha Wasiri ni kwamba kule Mombasa, hasa Miritini, kuna nyumbani ambazo hazioekani katika ramani ya vvizara ingawa wananchi wameishi katika nyumba hizo kwa miaka mingi. Kwa sababu hii watu wanapoomba ardhi yaku.jengea viwanda na vitu vingine wanasema sehemu wanayotaka haina watu na hali watu wako. Namwomha Waziri asimpe mtu yeyote ardhi kabla ya kuchunguza na kujua kama kuna watu katika sehemu inayohusi Ningemwomba Waziri asitoe ardhi .kwa yeyote katika Miritini na Mikindani huko Changamwe kwa sababu tumetuma maombi kwa Rais ya kutaka watu sehemu hiyo wapewe ardhi hiyo. kwa hivyo, hadi Serikali. itakapotujibu, yeyote  takayeomba ardhi katika sehemu hizi aambiwe ardhi hiyo itatolewa kwa watu wa sehemu hizi kwa sababu tuna watu wengi na shule.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Kuda, makampuni kama Prollo (K) Ltd, Associated Vehicle Assemblers, Ufuta Company Ltd na East African Match Company ambayo yaliomba ardhi kubwa sana, yakairoznia sehemu ndogo ya ardhi hiyo na kuanza kukuza ndizi katika sehemu kubwa, na hali wakazi wa sehemu hiyo hawana ardhi. Hata Kenya Cooperative Creameries ilichukua ekari 30 ingawa haiwezi kuitumia ardhi hiyo yote hata katika miaka 100. Ninaiomba Serikali kuona kwamba ardhi hiyo, ambayo ilichukuliwa kwa jina ya kampuni na ambayo sasa inatumiwa kama mashamba ya ndizi na mahindi, inarudishiwa wenyewe.Kwa wakati huu, Bw. Uaiou Spika wa Muda ile kampuni ya Broilo, inataka kuiziaile kampuni ya Kenatco ile ardhi walioichukua ingawa kuna maskwota katikaardhi hii. Ingawa walipewa ardhi hii ili waweze kujenga, sasa wanataka kuiuzaardhi hii. Yule mwenye kampuni hii aliyekuva akiitwa Brollo, amekufa na 3sasa wanayoi endesha kampuni hii, ndio wanataka kuiuza ardhi hii. i ili lazimahawa watu wazuiliwe wasiiuze ile ardhi kwa sababu kuna maskwota katikaile ardhi. Wakiiuza ardhi hii kwa ile kampuni ya Kenataco, kamapuni hii itawaondoa wale maskwota kule. Ni lazima waziri achukue hatua kuhusu jambo hili. Tunajua kwamba at af any a hivyo kwa sababu tangu alipochukua usukani katika Wizara hii, amefanya kazi nzuri.Bw. Naibu Spika wa muda, hakuna mkoa mwingine katika Kenya hii ambapo kuna matatiso mengi ya ardhi kama ilivyo Mkoa wa Pwani. Hivyo ni kusema kwamba mkoa huundio nambari moja katika matatizo ya maskwota. Ninafahamu kuna sehemu nyingine pia ambazo zina tatizo hili, lakini ukweli ni kwamba sehemu ya pwani ndio inatangulia katika matatizo ya maskwota. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu asilimia 90 ya nyumba katika sehemu hii ni za maskwota na hi si nyumba ni za aina ya zile zilizoko kule I-lajengo. wenye nyumba hizi hawakai kale, lakini wamewakodisha wengine. wengine wa watu hawa wamehama na hawsko katika nchi hii. These people are not in the country,but they continue to get money cut of these houses. Tunamwomba Waziri aitembelee sehemu hii ili kujionea taabu inayowakabili wananchi. Tungetaka ule mpango uliyoko kule Majengo uenezwe kote Mombasa na katika miji ngine katika nchi hii.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, Waziri ameibadilisha Eoja hii na niimi sina ugomvi wowote na badiliko hilo. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu nivizuri sisi kama Wabunge kufikiria matatizo ya Kenya nzima na sio tu matatizo ya sehemu moja. Kwa hivyo, tungetaka pahali popote palipo na matatizo yamaskwota, Waziri achukue hatuaya kuwapatia wananchi mashamba. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu siku hizi hakuna nafasi za kazi, lakird mtu akiwa na ardhi, anaweza kufasya hujudi kubwa ili kuweza kujisaidia. X Waziri aliseaa kvraafca ile aari ya Mtukufu Rais rd lazima ichukuliwe hatua leva haraka iwezekanavyo, ringetaka pia kusema jambo hilo ni lazima litimizwe mara moja anapotoa amri, ni lazima hatua ichukuliwe mara moja. Hatutaka amri iliyotolewa na Mtukufu Raia alipoitembelea sehemu ya Kilifi icheleweshwe. Mimi nilimsikia akitca amri hii. Vile vile, alipoitembelea sehemu ya Mombasa juzi, nilimsikia akisema ikiwa mtu ameupanda ata mnazi na anaambiwa shamba si lake, hilo jambo haliwezi kukubaliwa. Wakati alipoupanda ule mnazi aunbao sasa uko futi 60, - wewe unay emwambia ati ile ardhi si yake umekuwa wapi kwa muda huo wote? Kwa hivyo, ni lazima ile amri ya Mtukufu Rais itekelezwe. kwa haraka iwezekanavyo. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu kwa wakati huu, wananchi wako na matatiso mengi sana.Bw. Naibu Spika, tunafahamu kuna watu wengine wanaposikia kwamba ardhi fulani itatolewa kwa wasio na ardhi, wanajiirgiza katikati ya maskwota kama mohuzi unavyojiingiza kwa ugali. Lakini tunafahamu kuna machifu, machifu wasaidizi na maofisa wengine wa Serikali ambao wanapaswa kuwaordoa hawa watu. Ikiwa kwa nas mfano watu wan at oka katika sehemu nyingine na kuingia kule Miritini, sisi sote katika Miritini tunawafahamu. Hatuwezi kuendelea kuimba wimbo wakati wote kwamba hakuna ardhi bila kuchukua hatua yoyote. Kwa hivyo, ningetaka kumwomba Waziri apiga simu kule Mombasa na kuizia kampuni ya Srollo isiiuzeTile ardhi. Hi lazima njia kwa itafutwe ya kuwapatia icnzaks ardhi ma.skwota walioko katika ardhi hii. Wakiruhusiwa kuiusa ile axdhi, wataniletea shida kubwa na sitaki kupata shida zaidi ya zile nilizo nazo.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ardhi katika rchi hii yetu ni muhimu sana. Ardhi ndiyo iliwafanya watu wa Kenya wapiganie Uhuru wetu. Nilisoma historia ya hayati Jomo Kenyatta na kusikia kwamba alipokwenda kale London kwa mara ya kwanza, alikwenda kule kuyapeleka malalamiko ya ardhi na jambo hili likawafanya watu wetu wengi wauawe na kuitwa kila aina ya majina na wabeberu. Hii ndiyo ilikuwa sababu ya kwanza ya watu wa Kenya l-rupigania uhuru. wabeberu walipoingia Kenya, walichukua ardhi yetu na ikiwa hili jambo lilitufanya turn wage damu yetu na viongozi wengine kama hay ati Jomo Kenyatta wakafungwa, ni lazima tujihadhali sana na mambo yanayohusiana na ardhi. Sasa ni miaka 27 taangu. tulipopata uhuru na inaonekana kwamba hakuna suluhisho lolote ambalo limcpatikana kuhusu matatizo ya maskwota. Hi ajabu kwamba baadhi ya wasio na mashamba ni wale wazee ambao walipigania uhuru, na hili ni jambo mbaya sana. Ardhi ni jambo muhimu sana na kwa hivyo, wale maskwota wanaopati mashamba, ni lazima wasiyauzie mtu yeyote. ITitaka kuchukua nafasi hii kuwaonya watu wachache katika sehemu yana, waikomeshe tabia ya kuuza ploti ambazo wamepatiwa na Serikali kule Mikindani.Kwa hayo machache, naunga mkono.</Newspeech>(Question of the first part of the amendment, that the words to be left out be left out, put and agreed to)(Question of the Second part of the Amendment, that the words to be inserted in the place thereof be inserted, put and agreed to)(Question of the Motion as amended proposed)</Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Kachila): Ahsante sana Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda kwa kunipatia nafasi hii ili nami niweze kuyatoa mawazo ya wananchi kuhusu nambo ya ardhi. Ninapoiunga mkono Hoja ka_ma i1ivyobadi1ishwa, ningetaka kuishukuru Serikali kwa mipango inayofanya ya kuwapatia wananchi makao. Lakini kama vile mwenye kuileta Hoja hii alivyosema, ningetaka tuwe waangalifu sana kuhusu jaabo hili la ardhi. Ardhi ndiyo liwafanya vakenya kupigania Uhuru; ardhi ndiyo iliwafanya wenzetu wafungwe jela na kwa hivyo, sisi kama watu huru, ni lazima tuyaaxigalie mambo ya maskwota.Mipango tunayofanya ya kuwapa wananchi ardhi inafaa kuwa ya aina ambayo itakubaliwa na vizazi vijavyo kwa sababu tukipanga mipango leo na kuwapa ardhi watu ambao hawana shida bali wana lengo ya kuiuza ardhi hii, tutakuwa na shida kesho na wananchi watauliza.ni kwa nini tulifanya hivi. Sisemi jambo hili kwa ukabila kwa sababu katika kila sehemu ya Kenya kuna watu wanaoishi humo, na ingefaa mipango yetu iwe mizuri ili watu waliozaliwa mahali fulani wasije kutotosheleka nyumaye kutokana na mipango tunayopanga sasa hivi. Ardhi ndiyo chanzo cha maendeleo na utajiri, na tukipanga mipango mibaya ya kutoa ardhi hii leo, watu wengine watakuja kujiuliza, "Ikiwa sisi ni wazaliwa halisi wa sehemu hii, ni kwa nini hatuna ardhi?" na hapo wataanza kupekuapekua files na itaonekana kuwa palikuwa na ukosefu fulani katika mipango tunayopanga sasa. Kwa hivyo, mipango tunayofanya sasa inafaa kufanywa kwa uangalifu sana. Mambo tunayozungumza hapa leo na yale yaliyozungumzwa mbeleni ni ya maana sana, na yanafaa kuzingatiwa. Ninashukuru kwa sababu Waziri anayehusika na jambo hili yuko hapa sasa na anayasikia maoni ya waheshimiwa Wabunge.Waziri anafaa kujua kwamba waheshimiwa Wabunge wanafaa kupewa nafasi kubwa sana katika maeneo yao ili wazungumze juu ya mambo ya ardhi na maskwata kwa sababu nikichaguliwa na wananchi huwa nimechaguliwa na majority ambao wanajua kwamba nitawatetea, hasa kuhusu shida zao zinazohusu ardhi. Kwa hivyo, nisipopewa nafasi ya kutoa maoni yangu au maoni yangu yakipuuzwa, huku ni kuwanyima wananchi walionichagua haki yao. Kwa hivyo, tunaomba waheshimiwa wabunge wapewe nafasi kuzungumzia mambo yote yanayofanyika mawakilishoni mwao.Nikirudi katika Hoja yenyewe, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, hasa jambo la ardhi ya Serikali, ningependa kusema kwamba wananchi wengine wametoa heshima kubwa kuhusu ardhi hii na hawaingii ndani yake. Hata hivyo, utakuta kwamba wananchi wengine wanaletwa na malori makubwa na kuingizwa ndani ya ardhi ya Serikali ambapo wanakuwa maskwata. Tunataka jambo hili liangaliwe. Kule Taita, kwa mfano, tunaiheshimu ardhi ya Serikali na hatuingii ndani yake kwa sababu tunangoja kuomba ardhi kwa njia iliyo sawa sawa. Lakini utakuta kwamba malori kama tisa au 10 yameleta wananchi wengine kutoka sehemu nyingine eti kwa sababu hawa ndio walio na shida kubwa zaidi ya ardhi, na tukianza kuingia humo pamoja nao, fujo inatokea. Tafadhali jambo hili linafaa kuangaliwa hata ingawa sote katika Kenya tuna shida ya ardhi. Wananchi hawa wengine wanaokuja kuvamia ardhi ya Serikali katika maeneo ambayo yaraekuwa yakilindwa na wananchi wazaliwa wa huko. Ikiwa wananchi hawa wazaliwa wa huko wakomba ardhi hii wakifuata sheria wanaitwa maskwata kesho yake, jambo hili litakuja kuleta shida.Sehemu nyingine kule kwetu, kama vile Taveta, Mwatate na Voi, zinaingiliwa na wageni kutoka sehemu nyingine ambao huanza ktusumbua huku wakisema kuwa wao ni maskwata na hali wao si maskwata halisi. Wengine wao huwa wametoka maili 200 kutoka sehemu hizi. Ikitangazwa kwamba kutakuwa na settlement scheme mahali. fulani, hata kabla ya viongozi waliochaguliwa kuangalia ni nani watakaopewa ardhi hii, watu wengine huwa tayari wameingia humo. Tunataka watu hawa wasipewe ardhi hiyo kamwe, bali wapewe wale ambao walikuwa wanafikiriwa kuipewa ardhi hii. Wenye kutenga ardhi hii huwa wanawajua wale wenyeji walio na shida. Kwa hivyo, hili ni mojawapo ya mambo tunayotaka yaangaliwe na kamati zinazopanga mipango hii.Watu fulani walijinyakulia ardhi kubwa sana katika maeneo ambamo tunaishi, na sasa wameanza kuyagawanya mashamba yao na kuuza ploti ili wajipatie faida wakati ambapo kunao wale ambao hawana ardhi hata kidogo. Tutakuwa tUkifanya kazi gani ikiwa tutaliacha jambohili liendelee vile lilivyo sasa? Waziri, ambaye yuko hapa nasi sasa, anafaa kulichunguza jambo hili. Mwenye shida ya ardhi ni yule ambaye hana kipande cha ardhi.hata kidogo. Ikiwa mtu ana ardhi kubwa kiasi cha kuuza sehemu moja, kweli huyu ana shida? Ni kwa nini alipewa ardhi hiyo ambayo haitumii kwa minajili ambayo ilimfanya aombe kuipewa? Ningetaka tutie mkazo kwamba mtu akipewa ardhi aitumie, na akiona kwamba hana haja nayo asipewe nafasi ya kuiuza, kwa sababu kuna wananchi wengine ambao wanafaa kuipewa. Mtu akiuza ardhi hii, matajiri walio na ardhi mahali kadha watainunua na hapo hatutakuwa tumeyatatua matatizo ya wananchi halisi ambao hawana ardhi. Kwa hivyo, jambo hili la kuuza ardhi hii linafaa kuondolewa, ndipo ikiwa huitumii ardhi uliyopewa aurudishe kwa Serikali ili ipewe watu wengine wasio na ardhi. Hata ploti nazo ziwe zikitolewa kwa utaratibu huu pia. Kwa njia hii, tutaiondoa shida ya wananchi ambao hawana ardhi kweli, lakini tukiwaacha wale ambao wanataka kuuza ardhi waliyopewa, watakoinunua ni wale wenye pesa. Wale wananchi ambao hawana pesa ndio pia hawana ardhi. Matajiri hawana shida ya ardhi kwa sababu wana ploti za biashara mahali kwingi. Kwa hivyo, tunataka jambo hili liingiliwe kwa uangalifu sana.	Jambo lingine, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ni kwamba kule kwetu, kwa mfano, kunao watu walionunua mashamba zamani na sasa wameanza kuyauza, huku wananchi. wengine wakiwa wameishi hapo kwa zaidi ya miaka 50. Ninajua kwamba Waziri analijua jambo hili kwa sababu nimezungumza naye juu yake. Wale walionunua ardhi hii hawaacha kitendo cha kuipima na kuwasumbua wananchi wanaoishi hapo. Ningewaomba wale walionunua ardhi hiyo, ambayo huitwa Vindu (?) Multi-purpose, waache kuwasumbua wananchi wa Kirutai (?) ambao walezaliwa hapo. Aliyetwaa ardhi hii wakati huo alisema tu, "Nitaichukua eneo hili, kutoka hapa penye mti huu mpaka kuleee mlimani ule" bila ya wananchi waliokuwa wakiishi huko kujua ni kitu gani kilichokuwa kikiendelea. Baadaye ugawanyaji wa ardhi ulifanywa wakati. huo huo wa wakoloni. Ardhi hii inauzwa sasa, na wale ambao wameishi hapo kwa zaidi ya miaka 50 ndio wanaoitwa maskwata. Hii si hak;, na tunasikitika. Tungependa wananchi hao, ambazo ninajua Waziri ana majina yao, wafikiriwe kwa sababu wale walioinunua ardhi hiyo wanaendelea kupima ploti na kuziuza huku wakiwanyanyasa wananchi walio huko. Wanapima ploti mpaka karibu na nyumba ya mtu, na hii si heshima. Ikiwa tunajivunia Uhuru wetu katika Kenya, ingefaa wananchi hao waheshimiwe pia. Kwa hivyo, ningeiomba Wizara hii iliangalie hasa eneo hili la Kirutai na mengineyo kama hili.Hatukatai kuwapa ardhi wenzetu ambao hawana ardhi. Kule Voi, tuna mchanganyiko maalum wa watu. Kuna settlement scheme ya Buhuta.na tungependa mpango ufanywe hili wale ambao hawana ardhi kweli, hasa Wataita, wapewe ardhi hapo. Utaona kwamba watu wengine wageni hapo ndio wanaofanya fujo na kuwafukuza wenyeji.Kwa hayo machacho, wasiukuru kwa kunipa nafaoi hiiMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, histoically Trans Nzoia District is an area where we have the largest number of squatters. The Mover of this Motion has had a chance to travel through Trans Nzoia District, and he does realise the problem we have there. I am one of those Members of Parliament that the Mover of this Motion was referring to when he said that most of us will have to go back and ask for votes from landless people. Half of my constituents are landless people. As you know, Sir, half of my constituents live on Govern¬ment land. They are workers with many grown u children who have no land at all, and who are how squatting on people's farms.Sir, I would like to join my other colleagues who have repeatedly requested the Minister for Lands, Housing and Physical Planning to ensure that in future, if we have any Government to be given to landless people, the local Member of Parliament must be fully involved. It was only the other day that in my own constituency a farm called Mwisho was divided to landless people, and none of those allottees came from my constituency. I was not approached by any official from the Ministry about the distribution of over 3,000 acres of land in my constituency. You know that when landless people have a problem the first person they approach is the local Member of Parliament. In 1988 and 1989 I had thousands of people coming to me, as their Member of Parliament, about Mwisho Farm and I was helpless. I could not assist them. My area has people from every part of this country and I, as the local Member of Parliament, have been elected to this House to represent everybody there regardless of their tribes. But, in this case, I had no assistance for my people whatsoever.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, you know that half of Kwanza Constituency is covered by Government land, namely, the Agricultural Development Corporation. My relationship with the Corporation is very good but ther are people" who have lived on these farms since the colonial days. A of them have retired, and it is unfortunate that in some instances these people are requested to leave the farms because they are Landless and to ..... because they have lived on these farms for as long as they can remember. I only wish to request that the Minister makes a policy statement on this matter well so that people who have been working on Government land have have retired should be considered for settlement by the Government. The same goes with the land that is owned by private individuals; they should not send away people that they found on the farm and who have nowhere to go.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question of land being given to people who already own land is a very sad affair. It should happen. When the Government is giving land to the landless people, we understand that the Government is giving land to a person who does not have any other piece of land in the Republic of Kenya. Therefore, the Minister should make it very clear that whoever is going to get a plot of Nairobi or elsewhere in the Republic of Kenya has not got land elsewhere. I am saying this because in my constituency we have Maridadi Farm, Kanyarikwet Settlement Scheme and Twiga settlement Scheme where, as I speak now, land transaction is going on between people who were allocated land by the Government there and have land elsewhere and the landless. Those people are busy selling the very pieces of land they they cried for and that they got by pretending that they did not have any other pieces of land in this Republic. One way of checking on these people whom I call cheats is for land title deeds to be given to every Kenyan who owns land. Any Kenyan whose land has been surveyed should be issued with a title deed. Once I have a title deed, I am therefore, registered with the Government that I own land and, therefore, there is no question of me getting another piece of land. Already the Government has my name on their records as having a piece of land. Sir, if we were to use this check out system, we would ensure that people who already have land do not acquire more land. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as you know, in Trans Nzoia District we have had people moving away from forest land according to the Government policy that deserves our total support. But, as one hon. Member has put it to your, what is more important? Is it the people or is it the forest? We do realise that this is a Government where the welfare of each man is of top priority and we would like to co-ordinate our development efforts as far as environment efforts go, and we would like to co-operate with the Government in this matter. But areas where the land is suitable for crop production and for livestock production, that land should not be given for afforestation. Mt. Elgon area is an ideal one for afforestation. There is a piece of land close to Kitale that the East African Tanning has been managing for the Government, and there is a piece of land in the area that could go to wananchi. I would plead with the Government that he should look into the question of some of the land remaining in this particular farm in order that it goes to wananchi.	Sir the forest, areas which have been vacated by the people who have been living in the forests are very helpless. The people who have vacated these areas are seen all over in town unemployed, and it is a problem for leaders to come up with a programme to settle them. I see no reason why we should bring extra people to Tranz Nzoia .District to settle on any piece of land when we have these people from the forest who are now living or squatting in the town, We would like these people to be accommodated by the Government. I think one of the ways that these people could be accommodated is through employment, which is another big problem for the leaders"of this country. If we can set up industries, we would be overcoming the problem a bit.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER: It is now time for the Mover to reply.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOY: Asante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika va Muda. Zvingependa kuva shukuru ifabunge wote waliozungussa juu ya Hoja. Pia ningependa kaashukuru Waziri kwa kuifanyia Hoja hii marekebisho kwa kuondoa pendekezo la kuunda kamati teule kwa sababu pengine aliona kwamba Wabunge wakikaa oanoja itakuwa moto kwake. Ninaashukuru pia mhe. Wabuge ambaye ako kwenye Xiti kwa yale aliyosema sana sana kuhusu jambo la kuwahamisha wananchi kwa nguvu.Ingefaa Waziri afahainu kwamba Hoja imeletwa kutokana na matatizo yaliyoko. Hoja za aina hii zinaendelea kujadiliwa katika Bunge hili lakini shida ya maskwata inazidi kawa abaya. Wananchi bado wanaendelea kaondolewa kutoka mashamba ya Serikali hata ingawa tunaambiwa kwamba suluhisho litapatikana juu ya swalahili.Shida iliyoko ni kwamba wale wananchi wahaoishi katika mashamba haya hawapatiwi ardhi. hiyo. Wale wanaopatiwa ardhi hii ni matajiri na jamil sa maofisa wa Wizara hii. Jambo hili litatuliwa ikiwa wafanyakazi wa Wizara hii wataianya kazi yao ipasavyo. Wizara hii haiwezi i-cuenda mbele ikiva haitashirikiana na maofisa wa utawala wa mikoa. Utaona kwamba shida kubwa iko katika ofisi hisi za utawala wa mikoa.Wakati mhe. Wabuge alikuwa akisungumza. alisema kwamba ingefaa wananchi aasa wasiondolewe kutoka kule vanakokaa. Tunakubali kwamba Serikali inaheshimu haki ya~ mtu_kumiliki. sha?.ba lakini kuna sehemu nyingine, kama vile, Sabarwana na Didoaa Farms kale - Kwale, aabapo mashamba hayatumiwi hata kiiogo Ingefaa Wizara isuaguaze na wenye mashamba haya ili wawauzie wananchi kwa sabab: wako tayari kuyanunua kwa bei ya kuridiisha na sic kuusa hekari moja kwa Xshs. 100,000.00. .Kwa mfano, Sabarwana Farm inekuwa na aaskwata kutoka rnwaka wa 1948 na sasa kuna kesi nymgi kortini na inaonekana auluhishc halitapaticana hivi karibuni.	Ningependa tushirikiane na Wizara kuhusu jambo hili na waone kwamba wananchi hawahamishwi kama makao nengine hayajapatikana au kama hawajalipwa ridhaa ya maana na wakubali kwamba malipo hayo yanafaa. Lakini si vizuri mtu, kwa sababu yeye ana cheo kikubwa Serikali ni , iawatumie maofisa wa utawala au maofisa hawa wamtumie chifu kwa kuwanyanyasa wananchi. Kwa mfano,mkuu wa wilaya anaita baraza na kuwaambia wsLnanchi "Mimi nikiva D.C. wa hapa, nasema maskwata waondoke. haraka sana. Kama hawatafanya hivyo, hatua kali itachukuliwa. Baada ya mkuu wa wilaya kusema hivi, chifu anarudi baada ya wiki moja ha kuwaambia wananchi "Je, mlisikia yale y_ali yosemwa na . D.C. wiki iliyopita? Onaokeni. Kabla wakuu wa wilaya hawajavaa virauni vyao vya gredi na kuondoka na gari zao xizk kubwa kubwa walizopewa na Serikali kwenda kuwahutubia maskwata, wawe tayari wame watafutia ardhi nyingine.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, naifai kwa Waziri kwenda ofisini mwake na kumpatia secretary wake karatasi na kumwambia "Weka hii kwa sababu wale Wabunge wameongea sana juu ya jambo hili." Tunge- taka Waziri achukue hatua zinazofaa kuyatatua mambo haya.Jambo lingine ni kuhusu mass maskwata katika ardhi za Serikali. Hili ni jambomuhinu. Tunajua kwaaba Serikali yetu imezitenga ardhi hizo kwa manufaa ya wananchi. k Kule kw Kwale tuna mradi wa Sheep and Goat Project na Serikali yetu inajaribu sana kuwasaidia wananchi kupitia kwa mradi huo, lakini jambo la kuhuzunisha ni kwamba wananchi ambao ni maskwata nalxsi katika mpango huo wa makao wanaondolewa kukiwa na kusudi ya kuwaficha wale wapya watakaoletwa. Haya ni mambo ambayo yanatendelc kila siku„ Nakubali kwamba kuna watu wanaomfuata Waziri wakitaka awasaidie; pengine nmoja anataka ploti na mwingine anataka kitu kingine. Kusaidiana ni jambo la kawaida. Ni lazims wafuoatwe na watu wakimwomba awasaidie kwa sababu yeye ni Waziri anayehusika.na mambo ya ardhi. Sisi hatuyapingi mambo haya. Jambo tunalosema hapa ni kwamba yafaa kila mtu asaidiwe. Haifai kusaidiam ili wale wanaohitaji msaada zaidi waumie.Mhe. Kiliku ametaja kuhusu makampuni ambayo yamepewa mapande makubwa ya ardhi. Amesema pia kwamba hakuna maendeleo yo yote ambayo yamefanywa kwenye axdhi hizo, Kwa hivyo, ingefaa Waziri alichunguse jambo hili. Hii ni kwa sababu ploti hizo zilitolewa kwa minanjili ya kuya_wezesha yale makampuni kufanya maendeleo,Jambo lingine ni lava kule Kwale tuna mpango wa Mbuguni Settlement Scheme. Pia kuna Tesbo Parm Settlement Scheme. Mipango hii miwili ya makao inetayarishwa na Wizara ya Ardhi na Myumba.Utaona kwamba hata baada ya Mkuu wa Wilaya kusimamia utoaji wa ploti watu fulani kurudi na Irutoa ploti hi so kwa mara ya pili.Utaona kwamba yale yote yanayopiti shwa na kamati ya kugawa ploti hayatekelezwi kamwe; yanay otekelezwa ni mengine. Kwa hivyo yafaa Waziri ayaclronguae kwa makini mambo hay a yote.Bw. Kaibu Spika wa Muda, tunakubali kwamba wale wanaopewa ploti ni wakenya. Lakini je, ni katika wizara ya Ardhi peke yake ambako kunapatikana hawa Wakenya"? Je, hakuna Wakenya katika ofisi ya Rais? Je, hakuna Wakenya katika Wisara ya Habari na Utangazaji?  Mbona hawa "Wakenya" hvipatikana tu katika Wizara ya Ardhi na Nyumba peke yake? Yafaa Wakenya wote wafikiriwe." Ikiwa mtu wa kutoka Trans-Hzoia amepewa ardhi kule Pwani na vile vile yafaa mtu wa kutoka Pwani apewe ardhi kule Trans-Nzoia. Je, ni kwa nini watu wa Pwani hawapewi ardhi katika sehemu nyingine za nchi hii? Haya ni maonevu juu ya maonevu. Ni lazima mambo ya maonevu yakomeshwe kabisa.Kwa hayo machache, naomba kupendekeza Hoja hii.(Question of the Motion as amended put and agreed to) Resolved accordinsly:-"KWAMBA, tunapczidi kuipongeza Serikali kwa juhudi za kutatua matatizo ya maskwata kote nchini walakini ongezeko la hoja kuhusu hali na matatizo ya mask,vata nchini ladhihirisha kazoroteka kwa hali yao; Sunge hili lapenaekeza Wizara ya Ardhi na ITyumba ihakiki she kusuluhishwa kWa tatizo hili nchini kote Kenya kaambatana na amri ya Serikali." </Newspeech><Header>ADJORNMRNT</Header><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Hon.

The death gratuity and any other benefits due to the dependants will be processed and paid as soon as the documentary evidence is received from the employer which is the Ministry of Live¬stock Development.</Newspeech>            <Newspeech>MR. arap CHEPKOK: This morning hon. Members were telling the chair that the Ministers have been giving a wrong answers m the House. I have copy of HANSARD here of 1987. I will now Question Mo. 60. which was answered bv hon. arap Saina who was the an Assistant Minister for Agriculture.</Newspeech>"Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. The Minister is aware that the family of the late Patrick Somongi Klprotich, P.No. 410 2/127, who died in 1983	beenpaid death gratuity.<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: When was it?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have  Hon. Arap Saina went on to say the pullwingall this on record. "all these relevant documents were sent to the Treasury on 7th December, 1986. And I think they are now being processed. I can promise that the family of the late Somongi will be paid their gratuity  next week</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: When was that?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR arap CHEPKOK: It was on 19th of March, 1987.How many years have now passed from that date. The next week is coming and I want to quote some words that Mr. Arap Saina said that the delay has been caused by an oversight. Can the Assistant Minister tell the House the truth of this answer.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. KARIUKI: I will tell the House the whole truth and nothing, but the truth. I have had very long discussions with our officers over this Question and these are the facts of the case. The late patricle Somongi Kiprotich who is a former Technical Assistant in the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development died while he was in service in 1983. The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock  Development forwarded the death gratuity claim form to the pensions Department of the Ministry of Finance in December, 1986 indicating that the deceased was earning a salary of K£900 p.a at the time of his death without a pay slip to support the amount. Since documentary evidence is required in support of salary received by the deceased or a retiring officer to ensure that their is no overpayment or underpayment of death gratuity  or retirement benefits. The Principal Pensions Officers wrote and I am sure that the hon. Member is listening to the Ministry of Livestock Development in March, 1987^ calling for the said evidence and a response of the letter was not received until October, 1988. When a copy of the payroll was received it indicated a payment. I a salary of K£936 per annumwhich contradicted the pension's claim form, which indicated a salary of K£900 per annum. Therefore, the Principal Pensions Officer is currently in touch with the Ministry regarding the correct salary of the deceased officer. Immediately the information is received, the death gratuity and other benefits in form of five years pension will be paid to the department.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to add here that I have instructed an officer from our Ministry to go personally to the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Livestock Development and make sure that he gets this information and I have also given instructions that this must be processed within a week.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR MALEBE: Can the Assistant Minister undertake himself to go and get the information and then issue out the chaque. The Assistant Minister is still beating about the bush he is promising to finalise the matter in another week similarly to what was promised in 1986. How serious are we going to take him when he gives us the excuse of another one week.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARIUKI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me correct the information. The Ministry did not promise any payment in 1986. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap. CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. DeputySpeaker, Sir The Assistant Minister is misleading the House.I brought the payslip myself and gave it to Mr. Arap Saina himself andthat is why he sent it over to the Ministry. What other pay-slip does he want?<N/ewspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARIUKI: I have explained very clearly. When the payslip was received by the Ministry of Finance, it showed a salary figure of K£936 which was contrary to what was claimed in the claim form of K£900	and the correspondence between the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Livestock Development has been about that difference between K£900 and K£936. And, until, the matter was sorted out as to whether the salary was K£900 p.a or K£936 p.a the claim could not have been processed. Therefore, this is why and I do not think I could do better than that I have instructed our officer in the Ministry to go personally to the Ministry of Livestock Development and clear this matter and have this claim processed within a week.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATE: Since an issue like this one is embarassince to the Government and also tarnishing the name Government in the eyes of the wananchi. Can the Assistant Minister undertake to give us a report after one week  after finalising the issue?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARIUKI: I do undertake that within a week I will come to this House and report that the claim has been processed. If it has not been processed, I will come and report the reasons why it has not been processed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Ali Bidu's Question.</Newspeech>Question No. 4 64<Header>Replacement Incubator for Kinango Hospital</Header>MR. BIDU asked the Minister for Health since the incubator in the laboratory of Kinango Hospital was stolen last year, what immediate steps is his Ministry taking to have it replaced.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur):Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. I wish to inform the hon. Member that my Ministry is not aware of any incubator that has been stolen from Kinangpo Hospital last year, 1989 or any other time. The incubator which wassupplied to the hospital is still there but the only problem isthat the rooms currently used as laboratory do not have threephase electric—wiring system to enable it work effectively. TheMinistry of Public Works has been contacted on this issue andalready plans and modifications have been done to enable theincubator work when installed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: At least you can bear with me, Mr. DeputySpeaker that this morning we said that some microbiologyequipments have been removed. With regard this incubator the Assistant Minister k sing that it was not stolen. I might agree with him on that it was found faulty: it was taken somewhere for repair, but it has never been replaced. My Question is could the Assistant Minister now, instead of saying that the incubator is being kept for the Ministry of Public Works to come and repair, agree with me that it is not there; it is somewhere and it should be returned immediately? </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. OGUH: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the machine has been repaired.  What now remains to be done is the testing of the machine and immediately this is done, the machine will be brought back to the Hospital ana installed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.G. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, an incubator is a very important piece of equipment. In view of the importance of this equipment for the survival of babies that are born prematurely, would the Assistance Minister assure thisHouse that this equipment will be installed immediately?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the equipment will be installed immediately.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. P.G.

GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the Assistant Minister for that reply.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has told us that the cheque is ready and that the claimant can go and collect it. Do the Minister and Assistant Ministers have to wait until Questions are raised in this House before they can take any action? Is that the way the system should work? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I said that the cheque is ready and the hon. Questioner is satisfied with that reply." Therefore the claimant can come and collect that cheque.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WABUGE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the answer given by the Assistant Minister that the cheque is ready why did he wait until the Question was put to his Ministry? Why was the Ministry unable to pay the claimant before this Question was put?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: The hon. Questioner put this Question to the Ministry when the claim was already being processed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE 0F THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE(Mr. Kariuki): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I do not think it is in order for the hon. Member to allege that cheques are only paid when a Question is asked in Parliament. This is because thousands of cheques have been paid and continue to be paid without any Questions being brought to Parliament.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. MATE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that was not an allegation. This is because we are basing our supplementary questions on the information given by the Assistant Minister. He says that the cheque is ready for collection. So, it appears that they wrote the cheque after the Question had been raised.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I said that the cheque is ready and I therefore do not understand what the hon. Member wants from us!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

MOMANYI asked the Minister for Agriculture when Mrs. Grace 3.Okioma of Nyasiongo Tea Factory, No. ITS. 200244, will he paid her second payment of 1987 and 10 months of 1938.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr.Gachui): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Mrs. Grace Okioma could not be paid her second paymentin 1987 and the 10 months of 1988 because of the large debt of KShs.11,979/- raised against her for the falsified green leaf weight. The value of her deliveries for 1987 and 1988, which amounted to 493 kilogrammes and 102 kilogramme respectively went towards reduction of the debt which currently stands at KShs.6,623.57.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.H.O. MOMANYI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I urge the Assistant Minister to have mercy on this lady. She has not received any of her second payments since 1987. The family, has a number ox children who need school fees and they re really suffering. Could the Assistant Minister have mercy on this family and pay them something?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GACHUI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, payment to farmers are based on the amounts of tea leaves delivered. Mrs. Okioma has not delivered any tea leaves during the year 1938/89. She still owes the factory a debt of over KShs.6,000/-. So, ther is no payment for her until she clears the debt first.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Very well. Mr. Kiliku's Question.</Newspeech>Question No.498<Header>Casual Employment of Workers by a Moabasa Pirn</Header>MR. KILIKU asked the Minister for Labour why the Management of M/S Eastern industrial Works Limited of P.O. 3ox62241, Mombasa, employed Messrs. Ngome Gunya, Bamweru, Kuri, Papu BebureOmari Katana, Mwiru, Mokolani, James Mwengu, Wanje Mvoo and Ali  Mzoio on temporary terms of service over a period of many years contrary to the labour regulations.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. D.M. Amin) : Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.M/S Eastern Industrial Works Limited, of Mombasa, deals with extraction of oil from coconut. The coconuts are available on a seasonal basis. Normally there is plenty of work between January and June every year. Prom July to December, each year, there is a shortage of raw products and consequently the Company finds it difficult to keep permanent employees during th period. The workers are strictly paid at the end of each day implying that their services are terminated at the end of each d However, the workers who complete one year in service are paid their leave dues.Currently, the employer has a labour force of 11 employees as a result of intervention by the Labour Office, Mombasa, the employer has agreed to convert six employees from casual employment to permanent employment with effect from 1st November, 1990. Among these are Messrs. Ngome Gunya, kuri, Papu, Omari, katana and Mandela. Messrs. James Mvengu, Wanje Mvoo and Ali Mzoio cases will be considered on their own merits in due course.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while appreciating part of the Assistant Minister's reply, these people have worked for periods ranging from two years to 14 years. Mr. Ngome Gunya has worked for 13 years. If they are going to be converted from temporary employment to permanent employment will this be effective from the date they started working so that when they retire they can be paid some retirment benefits?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, their conversion from casual to permanent employment will be effective from 1st November, 1990, and not from the time they started working.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister says that the cases of Mr. Wanje Mvoo and Mr. Ali Mzoio will be considered on merit. What kind of merit is he talking about when in fact these people have worked for more than 10 years? Have they been working without any merit?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. D. M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we requested the employer to taken on these people on permanent terms of employment and he promised that he will do so.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are many employers who employ people on casual basis for many years contrary to labour regulations. What action is the Ministry going to take to discourage such employers from employing people as casuals for a long time?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M.

DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. KUDO'S Question.</Newspeech>Question No. 431Removal of Water Reeds in Lake JipeMR. KUBO asked the Minister for Water Development in view of the fact that water reeds are spreading and covering up lake Jipe in Taveta Division, what steps he is taking to remove the reeds in order to open up the lake for fishing.<Newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT  (Mr. Mwita) : Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.At the moment, there are no steps that my Ministry can take to remove the weeds spreading and covering Lake Jipe in Taveta Division so as to open up the Lake for fishing. This is because no funds have been set aside for this purpose. However like all other projects by my Ministry, this requires the blessing of the local D.D.C. and an allocation of funds made for the work. The hon. Member should, therefore, raise this matter with the Taita-Taveta D.D.C. so that it can be considered alongside other projects and I will then make arrangements for this work to be carried out.</Newspeech><Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. KUBO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, my Hon. friend does not seemto understand the nature of that lake. This lake is more than three kilometreslong and it is now being filled up with silt and reeds are growing all round it.So, this is not a small project that can be dealt with at the district leveland this is why I brought this question here. Could the Assistant Ministerto take this matter more seriously because it is threatening the future ofall the fishermen in Taita Taveta. Right now, the fishermen arerunning away from that area because there is not enough fishing ground sincethe lake is covered by reeds. Would the Assistant Minister take thismatter seriously instead of referring it to the district developmentcommittee which deals only with minor projects.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWITA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have taken this matter seriouslyand have already asked our district water engineer responsible for Taita Taveta to assess the situation and report back to the district development committeeand the Ministry.</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Wakole's Question.</Newspeech>Question No-496 Provision of Enough Water for Hola Irrigation Scheme Mr. WAKOLE asked the Minister for Regional Development since River Tana has changed its course, what urgent action the Ministry is taking to ensure that the Hola irrigationScheme has enough water for irrigation purposes.	<Newspeech> THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.I do agree with the hon. Member that the situation in HolaIrrigation Scheme is truly very, bad but I am happy to inform him that theGovernment is doing everything humanly possible to ensure that the situation is corrected. At the moment, we have the national Youth Service and specialengineers stationed at Hola and the work now done has exceeded on kilometrefrom the point of break and we hope that by the end of the month, all therepair work ,will have been completed and most of the water controlled.However, as the hon. Member has said, the people in the area haveaffected and although we did not have enough funds to take care of the situation,Member that the situation in Hola has even necessitated arrangements for visiting the areas to be made. During this visit to Hola, the Ministerial Committee which consists of the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Water Development and the Minister for Energy, if possible, would be accompanying me to Hola, so that we can see for ourselves is being done. I would like to assure the hon. Member that before the end of the year, the situation will have come under control. This is a situation which we have realised it is bad and I do sympathize with the people of Hola, but we shall try as much as possible tospeed up the work.</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR.

LEWA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister for Health, the following Question by Private Notice:-In view of the great deman for the services of a surgeon at the Kilifi District Hospital, could the Minister make arrangements to posta surgeon immediately.</Newspeech><Newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur): Mr. Deputy Speaker,Sir, I beg to reply.I wish to inform the hon. Member that it is not possible for my Ministry to post a surgeon to Kilifi District Hospital immediately since we donot have enough surgeons in the a country at the moment. Most of the surgical	surgical cases are competetly handed by the hospital through a team ofdoctors already posted at the hospital. Also in a district hospital which is not so busy,a surgeon or a gynaecologist alone, looks after the two departments adequately.  There are two operation days on Tuesday and Thursday mainly dealing with hernias and hydro codes case that for large prostates and these are referred to the Coast General Hospital which is kilometres away from kilifi.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. LEWA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Kilifi District Hospital serves the whole of Kilifi District, Malindi Municipality included. You can imagine patients coning all the way from Tana River, Malindi, Mombasa to this hospital. This hospital is supposed to be the best in the North of Mombasa, and it is surprising to hear the Assistant Minister saying that since there are not enough surgeons in the country, it is not likely that a surgeon is likely to be sent to this Hospital immediately. My question is: how long is this situation going to be allowed to continue. In his reply, the Assistant Minister says that surgeons and gynecologists can perform operations, but there is not even one gynecologist in this hospital at the moment. Therefore, could he tell this House who is supposed to be carrying out the so called operations he is talking about on Tuesdays and Thursdays?</newspeech> <newspeech> MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, a gynecologist is a professionally trained doctor. As of the moment, we do not have a surgeon to be able to post him to Kilifi District Hospital.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. EKIDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker. Sir there is a very big shortage of surgeons in the country as a whole and therefore, could the Assistant Minister tell this House what immediately plans his Ministry has of training enough surgeons in order to take care of this situation as a matter of urgency.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is not at all correct to say that there is a shortage of surgeons when in the Rift Valley alone, we have six surgeons. In Western province, we have one, in Eastern Province, we have one surgeon, in Nairobi Province, we have one surgeon, in Central Province, we have three, in the Coast Province we have four, in Nyanza Province we have four surgeons and in North Eastern Province we have zero and other three to cover special cases. Altogether, we have 23 surgeons in the country and therefore, we cannot say we have none.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. ADEll: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister really in order to say that there are enough surgeons all over the country, while his own notes indicate that there is not even one surgeon for North Eastern Province?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. OGJR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this does not mean that the cases that need the attention of a surgeon in that area are not taken care of </newspeech><newspeech>MR. MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am surprised to hear the hon. Assistant Minister saying that we have enough surgeons in the country while the breakdown of surgeons per province he has given is contradictory, particularly where he says there is only one surgeon for the whole of Nairobiand that there is not even one for North Eastern Province. By what measure has he assessed a situation like this, which to me is highly unsatisfactory? We know, for example, that in Kenya we have one doctor for over 100,000and in fact, this is a very unsatisfactory situation.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we still have medical surgeon students and when they graduate, they will add to the number that we already have. However, what I would like to clear is the impression that was created that we do not have any surgeon in this country because we indeed do have quite a number, which will he increased year after year as our students qualify from our medical institutions, apart from those graduating from medical institutions abroad.</newspeech>[The Deputy Speaker left the Chair][The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Wabuge) took the Chair]         <newspeech>MR. CHPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. When the Assistant Minister was replying, I heard him mention "zero surgeon". Could he elaborate to the House the meaning of "zero surgeon"?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Temporary. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it means that we have a vacancy which the Ministry is already aware of. We are not blind to this fact. We are fully aware of it and, after graduation; we will sooner or later have to fill the post.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. LEWA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in view of the fact that the Assistant Minister has accepted that there is a shortage of surgeons in the country, what plans does his Ministry have in its post-graduate programme to employ that so many surgeons are trained per year in order to curtail this shortage?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have already said that there are Kenyans being pained outside the country and that we will absorb them as soon as they come back. This is besides the regular training facilities we have in the country. When these Kenyans qualify, they do not stay in the tarmac at all. In the case of the existing vacancies, we will dispatch surgeons immediately to the needy areas. As I have indicated, our statistics show clearly where we should post them immediately they come back. We are fully committed to doing this, and the hon. Member of Parliament from the area should not be worried at all because we will post these surgeons there immediately they arrive from overseas, along with those who qualify here locally. We already know that this shortage exists.Repossession of Undocumented Plot No. 199 </newspeech><newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Lands, Housing and Physical Planning the following Question by Private Notice.How was the repossession of the vacant undeveloped and undocumented plot, No. 199, in Lelmolok Settlement Scheme, effected with regard to Ministry's letter, ref. No. DS/6/19/4/Vol.VI/199, dated 3rd February, 1987.</newspeech> <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Bomett): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.                              The repossession of Plot No. 199 at Lelmolok Settlement Scheme was served on the allottee, one Mukua Muchuna, through P. 0. Box 839; Eldoret the allottee's last known address. The allottee was given 60 days' notice to rectify the breach of the condition of allotment, but he did nothing. At the expiry of the 60 days' notice, the plot was repossessed and allocated to another allottee by the Uasin Gishu District Plot Allocation Committee under the Chairmanship of the District Commissioner.</newspeech>                      <newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell this House who was allocated this piece of land? Was it somebody who had been squatting on the land or an outsider?</newspeech>                                  <newspeech>MR. BOMETT: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the land was allotted to a Kenyan who was actually in need of land and his name is Mr. Kiprotich.</newspeech>                     <newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for clarifying that point, I would like to know whether he could assure this House that if there other such vacant and undocumented plots in Basin gishu District they will be allocated to people who are already registered but have failed to get land. These people may already be living on the land, and it would be unfair to evict somebody who has been on the land for the last five years and get some five other persons from outside the area.</newspeech>                                 <newspeech>MR. BOMETT: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we do not actually evict anybody who has developed a land for 10 years. The reason why this particular eviction was carried out was that the first allottee did not settle on the land nor did he plough it or do anything to develop it at all. Indeed, I would also like to tell the hon. Member that the person who has now been allotted the land has, in fact, done nothing to it up to now and there is another person living on the land who might be given the land. Sacking of Workers by M/s Lanji Ratna Company.</newspeech>                          <newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Labour the following Question by Private Notice. Why were, the services of Messrs Vitalis Ochieng and Walter Ouma,former employees of M/s Lanji Ratna Construction Company, of P. 0. Box 83223, Mombasa, terminated on 30th June, 1990, and when will they be paid their terminal benefits?</newspeech>                                   <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. D.M. Amin): Mr. TemporaryDeputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. My investigations confirmed that the services of these two persons were terminated in June, 1990, by the employer, Lanji Ratna and Sons, and not Lanji Ratana Construction Company, as given in the Question. This case has never been reported to my Labour Office, Mombasa. It has not been possible to ascertain the reason for the- termination of the services of these people due to the fact that the employer has not been found at his place of work. His son, who is available, is unable to provide the required information in the absence of his father. In view of the employer's failure to produce records, I have decided that he should be charged in court for failure to produce employment records. Once the employment records are made available, I will ensure that terminal benefits, if any, are recovered and paid to these persons. Further, we have already registered Court Case No.3395/90. It was filed in the morning of today, 24th October, 1990, against the employer.</newspeech>                      <newspeech>MR.

In view of the importance of the proposed amendments to the Muslim community, could the Attorney—General suspend all succession cases pending before court until the amendments are effected?</newspeech><newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The proposed amendment to the Law of Succession, Cap. 160 of the Laws of Kenya, is in the process of being drafted, and a Bill will be published as soon as possible. I am happy to say that the proposed amendment to the Law of Succession Act will be debated in Parliament during the current Session. With regard to part (b) of the Question, I am afraid I cannot suspend succession cases pending before court. The proposed amendment will not have retroactive effect and, for that purpose, the court cannot be stopped from hearing these pending cases.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. ADEN: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the light of the Attorney-General's assurance that the amendments will' be introduced and debated in this House during the current Session, I am satisfied with the reply.</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Okay. Let us move on to the next order.</newspeech><header>POINTS OF ORDER</header><newspeech>MR. FALANA: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. My point of order concerns a Question I asked in this House on 6th June, 1990, to the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife' and the' reply I was given. With your permission, Sir, I-wish to quote the' Question from the' HANSARD. It reads:-"MR. FALANA asked the Minister for Tourism and Wildlife whether he could consider waiving the fate fees currently being paid by the local people who live in Badasa and Songa and have to use the gate to and from Marsabit town on a daily basis".In its reply, the Ministry had said that the paying of this gate fee did not arise. The Minister did even challenge me that I bring documentary -evidence if there is any. With your permission, Sir, I wish also to quote' his reply. He said:-"Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to repeat what I have already stated. If the hon. Member can bring any evidence to the Ministry that an innocent person has been charged for passing through the gate to go to the market, action will be taken. I would like to assure the nation right now that the charges are only for those people going into the park and not for those passing through it in carrying out their innocent business".Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, what the Front-benchers tell us here in most cases and what they relay back to their officers in the field are two different things. We hate to be taken for a ride. We hate to have these monkey tricks being played on us. If this information was communicated to the game warden in Marsabit, I am sure he would have taken up the instructions. No instructions were relayed back to the: game warden. And the Ministers make us fight our civil servants back in the district because of not giving instructions. Right now, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have the evidence that the Minister was asking for. Just a few days ago on 20th October I had sent my vehicle through this gate to my shamba to go and take a bag of maize for plant¬ing. The vehicle and its two occupants we're charged gate fee and I am going to lay the receipts on the Table. For heaven's sake, could the Front-bench stop playing these monkey tricks on us and relay the same message back to the people in the field when they give promises in this House?</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I am only asking for your guidance here. This morning something like this arose, where an Assistant Minister or a Minister may not have answered a Question adequately. Would you, Sir, ask the Back-bench to be directing their remarks to those Ministers and Assistant Ministers who may not do their duty accordingly? Hon. Falana was given an assurance by the Minister for Tourism and Wildlife, and he is now talking about the entire Front-Bench. I wish we could be more specific. If hon. Karauri, as the Assistant Minister for Education, has not answered his Question adequately, that is no cause for total condemnation of the Front-Bench. That is not proper.</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): I think the hon. Member might have, been worked out since the reply came from the Front-Bench, but I think his remarks were directed to the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife. If so, we could hear the reaction of the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife. Otherwise, in all fairness, it is not good to condemn everybody in the Front-Bench. It may be just one isolated case. If there is nobody from the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife, then we can go on. Hon. Falana, can you lay those receipts on the Table?(Hon. Falana laid the receipts on the Table)Now, can we please move on to the next Order?</newspeech>                                      COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY(Order for Committee read, being the 16th Allotted Day)                         MOTIONTHAT, Mr. Speaker do now leave the Chair(The Minister for Water Development on 23.10.90)(Resumption of Debate interrupted on 23.10.90)<newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Hon.

Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipatia nafasi hii ili nami nitoe- maoni yangu kuhusu voti hii ya Wizara ya Ustawi wa Maji.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ukosefu wa maji ambao tunao wakati huu unatokana na ukosefu wa mipango kamili. Wizara ya Ustawi wa Maji haina mipango ya kutosha. Kama wangelikuwa na mipango ya kutosha, kila mahali kwa wakati huu kungekuwa na maji. lie mipango iliyoko ni ya makaratasi tu na hawafanyi vile Wahe. Wabunge' wanavyosema. Ninasema hivyo kwa sababu Hoja kuhusu maji zimeletwa katika Bunge hili miaka nenda miaka rudi. Hivi majuzi kulikuwa na Hoja moja iliyoletwa hapa ikipendekeza kutoa maji kutoka Ziwa Victoria kupitia Timboroa na yasambaswe kila mahali, lakini wakati Waziri alipokuwa akiwasilisha Voti yake hakuele'za mpar.go huo ume'fika wapi. Wizara hii imwaambia wananchi wa Kenya kwamba kufikia mwaka wa 2000  na kumebakia miaka tisa peke yake kila mtu atapata maji.Hivi karibuni mvua itaanza kunyesha kote nchini na maji yatapotea katika Bahari Hindi. Yale maji yanayopotele'a katika Bahari Hindi ndani ya msimu i.imoja wa mvua yakitekwa yote" yanaweza kuitumikia nchi hii kwa zaidi ya miaka 10 Lakini hakuna mpango wa kuyateka maji yanayopotelea baharini. Utaona kvamba tumeingilia mipango ya kuchimba visima, lakini tunachimba na hatupati maji.</newspeech>(Hon. Okwanyo was consulting with hon. Cheruiyot)<newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Jambo oa nidhamu, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda. Ni haki, wakati mhe. Kiliku anapotoa maoni yake kuhusu Wizara ya Ustawi wa Maji, kwa Waziri wa Ustawi wa Maji kuwa akizungumza na Waziri mwenzake bila kusikiliza . maoni yanayotolewa?</newspeech><newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Okwanyo): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): No, you cannot raise a point of order at this time You are' either replying to the one which has "been raised or Is yours a point of order?</newspeech><newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Okwanyo): Yes, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I want to deny that I was not listening to what the hon. Member was talking about.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, sipingi mpango wa kuchimba maji chini. Lakini hakuna maana ya kuchimba maji chini na huku yanatiririka huku juu tukiyaona. Unawacha maji huku juu yaingie'-:chini halafu unaanza kupima .kama kule chini kuna maji. Ni kwa nini huwezi kuyazuia maji yasipote'e katika Bahari Hindi? Ikiwa kuna mpango mzuri wa kushughulikia maji, maji fcunayopata katika nchi hii kutokana na mvua ni mengi sana. Lakini hakuna utekelezaji wowote wa mipango ya Serikali unaofanywa.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, wakati mmoja Waziri wa Ustawi wa Mjai atahi jika kuandika ni mipango gani anayotazamia kutekeleza na pesa atakazokuwa akiomba apewe na Bunge hili. Katika Changamwe na Tudor wananchi hulipa nyumba pamoja na maji kwa Baraza la Mji wa Mombasa. Lakini baraza likiche'lewe'sha zile pesa, maofisa wa Wizara wanakatia watu maji huku wakiwa wamelipa. Namwomba Waziri, ambaye ni rafiki yangu, ahakikishe kwamba mtindo huo ume'isha.	Bw. ITaibu Spika wa Muda, tunapozungumza hapa hakuna maji katika sehemu nyinginz. sa Mombasa; tena Irako Mombasa maji hufungwa wakati wowote na hawe-aij kupata maji wakati wa usiku. Tumeuliza na koambiwa kwauiba maji hufungwa wakati wa usiku kwa sababu hakuna maji ya kutosha huko Mombasa; utaona kwamba hurra na shida wakati motcr unapotokea usiku® Kwa hivyo, namwomba aone kwamba mpango wa kutoa maji katoka I.izima Springs unaliarakishe na kwamba maji hayo yakifika Mombasa kusifanyike kosa la katojenga matanki ya maji ya kutumika wakati wa ukosefu wa maji; kosa hili lilifanyika wakati mwingine na wakati huu sehemu ya Viwanda ya Changamwe huwa na shida kubwa ya maji.Vile vile ningemwomba A7aziri ashirikiane na mawaziri wenzake na kuona kila anaye .ienga ^y^trsi au shule anajenga  matanki ya maji. Jambo hili likifanyika, hasa katika kila shule na wananchi kwa jumla. uXmajua pesa uxanya kazij kazi inafanywa na watu. Ikiwa r.aciisa wgfcu wazalendo hata kama -tuwe na pesa kiasi gani hatuwezi kufaulu katika shughuli zetu za kawa na maji ya katosha.Kan a alivyosema nhe ICirwa hakuna haja koacha mpango ambao haujakamilika na kuansisha mwir-gine mahali peiigine ir.va ili kumjenga mtu fulani kisiasa: Hatutekelezi niradi kwa sababu ya kutaka kara lakini ni kwa kulingana na mahitaji ya wananchi. riataka maofisa wetu waonyeshe uzalendo wao kwa komaliza mradi wanaoanza kabla ya kuanzisha mwingine. Tena r.ingesema k.vamba kandarasi ambaye hajamaliza kazi aliyopewa hafai kupewa kazi nyingine kama kuna nyingine i ipewe mtu rjingine ambaye ataimaliza haraka. liwa hayo nachache. naunga kcno nchini kote, tutapunguza shida ya maji sana lava wanafunzi, waalimu ra ya Ustavn. wa Maji. Kama tujuavyo bila maji binadamu na vzanyana hav/awezi kuishi.' Kwa maoni yangu pesa Waziri anazoomba ni haba zikilinganishwa na maiiitaji ya maji ya Wakenya.Ssransa 7ilaya ya Vest Pokot, na hasa Ilawakili sho yangu ya Xacheliba, ni kame na tuna shida maji. imaishukuru vizara kwa kuona izwamba kuna maji kwa watu Ess.vna mifugo katika sehemu yangu. Lakini nataka kumwambia V/aziri na maofisa wake kwamba Kacheliba, ambako kuna makao makuu ya tarafa, haijakuwa na maji kwa zaidi ya miezi miwili na nusu. Pengine tatizo lililoko katika mitambo ya maji limev ashinda maofisa wa maji katika tarafa. Hat a sasa patroli aibayo instuEiika katika kulinda usalama wa sehemu hiyo sasa yanainimika katika kutafuta maji kwa sababu polisi wa huko haw an a maji. Zwa hivyo, ningemwomba Jaziri syg achungu sekutoka kvra maofisa wake huko Eachsliba na kujua kura shida gani Tuna shule katika sehesi iuyo na wakati huu 2 mifugo na wanafunzi na watu wengine sasa, maji ya into na jambo hili Una we sa kudhuru axya za watuHi kweli tuna visima kadhaa ambavyo dnaiiitaji mashine za kupigia majio 5raieri ingefaa zaidi kama Wizara ingetujengea mabwawa. Ewa afano tumeona kwsrnba service dams zinasaidia sana. 3isi hupata kiasi kidogo cha mvua na tukiwa na mabwawa tutanasa maji ambayo yatatusaidia sana. ITitassma machache kuhusu pesa malipo ya maji. Hi visuri Vasiri aliagiza kukatwa kwa ya watu ambao hawayalipii. Lakini pengine kuna uzembe	mahali fuianioLngefaa Viisara hii iwe na mpango kamili wa kuona kwamba anatoa malipo ya maji anayotumia kama vile Shirika la Posta na Sisu na Kenya Power and Lighting Company zinafanya. Ifizara hii imeweza kufanya kazi hii nsuri kwa sahahu ya utuliva ulioko nchini chini ya uongozi wa Mtukufu Rais. Ningependa kuipongeza Serikali tukufu ya Mtukufu Rais kwa kuanzisha mradi wa maji kale Turkwell na ni matumaini yetu kwamha shida ya maji inayotukabili saaa itakwisha max a tu mradi huu utakamilika.Kama kuna watu wengine arr.bao wanataka kuchafua amani hapa nchini, ningependa kuwaambia kwamba wananchi hawatarudi nyuma. Tutasidi kulinda amani hapa nchini na Serikali yetu inayoongozwasGi na Mtukufu Rais na chama chetu cha Kanu. lngefaa Wizara hii inapoomba pesa sa matumisi yake, ihakiicishe kwamba wamepatiwa kiwango kinachotozelesha mahitaji yake. Kwa njia hii, se_hemu zile ambaso hazikupatiwa pesa sa kuanzisha miradi ya maji mwaka fulani, kama vile, Kacheliba na kwingineko, zitafanikiwa. Kwa hayo machache, naunga: mkono.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MAI27GI: Thank you, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to is no life. This is a very important Ministry and we should see to it that they get enough funds for their operations. I would like to thank the Government for initiating the Kilimanjaro water Project. The water from this project is used in Kasikeu, Sultan Eamud, Kilungu and Mukaa. The main pipe is passing through my constituency.I would like to ask the Ministry to put up T-joints in the locations I have just mentioned. It is not fair for this water to flow straight to Machakos Town without the people in between benefiting. It is my sincere hope that the Ministry will consider this request.A large portion of Kenya is arid and in my opinion, the funds allocated to this Ministry are not enough. I would like to request the Government to consider allocating this Ministry adequate fund to finance its operations. The Ministry made a commitment to the effect that by the year 2000. Everyone will have piped water and we are looking to this promise. I believe that all hon. Members are looking forward to this realization.Boreholes are a necessity in many parts of Kenya. Maintenance of existing boreholes must be upheld at all costs. Some of the boreholes in the country have silted and are not operating and yet the Government had used a lot of money constructing them.' It does not make sense to have boreholes which do not benefit anybody. The Ministry should also maintain the pumps used in these boreholes.The Kenyan landscape is hilly and when it rains, all the water flows into the ocean and lakes. The Ministry should consider constructing dams which can ka harness this water for dome stick purposes and also for irrigation. Dams are important and the Ministry should budget for them.Machakos District is now being split into two districts. The proposed district will be Makueni whose headquarters will be at wote. As I am speaking now, construction of buildings at Wote is almost complete and I do not know what the Ministry is doing to supply water to this area. This area is very dry but potential in cotton farming. If water can be supplied to this place, the country can earn a lot of money in terms of cotton production.As you know, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when a new district is created a lot of things are required. First of all the new district must have a district commissioner. The new district also needs tarmac roads, telephone services, electricity and above all water. The part of Ukambani I am talking about has high potential for agriculture. Areas like, Dukuyuni, Ulda, Kilala ana so on need telephone and road services to link them with the headquarters of the new Makueni District. These areas are only a few kilometres from Kalamba which has electricity and telephones. Electricity and telephones should be extended from Kalamba which is only 10 kilometres away, to these areas.My constituency is quite hilly and when His Excellency the President was presiding over a fund raising meeting for Kalamba A.I.C. Church, he directed the Ministry to sink more boreholes in that area. I would like to request the Ministry to ensure that its officers go to the rural areas to assist the wananchi to harness rain water from the roofs of their houses. This will enable every home to have water. So, I urge all Kenyans to think about roof catchment whenever they put up new houses. I hope that the Ministry is taking our views seriously.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KATURKANA: Ah sante sana, Su. ITaibu Spika, k.va kunipa nafasi ili nami nivese ioiiunga mkono Hoi a hii axSocrro ni ya nzzn maana. Ukweli ni k7amba bila maji hakuvrezi ku.va na uhai vo vote. Hat a hivyo ningeomba vizara hii ipeve pesa sa katosha. Hii ni kva sababu Vizara Iiii haiweze kutekeleza miradi ya maji bila ya kuwa na pesa sa katosha. Hva hivyo ningeomba Wizara hii ipeve pesa za kutosha ili iweze kutekeleza miradi ya maji katika kila penbe ya nchi yetu. Hii ni kva sababu wananchi pamoja na mifugo yao wanahitaji mahz maji ya katosha. Yzara hii isepewa kiasi lei do go cha pesa na ningependa kaiomba Serikali ijaribu kaipatia Yizara hii pesa za katosha.Bw. Naibu Spika wa iiuda, watu wa ZDaringo Irlashariki ni vachungaji, Utaona k.vamba wakati huu watu hao pamojana wanyajna wao wanakabiliwa na shida kubwa ya maji. Ii inatumaini yangu Irwam baada ya Vizara hii kupewa pesa za katosha itatuma maoiisa katika IcLla tarafa kote nchini kuchunguza shida za maji katika sehemu hi so.Janbo lingine ni kwamba vizara hii haina magari ya kutosha. Hwa hivyo ni wazi k.vamba Yizara hii haipatiwi pesaza kutosha na maofisa wake wa nyanjani Irukabiliwa na matatizo mengi. Utaona kwamba wilaya kama Baringo imepewa magari mawili peke yake.	Bila kuva na magari ya kutosha maofisa va isara hii har atawesa kuutekelesa vajibu wao vizuri. Hata hivyo Yaziri pamoja na maofisa wake wanajaribu Icuitumikia nchi hii hata bila magari ya Icutosha.	LInamo mwaka va. 19o7, wataalaima wa maji kut oka Hakuru walifike katika mawakili sho kufanya uzii uchunguzi sss kuhusu u.vesekano v:a kuchimba visima vya maji ".catika sehemu hiyo. Hilipozungumza na maofisa hao baadaye niligundua kvamba hawakawa na aia: magari ya kutosha. I'lwa kivyo ninaomba Y/isara hii ipewe pesa za kutosha kuiwezesha kununua magari ambayo yatatumiwa na inaoiisa wake va nyanjani. Baada ya maofisa wa Wizara kapewa magari ya katosha sisi tutakuwa na haki ya kuwalalamikia wanapofanya kazi mbaya.Hinajua k.vainba kuna vij ana wengi hap a nchini ambao wamepwa mafunzo ya uhandisi wa maji. Lakini ikiwa utamfunza mtu na ukose kumpa vif aa vya kufanya kazi, utakuwa umefanya kazi bure. Kwa hivyo, sisi kama vvabunge yafaa tujitolee kuwasaidia hawa maofisa wa Vizara ya m Maji. Hii ni k.va sababu icrzm Visara haina pesa za katosha. riinaiomba Serikali itoe pesa za katosha k.va Wizara ya Ustawi wa Miradi ya Maji ili Wizara hii iweze kutekeleza miradi mbali mbali ya maji katika sehemu sa mashambani. Yafaa kila shale ya msingi na kila kituo cha afya hapa nchini kipatiwe maji. Hili ni jambo ambalo litawawezesha wananchi kufahamu k.vamba Serikali inaajali maslahi yao; Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ningetaka Waziri afikirie kupeleka maji katika 	zule zetu za boarding Kwa mfano, kuna shule iitwayo Shonglobei boardingprimary School na ingawa maofisa wa maji wamejaribu kuchimba maji, narak kwa mara, shule hii inafungwa kwa sababu ya ukosefu wa maji. Kama tungekuwa na mashine nyingine ya kupiga maji, watoto wetu wangewesa 2uendelea na masomo. Vile vile, hakuna maji katika kituo cha afya cha Ilginyau na i nina hakika kama iizara hii ingepatiwa pesa za katosha, wangenunua tangi la maji katika shule na kituo hiki hx cha afya. Kwa wakati huu, kuna tangi moja tu katika wilaya hii na haiwezi kuyatoshelesa mahitaji ya watu wote.Kwa hivyo, ningeomba Wisara hii patiwe pesa sa kutosha ili kuwesa kununua raatangi ya maji kwa shule na vituo vya afya, na wakifanya hivyo, bila shaka, tutapata maji ya kutosha Ningetaka maofisa wa hisara hii ambao wamepelekwa katika sehemu hii, wajaribu kutengeneza mashine ya maji ya boreholes na mabwawa. Hinaposema hivyo, siwesi kuwarudishia shukdrani ile kamati ya Freedom from Hunger Council ambao wametusaidia katika upande wa kutengeneza maowawa. Iiingeiomba Uizara hii ihakikishe kwamba maofisa wake warashirild.ana na tesii kamati hii ili kuweza kuiengeneza nabwawa yanayohitajika. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu asxc tunawategemea watu wa r.aji kwa sababu  ndio wana ujuzi wa kutosha. wao ndio wanaweza kajua wakati mashine sinasotumiwa kupiga maji sinapoharibika. Kamati hii kazi yake ya kuj enga bwawa inapomalisika, wao wanaondoka na kwa hivyo, maofisa wa maji ni lazima wawe karibu wakati wote ili kuwasaidia wananchi wakati mashine hizi si nap oharibilca.Kwa hayo machache, naur.ga mkono.</newspeech><newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Kibaki): Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker for giving me this opportunity to speak on this vote. First of all, I would like to congratulate the Minister for water Development and his staff for the new pipeline water project that has been set up. In doing so I have just about three or four points to make. First of all, I would like to say that there is a very serious need for the Ministry to make sure that the project that have already been started are completed before new ones are established. I am saying so because here we are really talking about capital. At times we use capital to initiate water projects whereby we find water pipes being laid and brick tanks built. However, the water does not flow into the pipes and therefore, that capital just lies there without benefiting those whom it was intended to benefit. This is straightforward basic economics and it should be totally obvious and does not need to be mentioned by hon. Members that something really ought to be done. Today, we have hundreds of projects started and gone half-way and that money is committed but not producing the benefits. So, we should give the already started project the first priority.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we in the Ministry of Health are very, keen to see water projects being successful because more than any others service that is rendered to Kenyans, the provision of water is paramount, there clean water is available, diseases that pester and kill little children and infants are reduced by more than half automatically, particularly the intestinal diseases and diarrhea. So, we are very keen to see these water projects being completed, Where there is not enough money, and this is my third point, the Ministry should join hands with the Ministry of Education now that we are building schools in every village, to educate our people how to use roof catchment water, we want to use roof catchment water from roofs at schools and at our homes. For example, the amount of rain water that could be harvested or caught from the roofs one one primary school in a district like Kericho, Hanoi, lyeri or any other place where there is a lot of rain, is enormous. Furthermore, this water is cleaner than river water which means that our children will drink clean water all the time. So, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry if Technical Training and Applied Technology and the Ministry of water development should come together and try to assist the people in the rural areas to harness roof water. Today, we have the jua kali artisans who are capable of making very good water tanks, gutters and all they need is only smell capital to buy the materials. So, we can use these people to build water tanks and in a short time we shall be able to harness a lot of rain water a very cheap a project and would cover the whole country, and provide a lot of water to schools and homes throughout the country. I know the jua kali people could build these tanks very effectively. Therefore, these three or four Ministries only need to get together and get with the assistance of the jua kali people^ they would be able to provide us with a lot of water. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the same thing applies to what we are calling the "earth dams". This is not something that ought to be left to the Ministry of Livestock Development and other people. As was said yesterday the vast majority of the people in this country are going to depend on the "earth water" and rain water and we have to establish dams from these two sources of water. The only thing we can be able to do this is to join hands with the Ministry of Water Development, Livestock development, the Ministry of Reclamation and Development of Arid, Semi-Arid and wastelands in order to complete these projects. I am saying this because the resources available between those three Ministries would transform some districts. If you take, for example, as district like Laikipia or wajir you would find that the water is available in the underground but with a little expenditure from these three Ministries, we would be able to get enough water for our people and their livestock. This water is right there.That water is right there. The Uaso Nyiro River Basin Development Authority that has been formed to take care of the waters that flow in this river and disappears somewhere in Abasweni never to be seen again should realise that what we are talking about is something very small but very urgent, and can cost very little to do. We are willing to dig the necessary trenches and divert this water towards where it can be utilised. During the rains all the rivers feeding this main river are full, but, in three months, they go dry again. During chat short period, millions and millions of gallons of water that flows away can be diverted towards where it is needed.However, this is only a small thing think of Yatta, for instance. The intention at one time was to make the Yatta Furrow flow further southwards, but it is now clogged, blocked; unmaintained and inoperative. Therefore, the amount of water getting through this furrow is very little. However, mere labour, leave alone machinery, would reopen this furrow and water would flow to that part of the country, in which case, the area can produce all the horticultural crops we need for use in Nairobi, abroad and everywhere else. Land is available there, and the black cotton soil there which looks unproductive can, with a little water, produce all the beans and other crops that we need.</newspeech><newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: It can even produce miraa.</newspeech><newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Kibaki): No, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we do not need to plant miraa. We are talking about serious things, and miraa should be forgotten. As you know, miraa is actually a drug, and the hon. Member should think about this. I actually do not want to talk about it.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Muturia): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir could the hon. Minister, the Member for Othaya apologise for calling miraa a drug?</newspeech><newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Kibaki): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member would be better advised not to raise this issue. It would be better to leave it quiet because it may become a crisis sooner than he thinks. Out of my goodness towards him, I will not raise the matter further.I only want to plead with the Minister for Water Development to realise that the people of Othaya Constituency started a project there once upon a time in history, but it only went on half-way. Ever since then, some people have been getting some water while others have not been getting any. Therefore, we plead with the Minister and his officers to consider this very small job that requires to be done. All there is to do is to raise the water reservoir there, which is a very small one where water flows through gravity from the Aberdares Range. The cost involved in this work is very little because it does not include any pumping or energy, which has become very expensive. It is only a matter of making sure that the piping and the other systems reach the places they are supposed to reach. This work could be done by the Ministry as a Christmas gift to the people of Othaya, as a result of which we will pray for it and be grateful for ever.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MAKAU: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Ministry of Water Development is, as has been said by those who have spoken before me, a very crucial and important one as far as the agricultural and the industrial development of this country is concerned. Those of us who come from arid and semi arid places such as Machakos and Kitui, especially Machakos, would like to thank the Minister for Water Development and his officers for their recent trip to Machakos to assess the problem that Machakos, and especially the new district of Wote, are going to face, they guaranteed us that water would be available at the new headquarters of Wote, which is going to be an urban centre or a town council. I would also like to join my colleagues from Machakos who have spoken before me in thanking His Excellency the President for his personal initiative in the Kilimanjaro—Machakos-Kajiado Water Project. Currently, this project is being referred to as Nortoresh (?), but, because of His Excellency the President's initiative in that project, we would still like to refer to it as the Kilimanjaro—Machakos-Kajiado Water Project. His Excellency the President came down to Machakos and promised the people there that he would make sure that water was made available to them, and we have now seen the fruits of Nyayoism through that project. Every now and then, we would like our people to be reminded that the project originates in Kilimanjaro and passes through Machakos on its way to Kajiado. It is currently the lifeline of the areas concerned. Our thanks to the President are evident in our loyalty to the President. That is why there was nobody from Machakos involved in the recent disturbance that we had.Having said that, I would like to say that in Machakos there has been and there still is what is called the Machakos Integrated Development Programme, which was started with money given through the European Economic Community, the African Carribeans Countries and Home I and Lome II. This programme spent about Shs.0.5 billion in developing various projects in Machakos District, but I would like the Minister and his officers to note that the programme has been left hanging because, although Phases I and II were started by the programme, we are still waiting for Phase III. Dams and water points were constructed, but there are no pipes connecting these water points. One example is Mlima Dam, which was constructed with money obtained from European Economic Community countries arid Lome I and Lome II. The promise we were given was that there was going to be Phase III of the project. We are worried about this third phase of the programme because up to now the Shs.300 million that we were promised has not been forthcoming. However, we understand that there are problems. Recently, there was a Question here on Phase II of Kibauni Water Project, which covers Kalawa Location, in Mbooni Constituency. Wananchi were asked to prepare trences for the laying of pipes. Those trenches are now there, and we understand it will cost about Shs.60 million to install these pipes. We were told in the Machakos District Development Committee that Phase III of Machakos Integrated Development Programme ws on the way that 50 per cent of the money involved would go to water projects. The wananchi of Kalawa Location have done their job, and the Ministry should now come in because the money we were promised does not seem to be forthcoming.There was a Question here from the hon. Member for Mwala, which borders my constituency, and we were told that the construction of this .water project would cost about KShs.60 million. So, we would like the Ministry to look in that issue so that people in that area can be supplied with water. The Machakso Integrated Development Programme currently; has no money and we do not see any money coming to that Programm's phase three in the near future. There is no point of waiting for money that does not come. Every time we have been told in the district development committee that there are some technical problems, and we understand that up to now nothing has come up. This is an area where the Ministry should concentrate. We are very grateful for the water projects which were started, but they were left hanging. The Ministry can allocate some money to finish these projects because it is just a question of putting pipes to connect the rural villages to the water sources. For instance, we only need pipes to take water from Mulima Dam and take it to the people.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when you look at the Development Estimates, one thing that is worrying is that you find that for about five years there have been projects appearing there. Those projects have been coming in the Development Estimate's year in year out and there is nothing that has been done about them. Those projects on which investigations and feasibility studies have been done should be implemented. For example, the question of constructing a water project in Mbooni Constituency has been appearing in the Estimates Books for a long time, and we would like something to be done: We are very grateful that a sum of about KShs. 600,000/- has been allocated for the purchase of pipes. Having said that, Sir, let me say that looking at the budget of the Ministry of Water Development, it is very clear that a lot of money that is going to do water projects comes in form of aid from foreign countries. When the Minister presented his Vote, he thanked donor countries for having done a good job. But then, we should be very specific on the question of conditionally in aid. We accept the structural adjustments programmes are acceptable from institutions like the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund because if you are borrowing money the person who is lending you should know how you are going to use that money. But conditionalities being imposed on some donor countries have started imposing on borrowers are unacceptable. Developing countries should tell these donor countries clearly that aid is given on friendly basis and, there¬fore, no conditions should be imposed on it. The conditionality that is coming with aid, that developing countries should accept opposition in their govern¬ments I am talking about multi-parties should be rejected. Friendship means that you are going to give aid without conditions.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, our President has been very emphatic that Kenyans cannot and will never accept these conditionalities. Kenyans shed blood for independence because we wanted to maintain sovereignty; we wanted to be a sovereign state. After attaining our independence, people should not keep on dangling aid baskets and telling us that we can only get that aid if we fulfill certain conditions. We should maintain our own cultural values. We have never seen or heard conditionalities being imposed on Middle East countries which, I am not afraid to say, are not democratic. They do not have democratically elected governments like Kenya. Those countries are not given any aid conditions because' they are rich. It is unfortunate that it is only the poor countries which are being given certain conditions when it comes to aid by donors. We would like to appeal to the donors that as much as we would like to have their aid, they should not impose any conditions on us. If there is instability in the country, there is no point of giving the money. If, for instance, I know that you are just about to start fighting, there is no point of giving you some¬thing. Kenyans should be behind His Excellency the President in saying that we should not be blackmailed by the aid that donor countries are going to give us. We should tell them very clearly that a friend aiding another friend should have no conditions.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. LENGES: Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipatia nafasi hii ili nami niweze kujiunga na Wahe. Wabunge wenzangu katika kutoa maoni juu ya Hoja hii ya muhimu sana kwa Kenya. wizara ya Ustawi wa Maji inatekeleza wajibu mkubwa sana katika taifa la Kenya. Hii ni Wizara yamhimu sana kwa sababu maji hi maisha kwetu sote. Bila maji hatuwezi kuwa na maisha bora kwa sababu vituo vya afya, shule au hata hospitali haziwez.i kujengwa. Zaidi ya hayo, bila maji hatuwezi hata kuwa na chakula.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, nataka kusema kwamba maji yanahitajika sana katika sehemu ninayowakilisha hapa Bungeni. Ninaishukuru Wizara kwa sababu imefanya mambo mengi katika setiemu hiyo, hata ingawa sehemu ye'nyewe ni kubwa sana. Hata hivyo, bado tunasema kwamba maji yanahitajika katika seheinu zilizo mbali na miji kama vile Bargoi au Maralal. Tunahitaji maji katika sehemu ambazo watu wanafuga mifugo. Kwa hivyo, wakati Wizara inapotekeleza mipango yake, tunataka itupatie maji katika sehemu ambazo kuna malisho badala ya kuweka maji katika sehemu nyingine.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ombi langi la muhimu siku ya leo kwa Wizara ya Ustawi wa Maji ni kwamba tunahitaji tupatiwe maji katika kituo cha Baragoi. Kituo hicho kilianzishwa mnamo 1952, na mpaka sasa tumekuwa na shule za msingi, shule za sekondari, kituo cha afya na kadhalika. Kwa sasa, tuna kisima kimoja tu cha maji kutumikia kituo hicho pamoja na zaidi ya watu 4,000 ambao wanaishi humo. Kisimatulicho nacho huwa sana sana kikipata majiwakati wa mvua tu na hatuna mahali pengine tunapoweza kupata maji. Kwa hivyo, watu hulaziraika kwenda kilomita 58 kuchota maji. Kwa hivyo, ninaiomba Wizara hii iangalie kama kuna mpango mwingine ambao unaweza kufanyiwa kituo hiki cha Baragoi ili kuwe na kisima kingine. Hata tukichimbiwe silanga huko hatutajali kwa sababu tunajua itagharimu pesa nyingi sana kuvuta maji kutoka Uasorangai, kilomita 30 kutoka wa Wilaya ya Samburu alilazimika kutuma matrela ya Wizara ya Ujenzi kupeleka raaji huko. Tunamshukuru sana kwa usaidizi huo. Waziri akitaka kujua vizuri anaweza kumwul'iza Ofisa wa Maji Wialayani Saraburu na ataelezwa shida tulizo nazo kuhusu maj i. Kwa hivyo, ningeiomba Vizara itafute n.jia nyingine ya kuiongezea Bar agoi. Hatuwezi kusema mashine iliyoko sasa mbaya pengine haiwezi kutoa maji ya kuwatosha watu wote wa mji huu.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, pia 5: katika Mawakilisho yangu kuna silanga zilizojengwa wakati wa ukoloni lakini wakati nrvua nyingi zinabomolewa na a maji. ITingsiomba 7izara itenga pesa kila niwaka za kosirekebisha silanga hizi. Ninaiomba 7izara iwe na trekta moja aina ya bulldozer katika xaakao raakuu ya wilaya ambayo inaweza kutumiwa kuzirekebisha silanga hizi popote katika wilaya nzima.Ihgawa ninaishukuru vizara kwa yote ili.yotuf anyia, baao tunahitaji zaidi kwa sababu maji ni nrohiiira sana kwa maisha ya watu wote kote nchini.Kwa hayo machache naunga mkono.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MADHUBUTI: Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kva kunipa nafasi hii ili nijiunge na wenzanga katika mjadala juu ya "voti hii ya v/izara ya Ustawi wa rJaji. Kwanza ninamshukuru Waziri Okwanyo ingawa pesa anazoomba hapa ni karna nusu ya sile zinazotakikana. Hata hivyo, pengine ameomba kiasi hiki kwa Serikali haina pesa za kutosha.ivlimi namjua mhe Okwanyo tangu 1963 tulipoinging katika Bunge kama mtu niwenye bidii katika kazi yake. akati alipokawa Yaziri wa Ustawi wa Mikoa aliitembelea nchi nsima; hata huko lamu alifika'na kutui anyia mengi. ITatuinaini kama Waziri wa Ustawi wa iiaji atahakikisha kila pembe ya nchi hii imepata maji."Kama mhe I.-lahihu alivyosema, leo Kbnya inategemea sana watalii ambao wengi wao huja Pwani, lakini wakati huu tuna taabu irabwa ya. maji huko Pwani. Ilipoonekana maji kutoka Ivizima Springs hayatoshi Serikali ilianzisha rp mpango wa maji wa Sabaki, lakini bado hatupati maji ya kutosha; shida mo j a sasa ni kwamba mashine haziwezi kuchuja machanga tz. au silt, ambao unapatikana katika Mto Sabaki.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, shida nyingine tuliyo nayo katika ni ufisadi. Sasa ni kama miaka minre tazgu Mombasa ipate mfereji wa maji na tulikuwa tumeambiwa shida ya maji ingeisha huko Mombasa baada ya mfereji huo wa pili kupatikana. "Lakini tulianza kupata sliida hiyo ya maji kabla ya mwaka kuisha. Jambo hilii lilifanyika kwa sababu maofisa wanaoangalia na kudhibitisha kazi imefanywa vizuri wanahongwa na kupitisha kasi mbaya. Hata huko Lamu wahandisi valifanya uchunguzi na kupata mahali ambapo maji yangetolewa na kupelekwa katika Mji wa Kiunga. Eisha mifereji ilinunuli wa lakini sssfci baadaye mhandisi msvingine alikuja na kusema kwamba mifereji iliyokuwa imenunuliwa si iliyotakikana. Ubaya ni kwamba pesa zilizokuwa zimetumika zilikuwa msaada kutoka nchi fulani na kuieleza nchi hiyo kilichokuwa kimefanyika kungetuf anya. tucnekane wapuabavu. Huu ni mwaka wa nne; zzz ile mifereji bado ipo hapo na wananchi bado vana shida ya maji.Shida ya maji katika Lamu inaweza kumalizwa kz. icwa kutumia maji ya Mto Tana; ni lazima tuweke maji katika vi si we ambavyo vinatembelewa na wataiii. Lilikuwa kosa k.vetu kutoa maji kuto Lamu na kuyapeleka nje ya kisiwa hiki; sasa tuna shida ya kupima maji kila siku katika mwaka mzima. Hwa sababu hii watalii katika Lamu wameanza kupungua, na hali Mji wa Lamu ambao ulijengwa miaka 2000 iliyopita ni wa kipekee hauna magari bali punda hutumik kwa uchukuzi. Mombasa na Lamu zina joto jingi hivi k.vamba kila wakati mtu anatakavkuoga. Kwa sababu ninamwcmba Vaziri asitegemee anayoambiwa na maofisa wake bali aende na kujionea kinachofaa kufanywa kuhusu maji katika Mombasa na Lamu.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, maji ya Kisiwa cha Baza nilikozali wa ni chumvi zaidi hivi kwamba watu wengine wanaleta maji kutoka sehemu nyingine na kuyauza hza hapo Shs.5/- k.va debev Eiva hivyo, ninaiomba Serikali shida ya maji huko k.va njia maalum. Ningetaka pia is ichunguze ripoti ya Holland ya miaka mitano iliyopita. kuhusu jinsi ya kutega maji ya :.Ito Tana badala kay aac ha yamwagika katika Bahari ya Hindi.Kwa hayo zsl machache naunga M mkono.</newspeech><newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR COOPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Cheruiyot) Thank you Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving an opportunity to contribute to this very important Vote. First of all I would like to thank the Minister for ably moving this Motion which touches on the whole nation. I think every hon. Member should contribute to this Motion because touches on everybody.The money being asked for by this Ministry is not enough considering the need for water. I would also like to thank the President who has created an enabling environment for the putting up water projects which are normally completed over a very long period. Some of our neighbouring countries are not sure of what is going to happen tomorrow. In such a situation, you cannot work any programmes; you cannot plan, design, investigate or complete a project. This country is lucky to have a peaceful environment and all this is attributed to the President.Then Ministry has an ambitious programme to the effect that by the year 2000, every home should have piped water. This is very positive in my opinion. The Ministry of water Development has qualified technical manpower but they lack patriotism, devotion and speed in implementing projects. These officers should attend seminars on project implementation. I know that the World Sank finances courses, say, at Esaini for officers of this cadre so that they can know what is necessary in completing a project. I know that we attribute seme of our problems to lack of finance, but I can tell you, Sir, for certain that I congratulate the Permanent Secretary for Water Development because there was a project in my district which should have taken three months to complete. Honey was voted and A.I.E. issued but the project did not taken. off the ground even after one year, when the Permanent Secretary wrote a letter to the district water engineer asking for regular reports on the progress of the project, the project took off the ground. The project is now in progress because the officers responsible know that their Permanent Secretary can take action if they do not discharge their duties properly. If such a small project can take so long to complete, how about massive water projects undertaken by the Ministry?That is why I said that our people should be more dedicated to their work. When moving this Motion, the Minister thanked donor agenciesan that have financed some of the big projects Some of these countries would like to see appreciation in writing. I know that the mass media can tell them that we are grateful because they have given us funding of some kind. The Minister should make sure that written appreciation is extended to them so that they can know that we, as a Government, are thankful for the grants so extended.Water is important in all spheres of life. It is because of water that our country is fetching good money from horticultural produce. For example, arid and semi arid areas can use water for irrigation for the production of various crops. In fact, our vegetables and flowers are fetching good money for this country. For example, if we establish a market in Western Europe, we must supply the product in question consistently. Carnations and French beans are highly marketable in, say, United Kingdom ana taking into 2352a account the appreciating Sterling Pound, Kenya can earn good foreign exchange. If we have constant supply of water, we can earn a lot of money from horticultural produce.Zero grazing also needs constant supply of water. The production of milk has gone up greatly to the extent that K.G.C. cannot handle the milk that is delivered to them per day. This milk is only produced in those areas where there is regular supply of water. I thank the Ministry because they have done very well and it is only management and supervision that is lacking. Otherwise, they have done a good job to ensure that water is provided for mechanised farming. If the Ministry can supply water to all the areas they have surveyed, we shall maximise mill production.Finally I would like to thank the President for what he said during the University of Nairobi graduation ceremony on Monday. Recently, there was panic that we are over-producing graduates. I know we have reached a situation; like other countries, of over-producing high levelmanpower. These are the people we need to man various places. For example, Korea has utilised its human resources and they have now industrialised so much that  it is a power to reckon with. I do not think we have reached a stage where our graduates can say that there are no jobs ior them. The President assured them by saying that the Government would try its best to ensure that they are absorbed. The only problem is that these graduates have been tuned to imagine that immediately they graduate, they will get jobs, we are preparing people for life particularly with the 8-4-4 programme where people graduate not for direct employment  but for self-employment. Soon we might start exporting brains to neighbouring contries including South Africa.The President recently initiated the manufacture of Nyayo Pioneer Cars. Once this industry takes off, it will absorb very many people. The export processing Zone is one area we should exploit. For example, the unemployment rate is Mauritius was 20 per cent at one time, but immediately they started producing for export, this rats was reduced to almost a nothing. In fact, they are now employing people from Madagascar and so on.I beg to support.   </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT  MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mrs Ogot): Thank you, Sir, for giving me this opportunity, Water is important for our lives and I  would like to say from the cutset that hon. okwanyo has starred well and he is doing a good job.	just like when he was in the Ministry cf Regional Development. We are now looking forward to hon. Okwanyo's visit to Siaya because he has already visited other areas and good results have been achieved there. I am glad that the Minister has been consulting with many hon. Members cf this House which is unusual. We would like the Minister to visit Yala because that is the beginning of Sivindi Malakisi Water ProjectThe turbine there  was commissioned in 1986 and project has not yielded any fruits up to now.The Sivindi-Water Project is supplying rater to Yala, Ugunja, Ukwala, Butere ana khisero. How, since this project was commissioned in 1986, the water has not been extended to other parts of Yala. River Yala passes through my constituency before it flows to Lake Victoria.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when the late Owiti was alive the Uranda-Lamula Water Project was inaugurated and a lot of pipes were brought in between 1984 and 1986. But those pipes were later removed. I do not know why the pipes were taken away when in fact we had already dug the trenches in which the pipes were going to be laid. But since hon.Okwanyo will be visiting those areas the wananchi will put these questions to him when he finally - gets there.	Hon. Okwanyo is a thorough Liinister and I am surethat he will ensiure that this project is rehabilitated soon, A token sun of money has been allocated to that project. The figure is about XShs.40,000/- and I hope that the money will be used to revive the project.For the last four years money has been allocated to water projects in Gogo, Sirenbe, Lunsa and Dsng'ala in Yala Division. Trenches were dug in these areas and pipes were laid cut there is no water. It may be that the slope, was not steep enough to make the water flow by the force of gravity. Since the minister is also planning to visit this area I am sure that we will get assistance so that water supply can be extended further.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are happy because St. Mary's High School in Yala has been expanded. The school now has a three-storey building and we are grateful to the Ministry for what the Ministry has already done for us particularly during the year 1989. We asked the Ministry, through our D.D.C.  to kindly consider assisting us with storage tanks. We wantedto raise funds for this purpose but we realised that it was too costly for us. I request the Minister to come to  our aid in the near future particularly when funds become available.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the Lais Basin Development Authority through the Liinistry for the  good work they have done for	especially in the  drier parts ofYala Division  particularly the area of South Gem and lower East Gem. A lot of work was done when the Lake Basin Development Authority brought a lady to work there.I hope that the Lake Basin Development Authority will continue to keep that particular officer there to carry on with the work of providing water to us. Already she has commissioned several shallow wells and I hope that during this year and next year she will extend her work to North-Y/est Gem where there are many hardships due to lack of water.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there have been several complaints regarding illegal water connections in Yala Division. I would like the Minister to assist us in this regard. I expect the Ministry to know the actual number of people who are its legal customers. These illegal connections are dangerous particularly in Yala  area where we have the water source. we have already alerted the chiefs ana their assistants over this matter.' We assume that the people who have water connections are legal customers. So, we will support the Ministry's efforts to eradicate illegal connections which are likely to endanger the water supply in our area.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we had already requested that Kenfinco which has done a commendable job in Ukwala extends its services to Yala, Bondo, Boro and Rarieda. I am sure that the Minister is going to consider this request.With regard to the question of training women to man shallow wells and "boreholes, I would like to inform the Miinister that a commendable job has been done in areas where women have been trained to look after water kiosks and where they have been trained to carry out minor repair works. They have been trained in the Jua Kali Sector and they are doing a good job.On the campaign for the provision of ixanic tank water I think the Ministry has not done enough to encourage all families throughout Kenya to use roof catchment. Here is where we can conbime our efforts with those of the Jua Kali artisans to harvest rain water. I say this because a lot of rain water goes unharvested each rainy season. Leaders should convene barazas and talk to our people about this matter. People can harvest a lot of water from the roofs of their houses particularly those with corrugated iron sheets. This will also give our Jua Kali artisans enough work to do.The question of providing water, a commodity which is a source of life, cannot be left to the Ministry of Water Development alone. I think the Ministries of Health, Livestock Development and Agriculture should join hands with the Liinistry of water Development to provide water because they also use a lot of water besides the services they render to our people.Finally, Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would liketo thank His Excellency the President for the speech he gave to the nation during the Kenyatta Day Celebrations. The speech gave Kenyans and the African peoples at large a dignity. I say this because if economic aid is going to be given with a lot of political strings, it is going to be very difficult for us to appreciate that aid. We have appreciate the aid we have received from non-Governmental organisations and foreign governments because it has enabled us to advance in the provision  of health services, education and other services. But we appeal to those foreign countries to give us our right which is our	dignity as Africans and our dignity as peoples of Independent African countries.With those few remarks, I beg to support the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. ole Kaparo.)Thank you, Mr, Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir, for giving me this opportunity to make my contribution on this very important motion. This because if I fail to make contribution on any Motion relating to water the people of Laikipia will be absolutely upset; upset because water is life. We all know that human life, animal life, marine life and plant life are all sustained by water. This is why I have risen to support the Vote of the Ministry of Water Development. The Ministry is looking for funds to enable it to implement various projects in the country. If the funds were not limited I would have supported their request for more money than they are asking for now. I believe that the funds the Ministry is seeking we be utilised in the most effectiveMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, my only request to my good friend, the"Minister for Water Development  hon. Okwanyo  is to visit Laikipia and notto concentrate on Siaya alone  as my colleague, the gracious lady., hon. Grace Ogot said. He should come to Laikipia and see the problem </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mrs. Ogot).:On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the hon. AssistantMinister in order really misinterprete what I said. I did not say that hon.Okvanyo concentrates on Siaya alone because I know he also vists all otherdistricts in the country. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. ole Kaparo):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think hon. Okvanyo comes from around Siayaand since  I come from another district far away from Siaya, I think he THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Order hon. ole Kaparo.I am sure you are aware that each Minister is answerable to all questionsthat touch on his Ministry from every corner of the Republic. Therefore,hon. Grace Ogot is right in saying that the Minister is responsible for all district water projects and he should visit them from time to time. </Newspeech><Newspeech>TEE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. ole Kaparo): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was provoking that</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mrs. Ogot): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Is it in order for hon. Assistant Minister to assume that all Luo Members of Parliament come from Siaya District? That is rather absurd! </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. ole Kaparo): I did not say that hon. Okwanyo comes from Siaya. I know he comes from a place called Migori and I have been there myself. However, what I was saying is that my good friend, the Minister for Water Development, should come to Laikipia and see the plight of those people there. I am saying this because since I came to this House about two or three years ago, I have been a very good friend of the Water Department and I will continue to be so in the hope that one day, out ofTemporary,Deputy Speaker, I an on record in this House as having said that we are not asking for piped water as people from otherareas are asking.  We       would like very much like to get clean piped water, butin the intervening period, we are asking the Ministry to provide the Laikipiapeople with water within a reasonable distance because I know we can get water from a reasonable distance. Of course, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am mindful of the factthat we cannot get as much water as we require, but if you look at the riversemanating from Mt. Kenya, the Aherdares, all of then have a lot of water, as Uaso Nyiro River. once used to have. However, there is a danger in that not far from now, the Uaso Nyiro River itself will dry up unless we address ourselves to this problem.  The Minister should endeavour to find out how much water is now left inthis river and how much of that water is still being tapped. My suggestion,although this may be a very expensive exercise, is that in the upper regionsof the Uaso Nyiro, we should construct huge dams to conserve flood waters.I am saying this because there is a lot of water in the Uaso Nyiro duringthe  rain reason which flows up to the Lorian Swamp and disappears underground.during the dry season, like the last two months, it looked like the  Uaso Nyirowould dry up after 60 miles from its source. This is a problem that the Ministershould address himself to if we have to continue using the waters of this river.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we also have to supplement the water that we have by constructing dams, boreholes and from roof catchment water and so on. The problem has been that the Ministry of water Development has not paid full attention to areas that lack water absolutely. I have said before that we ought to plan ten or 20 years ahead. I am saying this because in ten or twenty years, the population of Kenya at the rate it is increasing, will have to move northwards towards the Kenya Ethiopian border because the highlands will not contain the population anymore. Therefore, this is the right time we prepared ourselves for this so that when such a time comes, it would find us prepared for it.THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): It is now time for the</Newspeech> 	<newspeech> THE MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Okwanyo).: "'First of all,Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity tothank all hon. Members who have contributed to debate on my Ministry's voteyesterday and today. I an very grateful for the support which they havegiven us and I would like to assure them that all the points that they haveraised, will be taken into consideration.Having said that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would now liketo touch on the various points that were raised by the hon. Members. Emphasiswas laid by nearly every hon. Member who spoke, on the importance of providingwater in town, urban centres, divisional headquarters and also in the smalltrading centres. I concur with the sentiments that were made by hon.Members in this regard. Water supply in the development centres is very importantand my Ministry will do everything it can to provide water in these centres.However, I would like to say that the movement of our people into urban centresis such that we are not able to cope with their water requirements.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is liaising with.the Ministry of Planning and National Development in providing infrastructuresand other facilities in the trading centres in the rural areas, and the provisionof water is one of these facilities that ire are going to provide. However,for my Ministry to  intensify the provision of water to these centres, therespective district development committees, in which we are all Members,should consider and recommend these areas as their first priority. Most hon.Members also spoke about the provision of water in the rural areas and Iwould like to take a few moments to talk about our plan for the provision ofwater in the rural areas. The water projects that have not been completed in the rural areas are cuite many and scattered throughout the Republic. Seme of these projects were started on a Harambee basis while others were started by non¬governmental organizations and Missionaries and others by the local authorities.Although our wananchi will not be able to know which is which, we all take them to belong to our people. So, we will do everything we can in this regard. We have instructed our district water engineers to list all of them-and present them to the already formed district water committees (?) and later to the district development committees concerned so that we may make arrangements to get a number of them completed every year. We know that, they are so many in some districts. If you take South Nyanza District, for example, you will find that we have well over 20 such projects of which some have pipes laid, others have tanks finished and yet others have only the intake bill laid. They were all abandoned in our rural areas. I know that we have such projects in every district in the country. This is not anybody's mistake. The projects were undertaken by different bodies. Some of them were undertaken by missionaries, others through the Harambee Spirit and others by the United National Children's Programme and the European Community. The project that the hon. Member for Nyatike talked about was undertaken by the European Economic Community, which spent more than Shs.5 million. The Community left it unfinished and toay the wananchi there say, "Our project was not completed although it was undertaken by a very big organisations." We want a list of all these projects to be sent to us by our District Water Engineer so that we may know which ones to be completed this year and which ones to complete later. With this knowledge, we may approach the people who started them or even approach other donor countries to help finish the remaining work.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, some hon. Members talked about livestock programmes with regard to the provision of water for livestock. This is very important to our economic activities in rural areas, and the Ministry is involved in the construction of dams and water pumps as well as in the drilling of boreholes to act as sources of water. We are doing this in areas where livestock is very important, such as the areas occupied by the Maasai and the Turkana, and in other areas in Eastern and North-Eastern Provinces. So, when the hon. Assistant Minister from Turkana said yesterday that we havs forgottenthose people who keep cattle and are only thinking of those who live in towns, he was not quite right. We have constructed some dams in rural areas to serve livestock. Some such dams are to be seen in Turkana, where the Government has done a lot of work. So, he should congratulate the Government on what it has done in that area.Hon. Ngei talked about the extension of the Kilimanjaro-Machakos— Kajiado Water Project to Kangundo. This was the initial design of the project. It was intended that the project provides water up to Kajiado via Athi River and Machakos as a whole. However, if there will be surplus water after commission the project, extension beyond the initial limit of supply will be considered. This is a very huge project, and we will first see whether water will reach the initially intended destinations, that is Machakos Town, Athi River and Kajiado. If the people living in Kangundo and other nearby places want this water, we will definitely see to it that they get it. Of course, the Maasai who live in these areas will be considered and given water for their livestock.I also want to talk about water in Mombasa, a point that was raised by hon. Mahihu and hon. Massir. It is true that we have some problem with water in the Coast. This water, particularly in Mombasa, is sometimes rationed. This is because the present sources, such as Sabaki, are giving us problems. The project in Sabaki was constructed with the assistance of a World Bank loan. The project has, however, been facing several operational problems since it was commissioned, particularly regarding-siltation. I would like to assure the hon. Members that the matter is being looked into and that remedial measures will be taken as soon as possible. Sabaki was studied a long time ago, and it is a very expensive water supply. The treatment of this water is very expensive, and if get the second Mzima Springs supply, which we are soon getting, we will do something about the former project, which is very expensive at the moment.In the case of mzima Springs, my Ministry is currently holding discussions with various donor aopnr.iss tin finance We project; whose investigations,planning and design have almost been completed. As soon as this second Mzima Springs Pipeline is finished, Mombasa will not have any more problems. We would have visited Mombasa and tried to discuss with the local leaders there the water problems there, but, we could not do so because we-had other business up here.One hon. Member raised the issue of the National Water Conservation and Pipeline Corporation. This Corporation was established in 1988 vide Legal Notice No.270 of 16th June, 1988. The broad function of the Corporation is to construct and manage water resources in the area designated by me. Like the Ministry of Water Development, the short and long-term objective of theCorporation is to manage water supplies in a business manner and practice, andthis means that every water supply will be treated as an income-and-expenditure centre. To do so, the greater emphasis of the Corporation will be placed on improved financial management to ensure that optimum use is made on the existing assets and that proposed and new investment will be fully justified economically and viably.About three hon. Members from Rift Valley also raised a point in Timboroa Water Project, and I want to say that the issue regarding the extraction of water from rivers that feed into Lake Victoria has been so some considerable interest to the Ministry. Therefore, I would like1 to inform the House that the Chinese Government recently sent a group of experts to carry out the necessary feasibility study. They were in this country late last year for about three months. However, let me tell the House that it was through His Excellency the President that the Chinese Government has willingly accepted to send experts from China. The Ministry is waiting for a report on the studies to be carried out.We fully agree with the hon. Member's sentiments that the project is of a national importance. We think the Chinese have found it viable, and the study on the project is going on. We shall let the hon. Member know immediately we get the results of the Chinese experts.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Mwenje and other two hon. Members did speak about our policy of getting clean water to all Kenyans by the year 2000. Looking at the trend of things in the world today and also the popul¬ation growth in our country and the available resources, it is no longer realistic to say that water will be made available to every home by the year 2000. However, my Ministry will continue to mobilise the available resource's as effectively as possible so that water will be brought closer to every home' as soon as possible'. We cannot say that we will provide water to every home by the year 2000 because it is only about nine years to go before the.With regard to pollution of water bodies, my Ministry has taken every measure to control pollution. Research units have recently been established in my Ministry to research, among other things, the effective methods of solid and liquid waste disposal.Sir, some hon. Members also spoke on the Ewaso-Nyiro North River and how it disappears in the desert. The issue of the disappearance of the Ewaso-Nyiro North River in the Wajir area is still under investigations, but the workwill be carried out by the Ministry and the newly formed Ewaso-Nyiro North Development Authority to make use of this water in developing those areas that border the river.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, with regard to Ministerial visits, I will continue visiting all districts in the Republic with a view to familiarizing myself with what is happening. Our visits to the various districts have put our officers in those areas on their feet and we now hear that water is becoming available in those areas we have visited. We have been to various partsof both Eastern and North Eastern provinces and we have found that the lack of water was occasioned by laxity on the part of some of our officers. Right now there is enough water in those areas because the officers are now working we'll.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also want to assure the Members of Parliament from around Nairobi that Phase III of the Nairobi City Commission Water Project will improve the present water shortage in the city. Kayole and other suburbs will be considered at the completion of this project. At the moment, Nairobi residents should bear with the City Commission of Nairobi because the population of the city is very big compared to the available water. You will recall that the water available was supposed to cater for about half a million people and that today Nairobi has a population of about 1.5 million.Once more, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank all hon. Members for their contribution on this important Vote. As many hon. Members said, water is life and I want to appeal to hon. Membes that they can help us quite avgreat deal. Most of these projects I have talked about are discussed in district development committee meetings and we are all members of those commit¬tees. As I have already said, we have already formed district water boards where hon. Members can present their views. The boards are in every district and the chman is the local district commissioner. The secretary is the district water engineer and the boards cover all water projects in any given district, be they Governmental or non-governmental. Therefore, it is fitting for hon. Members to take their views to these boards so that at the district development committee we can know which projects to assist and which ones to set aside.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg tomove.</Newspeech>(Question put and agreed to) [The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Wabuge) left the Chair]<Header>IN THE COMMITTEE</Header>/The Temporary Chairman (Mr. Tuva) took the Chair/ Vote 20  Ministry of Water Development<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Okwanyo): Mr. Temporary Chairman, I beg to move:-THAT, a sum not exceeding K£,22,152,045 be issued from the Consolidated Fund to complete the sum neces¬sary to meet expenditure during the year ending 30th June, 1991, in respect ofVote 20  Ministry of Water Development</Newspeech>(Question proposed)RECURRENT EXPENDITURE Sub-Vote 200 - General Administration and Planning (Head 885 agreed to) (Sub-vote 200 agreed to)Sub-Vote 201 - Water Development(Heads 336 and 683 agreed to)(Sub-Vote 201 agreed to)Sub-Vote 202 - Training of Water Development Staff(Head 899 agreed to)(Sub-Vote 202 agreed to)Sub-Vote 203 - Rural Water Supply(Head. 887 agreed to)(Sub-Vote 203 agreed to)Sub-Vote 205 - Urban Water Supply and SerWarage(Heads 892, 894 and 89? agreed to)(Sub-Vote 205 agreed to)Sub-Vote 206 - Special Water Programme.(Heads 389, 890. 893, 897 and 398 agreed to)(Sub-Vote 206 agreed to)Sub-Vote 207 - Water Conservation and Pipeline corporate (Head 935 agreed to)		(Sub-Vote 207 agreed to) (Vote-520 agreed to)DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE Sub-Vote 201 - Water Development(Heads 886 and 337 agreed to)(Sub-Vote 201 agreed to) Sub-Vote 202 - Training of Water Development Staff (Head 899 agreed to) (Sub-Vote 202 agreed to)Sub-Vote 203 - Rural Water Supply(Heads 511, 523, 524 and 525 agreed to) (Sub-Vote 203 agreed to)Sub-Vote 204- - Self-help Water Supply(Heads 526, 527 and 561 agreed, to) (Sub-Vote 204 agreed to) Sub-Vote 205 – Urban water Supply and Serwarage(Heads 560, 562, 563 and o95 agreed to) (Sub-Vote 205 agreed to) Sub-Vote 206 – Special Water Programme(Heads 893, 896, 897 and 926 agreed to) (Sub-Vote 206 agreed to) Sub-Vote 207 - Water Conservation and Pipeline Corporation (Heads 935, 936 and 937 agreed to) (Sub-Vote 207 agreed to) 	(Vote D20 agreed to)	(Question put and agreed to) (Resolution to be reported without amendment)  (The House resumed)(The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Wabuge) in the Chair) <Header>REPORT?</header><Header>Vote 20 Ministry of Water Development</Header><Newspeech>MR.

DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Wakole's Question please?Question No. 494Number of Tana River Ladies in the National Youth Service and Police ForceMR. WAKOLE asked the Minister of State, Office of the President(a) How many ladies from Tana River District have been into the National Youth Service and Police Force in the last three years and 	(b) What is the approved recruitmentquota for this district. <Newspeech>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Kyalo): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.One woman candidate was recruited into the Police Force within the last three years. A total of 16 women candidates were recruited into the National Youth Service from the same district during the same period.There is no approved quota for Tana River District both for the Police and National Youth Service. As there is no quota for any other district in the Republic. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAKOLE: Is it not shameful for the hon. Member to say that only one woman has been recruited for the three consecutive years? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYALO: Yes, it is only one woman who has been recruited during that period. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. JALDESSA: The Minister told the House that there is no quota for Tana River or any other district in the country. Does he mean to tellus that when they go to recruit the police, the do not have any specific number in  mind and as such they just go and recruit any number they want, or what does he mean by saying, that there is no quota for any district? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYALO: In the first place, the candidates must possess the required qualifications and also be fit. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAKOLE: Could the Minister answer what he has been asked? We want to know whether the districts have special numbers  candidates to be recruited? Do they go there and recruit 40 or 50 candidates? He should give us a specific number. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYALO: No specific number of candidates is recruited or specified for any district. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. WASIKE-NDOMBI: The Minister has just informed the House that only one woman candidate has been recruited 	from Tana River. Can he the House, how many	women have applied during the last three years out of who	only one was recruited? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYALO: The question of how many women have ?	applied does not arise because what matters in this exerciseis to get suitable candidates with the right qualifications and once those conditions are met then any number can be recruited. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASIKE—NDOMBI: On a point of order, Mr. DeputySpeaker Sir. Is the Minister not misleading the House byevading to the answer question  the should have informed the House,	so many applied so many did not qualify. so many had this« \	kind of qualifications and the only one that we took was	this and that Is he not  avoiding to the answer question. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYALO: That is not the way this exercise is done Those people look only for the fit candidates and the only thing they do is to find out how many are fit for recruitment. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. JALDESSA: On a pointy of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think we are being misled by the Minister and I am sorry to say this.  If ICOcandidates appear before the recruiting officer and they all happen to	qualify what would does he do? could they all be taken even if they from one district?	</Newspeech>	<Newspeech> MR. KYALO: As you are aware, recruitment is done on the basis of fitness,.	respective of the number that turns  up for the interview. what matters is how many</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINSITER OF STATE., OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (ctd) : are fit for that excercise. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

DEPUTY SPEAKER: You find it difficult to oblige</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will quote the answer.

What is happening? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BiDu: On a point of order, Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir. Can you therefore put us right because it seems that there is one confusion in the office of the Clerk? Can you then put us right, so that next time </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: On the contrary, Mr. Bidu, it does appear that there is a slight oversight on the part of the Ministry. I think, Mr. Kariuki will agree with us on that. The answer for this Question was wrongfully given to hon. arap Chepkok. May I kindly request that Mr. arap Chepkok, 	honourably surrenders that answer to, Mr. Kiliku. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEPKOK: The Question is mine. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MP. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Very well Do we have any more supplemental question's on this? yes, mr. Kiliku. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Therefore, when the Assistant Minister  that only one widow can CLAIM to be the beneficiary, what really ices mean?  my father, for example, had 30 wives and each are of the a rightful beneficiary of fathers property. Recently, there was a in my area where two WIVES of A deceased person had to certify that were the lawfully marriage wives of the deceased so when Minister want to mean when he says that one and only one wife should tie thebeneficiary to a marriage? Is he restricted people to many only one wife?For his information, I have two already. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARIUKI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the issue is a very simpleone, and if the hon Member wants to marry even a third ;rife, I have no quarrelwith that. However, the fact of the matter is ha that the claim in this casewas made "by one lady and she has to prove that she is the widow and the onlywidow of the deceased. If there are two widows, they have to prove "beyondany reasonable doubt that they axe the only widows of the decease and similarly.if they are 30 widows, the; claim will. have to be  made by s0 widows. It isas simple as that </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Question is talking aboutdependants and not wives and I do not know why the Assistant Minister istalking' about wives. The Question is clearly talking about the dependants ofthe late Johnson Maganga. I do not know whether the deceased had two or ten wives and the assistant minister  should address himself to the Question as it appears. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARIUKI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, whether this is a claim forthe dependants or not, there must be somebody  actually making the claimon behalf of the dependants. The person would either be the a widow or oneof the children. If it is the widow making a claim, she has to prove beyondany reasonable doubt that  she is the widow and the only widow of the deceased.If there are two widows, they will have to prove that they are the rightfulwidows of the deceased. Therefore, whether the beneficiaries are intended forthe whole family, there must be a particular person; mailing the claim. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: we must move on now.

It is onlyfully occupied on market days, that is, Wednesdays and Saturdays. However,as  soon as the number of passengers on this route justifies the runningof the daily service, the Kenya Railways Corporation will review the positionwith a view to meeting the increased demand. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech> MR.

I am saying this because the bus fares have gone upby  almost double and now almost all wananohi. like travelling by train. You will find that the bus fare between Voi and Taveta is about Shs.70/- while you pay only Shs20/- by train.

The Mombasa Branch Officials have however tried in vain to contact Mr. Kambi and the cheque is still lying at the Mombasa Branch Office awaiting his collection. Mr. should therefore be advised by the hon. Member to get in touch withthe Mombasa Branch officials and collect his cheque from then. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. BIDU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Assistant Minister for giving-this good answer, but I still want him to tell the House what post office box number was used in sending a cheque to this man</Newspeech>.<Newspeech> MR. EJORE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, although the post office box number in question is not here now, I think the cheque was sent via the address of the Manager of this gentleman's co-operative society. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. BIDU: As you can now see, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has corae here with a half—baked answer. Could he tell the House whether the said cheque was sent by registered mail or ordinary mail? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. EJORE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the hon. Member should thank the Ministry. In any case, the cheque was sent by registered mail via the address of the Manager of the co-operative society concerned. I would like my friend, the hon. Member, to go and look for Mr. Kambi Bavu and tell him to go co the Manager's office to get his cheque. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KUBO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it has been the practice in the past for co-operative officers to endorse cheques and transfer them to their personal accounts. What assurance would the Assistant Minister give that the officials involved in this case did not do this? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. EJORE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this may have happened in the past, but it is not happening now. Co—operative officers should not convert- members' cheques and bank them in their personal accounts. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. BIDU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, although I have already thanked the Assistant Minister for his reply, I would still want him to tell the House whether this cheque was sent to the proper address. He seems not to know the proper address because he says he does not have the post office number concerned. When I asked him whether the cheque was sent under registered mail or ordinary mail, he assumed that it was sent under registered mail. For the benefit of all Kenyans, could he tell this august House under what registration number this cheque was sent to Mombasa? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. EJORE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not think the hon. Member appreciates anything. If this cheque had not been sent under registered mail, my Ministry would not have found it later. Since the cheque is available, this means that even though the post office box number it was sent to is not there, ?	the cheque was found and is now lying in the society's office.Question No. 519•? -<Header> Outcome of the 1989 National Census </Header ><Newspeech> MR.

CHEPKOK asked the Attorney-General what has delayed the payment of Mr. Samson Sirma Chebii as per the ruling by Eldoret Senior Resident Magistrate-in Civil Case No. 726 of 1987 - Samuson Sirma Chebii versus Attorney—General.<Newspeech> THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg toreply.On 8th May, 1987, Mr. Samson Sirma Chebii was arrested grazing his cattle in the forest area of Kaptagat Forest. The Forester arrested him and detained his cattle. In the course of detention, three cows died of acute bloat. He claimed damages through the negligence of the Forester, the particulars of which were:—Failure to provide cows with proper feeds.Failure to give cows adequate housing as required.Failure to give cows proper and adequate attention.He valued his cows at Shs.6,000/= each and proceeded to court to sue the Attorney—General to recover Shs.l8,000/=, being the value of the three dead cows. There was also interest at the usual court rates, damages and costs of the suit. The case in question was immediately finalised on 14th December, 1988, and the plaintiff awarded damages against the Attorney—General amounting to Shs.25,370/= on 26th June, 1989. The plaintiff's advocate did not go to court to finalise certain formalities pertaining to issue of a decree and taxation of bill of costs. The Attorney-General is prepared to pay this money provided the plaintiff or his advocate goes to court, secures the-decree and obtains a certificate of costs. After that, the money in question will be released to him by the Ministry concerned through the Attorney—General. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, according to the answer  given, by the Attorney—General, the amount of money he quoted seems to be different from the amount I have in mind. The ruling by the Eldoret Senior Resident Magistrate's Court in Civil Case No. 725 of 1987 awarded Mr. Chebii . Shs.26,015/=, being suit costs and interest thereof.. However, the Attorney- General says that this amount was Shs.25,370/=. Which of these figures is correct? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MULI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would not like to quibble over Shs.1,000/=, which may represent suit costs, but our instructions are that the amount outstanding is Shs.25,370/=. This figure was arrived at on 26th June, 1989. If the hon. Member persuades the plaintiff's advocate to go to court andfinalise the necessary decree, the money that will be released will be much more than this figure because it will include interest from 26th June, 1989 to date. The main thing here is that the Government we found liable to having impounded these animals and not looking after them. The difference between the figures involved can quite easily be sorted out with the court registry. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let us go back to Mr. Makhanu's Question. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I apologise for coming late. </Newspeech>Question No. 519 Outcome of the 1989 National Census<Newspeech> MR. MAKHANU asked the Minister for Planning andNational Development what the outcome of the National®Census conducted in August, 1989 was and when the ?	results will be released. </Newspeech><Newspeech> THE MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Dr. Onyonka) : Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The 1989 population census was carried out between 24th/25th August and 2nd September, 1989 in accordance with Legal Notice No.455 of 4th November, 1988 and the data in currently being processed  As is the practice when census are carried out,a post census enumeration	survey was conducted on 27th September, 1990, to facilitate verification of	the 1989 census data. This, too, is being processed right now. It is expectedthat the results of both the population census and the post census enumeration survey will be ready early next year. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Deputy Speaker,. Sir, while thanking the hon. Minister for that reply, could he give us an indication of how much money was used in carrying out this exercise? </Newspeech><Newspeech> DR. ONYOKA: Unfortunately, Sir, I do. not have the figure with me because that was not part of the original Question. However, if the hon. Member would wish me to give the figure, I am prepared to do so next week. There is no problem. </Newspeech><Newspeech>  MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in view of the fact that the1;.	population of the country will have increased by the; time the results of thecensus are announced, what has delayed the announcement of the results? </Newspeech><Newspeech> DR.0NY0NKA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the .carrying out of a population census is a very elaborate .exercise which involves a lot of analyses in the tabulation of data. That takes quite some time because, in particular, even before we can issue the provisional results, the: critical factor is to do the post census enumeration to see whether it supports or it does not support the earlier information obtained. There is a. lot of paper work involved, it is an issue about which we need to be very cautious because the results have: very major implications. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech> MR. JALDESA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are all aware that the censuswas carried out a year ago. What then necessitated this post census enumerations this year? </Newspeech><Newspeech> DR. 0NY0NKA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is an established procedure in statistics that before you can rely on the sort of information obtained from any is undertaken. First of all, to.befable to undertake that exercise, we have to wait for the availability of the necessary funds in the following fiscal year. That was recently done, and that is why we have been able to undertake the exercise. So, once again, it is intended to assist us to compare the new results with the earlier results because that is the only way one can tell whether the census was accurate within what are called acceptable limits or the inaccuracies or mistakes involved were outside the acceptable limits. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MANG'OLI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if I heard the Minister well; when hon. Makhanu put a question to him as how much money was involved, he' said that if it is the wish of the hon. Member he can get the figure next week. Now, this Question being the property of this House, it is important for us to know how much money was involved in the exercise and whether the exercise was success¬ful. if We do realise that the delayin announcing the results may be due to the fact that the exercise was not successful and, therefore, the money was wasted. Can we be told how much money was involved and who were involved in the exercise? </Newspeech><Newspeech> DR. 0NY0NKA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is a simple and straight¬forward question. I simply said that I would be very pleased to give the House full figures with respect to the cost of the census. As to the other question as to whether the exercise was successful, that is the purpose of the post census enumeration survey because it is the information we will obtain which we shall then compare. This is done on a random basis statistically, and we cannot judge the results until that exercise is completed. But, as for the rest of the data concerning expenditure, that is an honest and fair question and it is for public knowledge. I am prepared to bring the figure to the House. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. BIDU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for the interest of Kenyans whoare very anxious to hear this I heard the Minister say that the resultswill be ready next year. What month and date of next year will these results be released. </Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The question put to the Minister was very clear. Is he in order to give half answers when he has been asked exactly when these results will be announced? Is it in order for him to continue saying that the results will be announced early next year and leave us in suspense for almost half a year? Why can he not be specific? </Newspeech><Newspeech> DR. ONYONKA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would not wish to be dragged into the question of semantics in English. Early next year means at least within the first quarter or at least within the first half of the year. After that it cannot be early next year. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Was the hon. Minister to say that I was not listening clearly when, in fact, he had not given the date when the results would be announced? </Newspeech><Newspeech> DR. ONYONKA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I said "maybe", indicating that I was not sure that he was listening. If the hon. Member is offended, I withdraw the remark. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Question is of national import¬ance. I am quite sure that when we raise the' issue about the cost of the exercise" most of hon. Members have had their constituents who worked during the exercise not being paid. I know very well that in 1979 I was a deputy census officer for Nyandarua District and I know what is involved. At that time, the results, were put about six months later. If the 1989 census results are; going to be out two are later, the Minister has not told us the reason for the delay. Even during the 1979 census exercise, we also carried out post census enumeration exercise and I was involved in it. Why is it that the 1989 census results should take two years to be announced? What is so special in this case? </Newspeech><Newspeech> DR. 0NY0NKA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sorry but it appears that my brother, the hon. Member, was not listening to me keenly. I said that the 	results will be announced early next year. </Newspeech><Newspeech> DR. ONYONKA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as time goes on, more elaborate methods are involved in the census exercises. In fact, we have to a attempt to improve on what was done during the previous census because, out of the census, we learn either bad mistakes or the need for improvement as to how the exercise should be undertaken. Definitely, the current census was a much more elaborate exercise and involved changes that were not involved in the previous exercise. However, I would like to assure the House, in respect to the second question alluded to in the hon. Member's comments regarding payments to some people, that  I personally received correspondence from a-few wananchi who, apparently, were not getting responses from their district commissioners who had been given the responsibility of receiving and paying those who rendered services. I would like to assure the House that we are taking the trouble to find out from the areas concerned what precisely transpired, and if we get definite information the necessary action will be taken. </Newspeech><Header> QUESTIONS BY PRIVATE NOTICE </Header > <Header> Payment of 1989 K.C.P.E. and K.C.E. Invigilators  </Header ><Newspeech> MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Education the following Question by Private Notice.When will the invigilators of last year's (1989) K.C.P.E. and K.C.E. in Mwala Constituency be paid their invigilation claims? </Newspeech> 	<Newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri):Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.	Mr. Ministry has paid 745 invigilation claims out of 921for the 1939 Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) Examination	and the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) Examinationto claimants who were involved with, the invigilation duties ofthese examinations in Mwala Constituency and in Machakos District.However,, my Ministry has, through the Kenya National ExaminationsCouncil (KI'TEC), returned to the District Education Officer,..Machakos, a total of 82 KCES and 93 KCSE invigilation claims for futher verification before payment could be effected. These claims could not be processed because:-claims were not certified by the District Education Officer, Machakos, as the claimants sent such claims . directly to the KMEC.names of certain claimants were- not reported by the supervisors of the examination centres and consequently their  names were not included in the certificate ofsupervision.	certain claimants claimed Night Out Allowance although they were not eligible for such claims. </Newspeech><Newspeech> Mr. MANG'OLI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the AssistantMinister says certain people were not eligible for Night OutAllowance why were they not eligible wheel they were invigilators?why is the KNEC behaving like this before the people who worked for it? </Newspeech><Newspeech> Mr. KARAUSI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have giventhe reason why they not eligible for payment; either theirnames did not appear in the certificate of supervision or theysubmitted their claims directly to the  instead of doing so through the District Education Officer Machakos  </Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR.WAMBUA: Mr. Deputy Speairer, Sir, I totally disagreewith the answer given by the Assistant Minister "because the systemfor paying invigilators is straight forward right from the Ministryto the DSD's office and down to the  claimants. These peopleinvigilated the 1989 examinations but have not been paid for a whole year. What is withholding their payments they are already  invigilating this year's examinations without having been paid for the earlier work. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KARAUHI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would advisethe hon. Members to ask the claimants, if he knows them, to convincethe DEO that they, in fact, invigilated the examinations. </Newspeech><Newspeech>  MR. WAMBUA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.It is my duty to convince the DSO. when he appointed these people  to  the examinations he knew for sure that they were to be paid. It is for the Ministry to convince the DSO and not for me to do that. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KARAUHI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, on the partthe Ministry we have asked the DSO to certify the correct claims . and submit them to us for  payment. Now the DSO can certify claims that are not correct. That is why I am saying that if there is anybody who invigilated the examinations and he has not been paid it is up to him to convince the DSO so that he can forward his claim to the have said that names of those who invigilate examinations appear in the certificate of supervision; if their names are not in that certificate I do not see how they can "be paid. </Newspeech><Newspeech> Mr.KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is making a very serious allegation: It is not the duty of a Member of Parliament to go convincing a DSO. Is the Assistant Minister in order in asking an hon. Member to go andconvince a DEO. This House should not be taken lightly the assistant minister say whether people will be paid or not</Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR. KARAURI: Mr. Deputy "Speaker, Sir, I think: sometimes we a problem of communication in this House when hon. Members maynot have Listen properly. I did not tell the hon. Member to goand convince  the DEO: I told the hon. Member if he knows claimantswho have not been paid  we know those who have not been paid arequite a number because their claims were not in order - he shouldconvince them to see the DEO - after they are his constituents. Idid not ask the hon. Member to go and  convince the DEO. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MATE: . Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister agree or disagree with me that very many people all over the country who were involved in this exercise were not paid because there was shortage of funds? We know this.-is the reason because this  national exercise is affected by this problem nationwide. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KARAURI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not aware of that. What. I am aware of is that 2,122 supervised involved in the exercise all over the country were all paid. There were 14,o54 invigilators and where proper claims were submitted they wear all paid.	MR. wAMBUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the conditions to be fulfilled are clearly indicated in the forms and circulars sentto he DEOs and lam the sure the invigilators fulfilled all theconditions. The information being given by the Assistant Ministeris not true. Can he say exactly what delayed these paymentsbecause the claimants are very bitter about the issue?	</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KARAURI:  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have alreadyadvised the  hon. Member that if he knows these people he shouldtell them to go to the DEO and  he will tell them whether theydid not fill the forms properly or that they were is not involved in the exercise.Alleviation of Frequent Water Shortage in Tudor Estate</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Water Development the following Question by Private Notice Iwhat action is the Ministry taking to find a solution to the frequent waters shortage in Tudor Estate, Mombasa? </Newspeech><Newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVSLOPMENT (Mr. Mweu) : Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The flow of water to "Tudor Estate is normal throughout the year except during the dry season when water pressure goes down and the water cannot climb beyond second floor of tall building. This problem will be solved when the second Mzima pipeline is laid Meanwhile, my Ministry has been encouraging high-rise building owners to provide standby taps in the compounds. Thirdly, my Ministry is making efforts to switch on water in the taps around during the night so that residents can draw water at night. We are also making efforts to rehabilitate the Sabaki Water Project so that we can also have water re-directed to these areas and be -able - to cater for this, problem. </Newspeech><Newspeech>  MR.KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while agreeing with the Assistant Minister that water cannot climb h beyond  second floor, even as I am talking now this water cannot climb up to the ground floor of these houses. What can the Assistant Minister do about this? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MWEU: Mr. Deputy Speakers, Sir, I sympathies with the situation. But. as I have said, we are making efforts to be switching water off in the surrounding areas and re-directing water to this area so that residents can draw water during the night. </Newspeech>    <Newspeech> MR. MAUG'OU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we would like to know whether the Ministry was a  aware of this problem before this Question was brought to this House. If they were aware of this problem, why did they not take action? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MWEU: This problem could have been there but the hon. Member should also know that the population is increasing in Mombasa, like elsewhere, and, therefore, the water is sometimes not enough. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MANG'OLI: I asked the Assistant Minister a specific question as to whether the Ministry was aware of this problem before this Question was raised here Can he respond to  that? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MWEU: If the hon. Member was listening properly, I said that water shortages are experienced during the dry season. October is a dry season in Mombasa and that is why there is water shortage there. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KILIKU: Can the Assistant Minister tell this House when the seci Mzima Pipeline will be operational? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MWEU: Sir, discussion on the second Mzima Pipeline are taking place and we are making every effort to get a donor to finance the project In the meantime, feasibility studies and designs are almost complete and the only problem we have is finance but we are making every effort to secure funds. Fox the information of the House, this pipeline is going to cost Kshs.3 billion. </Newspeech>(Some hon. Members stood in their places)<Newspeech> MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: We must move on to the next Question. I willgive a chance to Mr. Kiliku to ask the last question on this matter. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KILIKU: Sir, when the Assistant Minister was replying, he made us to think that the second Mzima Pipeline would be operational very soon, but he has now told us that even feasibility studies are not finalized. Can the Assistant Minister undertake to alleviate this rater shortage, before the second Mzima. Pipeline comes into being? The Ministry is not even sure of getting a donor to finance  this project. COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY(Order for Committee read being seventeeth allotted day  MOTIONTHAT, Mr. Speaker do now leave the Chair Vote 10  Ministry of Agriculture</Newspeech><Newspeech> THE MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Mwangale): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move that Mr. Speaker do now leave the Chair    Agriculture is the mainstay of Kenya's economy and it provides the basisof development for the other sectors. Rapid and sustainable agricultural growth, is essential to Kenya's long-term development. Agriculture accounts for approximately one third of the gross domestic product, provides pro¬ductive employment to majority of Kenyans, supplies all but a small proportion of the nation's food and earns the largest share of foreign exchange.The Ministry of Agriculture is implementing the policies esta¬blished in Sectional Paper no 1 of 1986 on Economic Management for RenewedGrowth. The first and primary objective of  Ministry is to promote self-reliance in food production. Additional priorities of this sector are the generation of raw materials for Kenya's growing industries and earning foreign exchange. These objectives form the development strategy for the Ministry and adds justification for the Ministry's badget request.Before examining the Recurrent and Development Expenditures in detail, I would. like to highlight these three very important objectives a in terms of specific crops and the actions my Ministry is taking to support them.The first objective aid is an self-sufficiency in food production. 'The major crop here is maize. 'The Ministry plans to raise maize yields from 1.9 to  its potential of 4.5 tones per hectare and expand the area under cultivation to 1.8 million hectares. By increasing  yield and area under cultivation, jobs will be added to the 1.1 million people already 	As we attain these ambitious goals, the Ministry will implement the following measures: improved management of maize research; intensificatio of extension services; improved supply of inputs and prompt payment to farmei's Sir., this, will also apply to the other nzi cereals, such as, wheat, we continue to import into the country. According to the agro-ecological zones that.rw? have, we are able to produce all the wheat  required in this country.The Ministry is determined to ensure that the incentives which we are providing to wheat and rice farmers in terms of correct payment.to enable them to produce more, is followed.I would also like to take this opportunity to urge Kenyans to continue growing traditional crops, such as, millet and sorghum. The, Government has provided incentive in this field in the form of attractive prices to farmers to encourage them to grew these traditional crops. This is because it is through the production of sufficient traditional crops that we are able to ward off hunger in case of drought or famine.I would like to appeal to hon. Members that as they address their constituents, they should appeal to them to continue producing traditional crops. Good prices are being  offered to traditional crops - millet and sorghum - which are also resistant to drought and which can be stored, for long periods without being affected by pests.     Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also appeal to farmers to grow root crops like cassava, potatoes, sweet potatoes and yams. we consider these to be our  strategic crops if we have to avoid famine in our country. In addition to that the price of beans is quite attractive. It is important that farmers continue to grow all the varieties of beans that we have in our country They can buy the correct seeds from the Kenya Seed Company Limited and the Kenya Grain Growers Co-operative Union.In the case of sugar, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are now nearly meeting the needs of the country and with further resource self-sufficiency is attainable. The sector employes 21,000 people and expansion will increase this employment substantially. It is estimated that by the end of the decade sugar production could increase by 75 per cent  to 700,000 tonnes. To achieve these ambitious production and employment goals the Ministry will be taking several crucial steps. First of all, the sector is being rationalized and restructured. To this end the Government has taken over and is rehabilitating the Miwani Sugar Company, the Nzoia Sugar Company, Muhoroni Sugar Company. we are also taking action which will  ensure that these companies are properly managed. BY the end of the decade Miwani Sugar Company will be able to produce not less than 70,000 tonnes of refined sugar for industrial use The Government has decided that there will be no longer a need for us to import industrial sugar or refined sugar because this can be produced in sufficient quantities by the Miwani Sugar Factory.  During the same period, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Nzoia Sugar Company will increase its output from  66,000 tonnes today to 190,000 .tonnes per year by the year 2000. The output for South  Nyanza Sugar Company will change from 55,000 tonnes to 100,000 tonnes; Chemelil will raise production from 69,000 tonnes to 80,000 tonnes and Muhoroni Sugar Company will expand. its capacity from 46,000 tonnes to 65,000 tonnes.The second action that my Ministry is taking is to review the sugar-cane prices in order to strengthen the industry as a whole and assist in the reviving of  the Ramisi Sugar Factory down at the Coast Province. These prices have been announced this afternoon and so we will now have new producer prices for the farmers and also for the factories.The third action to be taken is the implementation of two large sugar projects; one in Busia ana the other in Siaya. These new factories will each produce about 100,000 tonnes, of sugar per year. In addition to these activities, the Ministry will continue its efforts in research into high yielding x-varieties in the station of extension services and expansion of inputs use in order to support the sector.The second objective, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, is with regard to  the high-value export crops. Coffee continues to be the mainstay of Kenya's exports as well as providing employment to over 144,000 workers. The Ministry is promoting the expansion of this vital coffee sector by supporting expansion of  Arabica production and introduction of Robusta production in the western and Coast Provinces. It is estimated that coffee production could increa.se by as much as 170 per cent to  350?000 tonnes from the current product of about My Ministry will support this substantial increase through the following asaa measures: By greatly improving extension methods and particularly the production of high-yielding and 	disease-resistant varieties suchthrough the construction of65 new factories and the rehabilitation of the 275 existing factories and by prompt payment of farmer and finally by the provision of credit.with regard to tea,  I would like to say that thissector is vital in meeting both domestic consumption and earningforeign exchange. The sector has great potential and the Ministryhas set an ambitious, target of tripling exports by the  end ofthe decade. The tea industry employs over 164,000 Kenjrans and thetripling of export production will significantly increase thenumber of	jobs in this vital sector. To expand the sector,the Ministry has established several ambitious goals which includethe expansion of the processing capacity of the existing 39 KenyaTea Development Authority factories by an addition 5 millionkilogrammes per year thus bringing the total capacity of the 39 K.T.D*A0 factories to nearly 600 million kilogrammes per year. Thesecond one x will be to expand the area under tea by at least 50 percent by the end of the decade; intensification of extensionservices. The Nyayo Tea Zones will also be expanded by 200 per cent.The K.T.D.A. will construct an additional eight factories to copewith the requirement or demand by the-farmers. The domestic purchasewill  be gradually raised to export parity to improve theincome of the tea producers.Horticulture, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, is a dynamic\ _export sector and the country is currently exporting over 50,000tonnes of fresh and processed horticultural products per year, foreign exchange the out employment of 96,000 workers will be expanded. It is the aim of the Government to expand the area under cultivation and to increase yields so as to maintain the rapid development, of this sector. TheMinistry plans to take the following measures to support the 	sector:The national Seed Quality Control Service will be improved. 	Projects to improve marketing outlets will also be  implementedand cold storage and 22 warehouse facilities will constructed and existing facilities also improved. As to the promotion of crops for the domestic industry cotton is important for it provides farmers  especially in the marginal areas, the much needed cash crop. 2 Cotton is also essential to the development of KENYA's textile industry. Currently production is one-third of domestic needs and the sector is expanding. To assist the production of this vitalcrop, the Ministry is taking several measures which include	the restructuring of the Cotton and Seed Marketing Board;expanding research into high-yielding varieties and  intensification of extension services. The. success in the restructuring of the Cotton Board will allow for purchase of cotton oh an auction basis by 1991.With regard to oil crops, although the country has the potential to grow a wide range of oil crops, two-thirds of Kenya's demand for vegetable oils is met from imports. To reduce the burden of foreign he exchange and to increase employment and production in the sector, the Ministry is taking firm steps to expand productionincluding the implementation of the rural oil output production and fi processing project; intensification of specialized extension service and 2 improvement of marketing channels. To achieve these ambitious and difficult objectives, the Ministry  requires a total gross provision of	of k£65,015.311. On this amount 4-1 per cent to Development Expenditure. The House's approval is sought for 3ziz. Recurrent Gross Expenditure of K£33,233,133 of which 5.4 per cent will be Appropriations in-Aia. Of the net  Recurrent funds 74 per cent are for staff costs and.2a 26 per cent are for operating expenses.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Recurrent Vote of the Ministry is divided into four Sub-Vote. The first one is General Administration  and Planning. This provides funds for running the headquarters services, including the provincial and  district offices. It also covers the recurrent expenditures of the Kenya Sugar Authority, the Central Agricultural Board, and the provincial and district agricultural boards. This Sub-Vote also funds field staff which  the Ministry will continue torationalize in accordance with the District Focus for Rural Development Strategy. To this end we have made a substantial provision in this budget for  district administrative services. Overall, the General Administration and Planning Sub-Vote is allocated 29 per cent of the Recurrent Vote.  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir the other one is the Crop Development sub-vote which funds the Pesticide Control Board and the crop protection services two critical services for the agricultural sector. Hon. Members, may note increase under items such as farm inputs, transport operating cost travelling and accommodation expenses under various the  budget heads, again, this reallocation is a result of	 budget rationalization programme. In total, the crop development sub-vote is allocated o£ the recurrent vote.The land. and farm development sub-vote provides funds for land development, soil and water conservation, agricultural mechanization, irrigation and drainagedevelopment and district farm management services. Thissub-vote is allocated of the recurrent vote.The agricultural education sub-vote is the largestsub-vote of the Ministry and under it we have fund for extension, agriculturaleducation, agricultural information, the training institutes,farmer training centre, and manpower development. theprincipal activity, however, is the extension service whichcontinues to expand in terms of manpower and facilities inorder to meet the growing demand for services in the ruralareas The agricultural education sub-vote is allocated 564 of the recurrent vote	The above. allocations are limited when compared to the great demands placed upon the Ministry. My Ministry  staff recognize the need to manage these resources with the utmost care to promote development. To this end, the Minister has. allocated funds for staff training to improve management. sir approval is for a gross developmentexpenditure of K£26 , 732 , 17300 of which 63 per cent appropriation in aid. May I take this opportunity to thank Kenyamany friends who have contributed, so generously to the developmentof agriculture in this country.This year's development budget is 21 percent than lastyear's. The decrease is due to projects that have come to theend of their implementation period and have been transferredto the recurrent vote. Projects transferred from the development to the recurrent vote include the rural structure unit,the Mbita irrigation project, the  western Kenya irrigationunit and Micro irrigation development project. In addition,donor grants tathe Chemilil Sugar Company and the MumiasSugar Company during this past fiscal year. The decrease inthe development vote is further due to the reduction of theGovernments contribution to various projects as a resultof adjustments in the Ministry budget ceiling.The development vote is divided between contributionsto the Ministry and to the parastatals. While 90 per cent of the funds are directed to the Ministry, 10 per cent of the development vote isearmarked for the parastatals. The Ministry has adoptedseveral steps to streamline and improve the management ofparastatals. As I have emphasized earlier, the Ministry istaking crucial steps to revitalize the sugar and cotton sectorsAs the hon. Members are aware, the Government has acceptedthe report of the Probe Committee on the Kenya Tea DevelopmentAuthority and my Ministry is implementing the recommendationsof the report The horticultural development authority willalso be revitalized. critical element in our long terra strategy to develop land and increase productivity. Overall, this sub vote isallocated 41per cent of the development vote.4. Integrated Agricultural Development: This is the second largest sub vote and funds extension sector which is the principal service of the Ministry, The national extension programme has been renewed for a second phase and improvement in both the substance and management of extension services are expected. Also funded under this sub vote are the critical arid and semiarid lands projects, and the small¬holder coffee improvement project. This sub vote comprises20 per cent of the development budget. 5. Agricultural Education is the fifth subvote and provides for the agricultural training institutes at Kilifi, Bukura and Embu. This year the sub vote provides a revolving fund to assist farmer, training centres. This sub vote is allocated 3 per cent of the development budget.6. The Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC), which is my Ministry’s sixth sub vote is a vital partner to the extension services in promoting agricultural productivity Sessional paper number one of 1986 emphasized the provision of seasonal and long term credit to farmers as well as the need for discipline amongst borrowers. Fortunately, theTreasury has recognized and accepted the importance of this facility and has increased this year’s allocation by 71 per cent. The Government intends to restructure the AFC into an agricultural development bank. In fact, we are restructurethe AFC so that it remains as a separate corporation andthe Agricultural Development Bank is created as a new bank. This sub vote makes takes 7 per cent of the development vote.  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have outlined the components of the Recurrent and Development Votes of the Ministry of Agriculture. It is the policy, of this Government to promote agricultural productivity and output through the following actions: Provision of improved inputs, effective technical support through appropriate research remunerative price for crops, and adequate credit. These actions are designed to inspire and reqard oru farmers to produce more so that our nation has a surplus for export. Only" with the cooperation of all Kenyans, and especially the hon. Members, of the House, can this objective be achieved.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are particularly grateful to our President for the continued support that he has given to the Kenyan farmers especially as number one farmer himself and also in the support by visiting farmers and by also attending the agricultural shows he does every year.Finally, I would now like to appeal to the House to approve an amount of K£38,268,138 to meet the recurrent expenditure and an amount of K£26,732,173 to meet the development expenditure of my Ministry during the financial year 199091.Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker.<Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROAD¬CASTING (Mr. Nassir): Bw.

Naibu Spika, naunga mkono.</Newspeech> (Question proposed)<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me a chance to support this Motion, which has been very, ably moved by the Minister for Agriculture. Agriculture is, sub vote	of course, the mainstay of our economy and we must do everything possible tomaximise its use. To do this, the Ministry should do something about extension officers in rural areas, including divisions and locations. These people should be seen to work, going to peoples farms and demonstrating what people should. They should advise farmers on what kind of chemicals to apply to the soil and how to space or prune their crops for maximum production. In most areas, extension officers are not seen in the same light as they used to be seen a long ago. In those days, they used to be seen going to peoples farms to tell them what to do. Today, however, these officers  I am not accusing them unfairly — will be seen doing their own jobs and at the end of the month they get salaries from the Ministry of Agriculture. So, the Ministry should devise a method of checking on these officers to ensure that we maximise the productivity of the crops that we grow.Today, tea fetches a very high price in the market, but the unfortunate thing is that there are not enough factories for our tea. In 1984, farmers in my constituency, Tigania, stopped picking tea because they saw no Company;	 to be paid very little eventually. The people of Igembe, on the other side of Nyambene, where Kegoi Tea Factory has been constructed by the Kenya Tea Development Authority, have always had a better price for their teaMr. Deputy Speaker left the Chair The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mureithi) took the Chair My people stopped picking tea in 1984 when I was on a journey to South Korea and said that they would not do anything until I came back. When I came back, I talked to them. Later, I visited the Ministry of Agriculture and persuaded the then Permanent Secretary to go to Tigania and talk to the farmers there so that they could continue to pick tea. The Permanent Secretary assured these farmers that they were going to have a factory constructed in Tigania with effect from October, 1985. Up to this day, six years later, this construction has not been started and a lot of tea is being wasted.My people are big tea farmers and they produce quality tea. If the Minister goes there, he will see this for himself. Unfortunately, they have no tea factory and the roads leading to Kegoi Tea Factory are impassable. The rains have just started falling, and last week saw a lot of rain in Meru in general. The roads in my constituency are now impassable, and it is very difficult to take tea to the factory. Some of this tea is finally poured down on the road because after two days, it is not fit to be taken to the factory. Now that "tea prices are very high, why can we not get loans? I do not know whether we seek loans only from one source or not, but I know that farmers are capable of repaying any loan that is utilised in constructing a tea factory. I am only reminding the Minister and the Permanent Secretary that my people are still waiting for the fulfillment of the promise given by the Permanent Secretary in 1984 that the people of Tigania would have a tea factory constructed with effect from October, 1985. When my people heir that the Ministry is going to build, say, four factories in Muranga, four in another place, and so on, we do not understand why we have been completely forgotten. I hope the Minister is going to assist regard.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other thing that I would like to say is that we are very grateful to His Excellency the President for his foresight in a lot of things. In the case of the Ministry of Agriculture, we thank him for Nyayo Tea Zones, which have become a source of employment for our people and a money—earner for the Government, but I must say that we need additional tea factories in these Zones. If we expand tea cultivation to such an extent that a specific area requires its own tea factory and we do not provide this factory, all our efforts go to waste.I myself am a coffee farmer and one thing that assisted me to come to Parliament is the fact that I used to complain about the way farmers were being swindled of their coffee and otherwise mistreated. Many people got to know me that way when I was still in school. My father was a coffee farmer and I got educated through money from coffee. Today, unfortunately, coffee prices have gone down. It is not the Government that pays coffee farmers, and nobody should blame the Government in this regard. However in order for the Ministry of Agriculture to encourage farmers to grow more coffee which earns us a lot of foreign exchange, when people are caught committing crimes against coffee farmers, they should be punished. I say this because it is common knowledge this appeared in newspapers that it has been alleged that coffee has disappeared in the Coffee Board of Kenya. It has always been spelt out as to how much money was involved in the coffee that was lost. Coffee farmers always wait to see somebody being taken to court so as to be sure that their money is not getting lost, and this should be done. The Minister should be courageous, fearless and ruthless in dealing with people who are likely to break farmers backs for nothing. Farmers want to be sure that if the price is only five cents per kilogramme of coffee, they are being paid the correct price. If somebody steals one cent that is due to farmers, he should be punished appropriately. If what has been said in the past is a mere allegation, the Ministry should come out and say so, but it is not an allegation, somebody should be punished he has committed.There should be no politics in agriculture, and I would like the Minister to do everything possible to ensure that this position stays. It is unfortunate that the Kenya Planters Co—operative Union, for instance, is both a cooperative society and a company at the same time. The crop that is managed by this society comes under agriculture.The Minister for Agriculture has a responsibility to save farmers from any sort of exploitation. The Ministry of Co—operative Development should also play its role properly. I do not know whether we are going to discuss the Ministry of Co—operative; Development, but I am saying this because it is very difficult to draw the distinguishing line when it comes to the question of the Kenya Planters Cooperative Union (KPCU). At any rate, KPCU is handling a very important crop in agriculture, and I am saying that there should be no politics in this area. The Minister for Agriculture, in conjunction with the Minister for Cooperative Development, should ensure that politics does not enter this area. Instead of encouraging farmers by giving them loans to improve their coffee, some people are busy bringing politics into this very vital organisation called KPCU. We would like to see a time when there are no politics at all in this organisation and when the crop is handled properly and, therefore, farmers getting what is due to them.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in my opinion, the Government should advise and supervise all the operations of KPCU.		... With those few remarks, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MATE: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to also make my remarks on the Vote of this very important Ministry.Sir, all of us will always mention the importance of agriculture because it is the main economic contributor to our nation. It also plays a very important part in feeding every individual in the Republic. Everybody here had a meal today, and that indicates the importance of the Ministry of Agriculture. Without enough food to feed the: nation there would be a lot of trouble. In fact, all the struggle and problems we have in the world revolve around the stomach. When stomachs are empty there must be a problem. If people go without food you can expect all thetrouble. So, that indicates the importance of this Ministry; we all depend quite heavily on it If, therefore, it does not perform well, then you can be sure that there will not be peace, happiness or a united nation; there would be fight¬ing and every sort of chaos. So, this is to underscore the importance of this Ministry apart from giving us foreign exchange.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in view of what I have just said, we would be very grateful if all the officer working in this Ministry and the Minister himself could explore the possibilities of research to even produce more in the particular fields which have not been researched on. If they can do more research, then we can be sure of producing more to feed our nation and also for export. So, research in agriculture is very important. In fact, I hope that the Ministry has its own department of research. If it is not there, then I wish to appeal to the Minister, who is just sitting in front of me, to look at the branch of research with the view to producing more and better quality crops.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are dismayed to hear that these days our coffee is fetching very dismal payments. I wish to appeal to the Minister, and the Government to explore the possibility of getting other markets elsewhere where our coffee can fetch slightly better money. At the moment farmers do not even know what to do with the coffee payments they get. In fact, the most miserable person today in Kenya is the coffee farmer because he cannot educate his children with the money he is given. Farmers use coffee money to buy food, meaning that these days they have empty stomachs. So, I wish to appeal to the Government, through the" Ministry, to explore the possibilities of other markets. Let us go to the South Pole or the North Pole where it is cold and where we may get better payments for our coffee, the money we are getting now is discouraging coffee; farmers and they do not even know what to do with it.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, irrigation in Siakago Constituency may play a very important part because that constituency is in a marginal area. Wehave ,enough water from the surrounding rivers and .also from the dams which have been created by the Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority. These dams which surround my constituency can be used for irrigation purposes. In fact, one of the proposals in the initial feasibility studies done during the construction of these dams, people were promised that apart from using the water for power generat¬ion the water would be availed to them for irrigation and for fishing. I have not seen the Ministry coming up strongly to utilise that water for those purposes. I am sure that the Permanent Secretary and his staff know the area very well; the land is there, personnel is there and expertise is there, and I think the money we are going to give the Minister will be used in this area. Otherwise, if he does not do that we can refuse to pass the money. So, he should also make sure that the water in those five dams is used for irrigation purposes around Siakago Constituency.Again, in my constituency we have a company known as BAT Ltd. or British American Tobacco Ltd. operating there. This company has been enjoying a kind of monopoly in the Republic, and I have a feeling that it blackmails the Govern¬ment in forcing farmers to use firewood for curing tobacco. This is a very bad exercise and we have raised in the district agricultural boar meetings and in the provincial agricultural board and pointed out that we do not have enough trees to provide firewood for curing tobacco. We are trying to plant more trees and every season we cut very many trees down to cure tobacco. This is illogical and blackmail to the Government, and it should be looked into very seriously. The company should be persuaded to use solar energy for curing tobacco. They can even be told to use electricity because we do not have any more trees left to provide firewood for curing tobacco. Let us explore other possibilities of curing tobacco.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this company, which has been enjoying monopoly in very many areas, has an idea of trying to zone markets in the Republic just because they are afraid of a local company which is still on the	ground or in its initial stages. Tobacco farmers in my constituency have told me and I have to say this in the ears of the Minister that they do not want a zoning of the area or monopoly. If the whole world is moving towards a free market today, why should BAT come up with an idea that they zone their own market and nobody else should enter those zones? Let us have a free market where all farmers can benefit, whether it is a mastermind or a devil mind. I am saying what I have been told in very strong terms by my farmers, that they do not want the zoning of market. Whether mastermind, devil mind or whatever, the BAT can compete for the benefit of the farmer.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, cost of inputs forcrops like maize and beans is so high that a farmer PROduces		a "bag at a loss. I would thus like to apply to the Minister to 	look into the prices of these crops because they are very important;some farmers would like to grow them on a large scale out the cost of inputs does not allow them to grow them profitably. An hon. friend of mine from the House was telling me that it is more profitable to buy these crops from other people than to grow them.I heard the Minister talk about sugar production in this county and I am sure there is a lot of room for improvement and expansion of sugar production in this country. Earlier this year when we had sugar shortage we wondering why this happened when we have such a high potential for sugar production. I am sure we can produce much more sugar than we are doing now and so the question of importing sugar should not arise. Therefore, I would ask the Minister to go further into research sugar production the Minister is my witness that we can do much better in sugar production.	with those few remarks I beg to support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COOPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Wjore): Ahsante sana, Bw.

This isa very important which is responsible for feeding Kenyans. First of all,I would like to congratulate the President for being the pillar of agriculture in Kenya. For example, he has planted alee in his farm he keeps cattle ana produces horticultural crops. The President sends a lot of milk to K.C.C. and that is why I have the guts to say he is a pillar of the Ministry of Agriculture and farmers in general. Production from his farm is quite substantial. For example, he produces about 70 bags of maise per acre when the other farmers harvest about 50 to 20 bags per acre. The President is also the patron of the Agricultural Society of Kenya. He has demontrated how food should be produced in this country.We have agricultural institutions which produce the maize in Africa. We also have the best maize seed compared to other countries, We should emulate the President as far farming is concerned. The Ministry of Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy of this country. Without food we a shall have chaos in this country.We have political problems bat as soon the stomach is full, politics end. I would like to support what was said by one hen. Member from Meru that politics should not be extended to the agricultural sector. Once the Coffee Board of Kenya and the Kenya Planters Co-operative Union are brought into politics, then there is a problem.I would like to congratulate the Minister for telling us what he intends to do with the funds he is requesting. I would like to talk about horticultural produce Which, with proper management, can earn this country over Kshs.2.2 billion in foreign exchange. The Minister should take serious interest in this industry because it is bound to 22; earn this country up to Kshs.9 billion in foreign exchange if irrigation is practiced. If farmers can be financed to grow chilli, beans and so on which have a ready market in Europe, we shall also earn a substantial amount of money in foreign exchange.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the farmers need sore money to enable the to expand horticultural production in this country. This will enable this country to earn about KShs.9 billion in foreign exchange which is a lot of money. But you will find the horticultural sector is dominated by Asians and Europeans„ What about us the indigenous people? Where are we? we need licences to enable us to export horticultural produce to overseas markets. I would like the Minister to take note of what I am going to say. Parsers in rural areas must be assisted to produce chillies. This is the only horticultural crop which is not expensive to produce. This produce is in great demand in the whole of Europe. The farmers must plant the crop as it is as the first crop. Chillies are vary expensive; a 3kilogramme carton costs KShs.75.00. That is a lot of money. I do not know what we are going to do. I therefore-, urge the Minister to look into this matter. The Indians have got their own way of doing things. They acquired wealth during the colonial days; they acquired money when we got our Independence and they continue to acquire more end more wealth. What are we going to do? Ye are getting poorer and poorer indeed.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, with regard to irrigation, the British Government should have realised by now that during the two World Wars; from 1914 to 1913 and from 1939 to 1945 I served as a soldier during the Second world War. They ought to know that people from Nandi District. Machakos District and Kitui District	AN HON. MEMBER: Even people from MaratinalTHIS LINE NOT READABLE4</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND HOUSING (Mr. Bonett) : Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. for giving me an opportunity to contribute on this very important Vote. This Vote needs the total support of the House.I would, like to say that the Kenya farmers have done a commendable job. Indeed our farmers have intensified crop production in this' country. This has been as a result of the co-operation between farmers and Government officers in the field. Having said that, I would like to touch on the production of wheat, maize, beans which are very essential to this nation. Production of maize and wheat is a very, very crucial operation.' The farmers of Kenya have shown in practical terms that they are able to do the job and do it properly in spite of difficulties such as the rising costs of production. In fact the prices of fuel have gone up. Also the prices of fertilisers and other inputs have also gone up. I listened to the Minister with a lot of interest - hoping that he would mention something about the Sax Guaranteed Minimum Returns - G.M.R. But he said nothing about this scheme and I feel very depressed as a farmer. I am a farmer and I produce wheat and my constituency of Rongai produces a lot of wheat and maize. Farmers in my constituency have done a very commendable job. Although the Agricultural Finance Corporation gives seasonal credit to the farmer Sometimes the farmers are unable to repay the loans because of factors beyond their control.Here I am talking about poor weather and other natural calamities, fact the production of good is the responsibility of the farmer the Government. It is like getting a child; a man and a woman must come together. Therefore the Government and the farmer have a responsibility to feed the nation. It is terribly important that the Minister tells us what he is going to do about the G.M.R.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the G.M.H. was withdrawn on very flimsy grounds; that the farmers were making false claims. Only a few farmers made false claims. The majority of the farmers were making genuine claims. Therefore I appeal to the Minister to assist the farmers who are very loyal and ready to assist the Government. The farmers should be rewarded; not punished. I think the G.M.R. scheme is more important than the Bank they are proposing to establish. I would like to say that the A.P.C. has done a good job but we need the G.M.R. scheme. let me now turn to milk production. Dairy farmers have also done a good job. A lot of milk is produced in the Rift Valley during the months of March, April, May, June, July, August and September.' That is the period when the Rift Valley receives a lot of rain. During this particular period the Kenya Co-operative Creameries finds itself with more milk than it can a handle. As a result of this they return a let of milk to the farmers saying it is bad. The milk buying centres in Thomson Falls, Makuru, Nyahuru  Eldoret and so on are not enough. The evening milk should be preserved, with modem technology we should be able to preserve milk. Other people are going to the moon and we in Kenya are failing to preserve milk for even one night.' Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think it is now time that we established milk centres in- every constituency that produces milk. For example, in my constituency, we should have a silk centre at Kambi ya Moto, at Mbogoini, at Kirombon and in various other places. Vie want to have a cooling system in each one of these centres so that farmers can bring their evening milk' which would be kept fresh for even two days before being taken for processing in the factories. This is a very important point and I think some of this money that we are going to vote for this Ministry should be used for this purpose. This would be money well spent. We can even go further and produce powder milk which we would export to countries like the Saudi Arabia end so on. We have enough technology to be able to do this and we should therefore consider this point seriously. Together with the powder milk, we would also he able to produce butter and cheese which is in high demand in countries like the Saudi Arabia. Therefore, we need to plan ahead since we have the brains to do so. It was only last week when His Excellency the President said that we have 1,000 veterinary officers who have actually been trained in our universities and who have no jobs today. These people could be employed so that they can assist the dairy farmers to produce more milk. 	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in this country we have a lot of seasonal fruits. For example, we have a lot of red plums, especially in Kikuyu, and uplands, but ufortunately, there does not seem to be a proper market for these fruits. Occasion ally, you find young men going round trying to sell these fruits along the roads from here to Nakuru. These people are doing their best cut they are caught up by problems. Why should something like this be allowed to happen. These people should be assisted by the Ministry to get proper market for these very nice fruits. We have technology to be able to preserve these fruits when there are plenty of them around. The same case applies to mangoes. At the moment we have a lot of mangces in Tana River District but unfortunately, they are rotting due to lack of market. I therefore, would like to challenge the Permanent Secretary and his group, who are well education.to look for a solution to this problem. The hon. Minister hon. Mwangale is a resourceful and strong nan</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: And healthy tool</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND HOUSING (Mr. Bonett): Yes, and healthy too. I am looking forward to having a solution on these problems and I am sure the hon. Minister hast taken note of this.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, similarly, we are producing a lot of English potatoes at certain times. These potatoes are in high demand overseas. In fact all the eastern European countries need a lot of potatoes and  we happen to be nearer than America and South America where these potatoes are grown and exported to these countries and therefore, we are in a really strategic position. Now that South Africa may start behaving itself very soon, I think it is tight time for us to start planning quickly since we are going to have a lot of people to feed and to employ, we have a lot of students coming from our universities and unless we plan on time, we are really going to be caught up unawares. This particular Ministry has the responsibility of seeing that we are able to employ more and more of our people who leave schools today. Finally, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, I would like to call upon the Kenyan youth who are educated to know that the soil is the answer to their employment problem with those few remarks, I beg to support.THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Masinde): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to debate on this very important Motion. Before I continue, I would like to beg to be excused, that be it late as it may be, this being my first time to contribute,I would like to thank His Excellency the President for appointing me the Minister for Labour. This is a great honour to me and to the constituents of Nambale and the people of 3usia District as a whole. May I also take this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency the President for having attained 35 years as a Member of this House	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, while supporting this Motion, I would like to thank the Minister for Agriculture for the way in which he has continued to handle the affairs of this Ministry up to date. I thank him particularly for. the way in which he has outlined a number of issues when he was moving his Vote today. It appears that a lot of people are putting emphasis on the growth of wheat, coffee, tea, maize and so on. However, there are other crops that would be of great importance to this country and it is unfortunate that nobody seems to be talking about them.I am grateful to note that the Minister has talked about the plans he has regarding the marketing of cotton. Busia as a district and Nambale as a constituency, grows a lot of cotton and we do not need irrigation to do this. However, the amount of cotton production has gone down due to poor marketing and I am happy to hear from the Minister that something is going to be done about the marketing aspect of it. Just very recently, there was an increase in the price of cotton from Shs.6/- per kilogramme to Shs.10/- per kilogramme and we are very grateful for this.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, recently, we read in the press about the amount of money that is being spent in the importation of cooking oil and so on. we have a lot of crops that the Ministry of Agriculture should pay a lot of attention to, particularly, within Busia District. We have for example, as I have already indicated, cotton growing in Busia. As we all knows cotton seed is ideal for the production of oil. we also grow groundnuts, simsims. sunflower and erven rice and all these crops produce some amount of oil. unfortunately, the marketing of these produce is not well organized and consequently, farmers are highly discouraged from growing them. Therefore, I would appeal to the Ministry to make arrangements to establish small cottage industries so. that farmers are able to have their seeds processed for oil. In this way, we shall be able to save a lot of our foreign exchange which is now "being used for the imporation of oil and other oil-related products.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, farmers also get handicapped in preparing their land for planting. About a year or so ago, His Excellency the President gave Busia District about 15 tractors on top of others that existed. At the moment, there are hardly three tractors that are in working-order in the district and I would like to challenge the Minister to deny this. This means that nothing has "been done to prepare the land for planting and therefore, I would like to urge the Minister to look into this very seriously. At the moment, we have some sort of grave yard for these tractors at Bumala Mechanised Agricultural Centre. I have visited this place myself and every time I have done so, I have found that of the tractors that were supposed to have come to the district, hardly three were working, and the people who would like to use them keep on waiting in a line. Something should be done about this matter or help wananchi to buy oxen and supply them with ploughs so that they may be able to plant in time and come up with a good harvest.  To be able to keep livestock, we need dips and medicine to kill ticks. I hope this matter willalso be looked into. I want to thank His Excellency the President and the Ministry for establishing a sugar factory in Nambale. Surprisingly, we are still importing sugar when we are able to produce a so much sugarcane that we can even export sugar. Let me urge the Minister to speed up the erection of this sugar factory in Nambale so that farmers may continue to produce sugarcane in order to save our much-required foreign exchange.    I also want to take this opportunity to join my coleagues in condemning the poor activities of Mr. Wamwere who, with his henchmen, has been trying to destabilise the country where wananci are peacefully and happily going about their business. I categorically condmn these people. I also want to support the Government for closing the Norwegian Embassy in Nairobi. we can well do without Norway's money, and other wealth poor as it may think we are. We are actually not poor. We are very resourceful, and we can survive on our own without that country's aid.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I appeal to the Ministry of Agriculture to help its staff in the field. I am sure these officers are willing to work, but very often, they have no means of transport nor enough money. If these people are going to advise farmers in the field, we must make them mobile by providing them with transport. If they get to the places they are supposed to visit in time, they can advise farmers on how to avoid certain diseases, but if they do not get there in time, they will find crops damaged.Since marketing is a problem, I appeal to the Ministry, in conjunction with the Ministry of Transport and Communications, and others, to help farmers to market whatever they have harvested so that it does not get spoiled due to poor transport or lack of market lack of market contributes to decreased production.I congratulate the Minister who recently assured the nation that we have enough food to feed us for years. However, I still urge him to encourage the people who produce this food to get better prices, readily available fertiliser and transport.With these few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. J.N. MUNGAI: Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika, kwa kunipa nafasi hii ili nami pia nijiunge na waheshimiwa Wabunge wenzangu katika Hoja hii ambapo Waziri wa Kilimo araeliomba Bunge kumpa kiasi hiki cha pesa ili aweze kuendesha Wizara yake bila shida yo yote. Ninaishukuru.sana Wizara hii kwa kazi nyingi inayofanya. Imejaribu sana kuona kwamba taifa letu lina chakula cha kutosha. Kama inavyojulikana, idadi ya watu wetu inaongezeka sana, na ni wajibu wa Wizara hii kuhakikisha kwamba watu wetu wana chakula cha kutosha sasa hivi na wakati ujao. Ninasema hivi kwa sababu katika mawakilisho yangu, sehemu za Njoro, Elburgon, Molo na Nakuru zina watu wengi sana na idadi yao inaongezeka kasi. Ukitembea barabarani za miji hii, unashindwa kujua kama kuna mikutano au la kwa sababu barabara hizi huwa zimejaa watu. Waziri anafaa kutembea katika miji hii, hasa sikxi za soko, na kuona kama wananchi wake wanapata mahitaji yao.Wakati fulani uliopita, vyakula vibichi, yaani perishable foodstuffs, vilikuwa vikipatikana kwa urahisi masokoni mwetu kwa bei ya chini sana, lakini wakati huu, vyakula hivi havipatikani kwa bei ya chini. Ni kwa nini mambo yamebadilika hivi? Ni kwa sababu ya ongezeko la idadi ya watu wetu. Inajulikana kwamba Wizara ya Mazingira na Maliasili ina vituo hasa kule kwenye mvua nyingi. Watu waliokuwa wakiishi katika sehemu hizi walikuwa wakikuza viazi, mboga namashambani, vyakula hivi viliacha kukuzwa kva sababu hawakuendelea kuvikuza aina hizi za vyakula kule walikokwenda. Tungeomba Wizara ifahamu kwamba vyakula vibichi vimepanda bei na kutafufca suluhisho.Wakati umewadia ambapo maofisa walio kule nje wanafaa kuyatembelea mashamba yanayopata mvua ya kutosha na kuwashauri wakulima huko ili, badala ya Vcukuza mahindi ambayo yanachukua muda va miezi 12 kuwa tayari kuvunwa, wapande mboga, viazi, karoti'na mimea mingine ya aina hii kwa sababu tuna soko yake Pia, wanakihitaji na watakinunua wakati wot'ote kikiwa tayari Hatua karaa hiyo ikiwa haitachukuliwa, muda si muda utakuja kuona tukikosa chakula cha aina hii. Kwa hivyo, wakati umewadia maofisa wa Wizara hii wawafundishe wananchi walio na mashamba njia ya kuyalima ili chakula cha aina hii kisije kikapungua katika .	inasoko yetu. Hiki ni chakula kinachohitajika katika miji yetu, na wajibu wa Wizara ya Kilimo kuhakikisha kwamba wakulima wanafundishwa jinsi ya kukikuza katika mashamba yao. Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, nataka kusema kwamba kuna watu wengine ambao wana mashamba makubwa sana ambayc hayalimwi jinsi inavyohitajika. Utaona, kwa mfano, mkulima ame'fuga ng!ombe tu na hajui ni faida gani anapata kutokana na raaziwa yanayotolewa na ng'ombe hao. Mtu karna huyo hawe'zi kupanda chakula kama vile viazi na mboga ili chakula cha aina hiyo kisije kikakosekana katika masoko  yetu. Ninaiomba Wizara ihakikishe kwamba maofisa wake wamewapatia wakulima mawaidha yanayoandamana na sehemu anayolima.Nikigusia kidogo kuhusu mmea wa pareto, nataka kuichukua nafasi hii kuishukuru Halmashauri ya Pareto nchini kupitia kwa Wizara, kwa sababu ya kazi nzuri wanayofanya. Naishukuru halmashauri hii kwa sababu wakati waliokuwa wakishindwa kuwalipa wakulima sasa umekuwa historia. Kwa wakati huu, hata ingawa bei ya pareto iko juu sana, wakulima wanalipwa vizuri. Tunawaomba waendelee hivyo hivyo na kuwapatia wakulima nguvu ndiposa kazi yao pia iendele'e vizuri.Nikizungumza juu ya pareto bado, tumeambiwa kwamba pareto ina bei ya juu sana. Wakulima wameombwa wakulima mmea huu kwa wingi kwa sababu kiasi wanacho toa kwa sasa hakitoshelezi mahitaji ya zao hilo katika masoko. Katika mae'neo yangu ya Molo na Mau Narok, mimi hutembea na kuona wakulima wanafanya nini. Nataka kumhakikishia Waziri kwamba wakulima wengi wa preto hawajui maana ya kuweka mblea katika mashamba yao. Wanaenda tu na kupanda pareto na kwa sababu hali ya anga katika sehemu hizo inafaa kilimo cha mmea huo, pareto inakua tu. Hata ingawa mmea wenye'we unakua vizuri, wakulima hawapati mapate ya kutosha Ninge'penda kumworaba Waziri wa Kilimo azungumze na Almsshauri ya Pareto nchini ili wananchi wapatiwe raawaidha kwamba yafaa kutumia- mbolea hata wakati wa kupanda mmea huo na pia baada ya kuvuna. Kwa njia hiyo, itakuwa rahisi sana kupata pareto ya kutosha yehye sumu nyingi na kuweza kutosheleza mahitaji ya soko.Nikishasema hivyo, ningetaka sasa kugusia kidogo kuhusu kilimo cha ngano. Katika sehemu ya Molo na Nakuru kwa jumla, kilimo cha ngano kimeendelea vizuri sana. Lakini shida ambayo hutukumba kila mwaka ni kwamba wakulima hukosa wavunaji. Utaona kwamba kwa wakati huu mvua imeanza kunyesha upande wa Makuru na ni rahisi sana wakulima kupoteza ngano yao kwa sababu ya kukosa mashine za kuivuna. Kwa hivyo, namwomba Waziri afikirie kuwa na mashine za kuvuna ngano katika kila sehemu inayokuzwa mmea huo chini ya ofisa wa kilimo wilayani. Kwa hayo machache, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, naunga mkono.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipatia nafasi hii ili nami pia niungane na wenzangu katika kuiunga mkono Hoja hii. Nataka kwanza kumpongeza Waziri na Wizara yote kwa jumla kwa vile wanavyokabiliana na kazi gujnu walio nayo. Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ili kumhimiza mkulima apande' chakula kwa wingi, tunahitaji vitu viwili. Kitu cha kwanza na kumtafutia soko na cha Dili ni kumpatia pesa. Kwa mfano, wakati huu wananchi wanaogopa kulima kwa sababu mikopo ya Guaranteed Minimum Returns iliondolewa. Ninaposema hivi ninaunga mkono maoni yaliyotolewa na mhe. Bomett. Wakulima wanaogopa kulima kwa wingi kwa sababu mvua ikikosa hawataweza kulipa mikopo ya Agricultural Finance Corporation. Kwa hivyo, wakulima wanapanda chakula ambacho kinawatosheleza wenyewe.Bw. Naibu Spika, nataka kumfahamisha Waziri kwamba bei ya mahindi yanayo- pandwa hapa nchini irnekuwa ya juu sana hivi kwamba wananchi hawaifikii. Ni kwa nini bei ya.mahindi imeenda juu namna hii na yanapandwa hapa nchini Kenya? Pia, wananchi hawawezi kununua mbegu za ngano kwa sababu bei yake ni ya juu sana. Hata mbolea na kemikali nyingine ambazo zinahitajika katika kilimo hazinunulikiutaona ni hasara tupu. Hiyo ndiyo sababu ninamwambia Waziri ajaribu kutafuta mahali arabapo tunaweza kupata mbolea ya bei ya chini. Tunataka pia mbegu za ngano na mahindi ziwe za bei ya chini ili wakulima waweze kununua kwa rahisi. Pia, tungetaka mikopo ya Guaranteed Minimum Returns ilirudishwe. Hali ikiwa hivyo, wakulima watatoa mazao kwa wingi sana hnta tutakosa mahali pa kuyauza. Wakati mwengine tunafanya makosa ya kuwaambia wakulima wakuze chakula kwa wingi na waki fanya hivyo wanakosa masoko. Kwa vile sina njia nyingine ya kusafirisha mahindi yangu na nina haja na pesa riitalazimika kuyauza kiva ile bei ya chini ajubayo mnunuzi yuko tayari kulipa. Wizara ingekuwa ikinunua mazao ya wakulima. ili wakulima wafurahie bei nzuri.Bw. Naibu wa Muda, naxikiri Wizara pia ingetafuta n.jia ya kuuza mihogo nje ya nchi hii. Niliteinbelsa chama kimoja cha ushirika huko Ujerumani Magharibi na kaona kuwa kinanunua mihogo kutokej; "k.va hivyo, Wizara inawsza kawahimiza wakulima kokuza mihogo mingi na ikauza n.je na kuipatia nchi yetu pesa nyingi za kigeni.Vile vile tukipanda mboga na kuuza nje kwa wingi tutanata ties a nyingi za kigeni. Tunafurahi kwaraba bei ya pareto nayo imeanza kupanda. Kule Bonde la Serio tuna mashamba makubwa ambanio tunaweza kukuza pamba. wisara ingetusaidia kupata huduma sa trekta, au tractor hire services, ili tupande pamba kwa wingi na koiwezesha nchi yetu katotumia pesa zetu za kigeni kununua pamba kutoka nje. Hat a makonge pia tunaweza kukuza kwa wingi huko Xerio Valley.Kuna tatizo katika hudusaa zinazotolewa na maofisa wa nyanjani ambalo ningetaka Wizara itatue. Tuliamoiwa wakulima ± 600 walifaidika katona na demonstration exercises katika Wilaya ya Blgeyo Llarakwet, na tulipouliza mahali demonstration ilifanywa tulionysshwa majina ya watu ambao hatuwajui. lakini sisi. kama watu eneo'hili, tunajua maoxisa wa wisara walitumia pesa za aradi him, wakakodi3ha mashamba na kukusa chakula ambacho kiliwafaidi wao wenyewe; hakuna mtu katika wilaya yetu ambaye alifaidika kutokana na Shs. 560,000/- ambazo zilitolswa kwa mpango huu. Jam bo hili lilixanyika kwa sababu wizara haiwachungi maofisa wa nyanjani.Vile vile pesa sa mpango wa unyunyusiajj. maji katika wilaya yetu hazikufanya chochote. Turiataka Wizara ihakikiehe kuwa kazi inafanyika bada.la ya kutca pesa na kungojea kuambiwa mipango ya kilimo imetekelezwa na hali hakuna kitu ambacho kimefanyika. Parmers Training Centre, Kimororo, ilitumiwa na maofisa wa Wizara kwa kukuza ngano yao na kuiusa, na hali hiki ni kituo cha kilimo cha Serikali. Tunapoiambia kilichofanyika inasema tu i inafanya uchunguzi na mwishowe hatupati matokeo ya uchunguzi wake.Kwa hayo machache, naunga mkono.MR. A.K. KINTANJUI: Ahsante sana, Ew. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipatia nafasi niongee machache juu ya Voti hii ya Wizara ya Kilimo. Ni kweli kuna haja ya kufikiria juu ya mimea iliyo muhimu. Tunajua kwamba chai na kahawa vinatuletea pesa nyingi sa kigeni.Pia ni kweli kwamba tuna nafasi kubwa ya kufaidika kutokana na maboga ambayo hatuitumii. Utaona kwamba uuzaji mboga ng'ambo wakati huu unafanywa na Wahindi. Kwa hivyo, tunaiomba Wisara kuona kwamba wakenya wanaingia katika biashara hii ya mboga. Wi kweli tuna shirikala Horticultural Crop Development Authority lakini shirika hili hali jaiiingilia kabisa biashara hii ya mboga.Tunaweza kawa na maofisa wa kashughulikia biashara hii katika balozi zetu na hapa hapa r.chini tui eke biashara hii mikononi mwa wananchi. Hii ni k^a sababu wageni walio katika biashara hii wanatudanganya: V/anailetea Banki Kuu ya Kenya invoice ikionyesha bei ya Shs.10/- na pengine huko waliusa kwa bei ya Shs.25/-; hatuwezi kulikabali jambo hili kwa sababu sisi tunahitaji pesa kama wengine.Utaona kwamba katoka limuru hadi Nakuru kuna matunda mengi sana; tunaweza kuyahifadhi na kuwauzia njirani amoao wana haja nayc sana.All we need to is to put them together in cold storage and they will last for ever. Kuna haja kubwa hapa. We should not only look at coffee and tea. We should go into that field as well.Ingefaa Wizara ya Maji na Wizara ya Kilimo zishirikiane na kuona kwamba maji ya mvua yanakusanywa na kuhifadhiwa kwa matumizi ya baadaye. Maji hay a yatatumiwa kunyunyizia mashamba maji ili tupate chakula cha kutosha Why should so much land lie idle.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: On a point of order, Sir. The hon.

Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwamba hatukubaliwi kncfcn kutumia lugha mbili kwa wakati mmoja lakini kuna pahali amoapo unaweza kutumia neno moja hapa na pale.Uampongesa Waziri kwa kusema kwamba ataongesa viwanda vya chai. Sei ya majani chai sasa imepandishwa na ingefaa sao hili Iote lipelekwe viwandani ili tuweze kujipatia pesa sa kigeni. Chai nyingi inaharibika kwa sababu ya ukosefu wa viwanda vya kutosha. Shida tulio nayo ni kwamba tea roads zimeharibika na chai ha we si kusafirishwa hadi viwandani. Kwa wakati huu, tunategemea chai kujipatia pesa sa kigeni ir.gawa sasa utalii nao uko katika mstali wa moele kwa mapato haya.Kitu kingihe ni kwamba ni lazima tuwe na usimamizi mzuri katika Almashauri ya Chai ya Kenya (K.T.D.A.). Ni vizuri pia kawafikiria wakulima na kujaribu kutatua. shida sao. Jusi turns iliteuliwa ya kuchunguza membo ya kilimo cha chai chini ya uongozi wa mhe. Mahihu. Mapendekeso mengi yalitolewak id kwa tume hii na tunangojea matckea maruri. Ikiwa mapendekezo haya yatafikiriwa. basi kilimo cha chai  kitaer delea vizuri na nchi yetu itajipatia pesa nyingi za kigeni.

MAKAU: Thank you, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this Motion. As it has been said by other hon. Members, agriculture is the back bone of the economy of this country. Apart from that, it is the mother of the other Ministries taking into account the function that it performs. Food policy has been very consistent in this country and that is why we have been having stability in this country under the wise leadership of our President. Food is a security item. Without food in a country, security becomes a problem. That is why the President and the officers in the Ministry of Agriculture came out with this good policy. Those of us who come' from dry areas know what it means when we say that food is a security item. That is why the Ministry of Agriculture is very important.The Agricultural sectors offers about 80-per cent of the available jobs in the country- The basis of our export lies in the agricultural sector. This is because raw materials required for the manufacture of goods for export come this sector, When talking about the export processing zone emphasis should be laid on the agricultural sector.Tourism is becoming a major foreign exchange earner in this country but tourists cannot come here if food was not available. That is why I said that this is a very important Ministry.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have bodies like the Kenya Tea Development Authority, Coffee Board of Kenya and the Kenya Planters Co-operative Union,, In fact His Excellency the President is always ahead of us. He sees a problem when Government officers are unable to see it he is always ahead of us. He has appointed probe committees to look into the affairs of the K.P.C.U. and K.T.D.A. He has done that because he has realised that we are lagging behind. The farmer has not been benefiting. The farmer has not been motivated. I come from a coffee growing area - Moooni. My father is a coffee farmer: I also own some coffee. But sometimes we fail to understand why the farmers cc shoul continue caring for the coffee. This is because if you look at what they are getting you will be left wondering as to whether the Ministry of Agriculture is interested in motivating the farmers. The farmer spends all his time on the farm but what he gets at the end of the day is very little. During the days of the coffee boom there were no problem. But since we are now going through difficult times, we should consider the establishment of agricultural marketing boards. During good times you can afford heavy overhead costs. The Ministry should, apart from the probe committees that are looking into certain matters, think in terms of marketing and distribution channels. You will see that the farmer delivers his crop to the locational co-operative; the district co-operative union takes over from there and then the K.P.C.U. and the Coffee Board come in. The farmer incurs a lot of expenses and at the end of the day lie gets very little. This should be looked into. Ye should adopt modem technics of marketing.These agricultural marketing .boards have not changed their operations since inception. His Excellency the President has been saying that farmers are getting a raw deal. There is no point of telling us that certain fellow have been caught over¬charging tea factories. Such fellows should be taken to court, when the farmer sees a list of people who have been given loans by the K.P.C.U. when the farmer not received any loan that tends to de motivate the farmer. So, these leakages should be stopped. This is because they de-motivate the farmers. We are told that these people got the money for other purposes because some of them are not even coffee farmers. So, agricultural marketing boards should be looked into; they can be merged with other departments. One department can do processing and distribution and marketing. If other people come in between the K.P.C.U. n ana the farmers, the farmers do suffer.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is unlikely that the prices of coffee in the world markets will rise in the near future. Also our tea market in Iran has been affected by the Gulf Crisis. So, we should ask ourselves what we are going to do as far as earning of foreign exchange is concerned. Tourism is doing very well we are earning about KShs.8 billion every year. But agriculture remains the back-bone of the economy of this country.With regard to horticulture, the Authority that is given that charge should be more aggressive as far as marketing of horticultural produce is concerned, First of all cargo space is a problem. So, the Kenya Airways should be able to give us more cargo space. There are no cold storage facilities at the Airport, Those who can afford have their own cold storage facilities. But the Ministry should make sure that would there facilities are made available to theMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we should embark on aggressive marketing  of Our  horticnitural produce. You will find that 60 per cent of vegetables is sold to supermarkets. I talk about aggressive marketing because packaging is very curicial. We should thank His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for reducing duty on packaging materials. So, our survival depends on packaging as a marketing to in these supermarkets.We have a coffee representative in Britain and other places. We should create a post for an horticultural representative Who should be a marketing  wisard. He should be able to go round and look for markets for our horticultural produce. We are earning about KShs. 2billion from the sale of horticultural produce overseas. The future looks bright for horticultural exports.I would like to thank the Ministry for starting a pilot scheme in Mbooni Constituency for horticultural produce and it is doing very well. I understand that last year the farmers earned more than KShs. 1 million during the experimental stage. But I would like to urge the officers there to let the people in Mbooni to sell their produce to people who are offering good prices. I do not know what reasons the officers have for making people sell to particular buyers. There are companies which are offering good prices - for example KShs.42/ Why should a farmer sell the produce at KShs.27/- when he knows of a company which can offer a better price. The Ministry should tell the Horticultural Crops Development Authority that farmers in Mbooni would like to sell their produce at better prices. Those private companies which are offering better prices should be allowed to establish buying centres in Mbooni.I say this because it is very demoralising for a farmer to be forced to sell to a company which is offering KShs.27/- when he knows that there is another company offering KShs.42/-. These people are being forced to sell to particular companies just to pay for the money they spend on inputs. The Ministry should look into this matter.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. 0K0TID0: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to support this Motion. The Minister presented the Motion so well that even if the main points were faulty we would still support it because of the way he has presented it. As has been said by previous speakers, agriculture is the backbone of this country's economy. It is so and it will remain so for a long time. This is because a country without agricultural strength cannot hope to make economic growth any good. But the reason why Kenya is envied by other nations is 2 because our agricultural base is very, very strong. That is why the President has led the nation by being a very active farmer and by recognising that the philosophy of a full tumbo is the philosophy of peace; it is the philosophy of I Tyayo and this is the philosophy we must, all of us, adhere to. We must ensure that our people are well fed and in this way we will progress.Kenya is envied by today by many nations. Since we have been successful, many countries try to undermine us; they are envious and they are jealous.They go ahead and say, "what is Kenya worth?" You will remember, Mr. TemporaryDeputy Speaker that several decades ago, a very important nation declared that Africa is a continent full of chaos. Even today, there are certain foreign countries who still believe that all African countries are chaotic.Although we know there are some African countries which are absolutely chaotic,certainly not all are. However, unfortunately for them, Kenya has kept a very highlevel of order because of its success in Agriculture and the dynamic leadership of His Excellency President arap Moi. Due to this success, our enemies have gone out of their way to say, "Kenya is an undemocractic country. Kenya is not worth any good. Kenya Is lacking in human rights and they continue thus, making all kinds of false accusations about Kenya, to such an extent that they want to force us to adopt the kind of democracy that cannot work in this country.Mr. Temporary deputy Speaker, Sir, this is all due to envy. We in Kenya cannot conform to the idea that the average European nations seem to have that an African country must be chaotic. Kenya is orderly; Kenya is peaceful and Kenya is progressive. The sort of success that Kenya has. makes our enemies to be envious to the extent that they have started attacking us on things that do not exist. Unfortunately for us, seme of our friends here begin to think that those false accusations are true, why should a country like Norway come out in support of a Kenya citizen who has been accused in court of a criminal offence. Is this not because they believe that the success that Kenya has made has been so great that they have now to undermine it somehow? If Mr. Koigi Wamwere has taken a Norwegian citizenship, then of course, Norway has a point in saying, "Our Norwegian citizen has been taken to court. Let us go and see what is happening". In any case, the Ambassador should have conducted himself in a diplomatic way by getting arrangements being properly made before he can do the sort of thing he decided to do. Perhaps the Kenya Government should first investigate to find out whether or not Mr. Koigi Wemwere is not, in fact, a Norwegian citizen. I am saying this because they may have given him a citizenship. However, that be as it may,a double agent and adopting some kind of pretence that he is a Kenyan citizen on the one hand while on the other, he is a Norwegian citizen.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, these are the sort of things that are "being done to us by our enemies because of their envy cue to our great success as an agricultural country. Many countries in Africa which do not have an agricultural base, have often run into trouble. So, I encourage the Minister to do a great deal more to anchor our economy more and more in agriculture so that Anglo Industries can go into the various rural centres to create job opportunities to our people for the prosperity of this nation. Today, there are very many things that need to be done by this Ministry and we cannot say them all in two days and it is not foreseeable that the Ministry can do them all we can only touch on a few which we think the Ministry can do. We know that the officials of the Ministry are dedicted people, but they ought to realise that they have an awful and owesome task in trying to meet their objectives. Here, I would like to point out a few things related to my constituency which I hope the Minister will look at with a view to doing something about them. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for example, we have the Yalla River Delta. Time and again, this delta has been earmarked for harnessing in order to facilitate, sugar cane production which would in turn bring about the construction of another sugar-factory. If this was done, we could be self-sufficient in sugar which means we would be able to stop any sugart importation. This river delta, together with facilitating sugar cane gowing, would also facilitate rice-growing so that we could too stop importing rice. So, I appeal to the Minister to put in a little bit more work to get this Yalla River delta harnessed to facilitate the growing of these two specific crops, in This is an area in which we can do a lot to produce more food for Kenya.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, another area that I would like the Minister to look at, is the area of irrigation schemes that the Government have approved in Dundalary Division, namely, Chenye, Wundembi and Siamungu Irrigations Schemes. These schemes very important to us and I appeal to ban to post an irrigation officer to Bundaalanyi Division to look after their operations. At the moment, the operations of these irrigation schemes have come to. a standstill because there is no officer to guide the farmers on how to carry out irrigation. These farmers have obtained irrigation equipment, namely, irrigation pumps, machines, tractors and so on. However, because there is no expert to guide them, they have often run into trouble. I request the Minister to have a look at this and find out how he can assist these farmers to grow what they have set out to grow. It is by using these small-scale projects that we can reach our objectives in being self-sufficient in food. I am saying this because if farmers could form small co-operative societies to produce enough food to supply to the people in the area, we shall not then have to import maize or other foods from a different district to feed our people. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister has done a great deal and he being a friend of mine, I would like to invite him to my place on a friendly basis to visit me for a weekend so that I can show him these things. If he wants to bring his Permanent Secretary, there would be enough accommodation for both of them. I would like him to see these things for himself and assist us to develop further so that we do not have to depend on importation of- food from the neighbouring areas. "Sometimes, the practice of importing food from the neighbouring districts, invites importation of food from outside the country, bring about seme amount of risk of having foreigners coming into our country. In fact, Sir, we can grow more than we need in this area. At the moment, there is a small irrigation scheme which is being run by the National Irrigation Board and it is well known in the Ministry, that this irrigation board, has made it possible for this irrigation scheme to produce the highest per capita income in the country. The conditions in this scheme are excellent; the soil is fertile due to the silt being piled ever the years by the River Nzoia. It is so rich that one does not need to add any fertilizers. You only need to turn the soil over 2nd plant anything you like.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, these are the sort of thingsthat the Ministry should "be looking at, especially in areas such as this,to make sure that Kenya is totally independent of importation of foodstuffsthat we require in 2 this country. I am sure with a little bit of moreeffort, we can produce enough rice for our' domestic consumption and forexport. So, may I repeat my request to the Minister to consider seriouslyposting an irrigation officer to Bundalanyi division to assist thefarmers there to carry out the irrigation projects, there in order to increase our rice and wimbi production. Wimbi as you know, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, is a grain with the highest content of protein and is very good for children at breakfast, luch and so on.With those few remarks, I am sure that the points I have raised will be of some use to the Minister.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KPKORIR: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving an opportunity to support this Motion. As you sire aware, agriculture is the backbone of our economy. For the sake of the peace, love and unity that exist in the country, it is very important that the government serves wananchi properly. We would like to have an agricultural field technician in every location and sub—location in the country to assit farmers so that we may expand our economy. If we have a lot of farm produce, we will be able to export it and earn more foreign exchange, particularly at a time like this when there is a crisis in the prices of petroleum products all over the country. Travelling has become very expensive and money is needed very much. It is necessary that we develop our farms in order to improve the economy of the country.When you look at my constituency, you find that there are many types of farm produce. In Kerio Valley, for example, we have cotton, green grams and bananas. I appeal to the Ministry of Public Works to improve the roads there so that our farmers can transport their farm produce to the market easily. Kerio Valley has wonderfully fertile land. I appeal to the Minister to visit Kerio Valley to see for himself what I mean. There are many kinds of fresh fruit there. We can export this fruit to foreign countries and earn a lot of foreign exchange. I am Very happy to see the Minister, his Permanent Secretary and his officers here taking note of this particular issue.Our country is prosperous and we are peace-loving people. So, we should expand our economy by having more agricultural field officers visiting every area of the country to advise farmers on what kinds of crops to produce. Many people today cannot get employment in the Government. There are no jobs for the majority of our people. However, everybody can participate in farming, by which means we can earn a lot of money for the benefit of our children and ourselves. We will also be able to feed other people as well.We should tell those who are not satisfied with our progress that Kenya is for Kenyans and that those who are trying to interfere with us should leave us alone to go on the way we want. We cannot allow anybody to tell us what we want to do because we are able to advise ourselves.There was a time when the officers of the Kenya Seed and Lint Cotton Board used to visit my area urging farmers to produce more cotton in the area. They told the fanners that they would buy this cotton on the basis of cash—on— delivery. I visited the area recently on Kenyatta Day and several farmers came to me and said that they had harvested their cotton and it was just lying idle as nobody from the Kenya Seed and Lint Cotton Board Board had gone to collect it. I appeal to the Ministry to advise its officers to collect his cotton and pay the farmes concerned immediately. We should not allow wananchi to be frustrate after they have toiled hard to produce crops. As far as cotton is concerned, we need to encourage more farmers to produce it, but if you frustrate those who have already produced some it, even those who were thinking of starting to produce it will refuse to work.I will not forget to remind the Ministry of Water Development that we passed a Motion last teas concerning the dams in Kerio Valley.The Motion was passed and I want to appeal to the Ministry to take action immediately. and construct those dams so that when the next season somes farmers may benefit from their sweat.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, people have been told to go back tothe land but you find that they have nothing to do there if the area is very dry. The Government now has agreed to reclaim and develop the arid and semi-arid areas, and it is the duty of the Ministry of Water Development to assist in this exercise When they are doing that, they should assist Kerio Valley farmers by constructing dams for them to provide water for irrigation. I would also like to ask trie Ministry of Public Works to adhere to His Excellency the President's directive and tarmack the road between Chesoi and Chesongoi in order to assist fairmers in that area to transport their produce. It is very sad to see somebody buying a bunch of bananas from a farmer at KShs.10.00 and then selling it at KShs.100.00 at the market. So, I am appealing to the Ministry of Public Works to construct good roads in order that the farmers can take their own produce to the market places easily.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also wish- to call upon the Ministry of Co-operative Development to organise farmers co-operatives so that farmers can sell their produce easily. That way, they will be able to enjoy their sweat. There is no point of farmers working very hard and, in the end, find that they have nowhere to sell their produce. The people concerned with marketing whould be moving around helping farmers.Sir, there is a water project in my area called Katecheron, where a let of money has been spent and we do not see any water in the' area. I would like the Ministry concerned to look i out of it. It is very important for all field officers to advise their Ministries accordingly so that farmers can be assisted.Having said that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I now wish to say one or two things concerning the fish industry. I would be very grateful if the fish industry could be expanded in this country. We want to see a lot of progress in this sort of farming. Wananchi should be told the necessity and benefits of the fish industry.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also wish to ask the Government to look into the prices of fertilizers so that farmers can be encouraged to produce more. At the moment the price of fertilizer is very high and many wananchi cannot afford it. It is my feeling that fertilizer prices should be controlled so that they can be affordable by the common small-scale farmer. That way, we will enhance our economy through agriculture.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.nto this project and find out how much money has been spent on this project and how much needs to be used so that the project can take off the ground immediately. This has been a waste of time and money. Any project which has been started should be implemented so that wananchi can benefit</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Nyagah): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to contribute to very important debate on The Ministry of Agriculture. I have known the Minister for Agriculture for some considerable time even before he was a Minister when he volunteered he very valuable knowledge and experience in farming, marketing and agricultural education to this country. Although I missed the chance of hearing his speech in moving the Motion, I have no doubt that he must have covered every aspect of the Ministry very competently. I have glanced at his speech and I am satisfied that he has told this august House as much as needed to enable us to support this Ministry and its request for this very meagre amount of money is asking for.Agriculture is a key Ministry in this country. I say this without prejudice and from experience in that the following Ministries would find themselves unable, to function. The Ministry of Reclamation and Development of Arid, Semi-arid and Wastelands would do nothing after reclaiming the land unless its work is followed by agriculture. The Ministry of Co-operative Development and even Kenya Tea Development Authority would have not have anything to sell unless agriculturalists preceded them, worked with them and even remained working thereafter. The Ministry of Regional Development would have nothing to do along the river .banks and valleys unless their production work was fully supported by the Ministry of Agriculture. The Ministry of Supplies and Marketing would also have nothing to store, market and supply unless the Ministry of Agriculture produced enough for us and a surplus to market. Even my Ministry would not development livestock in the small farmers sector unles the Ministry of Agriculture, Farm Planning Section, sees aside sufficient land for producing folder that is very much needed by my Ministry. The Ministry of Eesearch, Science and Technology would not be useful to this country unless its research findings were put into practical use by the Ministry of Agriculture.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we know that water is important for without it nothing would flourish trees and grass would dry up end people and animals would not be able to live. I am trying to underscore the interdependence of Government Ministries in this country: None can function without the other, especially the ones I have just mentioned. I have left out of my list one very important Ministry - labour. But its the Ministry of Agriculture that gives about 90 per cent of Kenyans an opportunity to earn a living through agricultural activities.How about Transport and Communications? It is different from agriculture, but it must depend on agriculture for many things that this sector cannot produce in order to a perfect transportation system, we also like thinking in teams of having industries because, in relation to agriculture, they Will give tractors, ploughs and. vehicles that transport food from place to place conveniently.We in Kenya are for tunate to have been placed along the equator right in the middle of the worldline where it is never too hot nor too cold; where' we are able to produce quality crops, such as, coffee, tea and pyrethrum. The other day, the Americans tried to kill our pyrethrum industry by producing sysnthetic stuff but they have come to say that there is nothing better than the natural pyrethrum. Kenya is among the top quality producers of this commodity.We are able to produce our own sugar, tea, coffee and so on. What would the world do without a good cup of tea. We rely on the Ministry of Agriculture for a good breakfast of a slice of bread and an egg and other Ministries which produce vital life sustaining products.We always emphasize in agricultural shows the importance of Kenya being self-sufficient in food production. A country that cannot feed its people, is a bankrupt country. It is also a country that is on the verge of ending its stability. I say this because there is an important role played by the security of a country. The armed forces make sure that our borders are not tampered with so that the farmer can go about his work without fear. The people in this country must, therefore, realise the importance of maintaining the best order of cur laws which are clearly defined in our Constitution. These laws protect everyone.When I have a chance to speak, like now, I always emphasise the fact in Kenya, we have a tendency of people talking too much thereby minimising activities and actions. We should talk less and do more. If the farmer were to spend his time talking and not working on his farm, we can rest assured that this country cannot go far because we shall be a net importer of essential foodstuffs.Our President is an accomplished farmer aid also a politician of no mean importance. He has, over the last 35 years, seen the importance of telling Kenyans to talk less and do more for the unity of this country. If we can all go hack to our farms, produce more crops, conserve our soil, water and the environment. Kenya will stand even higher in the eyes of the world and we will he able to set pace in Africa as one of the very developed coduntries in this Continent. Having said that, I would like to say one thing about my constituency which is surrounded by hydro—electrict dams. I feel sorry because these dams do not sees, at the moment, to give us the services we would require from them. We would like some of the surplus water to be used for irrigation purposes. I come from a serai-aria area and if the Minister for Agriculture can liaise with the Minister, for Energy and the Minister for Regional Development, more use can be made of the water in our dams.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, today the people I represent have to make endless noise about crocodiles. These crocodiles kill my constituents' goats, sheep and cows at the dams. Because of wildlife protection these crocodiles have multiplied. I want to finish by thanking the President for all that he has done in the Ministry of Agriculture. I say this because as a former Minister for Agriculture I know how much he has done.On this note, I beg to support the Motion very strongly.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OP THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah) : Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I would like to first of all, I would like to thank the Minister and his capable team of officers for feeding this nation. They have a very, very important role to play in this country. WE have kept our people well fed and that is why some Kenyans can in fact, well fed as they are start dreaming of doing the devilish things that some people have been trying to do. In congratulating the Ministry for doing a very commendable 300, and in urging them to continue doing this commendable job, I only have a couple of points to make because I realise that tins is not with me.My first, point is with regard to the Agricultural Mechanisation Unit at Mariakani. That Unit is a graveyard of machinery and it is situated on the Mombasa-Nairobi Kighway. I would urge the Minister to find it possible to rehabilitate the machinery there so that it can be used for the benefit of producing more and more food by the people in Kilifi DistrictTemporary Deputy Speaker. Sir, we in Kilifi would like to educate our people through agricultural mechanisation and we ask for tractors to be brought to Kilifi. I would also like to request the Ministry to evolve a research scheme so that we can develop our cashewnut and coconut crops and the various crops that are grown at the Coast. To us these crops are just like the tea and coffee crops that are grown in other parts of the country. We have ben forgotten down there at the Coast. Coconut and cashevmut down at the Coast grow as if we do not have expertise. The trees are aged at the moment and we have a factory there and there is even a danger that we may not be able to supply that factory at Kilifi with cashewnuts simply because the trees are very old. In view there is no adequate research and I urge the Ministry to assist particularly Kilifi farmers with regard to these two major cash crops. These crops are very vital to us they are our "coffee". We have been asking for a proper programme of how we can utilise the coconut tree to its fullest extent. We only use makuti and copra at the moment,. There is good mill that comes from that tree; it can be harnessed to do something else. I am not talking about liquor or anything like that. The proper utilisation of that milk can only come through proper research. I would like to thank the Ministry for the various programmes that have been started in Kilifi. I think I will end there because my time is over.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mureithi) : You may continue on Tuesday, next week, Mr. Keah.<Header>ADJOURNMENT</Header><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mureithi) : Hon.

MANGOLI: Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and the hon. Assistant Minister for giving me this opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Cote of the Ministry of Agriculture.I thank the Minister for Agriculture for having ably moved this Motion so that he can get money to spend during the current financial year. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Minister, at this very juncture, for having increased the price of sugarcane.        Sugarcane is a prime money earning product in my Constituency and the review of its price was overdue. So, I would like to take this chance on behalf of the people of Webuye Constituency in particular and that of the people of Bungoma District in general, to thank very sincerely the Minister for having thought it wise to increase the price of sugarcane. This price increase will boost the economy of the people in that area and children will now be able to attend school. However, I would like to ask the Minister to go further and ask the owners of sugar factories to pay the farmers, for the sugarcane which has already been-delivered. I am saying this because at the times farmers deliver sugarcane to the factories but are paid after one month when we know that the processed' commodity is paid for in cash. I wonder who keeps the money for all that time until the farmer is paid. We want the farmer to be paid on the spot. The Minister knows these things well and I am sure given time things will change.'We would also like to urge him to embark on the exercise of improving sugar factories including roads in the sugar belt like the Webuye Malaba road. When the contract for the construction of this road was awarded the price quoted was less than Ksh.900 million but it has now escalated to well over one billion shillings. Any project which is delayed becomes too 	expensive in the end and the increased costs are passed over tothe farmers or the consumers I am, therefore, asking humbly, on behalf of Kenyans and more particulary on behalf of the people of Webuve Constituency any project which is earmarked for implementation especially agricultural project, should be implemented on time., so that its cost does not escalate. I have realised that these delays are deliberate or designed to escalate the cost of the project in the end, and these extra expenses are passed over to the people that it was intended for.I would also like to come to issue of sugar factories where they collect money called "Excise Duty". Last year, I humbly asked the Minister for Agriculture that part of this money that is collected from the factories should be used for the improvement of roads where those factories are situated. The roads in the sugar belt are so bad, yet a lot of money is collected from sugar-cane farmers. I would like to appeal to the Minister, through his experts, to advice his Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance that part of this Exercise Duty should be used to improve the roads in these areas if there is no other source to fund the improvement of these roads, because I know the money is there but it should not be transferred to Nairobi. That tiny fraction of half per cent should be left to the people who make the money to improve the roads. I am sure this is a humble request which is managable and I am sure the Minister with his personnel will be able to implement this directive so that the sugar factory owners should improve in the sugar belt roads. This work should not be done by the Ministry of Public Works. For example, if this House had a generator which is maintained by the Ministry of Public Works.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

MANG'OLI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is good that you are 	in the Chair to guide us; otherwise, we would be getting into a confused situation.Sir, I am asking an obvious thing from the Ministry of Agriculture and, since I can see various senior officers from the Ministry here, I am sure they wi11 be directed by the Minister to go and implement the proposals we are making here. I say so especially with respect to the payment of farmers. When the Government imports sugar from outside the country, the product is paid for in cash. I am wondering why sugar cane farmers should continue giving credit facilities to the sugar factories. Funds should be made available to pay the farmers immediately they deliver their, sugar cane. The non-payment is affecting the farmers and; hence, the whole economy of those in the areas where sugar cane is grown. Since the sugar prices have now been increased, I would like to emphasize here that our farmers should 	also be paid on time. The question of the factory personnel coming here to await the cheques from the Kenya National Trading Corporation, or the Mini¬stry should not arise. I am confident the Minister will take action on thisMr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is a contradiction to pay cash for the imported sugar, while the sugar delivered from the Kenya National Trading Corporation from the local farmers cannot be paid for in the same manner. We would like this proposal to be considered so that in future we do not have to be told that personnel officers from the sugar companies have to come and "fight" for the cheques. We would also like to be told whether our local sugar is inferior to the imported one, or not.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there was mention of the proposed Agricultural Finance Bank. We would like-to know when this bank will- be started, the Minister should also tell us what interest rates the bank wi11 be charging always are small because ofnon-payment of loans, even when they have been guaranteed by companies like the Nzoia Sugar Company; I would like to request the Minister to stop this auctions because farmers are suffering. If this trend has to continue, then the Agricultural Finance Corporation should either be closed down, or something be done about its operations. All the time the Corporation is overruling the banks and go on to auction farmers' small shambas for very little amounts. They sometimes collude with auctioneers. I am sure the Minister who is able will deal with that.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. 'MALEBE:' 0n a point of order, Mr, Deputy Speaker, Sir. In view of the fact that much has been discussed on this vote, would I be in order to move that the Mover be called upon to reply?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order. I thought I said I overruled you in advance. I now properly overrule you on that point.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. TERER: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to make my observations on this important Vote on the Ministry of Agriculture. Every Ministry has equal import¬ance, but I think the Ministry of Agriculture is more important than a few other Ministries because our economy is largely dependent on agri¬culture. This Ministry needs the co-operation of all other Ministries in order to succeed in its endeavours to improve the economy of this country.I would like to start by thanking the Ministry of Agriculture, and particularly the Agricultural Development Corporation. This Corpo-ration has done a magnificent job in helping farmers; it has very good dairy cattle which have been sold to farmers and, therefore, improved the farmers' livestock tremendously. Again, the ADC's subsidiary, the Kenya Seed Company has done a very good job in improving the quality ofLet me now touch on soil conservation. Unless special attention is paid to the conservation of our soil, in future we may run short of the rich top soil. The Ministry of Agriculture should liaise with the Ministry of Water Development so that we can have water in our farms. Driving cattle to and from the rivers creates a lot of soil erosion because the livestock create the gulleys through their movements and when rains come a lot of soil is drained down the rivers. Of late not a lot of attention has been paid to terracing of farms and, I think, extension officers have - to go around so that they ensure that farmers are terracing their farms to avoid soil erosion.	I would like to touch on the research benefits, too. The Ministry is crrying out some research and we would like the benefits of the research to go to the farms. Farmers should be told of the research findings. There should be seminars held at various levels and we should have the extension officers visiting farmers more often. We would like those extension officers to advise farmers on the latest developments in tea production so that more of the same product can be grown in a shorter time. While talking about tea, I think it is not enough to tell farmers to plant any type of tea. I think we have reached a stage where we even need to phase put the poor quality tea so that farmers can have high yilding tea. I think this also applies to coffee.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, on the same level, when a new maize variety has been discovered, farmers should be told about it and I would like to request the Ministry to carry on research in various areas because most of the maize seeds we receive come from Kitale. I think it is time the Ministry thought of going to certain other areas to carry on more experiments so that we have more varieties that suit the different areas in the country better.Sir, I understand that we still import wheat and rice. If weare really serious, we can actually grow sufficient wheat and rice for local consumption and even surplus for export: With the research pro¬grammes we have, and with all the seriousness we apply, we should be able to save our meagre foreign exchange earnings. We should not be using that meagre earning to import wheat and rice while we can grow those two crops in large quantities in the country.Coming back to the issue of extension officers, I suggest that they should visit farmers regularly to advise them on how the pests in the farms can be controlled; how to store the harvested crops and so on. I believe that the destruction of crops by pests, can be reduced if our farmers are advised accordingly on how to prevent such loss.Turning to marketing, I would like to say that unless the farmers' crops are marketed, then the farmers will be disillusioned and will not grow more of those crops because there will be no point of producing crops which cannot be marketed.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the Marketing Division of the Ministry of Agriculture should be strengthened so that it deals with local markets as well as exploiting the possibilities of selling our agricultural products to the Preferential Trade Area, and even overseas countries. In order to improve on our production, we must at the same time improve the quality of our fertilisers. This aspect of fertiliser is taking a lot of our money and the Ministry must step up research on the fertiliser so that we can have locally manufactured fertiliser.The Ministry of Agriculture has technical: officers who have not been employed and I do not know where the problem is lying. These technical officers were trained, and the Ministry was aware that after the completion of their training they were to be absorbed in employment. Maybe the Ministry of Agriculture can liaise with the Ministry of Education so that these technical officers are not left to roam about but are employed as teachers in our primary schools. Short of that, the knowledge they have acquired will go to waste.When the Minister moved his vote, he mentioned that there will be eight new tea factories to be constructed and I think these factories should be sited where there is a lot of tea, or where there is room for expansion. The siting of factories has sometimes been done without considering the quantity of tea in the given area. In other words, the construction of the tea factories and, particularly, their siting should be done on purely economic grounds and not political. I know that my Konoin area produces a lot of tea and I appeal to the Minister to consider siting at least two of those proposed factories there. I know there is a lot of tea grown there and there is still more room for expansion.There was a tea factory at Kapkatet but I understand thatthe construction was stopped, for unknown reasons. Maybe it was as a result of findings of a probe committee. However, it will definitely cost more money to complete the factory because of the time lapse. As the hon. Member for Webuye said, if we delay implementing projects, we will end up paying costly later on and it is the farmers and the consumers who are going to suffer most. Most of the materials that are used in the construction of factories are imported and, therefore, that will also drain our meagre foreign exchange resources.Coming to factories, I think the Kenya Tea Development factories should be well managed. The Ministry, should have an inspectorate team to monitor the activities of these factories. There are certain factories that have continued to perform very poorly over the years and I think that should raise the Ministry's concern. If a factory has been making a lot of losses, the farmers also lose. I understand that the bonusses are soon going to be distributed to farmers, but there are certain fact¬ories that have continued, over the years, to perform very poorly. I think the Ministry should come in and establish why some of these factories continue to do so. Maybe the managers could be changed because some of them may have been in some stations for a very long time but are not making any headway and should, actually, even be sacked.It is important that the Ministry takes a keen interest in these factories in the form of training projections. Unless we have managers who are trained, we cannot do much. The managers should be updated from time to time so that they are knowledgeable in financial matters, if they are not trained already. There are cases where farmers are even told to return home with their tea. I think these should be one organisationWith those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Chesire): Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to make my contribution to this very important Ministry of Agriculture. In Kenya agriculture is the fulcrum of our economy. As we all know, it is said that politics is food and where there is plenty of food, the politics is good. However, where the food is lacking, then problems arise. I am glad to note that during the Nyayo Era, policies have been adopted and carried out that have ensured that this country is self sustaining in basic food production.It is glad to note that we have had a long period of sufficiency in virtually all the staple food. I would like to take this opportunity to urge the Ministry to continue to improve on the policies that have already been laid down so that we continue to grow from strength to strength as an agricultural nation. Since we have no oil, we have to rely on agriculture. It is important in this regard that the farmer is given maximum support possible. After all, our total stability depends on how much the farmer is able to produce and to maintain peace and stability in this country. In order to do that, it is also important that the farmer makes a good return out of his activities." A good return means that the Ministry of Agriculture must regularly review the various farming policies that have been adopted. The Ministry must constantly appraise the position of the farmer vis-a-vis his production ability. It would be wrong to wait until it is too late, particularly at this time when we have a lot of hazards; when the costs of inputs have outstripped production costs. It is of urgent need to look into the economics of farming and to do so very seriously.Up to now, Sir, it may be said that the farmer has been subsidising agriculture in this country. This is mainly because most of the farmers have not been doing accounts; their interest is only what they receive at the end out of their produce. They do not usually take into account the actual costs of production and this may have saved us for quite some time. However, there comes a time when the farmer finds his debts unmanageable. In fact, if I may address myself to the credit, because it is important, this agricultural aspect is taken care of very much: If you look at the cereal farmer today, he would rather be having a debt. If he does not have a debt with the Agriculture Finance Corporation, then he has one with the Kenya Grain Growers CoOperative Union or in the commercial banks. Either of those institutions will have granted a hardcore loan which the farmer just carries over. Because his returns are unable to sustain his efforts, it will be very difficult for him.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is, therefore, very important that we seriously look at the farmer and find out how well he can sustain himself. At the end of the year, after paying his presumptive taxes, his inputs and financial charges, the farmer will be left with about 15 per cent net returns out of all his efforts. That would, at least, enable him to carry something forward. However, I can assure you that most of the farmers today do not have that surplus and we must really do something about it. We cannot forever expect the farmer to subsidise agriculture.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, countries like the United States of America, and even bodies like the European Economic Commission, come to us and tell us not to subsidise farming. They tell us to leave the farmer to meet the full cost of production and the consumer to meet the total cost of the produce. These same people telling us that are, themselves, subsidising their farmers to the hilt. At the moment there is a major argument in the United States of America and even in the European Economic Commission on the reduction of subsidies. The legislators in the United States of America are saying that the subsidies should not be reduced. The European Economic Commission countries are giving 100 per cent subsidies and yet we get our inputs from those countries at full cost. How can they come to us and tell us not to subsidise the farmers activities? That is an area that we must look into. If we have to subsidise, then let us do so. After all, if we have to subsidise the wheat production, we would not be spending so much foreign exchange earnings importing the same product. If we were to subsidise the production of the various crops in this country, we would become a net exporter. This is an area over which I would like to urge the Ministry to ensure that from next year the farmer is making money out of his efforts. Let us subsidise agricultural production so that we can have as much food as possible.Another factor that bothers me is mechanisation. If you look at statistics, you will see that the sale of farm machinery is declining by as much as 40 per cent this year. That goes to show you that it does not pay the farmer to buy such tractors. I know it is very expensive to have a tractor and it is very difficult to make an economic return at the moment out of these farm machinery that you buy at very high prices. If there is a way that we can have these farm machinery subsidised, I would go for it all along. This is because our policy and aim is to ensure that we maximise production. The only way of maximising production is by making it cheapand accessible for the farmer to get mechanisation and funds, as well as credit facilities.At the same time, Sir, we must look into the question of Graduated Maximum Returns and insurance to the farmer. For the last few years the farmer has been carrying the brunt of gross losses caused by the vagaries of weather. This is also affecting the farmer very much. I think we have to seriously go back and look into the possibility of reintroducing G.M.R. so that the farmer can be assured of continued production.Lastly, we come to the question of payments. I am glad to say that institutions, like the National Cereals and Produce Board and others, have been paying the farmers promptly. There is nothing as import ant as paying the farmers promptly. However, there are a few other bodies which ought to behave likewise, because the farmer has his problems, too. You look at an organisation like the Kenya Seed Company. They are now busy taking farmers crops, but the farmer will not get the bulk of his payments before the end of next year. He will have been overtaken by expenses of land preparation for the coming year in buying inputs for the planting season in March, next year. So, I would like the Ministry to see to it that these institutions that delay payments to farmers also realise that they are making the farmers to suffer. We also know that at the moment the commercial farmers are being very hard on the farmers. I would like to urge the VicePresident and Minister for Finance to really discuss with the Central Bank of Kenya and other commercial banks with a view to easing the credit provision to the farmers. At the moment the banks are becoming difficult and the more they become difficult, the more farmers are discouraged from carrying out their farming activities.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KIILU: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my colleagues in support of the Ministry of Agriculture. We know that the Ministry is very important since wananchi rely mainly on this Ministry when trying to determine what is economically viable for them to grow in their farms. However, there are some things I would like the Ministry to rectify.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Masinga climate is good for the growing of cotton. Our people have been mistreated by the cotton buyers because there is the union that usually comes in, but does so late. We plant plenty of cotton but farmers are being discouraged by the union which, instead of coming to buy the cotton at specific times, they come at any other time they may wish. I request the Minister to take steps to see to it that our farmers are saved from that kind of problem. If possible, this cotton should be bought directly without having to pass through the middlemen, or unions, because they are not really consistent. The union should, if it has to continue buying, be informing the farmers when the farmers should be ready to sell their cotton. However, on most occasions, after they have given a date, they do not turn up and it takes time and effort for the farmers to prepare their cotton, take it to some points and they only end up returning with their cotton after waiting at the buying centres for more than three days. We know very well that the demand for cotton is high but the buying methods are not good. We appeal to the Ministry to determine what steps are going to be taken to save the poor farmer.Sir, I would also like to request the Ministry to look into the possibility of having a ginnery in Masinga. That area qualifies for a ginnery because the majority of farmers there plant cotton.A ginnery in the area wouldhelp farmers there a lot. At the moment, they buy cotton and travel all the way to Makueni where there is a ginnery. There are enough cotton farmers in my .constituency and I request the Ministry to see if we can get a ginnery in Masinga Constituency.The other point is that the Minister should assist the people we represent as they have been complaining about being charged too big a levy and cess by county councils. Our farmers do not have big farms and the Government takes a lot of money from whatever they sell. What is the Ministry going to do change this levy? I request the Ministry to act so that our farmers to enjoy the profits of whatever they plant, especially cotton.With regard to the Agricultural Finance Corporation (A.F.C.) there has been a problem in the way it gives loans to farmers especially in my constituency. Sometimes, there are no loan application forms in the district headquarters and farmers are forced to travel all the way from rural areas to Nairobi to get these forms, thereby using a lot of money even when they are not sure that they will qualify to get loans. Farmers should be enabled to obtain these application forms from their district headquarters. The A.F.C. should advise farmers as to how one qualifies for a loan. When farmers go to the relevant officers, they sometimes do not get good or satisfactory answers and these officers are too rude to advise our people. My farmers travel all the way from Masinga to Machakos only to find no application forms there, but a little later you find other people getting the forms. I do not know whether there is a system of giving some well known individuals these forms while those who are not so well known do not get them. The Ministry and the officers concerned should check this matter.The other point that I would like to make is that field officers should be placed in locations and sub—locations to advise our farmers on what types of crops they are supposed to plant and how they should prepare their farms. In this way, our people will get a lot of food from their farms. Enough officers should be sent to various divisions to advise our people even before the rains come. In this way, we will have no food problem in the country.I would also request the Ministry of Agriculture to cooperate with the Ministry of Water Development in supplying my people with water from Masinga Dam for irrigation purposes so that they may grow crops enough for our own consumption and export. The soil in Masinga is really good for farming and we have tried to carry out minor irrigation with the little water in the area, but there is no proper water project in the area. The Government indicates that there is a project of the Ministry of Water Development to supply water from Masinga to Ekarakara.With these few remarks, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Dr. Onyonka): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also rise firstly to congratulate the Ministry for the job it has done over several past decades. It is an established fact that the economy of this country depends primarily on agriculture. It is also a fact that about 78 per cent of the hon. Members in this House represent rural constituencies where agriculture is the main preoccupation of the people. So, in a way, this is a farmer elected house.I also rise to voice my views with regard to the small scale farmer. My brother colleague, hon. Chesire, gave views concerning the plight of the farmer, and I got the impression that his main concern was the largescale farmer who has an account in the Kenya Grain Growers Co—operative Union and other institutions that extend credit to such farmers. Some of us, however, represent farmers who have never had an account in those organisations but whose problems are central to the future of agricultural success in this country. It is a fact that agriculture in this country has done well, and when agriculture "sneezes" the economy catches a "cold". It is for this reason that it is important that we learn to husband this sector effectively. With particular reference to small scale farmers, their number is big but, unfortunately, their output is sometimes overshadowed by what comes out of large scale farms in the form of sellable surplus. I would like to point out that it is critical that we assist the smallscale farmer to raise his productivity for it is he who provides the food eaten in the farm and also generates a small surplus for sale. It is a fact that in some rural areas productivity has tended to stagnate. With the increasing population and further sub—division of land in some of the districts where we come from, we are going to have problems in the longer term.So, a solution should be found to improve productivity on these smallscale farms In some of the major districts, land ownership consists of enterprises that are less than five acres, but experience elsewhere internationally has clearly demon¬strated that it is possible to double or even triple output of certain crops in the small scale farms. For this to succeed, we still need to do a bit more in the area of expenses.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister has done a commendable job in training extension workers. I would wish to say to my colleagues that that is basic now is to get them to work they, themselves, should become more productive in order to justify the salary they are being paid by the Ministry. Their number is very substantial and, for that matter, they have to be found in practically every corner of this country. But some of them do not perform in a manner that is commensurate with what they are paid by the: Government. They could do much more to assist the farmer. But we are getting into a rather awkward situation where the local farmer appears to know more than these extension fellows. So, they do not seem to have the guts to face the local smallscale farmer and colla¬borate with him and see whether they could impart the knowledge that they have acquired during their training. So, I wish to say to the Ministry that making more effective use of our present extension workers could yield tremendous bene¬fits to the smallscale farmer because most of these officers are there. They must not only be seen around, but they must be seen to be performing and doing so effectively.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the second point I should like to emphasise relates to extension. Some of our financial institutions sometimes have a sort of requirement that renders it extremely difficult for a small scale farmer owning two or three acres of land who grows a fairly substantial quantity of, say, onions, to be able to borrow money and extend the work he has already embarked upon. I hope that the conversion of the Agricultural Finance corporation into an agricultural bank will go a long way to assist in this regard. Admit¬tedly, the Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC) has been a commendable job in assisting the farmers, but it has. in the past faced a lot of problems, some arising from its financial structure, the attitude of the farmers themselves and many other things that made it very difficult for it to perform some of its duties. However, I do hope that the change will be for the better. In that change, the small—scale farmer must also be considered. He might not be producing an enormous surplus for market purposes at the moment, but he has made it possible for us to generate the necessary surplus that has made this country selfsufficient as far as food is concerned. This must be considered as one of the principal achievements of this country since Independence because without sufficient food the rest really amount to nothing. The tammy comes first and the rest follow. So, in this regard, whether one likes it or not the Government, working with the people, has done a tremendous job in producing the surplus food that has rendered this country selfsupporting.SFBut, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we must go further and not just produce for domestic selfsufficiency. We now have to move a step forward and produce an additional surplus in many other subsectors of the agricultural sector for export. In this connection, the whole question of marketing has never been adequately addressed. This is one area that I would wish to mention to my hon. colleagues here, that the whole question of agricultural marketing, with particular emphasis not only on the largescale producers but also the smallscale farmer because he could easily generate much re income beyond the subsistence level. Some of our farmers would definitely produce much more for export. In this regard, they need to be assisted much more effectively. It means making much more effective use of the extension officers and also involves voting slightly more resources for the purpose of actually promoting our marketing. Given the fact that within the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) Kenya has an obvious corporative advantage when it comes to agricultural production in certain lines, we should be able to export much more to our neighbours and to some other countries far afield. So, it is true that we have realised some of our principal achievements in the 27 years of Independence in the field of agriculture, but the scope is still there. I know we have now to move more positively into the field of the use of marginal land because most of the arable land does not really have the capacity at the moment. There is, of course, room for major improvements, but I doubt whether without the other factors in this sector it will not be possible for these areas to carry more people than at the moment.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is the other question of land fragment¬ation which, increasingly, is going to reach an obvious point of diminishing returns. What is going to happen is that even these independent farmers in terms of subsistence may have to resort to purchasing food from other areas. But I believe that in some, of the high potential areas there is plenty of scope for development.Look at the field of livestock for instance, where the government has expended a lot of resources and where there is a lot to be done. I know that this sector lies under the Ministry of Livestock Development, but there is an interdependence here which is critical. We could do much more here just the way we could do in the field of crop production.With those few remarks, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion and hope that the Minister will give me back my tea factory when it comes to deciding on that.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. WASIKENDOMBI: Ahsante Sana, Bw. Naibu Spika, kwa kunipa nafasi hii ili nami niseme macheache kuhusu Wizara hii. Ninaiunga mkono Voti hii kwa sababu moja au mbili. Kwanza, ninauiunga Voti hii mkono kwa sababu Waziri anayeiongoza Wizara hii ni mtu amoaye pia amesomea mambo ya kilirno. Kwa hivyo, ujuzi wake utatakikana sana na hayuko katika Wizara hii kwa sababu ya siasa Pili, Bw. Naibu Spika, ningetaka Waziri amwangalie mkulima wa miwa katika eneo ninalowakilisha Bungeni. Ninashukuru kwamba bei ya miwa imepanda, ingawa pia bei ya sukari imepanda. NIngependa Waziri achunguze mambo ya kodi ya five per cent kwa gross kwa maana mkulima anapeleka miwa yake katika kiwanda halafu kampuni inakata gharama ya leba, uchukuzi, mbolea na pesa zinazobakia zinakuwa kidogo sana kwa mkulima huyo. Pia, ukitoa ile five per cent kwa gross, mkulima anabaki bila faida yoyote katika ukuzaji wa miwa. Hili ni jambo ambalo linagusa mimea yote inayokuzwa na mkulima. Kwa hivyo, ningemwomba Waziri, paraoja na Waziri mwenzake ambaye1 anasimamia mambo ya kodi, walichunguze jambo hili ndipo mkulima asilemewa sana.Pia, katika eneo ambalo ninawakilisha, imekuwa ni vigumu sana kuendesha kilimo cha miwa hasa ukiangalia upande: wa barabara. Utaona kwamba mkulima analipa five per cent cess kwa mimea yake na huku hiyo cess inachukuliwa na Wizara ya Ujenzi na Wizara ya Serikali za Wilaya. Je, hizi Wizara mbili zikingang1ania hii cess, ni nani anayeumia? (The Deputy Speaker left the Chair)  (The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Wabuge) took the Chair) Bw. Naiou Spika wa rauda, nayasema hay a kwa sababu inum 1 *ima anapata shida nyingi na kwa hivyo yafaa.Wizara ijaribu kumsaidia mkulima. Mimi naishukuru Sxzkli Serikali ya Kenya kwa kujenga silos nyingi katika nchi hii. Lakini utaona. kvvamba unapo pita kule Mois Bridge utaona milima na milima ya mahindi ambayo yainefunikwa chandarua. Mahindi hayo yananyeshewa iaa: na rnvua na kuharibika. namwishowe hutiimiwa kama chakula .cha..mifugo. . Mapeina mwaka huu mahindi vote yalioza pale karibu na Kipkaren. Kwa hivyo ningemucmba \7aziri	aliangalie jambo hili.Bw. Naibu Spika. wa Muda, utaona k.vamba kwa wakati huu bei ya mahindi imeanza kupanda kule Kitale. Sasa watu wenye malori wamekwenda huko kununua mahindi. Hivi karibuni hakutakuwa na mahindi yo yote ndani ya hizo silos zetu. Nchi hii itakuja kukumbw na hali ya njaa ksababu ya sisi wenyewe kutolichunga jambo hili. Kuna vvatu ambao wananunua mahindi bila kupitia kwa National Cereals and Produce Board. Sitaki kuwatetea watu wa N.C.P.B. lakin. hawa watu wa N.C.P.B. f. pia na wanawahimiza wafanyabiashara kununua mahindi. Utaona k.vamba baada ya mkulima kuyapeleii mahindi yake. kwa N.C.P.B. halmashauri hiyo huchukua muda wa mieze minane kabla ya kumlipa mkulima. Kwa hivyo yafaa Waziri wa Eilimo ashauriane na mwenzake katika vizara ya Ugawaji na Uuzaji ili wakulima wawe wanalipwa mar a tu wanapoyapeleka mahindi yao.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Lluda, jambo lingine ni kvwamba malori ya wakulima hupanga milolongo nje ya mastoo ya N.C.P.B. kwa muda wa siku mbili hadi tano bila mahindi hayo rapakuliwa. Yakati mwingine watu  wsnye malori hulazimika kutoa kiinuamgongo kaola ya mahindi yao kupokelewa  na N.C.P.B. Kwa hivyo yafaa Waziri alichunguze jamco hili ili wakulima wasizidi kuuraia. Hii ni kwa sbfbii vnabindi yanawese kunye she vva nahumletea mkulima hasara kubwa.Kuhusu miwa, Bw. Naibu SjLEGaqp: Spika wa Muda, nirigependa kusema kwamba wakati .mkulima wa mahindi, kahawa, majani chai na pamba huyapeleka mazao.yake, roazao hayo hupimwa na irna huenda nyumbani akiwa anaujua uzani wa mazao yake. Lakini utaona kwamba mkulima wa miwa haruhusiwi kuingia pale miwa yake inapopimiwa. Ni kama vile mgonjwa akipelekwa kwenye chumba cha kupasulia wagonjwa wewe mwe ny emgon wa huruhusiwi kuingia pale icuona vile mgonjwa wako anapofanyiwa. Miwa hupimwa bila ya mkulima kuwapo. Yeye hupatiwa fcaayicta taarifa kuonyesha uzani wa miwa yake.  Ni vigumu kupiina miwa kwenye shamba. Hata hivyo yafaa mkulima awe na nrtu pale kwenye kiwanda cha sukari kuhairi ki sha miwa ya mkulima imepinwa vizuri. Kama jambo hilo haliwezekani yafaa Waziri axanye mipango ya kupeleka mtambo wa kompyutakwenye viwanda vya sukari ili lori ya miwa likiingia pale tile rewk mtambo wa kompyuta uweze kuchukua uzani wa miwa hiyo„ Nase hivyo kwa sababu kuna watu wengine ambao hulipwa pesa bila ya kupeleka miwa yo yote kwenye viwanda vya sukari. Ni lazima jambo hili lichunguzwe ili kusiwe na malalaraiko mengi.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ni lazima maslahi ya vibarua wanaokata miwa mashambani yaangaliwe. Naishukuru sector ya kilimo cha miwa kwa kuongeza idadi ya wafanyakazi. Lakini utaona kstas kwamba yale magari yanayowabeba wafanyakazi wa kukata miwa hayana bima. Utaona kwamba kokitokea ajali kama s ile iliyotokea hivi majuzi ambapo watu 15 walikufa hakuna bima kwa wale wanaokufa. Kwa hivyoyafaa s Waziri aliangalie jambo hili. IS Kuwapatia wafan;, kazi magari ya kuwabeba hadi kazini ni jambo ambalo huwawezesha watu kufanya kazi vizuri. Yafaa Waziri afanye mipango ili watu ia wawekewe bima.Kwa hayo machache naomba kuunga mkono</Newspeech> 	 <Newspeech>MR. MATHUBUTI: Ah saute sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipa nafasi hii ili kwanza nimpongeze Waziri wa Kilimo. Bw. Mwangale, kwa a kazi yake nzuri. Yeye ni Waziri anayimudu kazi yake. Ni matumaini yangu kwamba yeye atazidisha juhudi zake katika Wizara hii kuhakikisha kwamba Kenya ina chakula cha kutosha kuwa lisha watu na pia kuuzwa katika nchi za nje. Ni aibu kubwa kwa nchi hii kuagiza ngano kutoka Saudi Arabia na hali inajulikana kwamba. Kenya ni nchi ya Kilimo. Ni aibu kwa nchi isz. hii kununua mafuta ya nazi kutoka nchi ya Philippines. Sisi tunaweza kukuza nazi hapa nchini kwa wingi, Utaona kwa eneo lote 22 la Arabian. 2x2 Peninsula halina chakula cha kutosha. Wao hununua chakula kutoka nje. Utaona kwamba Kenya imebarikiwa na hali ya hewa ambayo inaiwezesha nchi hii kutoka chakula ambacho huuzwa katika Arabian Peninsula. Ni lazima Waziri aliangalie jambo hili kwa makini sana. Hii ni kwa sababu watu wa Lamu wanateseka sana kwa sababu hawawezi kuyauza mafuta yao ya nazi hapa nchi ni. Hii ni kwa sababu tunaagiza mafuta ya nazi kutoka kale Philippines ambayo huiangusha bei ya mafuta yetu ya nazi.Vile vile, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, mimi ni mmoja wawale walioenda kule Italy kutafuta pesa za kuanzisha kiwanda chakorosho, Kilifi, ambacho sasa kimefungwa na karibu watu 2000walinunuawameachishwa kazi. Wakati huo huo wakubwa korosho nakuzipeleka India zikasagwe na hali tuna mashine ambazo hazifanyi kazi 4hii ni aibu. harffcagfrra. kwenda kutafuta korosho ±a. Tanzania, Mozambique na Nigeria ambao walikataa kutusaidia. Kwa vile sasa Mtukufu Rais alitusaidia na Shs.30 million na ki wanda kimeanza kufanya kazi hatutaki kifungwe tena kwa sababu jambo hili linawatatiza wakulima; hata wengine hukoPwani walikuwa wameanza kungoa mikorosho yao.Tatizo lingine linahusu biashara ya matunda. Maembe mazuri zaidi ulimwenguni yanatoka lamu, Tana River na Malindi. Lakini tukileta maembe katika uwaiija wa ndege tunaambiwa hakuna nafasi ya kuyasafirishia hadi ngambo. Hii IEI. krc inafanyika kwa sababu ya maembe yanayotoka India. India ikiwa na maembe Wakenya huwa hawawezi kuuza maembe yao Hii ni kwa sababu Serikali ya India inawasaidia wakulima wake kulipia gharama ya usafirishaji na kuwatia moyo wakulima wake wapeleke maembe katika nchi ambazo hazina maembe. Ningeiomba Wizara kuwasaiaia wakulima wetu kugharamia usafirishaji wa maembe, ambayo ndiyo matunda tu yanayotoka Laiou. Wakati huu maembe mengi yanaoza ica. ksababu hatujui mahali pa kuyapeleka. Ingawa kuna kiwanda kimoja cha kusaga maembe kule Mtwapa, hakiwezi kuchukua maembe yetu yote.Vile vile ningetaka Waziri achunguzoei ya vyakula hapa nchini kwa sababu mshahara wangu ni tofauit na ule wa mpishi, dreva na yaya wangu. Kivi ma.iuzi bei ya sukari imeongezwa na kuwazaidi ya Shs.12/ na hali Waziri, ambaye earn mshara wake ni mkubwamno, ananunua sukari kva bei.sawa na wenye mishahara ya chini sanakama vileyapisisi, kx. na hii si haki. Tunajua 5a jambo hililinatokana na ongezeko la bei ya mafuta.

Hatutaki ifike wakati ambapo watu wetu hawawezi kulipa bei ya vyakula kwa sababu hii ikifanyika kutakuwa na ghasia j. kama ilivyokuwa huko Zambia, Misri na Nigeria na Amerika na Uingereza wataansa kutudharau.Mwisho, Ew. Naibu Spika wa Muda, nitaongea juu ya Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC). Tangu tupate uhuru miaka 27 iliyopita hakuna miru hata moja kutoka Lamu ambaye amepewa mkopo na AFC na hii ni kuonyesha Lamu ni kama. jimbo lilijitenga kutoka Kenya. Kila tunapoomba. mikopo tuhsitishwa hati za mashamba ha hali hati zinaweza kutolewa kwetu na Serikali. Watu wa Lamu wangepewa mikono bila ya masharti mengi kwa sababu ninajua hawangekosa kuilipa. Mwaka huu watu wa Lamu ndio wataongeza Jamhuri yetu katika utoaji pamba. Hii kwa sababu ginnery ya Lamu	inawadhamini wakulimakupewa mikopo na bertki, zilizoko huko Lanru. NingemwombaWaziri a one kwamba watu wa Lamu wanapata mikopo kutoka kwa AFC ili nao wajue kuna matunda ya UhuruKwa hayo machache, naunga mkono.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing  me to support the debate on the Vote of the Ministry of •Agriculture. First, I would like to congratulate this Ministry for ensuring that Kenyans are well-fed. We have not been going out of this country to seek foreign aid for food simply because we have failed to produce our own food; if we have ever done so, it must have been because of the weather, which we do not control. Credit goes to the President who has spearheaded a lot of activit.ie in this area. It was the. President who initiated a committee which worked out certain details for that industry, and the same applies to the coffee industry. So, I wanted to simply say that in this country we have leaders who really take care of the interest of the population.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, whereas we can say that we have been able to meet our food requirements and also maintain our strategic food reserve, our export sector has not expanded fast enough. We still rely on traditional agricultural crops like coffee and tea but have not been able to develop fast enough the production of crops like wheat. I am saying so because this country has good land and can produce enough wheat for satisfaction of our requirements and even a surplus for export. This is an area in which the Ministry should concentrate so that we  can have surplus wheat for export. When there is shortage, we are forced to import or seek aid from outsideand yet we have the land. Perhaps, what is lacking as one hon. Member 			said, is proper management and advise to the farmers. In this regard, I think the ministry has 	lot to do.	Pyre thrum farming is going on well and the ministry and Pyre thrum Board shouldbe able to expand its production in order to enable farmers earn more forthe development of this country. Agricultural officers should reach farmersand advice them on how best to produce this crop. Our farmers are enterprisingand they will be able to do a lot of work.I think the Ministry has not done enough in the production of cotton.The Ministry should put more a effort in the production of this commodityso that textile industries can have enough supplies for the production ofcloth for local consumption. The Cotton Board should ensure that we haveenough cotton in the country. Why can the Ministry not approach textilemanufacturers and ask them to support the production of cotton in various	places in terms of technical advice or finances? Textile mills should bein a position to manage some of these units in the cotton growing areas. It is pathetic to hear that cotton production in, phases like Bura Irrigation Schemehas gone down and yet a lot of money has been invested there in addition to technical manpower and machinery. The only problem here is lack of proper management and the inability of the Ministry to create an impact in the farmers minds.The other crucial area is the payment of farmers. If farmers supply produce and they are not paid on time, they will lose heart and will turn to better yielding crops. Therefore, paying farmers on time is very important. The Ministry should intervene and ensure that payment to farmers is not delayed.	If the Boards responsible do not have funds, they should seek support from theOffice of the Vice President and Ministry of Finance or get overdrafts from banks, vie cannot play with farmers and if we want them to produce, we must pay them	well and on time.  The cost of inputs has gone up the cost of petroleum products and yet the prices offered the farmers are not commensurate with the expenses they incur.Here in Kenya, we do not subsidize the farmer like other countries. For example, EEC country subsidises their farmers and that is why they have been able to produce so such food for local consumption and for export. We should look into this area. The question of taxation also comes in. For example the farmer is taxed at the rate of 5 per cent upon delivery whether he has earned profit or not. This is cumbersome.For example, in Uasin Gishu District, farmers are now preparing to harvest maize and wheat and yet the tax people have gone there to close their accounts and they cannot withdraw money for buying bags and so on. This is very bad indeed. Why can the Income Tax Department not go and ask the farmers how they want to pay the levy after harvesting their crops? We cannot allow this to happen and I would like to request the Ministry to look into this natter. Farmers will not continue producing if they will be frustrated from all angles.We were told that very soon the Agricultural Finance Corporation will become a farmers bank and we are waiting for its establishment. What is delaying its establishment? Farmers should be given loans on reasonable terms. There is a dangerous trend taking off the ground in Uasin Gishu Distric For example, AFC gets a court broker to attach a farmer’s machinery, such as, tractors, lorries, motor vehicles and so on, when he due to harvest his maize or wheat. What is the rationale of harassing these farmers? Where are they expected to get money from? These farmers should be allowed to sell their produce before they are asked to pay any outstanding loans to AFC. This is causing a lot of problems in Uasin Giehu District and I would request the Ministry to look into this natter so that farmers are not disturbed when they are preparing to deliver the goods. The officials of AFC should go to the farmers and ask them how they would like to pay the which may date backWe have the Lonrho Mushroom Production Unit in Uasin Gishu District near Eldoret which is doing a good job. We are now exporting a lot of fresh mushroom. The Ministry should step in and see if there can be a possibility of farmers engaging in mushroom farming. The local farmers can be suppliers of mushrooms to this processing plant. At the moment, it is only East African Tanning Extract Company which is producing this commodity and yet a large area around, there is capable of producing mushrooms. I would like to request the Ministry to find out where there are less costly tech¬nologies which the farmers can adapt so that they can also produce this crop.I would now like to talk about prices of farm machinery and inputs. I wonder what the Ministry is doing to ensure that prices of imported machinery are stabilized. We were told some years back that KGGCU was to assemble tractors locally and we do not know what has happened. We still have a lot of varieties of tractors corning into this country. Why can the Ministry not in conjunction with other Ministries look into the possibility of, at least, assembling some of these machinery and at the same time see whether it is possible to produce some of the spare parts locally In this way, we shall reduce expenses incurred in the purchase of spare parts and so on.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Habwera): ThankYou, Sir for giving me this chance to support this Motion. If it werepossible the Ministry of Agriculture should get a lot more money than theGovernment is able to provide. This is because, after security, the Ministryof Agriculture is the next most important Ministry in the country. This is because we feed from agriculture and we are able to sustain our economy.I would like to thank the Minister and his entire team for organising agriculture in such a way that we are able to feed ourselves. I would like to say that the Ministry should now move and put a lot of effort in the production of the following four crops. a lot more cotton than we are doing because our textile factories are hungry because we do not have enough cotton. It is a pity that we should be importing cotton. We should produce much more pyrethrum because the world market price is very good. We should also produce much more wheat for our consumption and for export. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, agriculture will for a long time remains the prime mover of our economy and therefore, we should concentrate on the development of agriculture in every way possible. How that the price of oil and everything else has gone up, the small scale farmer should turnto using the traditional methods of ox-ploughing and even using boma manure which is even more ideal for as crop growing than the present fertilisers like D.A.P which tend to weaken the soil when used over and over again. I would therefore like to appeal to all the farmers in this country to appreciate the fact that we are facing economic difficulties and worse still, that with the rising price of oil, the times ahead will be even more difficult. Therefore, everybody in the country should wake up to this kind of realization so that we can all concentrate all cur efforts to doing the best we can to produce enough, both for domestic consumption and for export.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to mention one other point and that is: now that we have the Kanu Review Committee Report, I think we as leaders, particularly in this House, should come out to assist Government in lowering our voices. I am saying this because this is not the time for attacking each other.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech> 	/The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Wabuge) left the Chair//Mr. Deputy Speaker resumed the Chair/<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: It is now time for the Mover to reply.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Mwangale): First of all, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank all hon. Members who had the chance to contribute to debate on this Vote, for their very constructive suggestions and ideas that they have given to us. I may not be able to respond to all the points or comments made by hor. Members, but I will endeavour to briefly go through some of them.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me first of all reiterate what I said when moving the Vote last week, and that IS. it IS vital if we have to continueto be self-sufficient in food, to be able to get enough support from hon.Members of this House. It is also important that other leaders like councillorsand Kanu officials continue to support the our extension staff in the field.It is very important that when we address our people in the field, we should be able to emphasize the diversity of our production in our farms. We must ensure that when farmers grow their crops, they also grow our traditional food crops, such as millet, sorgum, yams, sweet potatoes, cassava, beans and so on, so as to ensure that we have enough food all the time.Therefore, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Six, let me emphasize that our colleagues should continue to encourage the farmers to grow more and more of our traditional crops. I am saying this because our traditional food is easier to store and is not attacked by peats to the same extent as some of the other foods such as maize. Therefore, it is important that the policy of self-sufficiency which includes growing of our traditional crops is maintained. We should also grow bananas which are a very important ingredient in our diet. Bananas are a perenial crop which could assist us very much in times of drought, especially in certain areas which warm climate. I would like to encourage our farmers to be gar growing these crops and I hope that hon. Members will continue to support them.	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank hon. Members for making comments with regards to coordination between the various Ministries that are concerned with food production, for example, the Ministry of Livestock Development, the Ministries of water Development, Supply and Marketing, Reclamation of Arid, Semi Arid and Wastelands and Regional Development. All these Ministries have to work in a coordinated manner in order to ensure that we produce enough food for our country.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, many hon. Members made comments on the supervision of extension staff. I would like to thank hon. Members for their comments on this and would like to assure them that the national extension programme which has been going on for some time now has enabled us to have some vehicles. Therefore during the next programme which is starting next year we shall also be able to buy additional vehicles to enable ourstaff to visit the farmers under the programme, training and visit programmeMr. Deputy Speaker. Sir, I agree that we need to do more in this field andthat is why I brought with me here, the senior executives in the Ministryof Agriculture and parastals related to this Ministry in order to listento the views of hon. Members. I would like to assure them that       all hon. Members of this House will continue to assist  and advisetheme On the otherhand when these officials find certain extension officers not working as        they are supposed to do, please  you shouldlet us know. However, the programmes which we have put together in the Ministry in conduction with the district development committees are such that they will ensure the extension staff will perform much better. However, we shall always have problems in finances since we have never have enough money to be able to support the field staff because they need petrol in order to be able to move here and there. For this reason, we are now advising them to be using bicycles because we now have technical officers at as low level as the location level. The divisions are manned by very senior officers and we hope that those at the location level can be able to walk and cycle from farm to farm to advise the farmers.On the question of research, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Membersare aware that the Ministry of Research Science and Technology is now responsiblefor research work, but we liaise very closely with them and I am d±± delightedto say that the research that comes from our institutions are immediatelyapplied where possible into the field and we are cooperating fully with them.I would like to say that in the case of certain crops, such as cotton, sugarcanecashew nuts and so on, we are now in the process of looking for ways and meansto diversify this research. With regard to some of the cash crops like coffeeand tea, we have started research funds collected as cess from thecrop itself to diversify research work. We look forward to devising similar methods where we can start for example, the cotton research foundation fund so that research could be diversification   apply to sisal. With regards to irrigation in marginal areas, I again fully agree that 	 wrote of those loans, in February, 1989, and I remember that at that time, I was in this same post as Minister for Agriculture. We lost a lot of money, but we also recongnize that there is every need for us to find a way in which a farmer can be insured against crop losses. We are in the process now, as I said in my speech, of doing two things. We are restructing the Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC) so that we can provide a crop insurance scheme, so that if a farmer losses his crop due to a certain calamity; for example, drought or something else, he can claim through this crop insurance scheme, and we hope that that will come into being within the next year or so.We are also establishing an Agricultural Development Bank :(ADB)  The Agricultural Development Bank is not a replacement of the AFC. The AFC is going to continue in its form and providing the services that it has been providing and, perhaps, enhanced or restructured in order to strengthen it. The ADB will be a separate bank to support and give credit to farmers at an interest rate which, perhaps, will be determined by the Government and, hopefully they will be lower than the commercial rates.In the case of tractor hire service, I know, and we are all aware in the Ministry, that the number of tractors and harvesters in this country will never be enough. We agree also that in order for us to be able to be self-sufficient and produce a certain crop such as wheat for example, we have to find a way in which we can provide harvesters, especially harvesters with a smaller cutting length for the small scale farmers. If we are going to be self-sufficient in wheat the production has to come from the small scale farmers; we are aware of that. The Ministry has looked at the various machinery that are being supplied from countries overseas those that are manufacturing this type of equipment, and we hope that some of this equipment will be available. We were hoping that some of the institutions, such as the Kenya Grain Growers Cooperative Union (KGGCU) and the AFC will be able to buy this equipment and supply it to farmers. It is very important that we do supply this equipment. I hope that when we come back here next year we would be able to say, "Now we have at least a reasonable number of harvesters for wheat bought either through the AFC or through some other Government agencies, so that they can help the farmers in harvesting	We have a problem with tractors, but I do not want to turn round and tell you that we, as a Government, will be able to supply tractors to all the farmers in this country. I think it is important that we, as very senior Kenyans who are able to buy tractors, should do so in order to be able to hire them out. If a tractor for hire is available, the farmer is prepared to pay a reasonable price for it in order to prepare his land. We cannot provide all the necessary tractors and the Tractor Hire Scheme is only there to support farmers in producing more food up to a certain point. Beyond that point, however, we have to be self generative. So, we can only expand the Tractor Hire Scheme up to a given point. In places where we have supplied tractors, such as Busia and others, the results have been very encouraging, but we are saying that it is the private sector, individuals, cooperative societies and farmers themselves who should get together and buy tractors for both their own work and hire services. I believe that the hon. Members who are farmers here know that it is good business to hire out ones tractor to other fanners. We cannot say that we can sustain the Government1s effort in buying tractors and hiring them out as this will not be economical to us nor will work.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as for tea, I believe I answered most of the questions involved when I addressed members of the tea growing fraternity yesterday. The present decision to appoint a probe committee resulted in the restructuring of the Kenya Tea Development Authority (K.T.D.A.). As a result of this, I am glad to say that this restructuring is going on and the final payment that was made yesterday is the highest ever paid out. The more than Shs.1.7 billion that was paid to farmers yesterday is equivalent to the total payment that farmers received last year. This makes Kenya not only the highest producer of top qualitytea, but also the highest (inaudible) in terms of small holder production. Iwant to congratulate the President on the work he had done in this regard.We are in the process of establishing new factories in order to cope with the increased production of green leaf and the decision that have now been made will ensure that the tea industry does not fall back again. We are doingthe same in the case of coffee and the probe committee will hopefully be finishing its report in the next few weeks. Once this is done, we will restructure the coffee industry completely and the Coffee. Board of Kenya and the Kenya Planters Co—operative Union will ensure that farmers are paid their dues as promptly as possible. We want to ensure that the kind of mismanagement, excessive payment of salaries and wastage that has been going on in this industry are removed. I also want to ensure all my colleagues that the instructions that have come from the President are that we should ensure that from now on, the parastatal bodies that serve farmers there are many such bodies in the Ministry of Agriculture are tun efficiently and effectively and that overhead costs are not too heavy as to cause us to use some of this money carelessly to the extent that farmers are not paid their money properly.The Kenya Tea Development Authority is an example that we must remember. The total amount paid to farmers last year was only Shs.1.7 billion, but this year, they Eire going to earn more than Shs.2.8 billion and this is an enormous improvement. This applies not only to the Kenya Tea Development Authority, but to all other such parastatal bodies, such as the Pyrethrum Board of Kenya, which will expand to such an extent that Kenya remains the leader in pyrethrum production. The demand for pyrethrum worldwide is about 22,000 tones, but we are producing only about 11,000 tones. I would like to assure hon. Members that we will visit all pyrethrum—producing areas to encourage farmers to plant the crop because it pays very well.This also applies to cashew nuts. Some hon. Members have talked about this crop and I want to assure them that the cashew nut industry is in the process of being revitalised. If I may say this on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Supplies and Marketing, we are buying cashew nuts and the Government has already set aside the first Shs.10 million, which is being used in the purchase of cashew nuts. Farmers are supplying cashew nuts and we want to increase the processing of the crop. When we do this, the industry will improve and we hope that the problems that have been facing the industry will not recur.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to mention cotton very briefly. Again, I want to assure hon. Members that the Act that was passed by this House, especially in respect of the auctioning of cotton, will change the entire industry. Firstly, we want to ensure that the farmer is paid for his cotton deliveries. We are going on with the purchase of cotton. Today, the Managing Director of the Cotton Lint and Seed Marketing Board is in western Kenya. We are buying cotton in such areas as Tana River. We have set aside enough money for this purpose and the system is being reorganized so that the cotton farmer may see that the actual world market prices fluctuate just like the prices of tea and coffee. Farmers will be paid on the basis of the quality of their cotton and when the price goes up, they will benefit. However, what is even more important is that they will be paid their money as promptly as possible.Some hon. Members have correctly pointed out that this country should not continue to import edible oil, such as coconut oil or palm oil because we areable to produce all the required edible oil in this country. I assure mycolleagues that action is being taken in the Ministry to implement certain programmes and if I will still be the Minister for Agriculture next year, when I come to move my Ministry’s Vote, the problem of edible vegetable oils will have been dealt with up to a certain point. We implement certain programmes that have been lying fallow in the Ministry and in the Government for too long now. This does not apply only to edible oils, but also to many other important oils. At the moment, we are now importing about Shs.2 billion worth of edible oils. If we stop this importation by producing these oils here, we will save this money in the form of foreign exchange.We are also determined to ensure that the horticultural industry plays its part not only in terms of generation of employment opportunities or foreign exchange earning but also in the indigenization of the business.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to assure hon. Members that the officers present here today are here because we want to assure the House that there will be changes that will be taking place shortly even in the horticultural industry. We want to ensure that the industry expands rapidly. As hon. Members have suggested, we are going to construct storage and warehousing facilities in certain strategic areas to ensure that farmers are: able to harvest their horticultural produce and store them and be transported without any problems. We are going to construct warehouses and wholesale markets in Nairobi, Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret and Kisumu. We are also going to construct a cold storage and warehousing facility in Sagana. We want to do that because we believe that this country has the opportunity to take advantage of our very good strategic geographical position to be able to supply all the food required in the1 Middle East and other countries in Europe and within the PTA countries. We are also strategically placed by virtue of having a country that is peaceful and that has leaders like: you, Sir, supporting the Government. We are able to control the economies of all these countries from here1, and I have no doubt that with the leadership we have in our President, if we all work in unity, this country will not only be self-sufficient in food but that we will be able to export surplus food of all types, including rice. We should be exporting rice and wheat to our neighbours instead of importing the crops. We should also be exporting edible oils, cassava and other foodstuffs.Sir, there are many other industries in which we can excel. The key to this is the same consistency and support that has been given to the President, his Government and to Kenya in general. If we can continue to do so and this country remains peaceful, then we can achieve a lot.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to conclude by commending about what many hon. Members have talked about, that is, the kind of donor agreements that we have, where donors agree to give us so much money. Sometimes we havenever. I want to appeal to my fellow Ministers and permanent secretaries thatbefore we sign any of these agreements it is good to know exactly how much of the amount of money that is coming to us will eventually get into the pockets of our people or what amount will really reach the rural folk. We have now examined a lot of these donor funded projects. We have been told that a certain country has given us so much millions, but when you count the amount of money that remains in the country, it is not more than five per cent or 10 per cent of the money. The rest goes back in the form of technical assistance, salaries and all sortsof things. We want to make sure that when we sign any technical agreements orwe accept any assistance from these donor communities we do so after examining every aspect properly. If it is not useful to us, then we should be able to reject it.Sir, I wish to take this opportunity to thank all hon. Members for the suggestions they have given us. I am sure that my Assistant Ministers and also the officials from the Ministry have benefited from the recommendations made by hon. Members. I want to welcome all hon. Members to feel free to come to the Ministry and give us advice. We are there all the time: and you do not need an appointment to come to our Ministry. As a Member of Parliament, you just walk in and when you are there we will welcome you in and talk. It is our business to ensure that this country remains self-sufficient in food and that we can export the1 surplus.With those few remarks, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.</Newspeech>

MAKHANU: Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker for giving me this opportunity to make a few observations regarding the votes that we have considered in the Committee of Supply. Generally, there are certain projects that have been funded by the Norwegian .Agency for Development(KORAD) and while thanking the Government for the action it has taken to severe our diplomatic relations with Norway, I would like to urge Government to look for alternative sources to fund these projects. I am saying so because there are projects in Bungoma, Turkana arid so on, which were being funded by NORAD and while supporting the Government move, I would like to appeal to ±j± it to look for alternative sources to complete these projects.Secondly, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I notice none of the votes that we have considered ha$.: any provision for the Office of the Controller General (Corporations). Perhaps we could be given some explanation as towhere this Office is going to get funds to run its operations. This is avery important Government department and therefore there ought to have been a provision made for running its services.Mr. Deputy Speaker, with regards to the other votes that we have passed, I would like to make some comments on</Newspeech>     <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Biwott): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I think I am able to anticipate what hon. Biwott	Is unhappy about. It is simply that it is most inappropriate at this stage	to allow debate on the general resolution and I hope Mr. Makhanu does realise	that. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Biwott): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I think the comments made by the hon. Member should not be allowed to go unchallenged. First of all, I think the comment about NORAD is tantamount to assisting our enemies more than our country. Let it be known that Kenyans cannot be bought with money and Kenyans will never regret not getting any money that is given with certain strings attached, we are a dignified country and we shall therefore never cry over money which, in fact does not help this country very much. If you look at what the Norwegians have been giving Kenya, you would find that a greater part of it goes towards the payment of salaries for their own personnel and this is money that never benefits our country. I was hoping that hon. Members were going to discuss that issue. I think there is a Motion which will be broughtTto this House on this issue so that wananchi may know the truth regardingChow much we are getting from Norway.Mr. Deputy Speaker, there should not be any Kenyan worth of his salt who should cry. over the departure of the Norwegians from this country. Once these relations are broken, they are broken and we do not have to regret about this at all. There was also another misleading statement by hon. Makhanu about the Auditor General (Corporations) This Department appears under the Office of the President and money for it has been voted under his Ministry.If the hon. Member would care to go through the Estates, he would find that a provision has already made for this department. So, he should not make a statement which is likely to cause some kind of misunderstanding.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MALABE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, now that the House is going	to approve funds for use by the Ministries, it is my sincere hope that someof the projects whose completion has been it will be given	   the first priority. However, we do know that sometimes Treasury delays the issuance of these money to the Ministries. There are cases where money voted for a particular Ministry could not he used because it could not be remitted by the Treasury. So, I hope that this money will be remitted to the Ministries so that it could be used for completing the unfinished projects.</Newspeech> (Question put and agreed to)<Header>ADJOURNMENT</Header><Newspeech>MR.

EKIDOR, on behalf of Mr. Kfcbo, asked the Minister for Energy when	the Eldoro	 Area be provided with electricity under the	rural electrification programme as per theTaita Taveta D.D.C. recommendation.	<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Moturi) :Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Eldoro area will be provided with electricity under theRural Electrification Pragramme after(1)	The Government completes works on the present top  priorities which include works in Wundanyi Division and at theMwakitau  Taveta  Loitokitok project.(2)	Sufficient funds become available for further works in the district.(3)	The hon. Member may wish to refresh his mem6ory on the content of an answer  I gave to a similar Question No. 159 on	Wednesday, 13th July, 1988.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Can the Assistant Minister tell the Housespecifically the year which the funds will be available for ruralelectrification will it be this financial year or next financialyear?given as cultured by the District Commissioner Taita Taveta. Thetop priorities for the rural electrification in the district have been completion of the Taveta Project. It has to be completed	before we move to  new projects. Number two is the supply of werugua a and		Musau Centres in Wundanyi Division with Electricity		Both priorities are currently being attended to by theKenya	Power and Lighting Company and So, far the Government hasincurred an expenditure of approximate  Kshs . 12  onWundanyi project Supply of electricity to the Eldorot area in Taveta constituencywill, therefore, be considered after the current District DevelopmentCommittee (DDC) priorities are met and this will be subject toavailability of funds.The earliest period of supplying the Eldorot area couldpossibly be during the 1992/1993 financial year.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: This seems as if it will take a long time.What immediate plans does the Ministry have as a matter of urgencyfor supplying electricity to this area?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

WASIKENDOMBI on behalf of Mr. Kiliku, asked the Minister for Labour why the management of Tudor Security Services Limited, Mombasa, terminated the services of Mr. Julius Ouma Olel on 8th September, 1989.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. D.M. Amin): Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Mr. Julius Ouma Olel was employed as a guard in March, 1989on .a monthly pay prior to which he was working as a casual labour. On6th September, 1989, while on guard duty, he left his place of workat 1.00 p.m. without permission. On his return it was discovered thatat some 35bags of maize had been stolen, possibly, by the owners of thelorries that were bringing in maize and taking, away unga flour. Hisabsence and the subsequent loss was treated by the management as grossmisconduct and negligence of duty and caused his immediate dismissal.He complained at the Mombasa Labour Office and, after intervention bythat Office, he was paid a total of Ksh.1,0007 broken down as follows.Wages up to 5th September, 1989  Ksh.332.85Five months leave	 Ksh.257.40Uniform deposit	 Ksh.240.00Ex-gratia	 Ksh.170.00Mr. Olel wrote a statement on 6th September, 1989 admitting that he left his place of work without the managements consent and the case was treated as misconduct contrary to Section 17 of the Employment Act.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. WASIKENDOMBI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has informed the House that Mr. Olel was dismissed because he was absent for one day and yet the Employment Act provides forseven consecutive days without reasonable cause as the number of days one can stay out before being dismissed. Can the Assistant Minister clarify to this House how the employer came to make all those payments if Mr. 01 el was a casual employee?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, these payments were made after it was found that the employee had been absent from duty without, any permission. After consultations with the Mombasa Labour Officer, and as per Section 17 of the Employment Act, it was decided to pay such an amount and terminate his services.</Newspeech> Question No. 542Payment of Mr. Pi 1is Invigilation Claims MR.KIILU on behalf of Mr. Lewa, asked the Minister for Education what has delayed the payment of the invigilation claims for Mr. Francis Mwatata Pili, T.S.C.

Is it in order for him to do so?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Karauri, you must realise that you obviously trying to incur the wrath of the Back benchers, at least, what I am addressing your mind to that point of order. Customarily, Member of the Front bench answer Questions from the dispatch docks, but any hon. Member is free to talk from wherever, like hon. Karauri is trying to do. However, when you depart from the normal practice, hon. Member are likely to feel concerned. I do not know whether you will choose continue from where you are, hon. Karauri.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thought I would be wasting the time of the House by to walk all the way to the Front bench, as I was seated here consulter Dr. Wameyo here.

MIS0I asked the Minister for Lands and Housing what plans the Ministry has to facilitate immediate and planned development of Kesses Centre in Uasin Gishu  District.		"<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND HOUSING (Mr. Mutiso):Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Ministry, through the Department of Physical Planning, hasalready prepared a physical development plan for Kesses Centre. The planwas prepared in 1988 and the reference number is ELD 120/88/1.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while I thank the AssistantMinister for the information to the effect that a plan for the developmentof the Centre has been prepared, is he aware that there is a tug-of-warbetween the people whose land fall within the Centre and those outsidewho would like to have their plots in the Centre, too? What is he doingto reconcile those differences? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MUTISO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if I may enlighten theHouse on the position of this place, I am sure this wi11 give sufficientinformation. Kesses Centre is located within Kesses Kalenjin Farm,LR. No.9621 in Uasin Gishu District. The Centre is about five kilometresfrom the Moi University and about 30 kilometres from Eldoret Municipality.The farm was bought in 1958 from a European farmer by 120 shareholders.Since then the number of shareholders has increased to 207. The farmwas subdivided the same year and 12 acres were set aside for the Centre There have been disagreements in the farm, especially from those who did not get land at the farm. Those disagreements have hindered Government efforts to survey the farm, due to the proximity of the farm to the Moi University, it is anticipated that most of the University workers will seek accommodation at Kesses Centre. The 12 acres were donated by the shareholders and the amount of land donated varies from 0.05 hectares to 2.0 hectares, the perimeter boundary of the Centre has been estab¬lished as per development plans prepared by the Physical Planning Department. The District Survey, Uasin Gishu also picked the boundaries of the plots of each shareholder outside the area set aside for the Centre. What remains now is to adjust all the plot boundaries picked by the District Surveyor in accordance with the amount of land each member donated for the establishment of the township. When that exercise is completed and every member with an interest is settled, the survey of the township will be undertaken by the Survey Department. Kesses Centre is one of the trading centres which have already been planned and whose development will be regularized as soon as survey work is completed. However, there are a few administrative issues which have to be sorted out by the Provincial Administration before survey work commences.</Newspeech> Question No. 470Payment of Mr. Dzombo's Death GratuityMRS.

DEPUTY SPEAKER: Still nobody from the Ministry? Let usgo back to Mr. Chepkok's Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I ask my QuestI would like to apologise for coming in late.</Newspeech>Question No. 512<Header>Payment of Compensation to Mr. Kimaiyo</Header>MR. CHEPK0K asked the Minister for Livestock Development, since the District Veterinary Officer, Iten treated cattle for a Mr. James Kimaiyo of P.). Box 374, Iten, with expired drugs resulting in the death of the said animal on 23rd July, 1990, what arrangements the Ministry is making to pay compen¬sation to the complainant as follows:-i) Price of the animal	- Ksh.8,500/-ii) Cost of drugs	- Ksh. 750/-iii) Hire of transport	- Ksh.- 200/-<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Dr. Wekesa) Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, first of all I beg to apologise for coming inlate, and beg to reply.The Government has no obligation to pay for this animal.CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the man in question is an employee of the Government and if an officer of the Government, in the person of a veterinary officer, dispensed expired drugs for his cown and it died, what can the owner of the cow now do?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WEKESA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the information I have is that the Veterinary Officer, Iten did not use expired drugs on this particular animal. However, he called on the farmer, because the animal was having difficulties in giving birth. They found out that the animal had been under labour for about 48 hours causing the animal to be very weak, as it was under shock. He did all that he could to treat the animal according to the professional ethics and, unfortunately, the animal died four days later.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is misleading the House as I know the farmer in question, who lives just near my residence. I took the man to the Vete¬rinary Officer to come and treat the cow. I even have the expired drugs and the Assistant Minister cannot, therefore, continue misleading the House. He has not given the House an appropriate answer. Can he now say whether the Government will compensate that man, or not?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WEKESA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member seems to be excited and I do not know the reason why. The truth of the matter is that the animal was under labour, which we call difficult calving, and this is a very usual problem. The farmer usually tries to help the animal before he goes to sunmon the veterinary officer. This farmer like all of us, tried to assist his animal and, in so doing, he caused a lot of damage to the uterus of the animal. This detail was found out on examination by the two veterinary surgeons Who called on the farmer and they found out that the uterus of the animal Was perforated and the vulva was very much enlarged. This usually causes shock in an animal.The animal died later on as a result of the damage caused by this particular farmer. Had the farmer left the animal alone when he found . out that it was about to deliver, and gone straight to the veterinary surgeon, the situation would have been saved. As it were, so much damage was caused and .the drugs that were left behind were antibiotics. It is not true that the antibiotic had expired.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I would really hate to differ with my friend, hon. Chepkok at the risk of getting into problem's but, I think, I have a point to seek clarification on. I heard him say that an expired drug was used on this animal and hon. Chepkok has further declared that he has the same drug with him. I fail to understand how the drug could have been used on the animal and yet hon. Chepkok is still having it with him. I am at a loss here.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Yes, Mr. Chepkok.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, what I was saying is that I have the bottle from which the drug was dispensed, and it is the actual bottle with half of the drug still in it. The man reported the matter to the police. Even the District Commissioner is aware of the issue, as does the District Veterinary Officer. . They are fully aware that the person who treated the cow made a mistake. How could the Assist¬ant Minister get such wrong information for the House? After about two days of the aborted labour, the officer went back again and treated the cow with the expired drug and, thee after, it died. The Assistant Mini¬ster is also claiming that there were two surgeons, while there was only one surgeon. How did he obtain the replies he is giving here? Is this not "cooked" information?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MIS0I: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Hon. Chepkok has told us that the drug administered to the cow was expired. First of all, he has not told us the name of the drug and when it was manufactured so that we can determine when it was supposed to have expired. The Assistant Minister has told us that the veterinary surgeon carried out his work and, apparently, the farmer had tried to assist his cown in delivery but, in the end, the cow died. This House would be interested to know the particular drug administered and whether the drug was bought from a private pharmacy, or from a Government source. At the same time, let us be told whether, if there was a post-mortem done by the surgeons, the cause of death was determined and who was, therefore, responsible. Whoever was responsible, we should be told.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WEKESA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I can see that the Govern¬ment has a lot of supporters on this particular question. The two hon. Members who have raised supplementary questions last have supported me. I am glad, also, to say that Mr. Chepkok does actually agree that the operation was successful. The operation was made because it was the only way out. The veterinary surgeon who operated on the animal found that the uterus was perforated. That usually causes infection of the inner membranes in the abdomen and, usually, if the cow dies, the result of the cow is said to be peritonisis (?). I would agree with my hon. colleague, who is a vete¬rinary surgeon, who says that we would like to see this drug that had expired if hon. Chepkok would be So kind as to lay it on the Table of the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Well, Mr. Chepkok.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, let the Assistant Minister not beat about the bush. I will produce the drug and lay it on the Table of the House tomorrow. It actually expired in 1988. According to the person who administered the drug, he accepted that he made a mistake, and he made this confession before the District Commissioner. How can the Assistant Minister then come to the House with a misleading answer?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WEKESA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is a highly technical matter and I do not see how the District Commissioner comes into it. In any case, if there was any gross misconduct by the veterinary officer, he should have been given a chance to carry out a post-moterm on this parti¬cular animal, it would have helped the farmer in his quest for payment in form of compensation.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I know from the Assist¬ant Minister if the calf that was born after the uterus was found raptured is alive or was born dead?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WEKESA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am really lost here. The hon. Member is a medical person and should know from simple physiology that 48 hours after the animal had been labouring, the calf could not be alive. It must have died a long time ago.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, under the circumstances, the Assistant Minister is right that the calf would be dead, if the uterus was found raptured and the animal was found exhausted so that even the drug that was being administered would have been of no use at all.</Newspeech>(applause)<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Dr. Wameyo, I will allow Dr. Wameyo to get away with that, but I had given him the Floor to put a question, but he made a statement.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, even if the cow died because of the expired drug, the fact remains that it is wrong to have expired drugs at all. Now that the Ministry has been informed of that kind of situation of expired drugs, what action is he going to take to discipline the officer concerned in that case?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER.: Would you also tell the House the name of the drug, in response to Dr. Misoi's supplementary question?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WEKESA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the drug was an anti-biotic Called Combiotic. I do agree it is a serious matter for an expireddrug to be used to try and cure any disease. However, in fact, in this particular case, the drug had not expired.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are dealing with a very important, not only in the livestock industry but, also, for all of us, as human beings. The question of the animal having died is highly suspect. We cannot get an answer here. First of all there was no post-moterm done and, secondly, a non-professional person had tampered with the labour exercise. So, even if we leave that aspect, the question here still remains whether an expired drug was used. This is because this type of antibiotic could be parallel to the antibiotics used on human beings. Can the Assistant Minister now confirm or deny that the drug had expired? If the answer is in the affirmative, when did the drug expire, which pharmacy had sold such a drug, which had expired?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WEKESA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the date of expiry of the drug was shown as September, and the animal was treated in July.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. JULY: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are at a loss here. The hon. Member who asked the Question stands by his contention that the drug had expired and the Assistant Minister categorically denies that. Now, who is telling us the truth? Could we be in order to ask hon. Chepkok to produce that expired drug and put it on the Table so that it can be determined who I telling the truth between the two of them?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Chepko, you insist that that was an expired drug. What makes you have that conviction?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will bring that drug in the afternoon and lay it on the Table of the House. However, if it is determined that the drug had expired, what is the Assistant Minister going to do?</Newspeech><Newspeech>WEKESA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Chepkok is free to lay the expired drug on the Table but, with all the sympathies to him, it is very difficult for him to prove that it is the actual drug that was used in this particular case.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am talking about a layman in my constituency who through the encouragement of the Ministry to buy grade cows, managed to raise the money to do so at Ksh.8,500/ per cow. Later on he called a surgeon to come and treat his cow. Is there any other place he could have bought such a drug? He even later went to the District Commissioner who, in turn called in the police. The officer who administered the drug confessed that he had made a mistake to have so treated that cow. Is the Assistant Minister in order to tell me that I cannot prove that the drug is the actual one used on that cow?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Very well, Mr. Chepkok. You will then have to bring the drug here for the inspection by hon. Members.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Since hon. Chepkok insists that he has the expired drugs, and there is also a police report to that effect, could he be asked to produce that police report and the drug?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have the drug with me, but I can bring the police report any time next week. There is no problem with that. I will also bring the report from the District Commissioner.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: All right. Let us have Mr. Lotim'sQuestion, for the second time.</Newspeech>Question No. 556<Header>Tea Growing Possibility in Kapenguria</Header>MR. LOTIM asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he could consider initiating feasibility studies to establish the viability of growing tea in Siyoi, Talan, Chepkono and Kapkanyar Sub-locations in Kapenguria constituency.<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Nobody still from the Ministry of Agriculture</Newspeech>We will defer the Question then.(Question deferred)Question No. 532Rehabilitation of Msambweni and Kikoneni Water ProjectsMR. ARTE, on behalf of Mr. Mwamzandi, asked the Minister for Water Development, since the water supply to Msambweni . and Kikoneni Water .Projects is no longer reliable, what measures the Ministry is taking to rehabilitate the projects.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Mweu): Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.My Ministry intends to drill and equip another borehole</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Hon.Mwamzandi had given hon. Arte the mandate to ask his Question on his behalf.When the Question was	Asked for the first time, the Assistant Minister wasnot here to answer the Question. Now, when he is. asked to apologise for coming in late, he says the one asking the Question is not hon. Mwamzand Is he in order to do that?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Mweu): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I answer the Question, I beg to apologise for coming in late. I however did not know that hon. Arte, my friend, had been given the responsibility of asking the Question on behalf of hon. Mwamzandi. However, I beg to reply.My Ministry intends to drill and equip another borehole for Msambweni Water Supply. Meanwhile arrangements are being finalised to increase pumping hours from 10 to 12 and eventually to 14. As for the Kikoneni Water Supply, negotiations'are at an advanced stage for re¬allocation of funds to buy two modern pumps to replace the old and unreliable pumps at the intake.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ARTE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, sir, while appreciating the reply by the Assistant Minister, can he tell us what arrangements they have so far made to get the funds for the project?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. MWEU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, sir, here I would like the hon. Member to clarify as there are two issues; namely the Msambweni and Kikoneni projects. Which one is he talking about?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ARTE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am talking about the Msambweni project.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWEU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the temporary solution to the problem is that we are looking for funds for the rehabilitation to be used for that purpose.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ARTE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister says that, they are looking for those funds but, so far, what action have they taken to get those funds, and where are they expecting to</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWEU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, rehabilitation funds are with the Ministry. That is why I am saying that we are going to use that money for rehabilitation to be able to repair the pumps.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ARTE: Now that the Assistant Minister has confirmed that there is money in the Ministry, when are they starting to do the rehabilitation? Is that tomorrow, or on what date? The case is very urgent, as can be seen.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MWEU: As soon as possible, Mr. Deputy Speaker, sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ARTE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. They say water is life. Can the Assistant Minister be specific about the dates of implementation? As soon as possible means when? If the money is there, the work should commence immediately.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWEU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I cannot give a definite date. The hon. Member should trust the Ministry. I have said we have the money for rehabilitation work and it is only a question of using this money for that purpose to repair the machinery.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ARTE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. We insist that water is life. The hon. Assistant Minister has stated here that the Ministry has that money for rehabilitation. Why can the action required not be taken immediately?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWEU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I appreciate that water is life and that is why I am alive. However, I am assuring the hon. Member t.hat we have the money and the repairs will be carried out. So, it is a question of time. I cannot say tomorrow or the day after. We are doing the best we can within the Ministry and will implement what is being requested in the shortest time possible.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we thank the Assistant Minister for categorically stating that there is money for that work within the Ministry. However, the people in that area are awaiting to see water supply and it would be, useful if the Assistant ,Minister	could tell us when the implementation will start. The people want to see the water tanks repaired so that they can store water. So, if the money is there, when is the repair work going, to commence? I believe that there are technicians for this type of job and, even the required spare parts, I am sure, are available.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWEU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is only yesterday when we were given authority to use the rest of the money in the vote. This is the money I am talking about. As soon as we have sorted out the Autho¬rity to Incur Expenditure, we are going to release the money to the Dist¬rict Water Engineer who is going to rehabilitate the machines. That is what I am trying to inform the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. P.G. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we appreciate the fact that the money was voted only yesterday. However, this is not a sudden even. The Ministry knew that the money was forthcoming and, therefore, should have had forward planning. When did the Ministry plan to rehabilitate this project in its forward planning?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWEU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are labouring a point I think I have already covered. I said that the Ministry has plans to repair these machines. It is our problems and I have assured the House that the Ministry is going to rehabilitate the machines. I cannot say things I cannot stand by tomorrow. All I am saying is that the machines are going to be repaired. It is a question of time, as the money is there.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WABUGE: Since the Assistant Minister has admitted that this money is available, could he tell the House how much money is going to be spent in the rehabilitation of the pump? Could he issue a local purchase order for the repair of this pump with immediate effect?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWEU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I cannot say how much money this is because the people who will repair the pump Eire our own technicians. So, it is not easy to say how much money will be involved in this work, but we have the necessary money.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.G. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, is the Assistant Minister in order to say that he does not know the amount of money required? How did the Ministry allocate the funds without knowing how much money was required?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWEU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have a Vote for the rehabilitation of such pumps which caters for all sorts of repairs in provinces and districts. Therefore, it is not easy to say how much money is required for a given project.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MIS0I: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is telling us that the Ministry has plans to repair XYZ water pump. If this is so, the Ministry knows what is wrong with this pump and how much money is required in each case. Is he in order not to disclose the amount of money required in this particular case?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWEU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to repeat that I am unable to say how much money is required for this repair, but we know the problem involved because we know what parts of the pumping unit are out of order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ARTE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Could the Assistant Minister tell us what the estimated cost of repairing this pump is?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWEU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is the same question I have answered. I have said that I do not know how much money is needed in this case.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, We are used to Ministers telling us that projects will be implemented when funds are available. This Assistant Minister  is in a very strong position because the necessary money is available. However, is in a very strong it is not the Assistant Minister himself who will carry out the said repair this officers. Could you so and consult thoseofficers so that you may come back here and tell us when this project will be implemented?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER-FOR LANDSHOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Mutiso): On a point, of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Did you notice that hon. P.K.. Kinyanjui addressed the Assistant Minister directly?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWEU: Yes, he did, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.I am not going to consult the said officers; instead, I am going to instruct them on what to do. The operative word here is "instruct".</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FAI.ANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Assistant Minister seems not to know quite a number of the things he has been asked about because he keeps on saying, "I do not know." Could he go back to his office, learn these things, and then come back to tell the House what he knows?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr.Mweu, you realise that it is absolutely basic for you to be able to assist hon. Members in knowing, at least, the estimated cost of repairing the broken water pump. I would have expected you to address yourself to this fact around which most of these supplementary questions seem to revolve.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWEU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it may not be difficult to get the required estimated cost. I promise to bring this answer here later.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ARTE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Assistant Minister has told us that plans for the repair of Kikoneni Water Project are at an advanced stage. Could he tell us what plans these are and what exact stage they have reached?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWEU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have four water pumps in this project, two at the intake point and the other two at the treatment works. The first two are the ones that are faulty because they are below standard and have been breaking down frequently, thus making them uneconomical to run. So, what the Ministry is doing is to buy two other pumps to replace those that are not performing well.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ARTE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the hon. Assistant Ministertell us whether his Ministry has ready cash for the purchase of the two modernpumps that he is talking about?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWEU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have this money.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

I wonder whether it is in order for the hon. Member to ask a Question by Private Notice on behalf of his colleague.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: That is out of order.</Newspeech><Header>Repatriation of Illegal Immigrants in Marsabit</Header> <Newspeech>MR. FALANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Home Affairs and National Heritage the following Question by Private Notice, (a) Is the Minister aware that a total of 640 Ethiopian refugeeshave been settled within the compound of St. John's Primary School, Marsabit?(j)	Since Marsabit is a border town, could the Minister make immediate arrangements to transfer these refugees to gazetted camps elsewhere in the. Republic?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL HERITAGE(Mr. Lalampaa): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(j)	I am aware that there are 648 persons who have crossed the Kenya-Ethiopia border into Kenya seeking asylum and that they have been provided with temporary accommodation in a plot adjacent to St. John's Primary School in Marsabit. This is a temporary measure and the refugees will return to their country when the situation there returns to normal.(j)	Marsabit town is within the acceptable distance in accordance with the International Conventions and Protocols governing this matter.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like the hon. Assistant Minister to treat this issue with all the seriousness it deserves. These are refugees, and Marsabit is a very small town which has become a' refugee town because 600 or 700 refugees are very noticeable there. As the Assistant Minister has accepted, these refugees have been settled in a primary school, having been moved out from a police station where they had been staying for three or four months. This move has endangered our district security because we do not even know the identity of these persons from across the border. We do not eveniknow whether they are genuine refugees or spies. When we complained about this matter, these people were moved from the police station to a primary school. Iwrote a letter on the issue to the Permanent Secretary Office of the President, 	the Ministry of Home Affairs and National Heritage,	Provincial Commissionerand the District Commissioner concerned.</Newspeech>			<Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: What is your question.  Ask your question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: In settling these people where they are  now, did thoseconcerned consider the moral and social effect this move would have on these Nyayo children. These refugees are idle in the school. Did those who made this move know that there are no toilet facilities in the place where these refugees are now settled? It is raining at the moment and their shit is all washed down into the nearby river whose water wananchi use for drinking.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon. Falana. You are quite obviously deeply involved in what you are saying and, in the process, you are even using four letter words. Why do you not put one question at a time?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Had the Ministry or the authorities who did it considered the moral and social impact the refugees' conduct would have on the Nyayo kids?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LALAMPAA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to answer part of the earlier supplementary question by the hon. Member for Saku and assure him that my Ministry and the entire Government is very much concerned about the refu¬gee's and the wananchi in that area. Let me assure him also that I am sending out a team of officers from the Ministry headquarters to Marsabit tomorrow to see the district commissioner and to be given a plot away from the said school. The hon. Member is most welcome to join the officials of the Ministry so that they can have discussions to gether; the officials have instructions to that effect.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. MAKAU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. In view of:the problem that refugees have started creating in countries like Rwanda</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon. Makau. What is your point of order?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKAU: Mr. Deputy Speaker,Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell us what methods they are using to ensure that these are genuine refugees if the camp they are in, and which is not gazetted, is not properly under the supervision of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees? What criterion are they using to know that these are genuine refugees?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LALAMPAA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure hon. Makau and the whole House that the Government has adequate machinery to detect genuine refugees in this country.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>DR. MISOI: On a point of order. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The issuewhich has been highlighted here, especially the interaction between the refugees of dubious types of unknown character being put together in a compound where you have innocent young children, is very serious indeed. Does the Ministry have any guideline's on where to place just settled here and there? If those guideline's are there, why were' they not followed until these people we're mixed in a school compound, therefore disturbing the studies of the students?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LALAMPAA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure hon. (Dr) Misoi that the Government is very much concerned about both refugee's and wananchi in that area. Let me inform the House once again that the Government will be taking away the refugee camp from the plot that is adjucent to St. John's Primary School. At the moment, the refugee's are not even mixed with the primary school kids. Hon. Falana can rest assured that that camp will be taken away from the primary school.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Mutiso): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I have noticed that the two previous supplementary questions which have been asked by the: last two hon. Members were disguised as points of order. How can questions be asked on the pretext of points of order? Hon. Members should catch the Speaker's eye for them to ask supplementary questions rather than stand up on matters that are not points of order,</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKAU: Mr.Deputy Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to get a clarification from the Chair whether it is the Speaker who decides what is a point of order or a question or it is an hon. Member of the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I think Mr. Mutiso has taken note of what Mr. Makau has said and that Mr. Makau has also noted the concern by Mr. Mutiso.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI: Mr. Deputy -Speaker, Sir, on a supplementary question, I beg to remind the hon. Assistant Minister that he has avoided to answer Dr. Misois question on what policy the Govern lent has on settling refugee's in this country. That is what we want to know.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LALAMPAA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have a very clear policy regarding refugees in this country. We have the United Nations High Commissioner 	of refuges in this country, whose office is dealing with that matter. In factofficials of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees will be accompanying my officers tomorrow to Marsabit to discuss the matter with the Marsabit District Commissioner. Mr. Falana and other hon. Members from that area are also welcome to participate in those discussions.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister tell the: House the criteria used to settle the refugees in a primary school? Is that a primary school or a refugee camp?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LALAMPAA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure hon. Ekidor that the refugees are not settled in the primary school but rather on a plot that is just adjucent to the school. We are in the process of moving the camp away from the primary school.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we had a previous problem with refugees but we were assured that they we're in transit. In 1977 a family of between 30 and 40 refugees were, settled in Badasa area, Marsabit District, which is a very arable land. Those families are there up to now and they have been allocated plots to cultivate and they have been provided with water to carry out irrigation farming when Kenyans have no water to drink. The residents there are placed at the mercy of refuges. Kenyans go to the refugee camp, with water cans and borrow water and, in most cases, they are denied water to drink. Can the Assistant Minister a sure this House that the same issue will not arise where we may be told that these1 refugees are in transit only to find them being settled there for good? How temporary is this temporary settlement?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LALAMPAA: Mr. deputy Speaker, Sir, the settlement of the refugees at the place in question is really temporary. I can assure the House that those refugee's are not going to be settled like the ones who were settled in Badasa.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ARTE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Can the hon. Assistant Minister tell us whether Marsabit is a gazetted settlement for refugees? If it is a gazetted refugee camp, can he tall us under which Gazette Notice isWas gazette?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Arte, in all sincerity, I thought you were putting a supplementary question and not a point of order. However, I will allow it all the same.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LALAMPAA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I fully agree with you that that is more of a supplementary question than a point of order. Nevertheless, the area is not a gazetted refugee camp.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKAU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, taking that the Assistant Minister has said that the refugees are there on temporary basis, could he tell us whether they have been temporarily settled their awaiting repatriation or what will be their fate?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LAIAMPAA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, these refugees have been temporarily settled there to give the Government time to screen them in order to determine who are genuine	refugesThose who are not genuine refugees we will be taken back to their home country. The genuine refugees will be taken to the gazetted refugees camps in the Republic.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. NDSTEI: Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir, this i3 even more worrying. If the Assistant Minister thinks that some of these people are not genuine refugees  and they have been kept in a police station for more than four months  what damage have they caused up to now? Could the Assistant Minister explain the policy he is talking about? When people come into this country claiming to be refugees, they must 2c be vetted immediately. why should the Ministry allow them to stay for four months without vetting them?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LALAMPAA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to inform hon. Ndetei that these refugees are not with the precincts of the police station. . They are in a camp which is not within the police station. Vetting these people is 3: a very difficult exercise.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. These people are in the Game Station which is not different from the police station. They are in. the station occupied by the Anti-Poaching Unit. They live in the same place as our security personnel.	</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMEBR: It is equally bad I</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LALAMPAA: You will agree with , Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that that is not a police station.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKID0R: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. At present these aliens are "being deported back to their horse countries. Is it therefore in order for the Assistant Minister to tell the House they are moving these refugees to gazetted refugee camps instead of telling the House that they will be returned back to their country?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LALAMPAA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to inform hon. Ekidor that Kenya is a civilised nation. We value human life. We protect people who run from their countries and come to Kenya to seek refuge. We have settled those refugees there temporarily and we will use Government machinery to screen them and the genuine refugees will be taken to gazetted refugee camps and those who will not qualify to be refugees will be taken back to their own country.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. HAEAU: On a point, of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister has admitted that that place is not a gazetted refugee camp. This means that that camp is not governed by the international regulations regarding refugees. At the same time he says that there is no police station there. What security arrangements are there for these people? Who is protecting those people if there is no police station there? Who is protecting the Kenyans who live near that camp? What medical facilities are there?</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Hali ni mbaya sana hapoi</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LALAMPAA: Mr. Deputy Speaker. Sir, I think hon.

This matter is being handled by highly competent Kenyan security personnel. These refugees are not allowed to roam about. They have been settled there temporarily to give the Government time to screen them and separate the genuine refugees from those who are not genuine refugees,</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BULYAAR: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister has said that these refugees are going to be moved from where they are at present to another place. Will t still continue to stay within Marsabit District or they will be moved to a gazetted refugee camp?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LALAMPAA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have already, said that we are sending a team of officers from the Ministry's headquarters tomorrow to Marsabit to see the District Commissioner. Hon. Members of Parliament for that area and particularly the Member for Saku are invited to identify a new site for these people. Indeed the new site will be within Marsabi District</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KATURKANA; Jambo la nidhamu. Bw. Kaibu Spika Kawa wakimbisi watapelekwa kwao lini?

Katurkana is talking about the refugee camp in Marsabit District or whether he is talking about refugees in the country in general. But Kenya is not the only country that has given shelter to refugees. There is a representative of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees in every country every civilised country  that has given shelter to refugees from other countries. Those genuine refugees will be looked after until the political situation in their mother¬lands is conducive enough for them to return home. But those who are not genuine refugees will be repartriated to their own countries.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI:Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, let us call a spade a spade and not a big spoon. From reliable information that we have from hon. Members from that area. these refugees have caused a lot of damage; both psychologically and physically to the people of that area. \7e are informed that cases of	veneraldiseases have increa.sed in that particular area. This is because the moral behaviour of these	refugees is low. The behaviourof Kenyan children who have come into contact with these refugees has a.lso deteriorated. Therefore considering that the behaviour of the Somali ethnic group is very conservative when it comesto children These children have already beenmorally damaged. What future plans Does the Ministry have to ensure that this kind of thing is not repeated in future?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LALAMPAA: Mar. Deputy Speaker, Sir, first of all, I think hon. Ndetei must apologise to the Somali community, In fact they are not Somalis;they are Kenyans 0 The Government is very concerned. We are dealing with the situation properly, The situa¬tion is not out of control; it is under control.That is the reason why we are inviting the local leaders to advise us as to where we can establish another camp for these refugees. The current camp is a temporary one. Even thenext one is going to be temporary.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WABUGE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. In view of the fact that this Question has attracted a lot of interest from the House and bearing in mind that we do not seem to be getting ass anywhere, would I be in order to request the Assistant Minister to go back and look into this matter afresh and come back to the House and give a Ministerial Statement tomorrow and put us in the correct picture? This is because the matter is not clear at all.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LALAMPAA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is no harm in doing that. I have already given the hone Members the current position. If it is the wish of the House, I will be able to make a Ministerial Statement here after that team of officers reports back to the Ministry from Marsabit.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

I simply want to commend you en what you have said. The Questions we have today for this Ministry are very in port ant: One is dealing with a disease outbreak that is killing cypress trees in the country. For a Ministry not have is  representative here to deal with a Question like this one and others is pretty serious. I by the Front bench.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY(Mr. Biwott): Mr. Deputy Speaker, the hon. Member are, of course, right in saying that the business of, this House must be taken seriously. There has been failure by the Ministry of Environment and Natural. Resources  to be here this morning and I hope that they will get the message arid that in future they will not absent themselves when they have a Question here.In fact, I would like to urge all the Ministries to ensure that either the Minister, or an Assistant Minister, is always   present in the House. The president  has appointed a Minister  and  several Assistant  Ministers to every Ministry. Therefore, at least one Assistant Minister from each Ministry should be in the House. Failure to present themselves here, they should, at least, leave  an answers here  If there was an answer available, we would have answered the Question on the basis of the people of collective responsibility. I would urge. through the Chair   the Clerk of the National Assembly to insist that answers be made available before each Question is asked in the House. Shall we move on to the next Order?</Newspeech> <Header>MOTION</Header>Support to the Government for Severing Diplomatic Relations with Norway<Newspeech>MR. WABUGE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg. to move: THAT, in view of the fact that the Government   of Norway has grossly and deliberately violated the internationally recognised diplomatic norms by consistently undermining the Constitutionally elected Government of the Republic of Kenya; and noting rath dismay that the Norwegian authorities have readily given material and moral support to known enemies of our popularly elected Government this House deplores unreservedly the Norwegian interference in the internal affairs of this Republic and fully supports the firm stand taken by our Government to sever the diplomatic ties between the two countries; and further this House reaffirms its total unblemished loyalty to our President H.3. the Hon. D.T. arap Moi, C.G.H.} M.P., his Government and our Ruling Party,. Kami. It is obvious that the Government has already taken a stand on this matter, but we, as the legislature which is independent of the executive branch of our Government, have to have some say, views and comments on. the issue pertaining to Norway and our country. Since Independence,   this country has continued to believe in the rule of law. We have a Constitution and laws and there has never been any time when the Government of this country has operated outside the laws. Our lawn, which are made by this House, are just same as those of other  countries, and for that matter those of Norway. We may not like some of the laws of ether countries, but  because of the doctrine of  non interference in the internal affairs of other countries, Hsnya has never gone out of its way to say that the Ncrwagi Government, or its laws, is bad. Kenya has subscribed to the charters and conventions of the United Nations the Organisation for African Unity (OAU) and other international organisations,. Since we adhere to these charters and conventions and avoid interested  in the internal affairs of other countries, we expect other  Accounts not to interfere our internal affairs.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I happened to be among thosewho attended the Lacanster House x Constitutional Talks on ourIndependence. At that time we said that it was better for Africans to rule themselves, even if it meant misgoverning themselves, rather  than be ruled by foreigners; that was the aim up everybody who struggled for independence. But I am happy to that since we got our Independence we have never misgoverned ourselves. If anything, we have governed ourselves and developed into a civilised country with civilised laws.  Our President is above the law as enshrined in the Constitution. If it were in other countries, those who tried to overthrow the Government would have been shot in public but  our President said that he would not do that but would act according to the Constitution. Even when they; were taken to court, they were allowed to engage lawyers to defend them. When the High Court sentenced them, they were allowed to appeal. Which the developing country can go to that extent apart from Kenya? When one is so good, one is thought to be stupid. Let everybody know that Kenya is Independent and that it can manage its own affairs without outside interference.Sir, there is a Luhyia saying which  goes like this: He who feedsyou, will beat your mother in your presence and you will not object. This isbecause if you object, he will not feed you anymore. Let it be known thatwe are prepared to live with our poverty so long as we are Independent and our dignity respected, let it be known that Kenya is not going to be black  mailed. We never fought for Independence in order to be a satellite of any nation. We wanted to be Independent in order to manage  our own affairs and be equal to any other country as provided under the United Nations Charter.I am moving this Motion with a lot of concern because our Independence is being watered down. Some countries are now saying:  If you do not do this, we are not going to give you this and that. Sir, if you analyses the economic support we get from some  countries, you will see that we actually get nothing out of it. A large percentage of the economic aid we get goes back to the donor countries in the form of technical assistance. In fact, it is one way of creating employment opportunities for the citizens of those countries. Some of these countries do not have natural resources   such as minerals which can favour the setting up of some of these projects in order to secure  employment for their people.   That is why they go round shopping for countries which they can give aid to in  order to get employment for their people.I read in the Press that because of the breakup of diplomatic relations    between Kenya and Norway, we stand to lose Kshs.1 billion. Let them go to hell with. that Kshs.1 billion. We are not interested. They also said that about 100 Kenyans will lose employment in the now defunct Norwegian Embassy. Should  we be blackmailed because 100 Kenyans stand to lose employment in this embassy? Are we  going to accept that? Another pertinent question is this: Are we going to accept aid to the tune of Kshs.1 billion in order to be  blackmailed and interfered with? The answer is No.  This is a matter of life and death. We are not going to accept this. Let is go on record   and other countries should take note from today  that Kenya is an independent severing country with its own values, culture and democracy. We are not going   to adopt other peoples democracy.Anybody who thinks that in order for this country to be democratic it must adopt the system practiced  either in Norway, Britain, America or Soviet Union, is deceiving himself. Kenya is an African country and has never adopted foreign   ideologies.Kenya was branded a capitalist nation because we said we cannot accept any foreign .ideas; we adopted African socialism. We are now being told  since, the Soviet Union wants to practise multi party politics, Africa should also follow suit. Let those who talk in those tetras go to hell. Kenya has its own system based on Kenya African socialism. Anybody who compares us to the Soviet Union or Eastern Europe must know that the Soviet Union did not believe in the privatization of the economy. Nobody owns   anything in the Soviet union unlike in Kenya. Individual people in Kenya can own property without being interfered with by the Government. Here we allow anybody to export and import. In the Soviet Union, no one owns a car except the top brass people, everybody else has to go by matatusnad what have you, which are owned by the Government. In this country, people own vehicles, including bicycles,   whereas in the Soviet Union no one was allowed to own   bicycle.Therefore this country has its own system and that system must be sustained at all costs. The President has provided a very enlightene leadership. It is, therefore, up to us now in this House and the country at large, to stand firm with His Excellency the President. We must not deceive ourselves; we are at war and under normal circumstances, when a country is at war in order for that country to survive or to win, it must stand with one voice and support the head of government and the head of the country. In this respect, we must support the President if we want to win this war. We must go with the President if we want to  succeed in this modern life of the world.I say so because some people have said that they want to have I am very sorry, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that we do not even have confidence in ourselves. Even the lawyers we have in this country are nothing and, therefore someone has got to look for a lawyer internationally to come and defend somebody in our courts. The moment we do that; the moment Kenya does that, we will cease to  be a nation.  Let me give you an example, Mr. Deputy Speaker. America has 50 states, a lawyer in New York cannot be allowed to go and practice or to appear in a court in New Jersey just next door. It is not allowed. He cannot go there unless he has been registered in  hat particular state. So, who are we to allow some other people who are not registered here, whether they are .Queens Counsel to come and defend somebody in our courts? That one should be stopped.I know there are American Nowergians who are in America, they should tell the Nowergians in Norway that to send a foreign lawyer to kenya will be interference in other sovereign states affairs, which we cannot accept. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, let that be know from today. Even the British will support us here. People talk of human rights for an individual and not for 20 million people. If you want to protect 20 million people against one individual, there you are breaking human rights. Our laws are   very explicit; they say,  in order to have effective and a firm Government, certain sections in the constitution must apply . Those are  section 79 subsection 4 I have not time to read then section 80 subsection 4; section 81 subsection 3; all these deal with how the country can be governed, taking into consideration human rights and individual freedoms. That is spelt there: they say this is what should be done . When they say  Detention , detention was made by this House: the Act was passed in this House, just as much as Mrs. Thacher can have a law  passed in the House of Commons to deal with Northen Ireland, or America can pass laws in Congress and Senate in order to be effectively in control of the country.With those few remarks, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sri, I beg to move.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I stand to second this Motion, and in doing so, I would first of all like to tell our enemies,  that Kenyans are totally n± united and cannot allow  any kind of interference from  within or without this country. It is nearly 27 years since we attained our Independence cut we cannot forget how the colonial Government used to govern us by adopting the policy of divide and rule. I would like to take this opportunity to warn them that it is too late for them to try and divide us since we as Kenyans are fully noted.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Norwegian Government were allowed to establish their relations with Kenya so as to create mutual trust and understand! between the peoples of Kenya and Norway. However, they were not asked to come here and advise us on how to run our Government but to a here to., all our policies in this country. Therefore,. it is surprising that they have now decided to interfere with the internal affairs of our Government. They have been pretending to be giving us a lot of money for development, but we would like to tell them that we can., do without  their assistance.  far as we are concerned, everything 2± is going to continue as it was before and all our development work will not stop. As we   all remember, the last President Jcmo Kenyatta left a word of advice to us as Kenyans, namely that we must remain united at all times, and Kenyans have heeded to this advice up to date. Even the world today know that we in Kenya are united. The President himself has said that we are all on the run and if he has said so. who else should suggest something else?Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is important for us all to  rally behind  the President. I am saying this because we how  that certain people have been trying to undermine the Government of President Moi. They have even gone further to criticise our good policy of district fee us for rural development programme,  It is through this programme that a very Kenyan has been assured of sharing the national cake end we must all come out in full support of his Excellency  the resident in this programme, I am saying this because every Kenya has been able to see the kind of development that our country has achieved ever, since President Moi took over the leadership of this country. It is for this reason that We say we do not want any foreigner to interfer with our  internal affairs we would like to tell ±h± these foreigners that even before the   colonialists came to this country, we enjoyed some form of democracy in this country and safeguarded human rights. For example, if you look at the Kikuyu custom, you would find that the Kikuyus used to practise some form of democracy through panels of elders who used  to preside over issues for the welfare of their people. Similarly, the same thing used to happen in Turkana, Luhya land, Luolond and so on. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to tell these intruders to leave Kenya alone to govern themselves.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is the duty of every leader in this country to unite our people. We should not allow other people to come here and tell us a how we n should conduct ourselves. It is unfortunate that   certain people who run, away from their countries after causing trouble there, come here to start causing trouble, We must warn them that if they want to remain in this country, they must cooperation with our Government and we shall by no means allow them to   interfere with our internal affairs. I have in minds particularly people who come here through certain churches. I would like to remind them that they come here to preach the word of good but not to interfere with our internal affairs. As we all know  our President has worked very hard towards the achievement of peace and stability in this country and we as elected leaders in this country must come out in full support to the President, We would like foreigners to stop pretending that they like this country. They come here through the back does and say that they are ready to assist us but we  know that they do not mean a word of whatever they say. I would like our government to investigate the affaire of these foreigners particularly hose coming from our neighbouring countries. Our security forces must be put on full alter at our surfers because where  comeLAST 2 LINES NOT READABLEshall not tolerate their  behaviour.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have also what we call nongovernmental organizations. There are some foreigners who come here through these organisations pretending to assist us in our development, but they are out to cause trouble to this country. There was such an organization which came to ELgeyoMarakwet pretending to start a development project there  but they ended up by swindling money and disappeared. I would like to remind these people that bur Government is a Government of men and it is not going to tolerate their activities any more. When they come here, they must do whatthey came to do and adhere to the policies of the Kenya Government.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mrs. Ogot): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.

Kenyans are</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Kipkorir. Your time is over.</Newspeech>(Question proposed)<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Biwott): Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker,  Sir, for giving me an opportunity to contribute to this very important Motion. The content of the Motion is very clear and self explanatory, and does not require elaboration. I would like to take this opportunity to emphasise the point that Kenya is a sovereign state which is mature enough to handle its own affairs without anybody’s assistance. For the purpose of international relations, however, we must have diplomatic relations with other countries using the established diplomatic norms. These relations are established on the basis of mutual respect, mutual understanding and sovereignty with a view to non interference in each other internal affairs and the promotion of good relations. The Norwegian Government has not followed this conduct, and our objective this morning is to speak as individuals and collectively as hon. Members of Parliament We speak with one voice that will go out of this august House to the international community to demonstrate that Kenyans are 100 per cent behind the decisions made by our Government. It was not His Excellency the President alone who showed indignation, but the entire Kenyan nation.The other message that should go out very clearly is that Kenyans expected Norwegians to have diplomatic relations with us, but it seems as if these relations degenerated so much that they were no longer shared with the Kenya Government and Kenyans but with Koigi Wamwere, who is just an individual. Mr. Wamweres case is subjudice at the moment, and we cannot indulge too much in it. However, the mere fact that an ambassador saw it fit to go to our law court is both shameful and disgraceful. This is an act that we could not stomach nor allow because it was not of interest to this country. It was, therefore, necessary to break off diplomatic relations with Norway. There must have been a painful reason for that countries ambassador saw it fit to go to court to look after the welfare of a criminal. There must have been a lot more that the country feared because it is inconceivable for a full ambassador to go and sit in a law court.It is also embarrassing for the country to cry for a lawyer from outside this country. It is quite obvious that this lawyer was not going to be a proper lawyer. I think Norway was looking for an individual from Amnesty International to pose as a lawyer when, in fact, he would merely be promoting the mischief that certain foreigners have been doing. We are very lucky today because the Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Co—operation is here and we will hear more from him. We congratulate him on the firm stand he took and the manner in which he executed his duty. He brought dignity to our state, and this shows how loyal, he is to his country, his Government and the Head of State.Our security is not negotiable, as we have said many times before. This security was at stake, and a certain country condoned this situation. The country is obviously keen to see that chaos is brought into the country, and that country cannot be our friend, in which case, we should not have diplomatic relations with it. It was, therefore, good that these relations were broken. The kind of relations that were existing were humiliating and we, as a country, cannot afford to be humiliated by an individual not can we be cowed simply becausewe are getting aid from somebody. We are not given aid to be bought nor to regulate our integrity. Our integrity is far more important than anything else and we take pride in it.(Applause)Our detractors are talking about aid of more than Shs.1 billion, but that is absolute fuss, and I believe a statement will be issued shortly in this regard. They themselves brought their own people here to assist us. They paid them and this money is taken as having been a loan given to Kenya. I am told that these peoples salaries were about Shs.l00,000= a month.The read, money that at came to this country was little. We were1 buying some of the things direct from them. For example, in the case of geothermal electricity generation, we have been buying some of their equipment because they manufacture a few. But that is normal trade and it cannot be; used to reduce us to a state  of a servant. We are nobody  servants; we are proud Kenyans.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,  there are some non Governmental organisations about which some hon. Member complained yesterday. But what he did not do is to declare his own interest. In fat, we: would have liked to have known .yesterday, from hon. Makhanu, if he had some interest in the whole issue and, perhaps, if it is possible that some of the agitation that we used to hear in Bungoma against Elijah Mwangale had anything to do with such things. But I believe that if the hon. Member is here today he might ellinghten us further.There were also other active agitators such as Dr. Njoya, lawyers and the Church of the Province of Kenya. When Koigi Wamwere was arrested for the charge that everybody here knows, he had brought arms to this country and we all know what he wanted to do. He wanted to cause assassinations and kill people. Instead of such people as I have mentioned condemning the intended acts, they started pleading for Wamwere. That shows that all the agitation that was going on must have had something to do with this. These are the people who have already been bought stroke and barrow, and their interests are out and not in this country Let it be known that Kenyans are determined to preserve their integrity and their security and their future. Our future does not lie with the adi we get from out¬siders. Our future lies in what we ourselves do; it lies in our own productivity and ability to produce goods and services which are exploitable to earn us foreign exchange. So, as Kenyans, let us resolve to be productive and work for our own exports so that we do not depend on anybody. Above all, let the message go cut today that Kenyans are proud people. No amount of aid will subjugate Kenyans because nobody, no matter how much money he has or how much weapons he has  will.humiliate us. No matter how many cars one buys individuals in Kenya, we will not be humiliated. I remember that we said before that if, people are investing on individuals here they are investing badly because they will lose. I think the investment the Norwegians have done on these criminals has, in fact, proved a failure.With those few remarks, Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. ole Kaparo): Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I wish to join my friends in supporting this Motion, and I do so on the basis of the; action already taken by the Government of Kenya. It is a correct action because when you have diplomatic relations with any nation, it presupposes that the nation represented in this country does recognise and respect the sovereignty of Kenya. It also does presume that that other country must respect the decisions taken by the nation with which it has diplomatic relations.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are dismayed to find out that when Kenya enforces its own laws against people: who have broken the laws of this nation, a foreign country protests. Wonder of wonders, the  first arrested and charged is not even a Norwegian. What interest could possibly have been there unless, of course, the Norwegian Government was fully behind those activities. The obvious question is this: Is Kenya a province of Norway?</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: Never! Never!</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. ole Kaparo): If, therefore, Kenya is not a province of Norway, what right has Norway to ask us about what we  do within our own borders? The: conduct of the ambassador his self, going to court as if he was a lawyer  The ambassador was not a lawyer and the subject under charge was not a Norwegian nor was he a relative. Is that respect to the laws of this nation? Is that respect to the sovereignty of Kenya? If they do not respect us, do they have a right to remain hare? They have noright to remain here. They should go as they went. Other people and the Press highlighted the story that Kenya stands to lose KShs.1 billion. Even if we lose KShs.100 billion, does it matter if by having those billions we cease to be our¬selves?Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I have said before, Africans have had quite a bit of bitter relations with other people. We have been sold as slaves; sold literally like cows. And those people who sold us are the people who are now talking about human rights. Where was their conscience when they were selling us? When did they suddenly realise that? Even if right now you go to those countries, you are still looked down upon just because you happen to be black. We are perpetually being treated to lessons like1 we are primary school children. But Kenya is saying that, we are  a nation capable of steering its own cause. We  should not have this carrot of aid dangled over our noses. We should not be told if we do not do this or that then the aid will be: taken away. What does it comprise , anyway?	 As it has been said before, the salaries those socalled experts receive in this country are outrageously high. They get very high salaries andvery modern cars. You should even look at the allocations they put for telephone. Some of the agencies have a very high budget for telephone. When you have a telephone budget running to £200,000 a year, you can compute that it is about KShs.4 million for telephone: alone. And that is part the aid and they enjoy themselves. But we  do not mind that so long as we are respected. We appreciate that some of them do a good job. But so long as they respect the right of Kenya to do as it pleases within its own borders, we will cooperate with them.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as the Motion is clear about the confidence we have in His Excellency the President, I will not generalise matters.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we all owe a duty to Kenyans: to make our stand clear on this particular issue; our confidence in the Government, the President and the Party. We have had 27 years  of peace and tranquility„ We have lived in peace all these years because we cherish unity., We have  lived in unity because we have respected the institutions of this country. Among the insti¬tutions of this country is the institution of the Presidency. It is the only institution that holds all the other institutions together, Everybody within our borders must respect; first and foremost, the institution of the Presidency„ This is because this is the institution that holds this country together. His Excellency the President has held this nation together.Deputy Speaker, Sir, a lot of things have been saidabout this Parliament. Some people say that this one here is thewrong Parliament; some say this Parliament was not elected. But whosleeted those who are saying these things to speak on behalf ofothers? Who elected them? So many people have taken it uponthemselves to criticise the Government without jiving alternatives.It is very easy to stand up and criticise everything that isdone, by the Government and say everything is wrong without offering any remedy whatsoever. Everybody is free to contest elections in this country. Even bishops are free to contest elections in this country.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: One Bishop is here.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. ole Kaparo) : The only one who dared to contest a Parliamentary seat is here. He is a very good   Bishop. In fact he is an Archbishop. Vie invite those who have   any good suggestion  to give them in a constructive manner. We have never closed our ears to good suggestions. This country has never closed its ears to genuine views. But when you criticise just for the sake of rocking the boat Yesterday, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I read an article in The Kenya Times where it was said that Swedish Television has been broadcasting that Mr. Andrew Kimani Nguinea was detained following the July riots in parts of this country. These are absolute lies. If foreigners are not ready to speak the truth about this country, then we have a right to tell them  You can go hose and say whatever you  want to say about us away from us,  Kenya is a  beautiful country and we roust take care of it. Vie have no other country. Those who want  to disturb our peace and  cause chaos in this country must  be told in no uncertain terras that we Kenyans do not want that kind  of thing; we want peace because Kenya has been a peaceful country since Independence. I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU:  Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my colleagues in congratu¬lating the mover of this Motion and to thank the Government, through the Ministry of foreign Affairs and International Cooperation for the firm decision it took to sever diplomatic relations with Worway which has acted in an unfriendly manner.In supporting this Motion, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that all Kenyans, including ourselves, crust know that Kenya is not up for sale. Kenya is a sovereign and Independent State. I will confine myself to the principle of   non interference   in the internal affairs of other states. This is a policy which is enshrined in all international convention This is a policy which is   recognized in all political  circles all over the world. But the behaviour of the Norwegian Ambassador to Kenya, when he was here, cannot be supported by any of these conventions. He directly interfered with, our own judicial processes and that is deplorable and nobody will support that kind of thing. That is why all of us here must support the	  firm decision taken by our Government to cut diplomatic ties with Norway.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, giving economic aid to a country is one thing but attaching strings and conditions to that aid is another story. we reject completely any type of economic assistance given to us with strings attached to it. We are not up for grabs; we an Independent    nation.  We have managed our. affairs with our any problems since Independence. We fought for our Independent  so that we may be free to govern our own country. That is why we said that we must have the freedom to shape our own destiny. If for instance I am invited to Malindi to go and assist my friend hon. Tuva in a fund raising meeting, I am not going to be the   prime mover of development in that constituency. I should no go there and pretend to be the prime mover of development in that area. So, Norway should not think that without their assistance we cannot develop; we can develop  without their aid. It is true that over 75 per cent of the aid that we have received from Norway has always ended up back in Norway  it has not benefited us at all.   The Norwegians who work in various projects funded by Norwayin tills country are paid huge salaries and as the hon. Mover said, this is just another way of finding employment for these people. Some of them have committed crimes in their own country.So, the Government of Norway transfers these criminals from Norway to Kenya. Seme of them behave in a very  undiplomatic manner. There are many  incidents of such undiplomatic behaviour in this country„ They leave all the work to  be done by our local people and yet they are paid huge salaries which take about 75 per cent of the total aid package. This is just to enable them to enjoy the stability and peace that we have in this country. They enjoy our food, freedom  of movement; I dare say that they even  enjoy  our women here.  Are we going to stand this kind of thing? Are we going to allow these people to come here and abuse us? We are not going to allow this andfas a result of this we must support the action the Government has taken in severing diplomatic relations with Norway. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is a book by a certain  professor entitled Vulnerability of States. The theory advanced in that book is that developing countries, including Kenya, will no  advance economically unless they has base their development programmes on Western aid. We totally reject that kind of thing because it is pure neocolonialism. They are  giving us aid with strings attached so that they may find a way of coming into our country to do what they want. That is nothing but neocolonialism which we have  rejected.  Our forefathers rejected that kind of thing. We as leaders should be firm and never allow ourselves to be hoodwinked into this kind of situation where Norway has been giving us aid, which comparatively is peanuts.. Essentially, nobody else will come to develop this country except we Kenyans through our articulate policies ana foresighted leadership of his Excellency the President, who has guided this nation very  well if we follow our policies properly, we can easily do without this assistance from Norway.  in the long run I do not see Norway helping us to solve or own problems.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, some of the foreign staff attached to aid packages are very inexperienced and naive. Sometime they happen to have come to Kenya, for the first time and you would not expect somebody of that calibre to contribute effectively to your own development aspirations. We have our own system and we should follow it. For instance we have the District Focus for Rural Development through which we involve our people in development we also have the Harambee movement through which we generate income to supplement Government resources and help in implementing our own projects.Therefore, in supporting this motion I am stressing the point that we can for ever do without assistance from Norway; we unreservedly deplore the behaviour of the former Norwegian ambassadour in Kenya. In fact, if I was in a position. I  would have locked him up when he followed Kiogi Wamwere to the High Court cell  But because we are a civilised nation that follows all the   diplomatic norms we allowed him to go around doing whatever he wanted to do.So, what has happened should serve as an example to other friendly nations9 which interested in thing business in House.In actual fact, they gain much more from Kenya and Africa as a whole than we gain from them. Therefore, if they want to maintain relation with us, they have to respect our system of Government and political culture. They should not think that we are weak; we are an independent and sovereign state and will have to remain so. They must be warned that Kenya is not a colony of theirs  we passed that stage a long time ago and we shall never go back to that kind of a situation. With these few remarks, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mrs. got): Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this very important Motion. On the onset, I would like to congratulate hon. Wabuge for moving this Motion in the House this morning and also the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation for swiftly implementing, the Government order that the Norwegian ambassadour goes back to his country.As the President of this beautiful country and the  ruling Party, Kanu, President Moi has done us proud. He has been brave in. protecting and uniting the people of this country.The mere fact that the  former  Norwagian ambassadour spoke the way he did about both our courts and country showed clearly that Norway has no respect for Kenya. We had been very patient with Norway when  it had given dissidents a free hand to attack Kenya year in year out. As if  this was not enough, Norway fed, clothed and paid the dissidents to abuse their motherlands Thinking about it now, one would be surprised if Norway did not have a hand in bringing a lot of confusion in Kenya earlier on to that we could be busy battling among ourselves in derates about many	in the country while However any our country.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, just any other country would appreciate aid given by any donor agency, or a friendly country, We appreciated the aid given to us by Norway. But when Norway uses that aid to whip our Government and people, then we totally reject that kind of aid. As has already been said with an aid amount of, say, Shs.1 billion and over 400 heads of families and from this money you pay house rents, buy cars for these people, pay their telephone bills, education overseas, leave and travelling allowances, then very little of it will remain. I feel that the former Norwegian ambassadour should have been more appreciativefor he and his fellow nationals having been given the freedom totravel throughout our country, enjoy good weather, food and fruits.Did we not read in the newspapers yesterday that even Norway hadproblems with its party and Government and yet the same country was trying to create chaos in Kenya?We are now telling the former Norwegian ambassadour wherever he is in his cold country, that it is not for us to reconsider our position, but it is up to Norway  to reconsider its position •with Kenya. We are demanding apology from Norway for having been  waging war against Kenya, which has been looking after the Norwegian nationals who were living in this country. If Norway wants to have   any friendship with Kenya it should reconsider its position as far as dissidents hurling abuses against  a popularly elected Government, which has not abused any human right is concerned.	 The story of Africa has been heard and rear; in ask from of mass  media all over the worlds Which country has been more lenient.</Newspeech>
