MAKHANU asked the Minister of State, Office of the President what, in view of the fact that Bungoma DDC has recommended that three sub-locations be created in Kibabii Location, is delaying the implementation of this recommendation. <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTA^NT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Onyancha): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Government does not intend to create three sub-locations in Kibabii Location in the near future because the issue is not an immediate priority in Bungoma District. ?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WASIKE—NDOMBI :Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that development has been taken down to the district level, and the Bungonia District Development Committee - has recommended that this particular location be sub-divided into three sub-locations How come that, the Government has no intention of doing that when the matter is the priority of the Bungonia District Development Committee?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as far as I am aware there is no minute of the Bungoma District Development Committee meeting which recommended the creation of the three sub-locations in Kibabii Location.. There is only one proposal for renaming Kanduyi Location to Kibabii Location, comprised of Marakaru and Tuti sub-locations. This is a recommendation by North Kanduyi Location, development committee meeting held on 27.th. September,1979. However,, the-proposal was not "- even, forwarded to- the. divisional' development committee for- deliberations and-, hence-, did not. Reach, the. Bungoma District Committee for discussion and approvalThe Location in question, Sir, has an area of 50 square kilometres with a population of approximately 16,000 people.- Annual population growth-of the area  is about 3.62.Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Bungoma District Development. Committee recommends- the- creation of the three sub-locations my office will consider the matter on the usual realities that we take into account when we want to create sub locations.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the reply given by the Assistant" Minister is contradictory. In the first instance^ he said that there was a proposal to rename the location and, secondly, there was also a recommendation of dividing the area into two su-locations. That itself has not been done because up to now the area is one location under one chief and one assistant chief. That makes if very difficult to administer the area. This matter came up at the district development committee for deliberations and the district commissioner promised .that-since he was reviewing the whole issue of new administrative location, he was going to forward them as a package under the normal administrative procedures under confidential cover.MR. MAKHANU (ctd.):Could the Assistant Minister ensure that the District Development Committee’s first recommendation that there should be two sub-locations is implemented? Could he also further ensure that kibabii Location is sub divided into three locations? This is because it is inconsiderable for a District like Bungoma to have one chief and one assistant chief</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon member says that  this matter has been discussed by the District Development Committee (D.D.C.) but as I have already indicated, from the information that I have got this matter has  been discussed by the Bungoma D.D.C. which means that no recommendations whatsoever have been sent to us.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant" Minister give us the criterion used for sub-dividing locations?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, apart .from the other factors,, we would: take, into account the size of .the population to-be served, the size of  the area to be created,, the economical potential of the area the infrastructures to be created-and. the social and .political trends of the area. Those are- infact-the-main factors to be considered. We would also have: to consider the availability of funds. <\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR- MAKHANU: - Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell us the general. Government: policy of creating new administrative units? Is the trend that such matters have to-go- through the D.D.Cs.? Could he also inform us about the current Government policy on this issue?<\NEWSPEECH>	<NEWSPEECH>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I. am sorry but I do not quite get what the hon. Member means. This is because as to the Government's current policy on such issues the recommendations have to come first from the grass root level up to the D.D.C. level after which the recommendations are sent to the headquarters. That is when we can act on what has been recommended. But to Repeat myself, I really do not know what it is the hon. Member is asking.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH> MR. SPEAKER: Could you repeat your question,. Mr. Makhanu?	MR. MAKHANU: All I wanted, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was for the Assistant Minister to inform the House the policy pursued by the Office of the President in creating new administrative units. Must the creation such units pass through the D.D.Cs? This is because there are very daring examples of new units that never went through the D.D.C.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am aware that the Questioner is a former district commissioner and knows very well that the Government policy on this matter has never changed.<\NEWSPEECH>Question No.77Tea Payments to Mr. OgaroMR. A.H.O. MOMANYI asked the Minister for Agriculture since Mr. Aboki Ogaro, tea grower No. 0229, of Nyankoba Tea Factory has not received his payments since 1987, what urgent steps he is taking to pay this farmer his total dues.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Gachui): Mr. Speaker, Sir I beg to reply.<\NEWSPEECH>Mr. Aboki Ogaro, tea grower No... 0229, owes- the Kenya. Tea Development Authority (K.T.D.A.) shs.6,744.80 which arises out  of the overpayment made'- to him in 1985/86 financial year. The K.T.D.A. therefore continues to recover the: overpayment from Mr. Ogaro's tea. deliveries. As and when the. Whole payments has been cleared, Mr. Ogaro will receive his payments thereafter. The current balance: outstanding on Mr. Ogaro’s. Account, is shs.5, 280.79. He has only been able to pay shs.1, 455.01.<NEWSPEECH>MR. A.H.O. MOMANYI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the farmer in question has not been given all this information. Could the Assistant Minister direct the K.T.D.A. to pass over all this information to this farmer? This is because although this farmer has been going to the factory he has never been given a satisfactory answer because all they tell him is to come back the following day, week or month. So the K.T.D.A. should come out and tell this farmer what he owes them.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. GACHUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe that Mr. Ogaro is aware of how the overpayment came about. He was. Credited with amounts due to another farmer as far back as 1986/87. When the K.T.DXA. Attempted to recover the money, they found out that Mr. Ogaro had already withdrawn the money from the bank. Subsequently, the overpayment had to be recovered from his tea leaf deliveries. It is unfortunate that Mr. Ogaro has for reasons unknown to us stopped delivering his. Leaf in the same manner he used to. This is because he has reduced the amount of leaf that he delivers annually. For the benefit of the hon. Member, I would like to give the House the following information:-In 1986/87 he delivered 654^ kilogrammesIn 1987/88 he delivered 43 kilogrammesIn .1988/89 he delivered 03 kilogrammesIn between July, 1989 and January, 1990, .140 kilogrammes.Mr. Ogaro is aware that £he owes the K.T.D.A. the money and the only way to repay it. is by delivering more leaf so that deductions could be made appropriately. We would therefore like to seek the help of the hon. Member in urging Mr. Ogaro to continue- delivering all his leaf -to the Nyankoba Tea Factory-.to enable him to clear the total amount.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. A.H.O MOMANYI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, although the farmer has enough he refuses to.deliver it to the buying centres because he knows that he will not be paid.. How can he work for nothing? This is the reason wh£y he- is not delivering his leaf, to the buying centres. If the: Assistant Minister could clarify the situation to this fanner then the farmer will deliver his leaf.<\NEWSPEECH>Question No. 28Payment of NSSF Benefits to Mr.(gitemengi)<NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. A.K. Kimemia is not in yet? Next Question.<\NEWSPEECH>Question No. 41 Payment of NSSF Benefits to Mr. BavuMR. BOY. On behalf foe of Mr.Bidu asked the Minister Labour why Mr. Kainbi Bavu, NSSF No. 011^43 7-02.2, who retired in 1988 was underpaid his benefits and when he would be paid the outstanding balance.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. D.M. Amin): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Mr. Bavu, NSSF NO. 011-437-922 who retired in 1988, was underpaid his benefits because the employer, the Ministry of Water Development had not made his returns for the year 1979-1988. On 28th January, 1990, the underpayment was confirmed by the employer-and a cheque No. 12B879 for sbs.15, 263.95 was sent to the claimant vide registered mail No. 02333 of 5th February, 1990.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. Boy: while thanking the Assistant Minister for that reply, I would like to. Say 'that the complainant has not-'received his cheque to-date. Why has it taken so long?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said earlier on, we have posted a cheque to the complainant and if he has not received it, then it is a- different matter altogether.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BOY: Mr. Speaker, Sir, can .the Assistant Minister tell us when this cheque was sent?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was sent on 5th February, 1990.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. Boy: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is more than a month now since the cheque was sent and it could as well be that it is still lying somewhere in the N.S.S.F. building. Could he check whether it is there because the N.S.S.F dispatching section takes so long before dispatching a registered mail we have the complainant with us here in Nairobi, and he has- not received his cheque.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said that we have-already, posted the cheques and. I even gave its registration number. The complainant should,-therefore-"go and. check at-his postal<\NEWSPEECH> address.MR. SPEAKER: next Question.Question no. -17<HEADER>Settlement of Claim by Italian Automobile Limited<\HEADER>	- _MR. WAHBUA asked the Minister for Educations why his Ministry has failed to settle the lodged .by Messrs Italian Automobile; Limited', Machakos, amounting, to Kshs.  Sixty two thousand, four hundred and sixty and  forty cents (kshs. 62,460.40) for services rendered' in 1987  as per the D.E.O.-'s letter  of " Ref. A/17/5/88/	of 13thJanuary, 1988.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Amayo): Mr. Speaker, Sir,I beg to reply.My Ministry has now received sus sufficient information regarding repairs done by Messrs Italian Automobile- Limited, Machakos. Arrangements are, therefore, being made to settle the Ministry's portion of the claim within the next two weeks.<\NEWSPEECH>?<NEWSPEECH>MS. WAMBUA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this man repaired the Ministry's vehicles in 1987 and. up to now, he has not received any payment out of the total claim of Kshs. 62,460.40- This is a poor man and he is almost closing down his garage. Can the Ministry be serious and K send this man a cheque covering this amount within the next two weeks?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>ME. AMAY0: Mr.Speaker, Sir, it may be necessary to clarify here that out of the total bill of Kshs. 64,460.40, only Kshs. 28,000 belongs to the Ministry of Education. We have contacted other Government Ministries whose vehicles were also used during the national examinations to- meet the cost from their various Votes. The understanding here is that although. Letters, were written by district education officers, authority to incur that expenditure was only for fuel but not for the repairs of other Ministries' vehicles. The portion of the claim of Kshs. 28 ,000.00 that we are talking about^ is for the repairs of vehicles belonging to the Ministry of Education. We are making arrangements to make payment of Kshs.28,171-00 to Messrs. Italian. Automobile Limited within the next two weeks.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAMBU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are talking, of. a claim of Kshs.62,460.40 which was presented to the Ministry of Education and not to other. Ministries covering, fuel and repair of vehicles in 1987- Can the Assistant. Minister be. specific and tell us when this money will be paid? The district education officer has even written to the Ministry requesting it TO release this money. Low come that the total claim has been reduced, TO Kshs. 28,000.00? ‘This man has been asking for his payment since 1937- is the Ministry not sympathetic to him after rendering good services to it? <\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MS. AMAYO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we accept that the total bill is Kshs.64,460.40 out of which Kshs.28,171-00 belongs to the Ministry of Education and the balance is distributed among  others  Government Ministries in this order:Ministry of Livestock Development					-	kshs. 13,310.00Ministry of Agriculture							-	kshs 13,560.00Ministry of Water Development						-	kshs     6,875.00Ministry of home Affairs and national heritage (Probation Department)	-	kshs     3,375.00Ministry of Culture and Social Services					-	kshs        160.00Ministry of Labour							-	kshs     4,250.00Forestry Department							-	kshs     2,000.00Ministry of Co-operative Development					-	kshs        158.00Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will pay our portion and. we expect the other Ministries to pay their portions<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MRS. NDETEI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We. are made to understand that, the L.P.O. which requested for this a job was. From the* Ministry of Education, Machakos.' It. is- the Ministry- of "Education which • needed these vehicles to use during, the examinations period: and' not the other.-Ministries Is the Assistant. Minister implying that this company should be. Directed to go every Ministry that is involved to look-for .this- money? Why can the Ministry of Education; not pay the whole amount and. Then claim from the-other Ministries? <\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to state that-we are equally sympathetic to the owner of Italian Automobile Limited. Government: arrangement are there as to who repairs which vehicles. I would like to explain .that'. The authority to- incur expenditure for conducting, examinations in Machakos was for fuelling a.11 Government vehicles that were utilized. In this exercise, but not- for normal repairs of vehicles. It is true that the letter was written by the D.2.0. Who made an error in giving an impression that, the total, bill would be paid by the- Ministry of Education. We have indicated to the Ministries concerned the portion they are supposed- to settle. The management of Italian. Automobile Limited can liaise with us so that we can. Assist them the get their money from the other Ministries.<\NEWSPEECH>?<NEWSPEECH>MR. BOY: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister, is taking this Souse for a ride. When he first stood to answer the Question, he- said that Italian Automobile Limited will be paid in two weeks’ time. When he was asked a supplementary question, he said that they are going to be paid kshs. 24,000.00. Again, when he was asked a further supplementary question, he said that they will only meet fuel expenses. Which, is which? The Question clearly states the amount that is to be paid in full and not partly or far fuel is it in order for the Assistant Minister to take us for a ride as if we were small kids?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I' only wish the hon. Member was a good listener.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BOY: I am.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. AMAYO: Be indicates that we are not young people and I have the -advantage of being older than him. Sir, I never--spoke about Kshsv. 24,000.00 but I indicated that the Ministry of Education will pay their portion of Kshs. 28,171.00 out of Kshs. 62,460.40. That is the amount I said we are going to pay within the next two weeks.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEB: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the Assistant Minister is misleading the House completely the Local Purchase Order (LPO) was issued and signed by the District Education Officer (DEO), Machakos, . It was therefore, the responsibility of the Ministry of Education to pay the 5 expenses incurred. Any other internal arrangements the Ministry makes with, other Ministries has nothing to do with the servicing company. Will the Assistant Minister stop /about dividing the amount of over Shs.62,000/- into portions, and say exactly this Ministry will pay the total amount to the Italian Automobile Limited?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MB. AMAYO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have admitted that issuing of are giving the LPO by the DEO' was a mistake. That is why we are an undertaking that we are going to Liaise with other Ministries in order to help off the balance of Shs.34, 289.40 that should not be paid by the ministry of Education<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MRS. NDETEI: Mr.Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister said that- the DEO was granted authority for fuelling-vehicle and for repairing them. This shows' the Ministry did not know what was happening; in the field. How could the. Ministry-authorise fuel expenditure when there were no vehicles on the road?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR I.A. MOHAMED: ".Mr- Speaker, Sir, ^Assistant Minister is talking' as if the Ministry has no funds for administration of examination. But we know that the ministry“allocates money for administration of examinations. Since these-vehicles, broke down while performing duties related to the examinations, - could the Assistant Minister specific and tell us how he it ends to handle' this a issue instead of frustrating somebody who rendered important services to' the nation.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I may also need your- guidance as to how hon. Members want me to answer this Question. I have explained to the House that authority to incur expenditure was given to the DEO, Machakos, for fuelling of all vehicles marshalled from various Ministries and that each Ministry pays for repairs of its vehicles. The money exercise and not for repairing .all Government vehicles in Machakos District. However, since the DEO wrote to the firm of Italian Automobile Limited asking that the vehicles be repaired, it is upon to liaise with other Ministries and secure payment of the money this company.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, actually every year it is the tendency of. The Ministry of Education to "borrow vehicles from departments in the district for use in conducting the examinations. However, the lending minister not pay for fuel or re pair because these are supposed, to be paid for from the Examinations could the assistant Ministry of Education. Since the Ministry of Education was responsible for-the conduct of the-administration of the examinations, it should pay the total amount of Shs.62,460.4.and then ask for-a refund from the other" Ministries concerned, instead of giving the company the "burden of asking for payment from various Ministries.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. AMAYO: Mr.' Speaker, Sir, first i would like to clarify one point. It is not just a "tendency for the Ministry to "borrow vehicles from other Departments". Since we have many examination centres every year we vehicles from all Ministries. But hon. wampum seems to give an impression that there is a conflict between the Ministry of Education and other Ministers. As other Government ministers have not complained about payment of their bills, I do not think it is in order for hon. wambua to 'act as-an advocate for those Ministries. I have said that we are liaising with other pay Ministries to secure so that we can this money to the firm in question.<\NEWSPEECH>		Question No. 68<HEADER>Completion of Kiangini Bridge<\HEADER>MR. EY0NDA asked the Minister for Public works what has delayed the completion of the bridge at kiangini on the newly built access road between Makueni and Makindu in kibwezi.<NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC V70RZS (Mr. Mibei): Mr. Speaker, Sir I beg to replyThe delay in completing the said bridge was due to lack of funds. But I am pleased to inform the House that funds are now available and the bridge will be completed before the end of June1990<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KYONDA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Minister for his good reply However, since what remains is only back-filling the two  sides of the bridge, why does the Minister need up-to the end of June to do that work? "Although we are now in the rainy season and the river is usually full of water ‘this work can be done in one day</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MIBEI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, .1 will consider the hon.

We will have to Questions by Private Notice. Mr. Kyonda's Question.</NEWSPEECH>QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE Doctor for Makueni District Hospital<NEWSPEECH>MR. KYONDA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I "beg to ask the Minister for Health the following Question "by Private Notice.Since Makueni District Hospital has "been operating without a resident doctor since February this year,, what urgent steps is the Minister taking to post a doctor to this hospital in order to provide essential medical services to the wananchi?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.'I am happy to inform the hon. Member that Dr. Bernard M. Mwangangi has already been posted from Makindu Sub-District Hospital to Makueni Hospital, and the doctor has already reported to the latter hospital, and he has been  shown his house. We will, transfer his belongings to the house that he. has been shown, and he will be there on 6th April, 1990. Having seen his house, he just went back to collect his belongings. Thank you.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MRS. NDETEI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has just made a very important revelation to the House, that he has transferred Dr. Mwangangi from Makindu to Makueni whereas the former is the only hospital I have in ray constituency with a doctor of Dr. Mwangangi’s calibre. What is happening to Makindu Hospital, where the situation is bad?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me explain this issue further to the House so that. Hon.Members- may understand it. We had in this area, some three doctors, one of whom-was recommended for-further studies-in the-United States of America. A. lady doctor remained behind, but we did not know- when she .would, go on maternity leave (Laughter)She eventually went; on maternity leave, something that we could not stop. This leave meant a break of two weeks only, However, the hon.-lady Member is- asking; who has remained behind after Dr. Mwangangi has moved from Makindu to Makueni. - There is Dr. Thomas Muthoka in this place. However,- we are not obliged to give doctors to dispensaries, sub—health centres, health centres or- sub-district hospitals because they are all under the district hospital, and the doctor-in the district hospital is capable of looking sifter all these smaller institutions.- In any case. Dr. Thomas Muthoka has remained behind in Makindu Hospital.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KYONDA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the Assistant Minister for the promise he has given to the effect that	AN HON. MEMBER: Is it a promise?<NEWSPEECH>MR. KYONDA: Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a promise to the effect MR. KYONDA (eTD.):that Dr. Mwangangi will be coming to Makueni Hospital. He has reported on duty, but he is not there at the moment. I myself went to Makueni Hospital yesterday and I was told that Dr. Mwangangi had reported on duty and got the hope that he would eventually come and settle down, which is good. We are talking about a district hospital with about 200 beds, which has been without a doctor from February 1990 up to now. This hospital needs five doctors, so even if. Dr. Mwangangi comes over, he will be overloaded. Could the Assistant Minister tell us when we are going to get more doctors for this hospital?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the lady doctor's maternity leave that I mentioned is ending soon, after which she will come back to help Dr. Mwangangi, who is reporting on duty on 6th April, 1990. Dr. Muthoka has remained behind and his position is not vacant. However, we have no doctor in the hospital where Dr. Mwangangi is going to report because the lady doctor is on maternity leave. When she reports back, there will be two doctors in Makueni Hospital. In. any case, we-do not. Post doctors in numbers just, like that;, we post them as per the need, depending on the number of patients that need to be seen per day,, month or year. I hope that this House knows how difficult it is to train doctors and keep them within our system. Some of them run away to start their own offices and compete with European and Asian clinics elsewhere</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MRS. NDETEI: Mr- Speaker, Sir, although this particular Question applies to Makueni Hospital,. I. am still quite worried because the Assistant Minister has said that he has. transferred Dr. Mwangangi to Makueni Hospital, where there is a lady doctor already. The doctor who is supposed to serve Makindu Hospital is abroad studying, which means that there is no doctor at Makindu at the moment. You will realize the importance of Makindu Hospital when you consider the man y major accidents we have on the nearby road. The only hospital we have between Voi and Machakos is Makindu, and leaving Makindu without a doctor is a worrying situation. The Assistant Minister will need to consider this situation and see what to do about it, even it means transferring a doctor from Nairobi to Makindu. Besides Makindu we have no alternativehospital whereas we have very many hospitals in Nairobi- If there is no doctor at Kenyatta National Hospital, one can go to another. Government hospital in Nairobi. I request the Assistant Minister to 'do something about Makindu, which is not a dispensary but a big hospital.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have, in fact, been dealing with Kakueni District Hospital, but not with Makindu.Sub-District Hospital. I should not discuss here the question of the latter hospital because it is not a district hospital.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. GALGALLO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. In recent times, we have seen some reluctance among doctors resisting transfers to certain stations. Since the Assistant Minister has said that, the doctor in question has. already been shown .a house in the said hospital, would he assure the House that the case of the doctor not wanting to work there will not arise?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, when I post a doctor. or any other; officer-in the Ministry of Health, I do not. Do.it on the request of the officer concerned, but as ray duty, which is both official and authoritative. The doctor in question has been posted on duty, he has obeyed and-reported on duty, and he has been shown his house. He has only gone back to bring his belongings-' to his new house. I do not post any officer anywhere merely because he agrees to- be posted; he only follows the authority involved</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KYONDA: On-a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to tell us that doctors do not refuse to go to remote places whereas we know that this is a fact. If this were not the case, it would not have taken the Assistant Minister from February 1990 to April, 1990 to get a resident doctor to such, a big hospital as Makueni. Is he in order to make his claim and yet we know that, while some hospitals are crowded, we have no doctor in such a big hospital as Makueni.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, before anybody became aware of the District Focus for Rural Development Strategy, one could argue between the choice of remote and not remote places. However, this does arise any more theseMR. OGURdays and everybody in the country seems to be aware of the need to move to rural areas. In any case, to be transferred from Makindu to Makueni is a good thing because the former is only a sub-district hospital whereas the latter is a full district hospital with better facilities. Furthermore, if there is a case of any doctor refusing to move from one- station to another just because he himself considers the new station to be remote, his case is out the question because I do not deal with such cases. What I do is to choose a doctor for a certain place, for a certain reason, and then do the posting. My order has to be obeyed, and if anybody does not want to obey, we know how to take care of his case .This situation has not arisen in this case.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KYONDA: On a point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to tell us that two doctors will be enough for a hospital as big as Makueni whereas we know that we need, at least, five doctors to cater for the different problems we have in the hospital?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.

Spika	Bw. Spika, kama vile unavyoelewa, huko Mombasa kumetokea mtetemko wa ardhi mar a tano sasa. Sisi wenyeji wa Mombasa tunataabika sana kwa sababu ya hizo tetemko za ardhi. Mungu ndiye .THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Nassir) (ctd.):anayejua mambo mengi, lakini, pia Serikali ina wajibu wa kuwafahamisha watu wa Mombasa baada ya kila siku mbili hali ya mtetemko wa ardhi. Tetemko la ardhi likitokea, linamshangazaJ kila mtu katika nchi Si miti peke yake inayotetemeka. Ni vizuri Serikali iwasaidie watu wa Mombasa kwa kuwafahamisha kinga wanazoweza kuchukuwa tetemko la ardhi liki tolea. Ni lazima Serikali ituambie vile  polisi, na m_aofisa wa utawala wanavyoweza kutusaidia wakati tetemko la ardhi linapotokea. Ni lazima tuwe macho sasa, sivizuri kugonjea tetemko la ardhi litokee halafu ndipo tujaribu kutafuta kinga, kwa sababu hatutafaidika hata kidogo.Bw. Spika, gazeti la Daily Nation la leo lilikuwaninawauliza watulatka vyoo vikuu wapeleke habari huko Amerika ili wajulishwe j hizo tetemko za ardhi ziko namna gani. Habari tulizopata juu ya tetemko hizo tano za z ardhi ilikuwa kidogo sana, na watu wa Mombasa wana hofu sana. Kwa sasa mimi niko hapa lakini jamii yangul na za wa wenzangu wote wako Mombasa. Hizo tetemko za ardhi zilikuwa huko Mombasa, Malindi, Lamu na hata Kwale. Kwa hivyo, kwa nialba ya watu wa Pwani, ningependa kulisndba Serikali itafute kinga za hizo tetemko za ardhi.Hata tunaweza kuwaondoa watoto wadogo huko bwani na kuwadeleka mahali pengine, kwa vile tumeona kwamba tetemko la ardhi linaweza kuwa Hatari sana.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Nassir).(Ctd.): Kwa wakati huu., Wakristo na Waislamu wa Mombasa na pwani nzima, wanamwomba Munga sana ili jam bo hili lisitokee tena kwa sababu ishara yake nzuri hata kidogo.Kuna mtu mmoja kutoka .Chuo kikuu cha Nairobi ambaye alitushauri tusiogope, lakini je, kuna mtu yeyote asiyeogopa kifo? Kwa hivyo, ningeiomba Serikali yetu, kupitia kwa Bunge hili tukufu, iwafahamishe wananchi wa Mombasa na pwani nzima, kupitia kwa redio na magazeti, inafikiria nini juu ya tetemeko hili la ardhi, na itawasaidia kwa njia gani ili wave salama.

P.S. MASINDE: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this bill First of all I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Minister for Labour for bringing this bill to the House o At the moment, our country has a lot of manpower because the majority of our people are ready to work, and I am sure that these people would contribute more to our development, if they worked under proper conditionsMr. Speaker, Sir, when the Minister introduced this Bill last week, he said, that the previous amendment to the Factories Apt were made in 1961. This means that from that time up to now, there are factory buildings which have become outdated It is true that some of these factories could be manufacturing products, -whose by-products may be harmful to our people I would therefore request the Ministry to straightaway check on these buildings to make sure that their sanitation is up to standard,, They should also make sure that ventilation, lighting and other specifications are up to the required standards for the welfare of the workerMr. Speaker, Sir, in order to "be productive in our work, we need workers with, fear tip Bodies and minds. The ordinary worker must be well –fed and in order to 'feed well, he will have to "be paid well too. At the same time, the working condition in x his place of work where he spends the greater part of the day, must he conducive to his health.. For this reason, it should fee made compulsory for employers to have their employees medically examined periodically, particularly when This would assist employers to detect any illness caused: "by these factories or otherwise Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are factories in this country that produce gas, asbestos, carbon blocks and so on. V11 these materials are harmful and therefore, the employers should be make sure that regular medical check-up is undertaken for all the employees. These medical, check Tips should be undertaken by x thoroughly qualified doctors. It is not good enough for us to make a legislation here and say that all workers should be provided with protective clothing s which include overalls, masks, goggles .and so on,, if the employers are not going to make sure that their employees use these things while working I am saying this because ji majority of employees who are inclined to work without protective clothing, particularly if the factory is not properly ventilated For example, it may be too hot in the factory and. Therefore the workers decide to remove either the masks or the goggles thereby making themselves susceptible to the harmful fumes that would otherwise have been stopped by wearing these things.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Minister for including a prevision for the introduction of occupational health committee in this Bill. "This committee is very important and therefore, I would like to urge the Minister to make sure that the formation of the committee is widespread. The committee should include experts in various fields many people are inclined to think that the Factories Act concerns only the safety of workers,machinery and so forth, hut this is not the case It is important for this committee to include doctors and not just general practitioners These doctors should "be 9s well qualified and knowledgeable in the side- effects of say, asbestos, gas and so on. They should also be knowledgeable on illnesses that are caused by pollution in factories. Committee should also include engineers who are able to find cut whether the machines in the factories have been properly fixed. The committee should also include architects who should be able to find out whether they specifications for each employee doing a particular sort of job are proper for that employee, this is to make sure that the lives of our workers are not sacrificed. The members of this committee should be people of high integrity.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MB. J.P. MASINDE (CTD)Mr. Speaker, Sir, some people are inclined to- brush off things after getting convinced by employers chat certain things are going to he done. You will find that some of these employers manage to get .certificates when in fact the premises we are approving are not suitable for human beings to work in. The officers who issue these certificates are helping the employers to murder our people. These should he people of integrity. They should be people capable of advising on various fields. They should be able to look after the lives of workers as well as their families.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Occupational Health Committee should not only be representatives but We have been informed that the Minister intends to set up an .inspectorate. but this new department may not be able to function differently from the department which has been functioning under the Commissioner of Labour. A special .emphasis should be placed on the work being done by these inspectors." They should do their inspection thoroughly and they should know exactly for what the factories are producing." They should be able to pinpoint the most hazardous areas, look at them and make sure that they are properly looked after. This should even include the disposal of wastes from these factories.Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is quite occasional that these factory inspectors go into the factories pair look only at the setting of the machines. They do not examine what these factories are doing. An inspector who goes to inspect a factory should go there knowing exactly what he is required to do. He should not rely on the factory owner to tell him everything. He should know «.n the products being manufactured there. Doctors, engineer’sand. Psychiatrists should be involved in this work of inspection.?MR. J.P. MASINDE (CTDJMr. Speaker, Sir, I note. With pleasure that the Minister intends to create a fund to run the scheme. But financial problems never seem to end in this country. I would also like to caution here that these funds should "be used .for the welfare of the workers." The funds should be used to make sure that the worker works xander healthy conditions. These funds should also assist in the education of the workers The factory inspectors should also "be taken for refresher courses. This is "because we have very .vital factories which produced very modern and advanced items in country. We do not expect inspectors who were employed by the Ministry at one time to know everything about the new factories that, are being established in this country. So, this money should be used also to" train these inspectors."'- I can "only hope that there is not going to be frustration, in the use of this money as has been the case with the training levy and particularly. In the motor. Industry."I know that we have had employers, who have : not been able. to claim, training levy from the- Ministry despite the fact- they have paid for the training of our young men and  women. This sort of thing discourages the-employers." So, these funds should hot "be. Used to frustrate the employers as well as the' workers just the way the training levy has been used.Mr. Speaker, Sir, while appreciating that theFactories (Amendment) Bill is quite different from the Workmen's Compensation Act I hope that a Bill seeking to amend the Workmen's Compensation Act will soon be Tabled in this House. Although this Act caters for- those who get injured while working, I would suggest that should an accident occur in any factory due to "the negligence of the, employer, such an employer should be punished. Such employers should be punished heavily. The present' punishment is very light.?MR. J.P. MASINDEThere should, be a heavy punishment to restrain employers from acting carelessly when handling machines and human "beings in the factories.With those few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the bill<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.

SPEAKER: PIGA KENGELE.<\NEWSPEECH>(The .Division Bell was rung)<NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: We have a quorum now. You may continue. Mr.Kyalo.THE MINISTER OP STATE, OFPICE OP THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Kyalo): MR. Speaker, Sir, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to speak in support of this Bill.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill has come at the right moment, because, as you are l aware, Kenya is becoming an industrial country, and the way the Bill is framed is such that it paves the way for this move. That is why I have said that the Bill has come at the right moment.Mr. Speaker, Sir one looks at the bill one notices a few issues that are very important for industrialisation of this country. One of them is the safety of workers. On page 21, the safety of workers has been given prominencer and this is a landmark in our industrial policy, and the sort, of policies that we should follow in future. A National Advisory Committee on Occupational and Health Safety of Workers has been established to look after not only the welfare of workers, and not only the welfare workers of-the Trorliorc brut also to ensure that this country follows the right policy. If you go through the list of the' Ministries and Departments that-have been included in this Committee, it appears – all as if. Practically ALL the Ministries that can play a part in ensuring that this country will follow safety measures for the workers been considered.What I would like to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that once this Committee - the National Advisory Committee - has been set up, it should look into the various aspects of its workers and ensure that workers in this country are safe, as this .will result to higher production, and also ensure that this countryman industrial country.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Kyalo) (Ctd.):Mr. Speaker, Sir, while this has "been provided for in the Bill, there are certain aspects of our industrialisation which should "be looked into. One of the major- problems that we are facing is pollution. When you go round the country- you will find that pollution is a big problem that we are going to face for a long time to come, whether it is from factories, industries, or other sources. But the biggest danger that we are likely to face is pollution from industries. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when you move around and look particularly at our rivers which pass through our towns or City, you will been surprised to note that the pollution that we are' creating in our industries today is not something that is being taken care of. When you move round Nairobi it is the same thing. As you drive  down towards Mombasa, when you reach Athi River, the first thing that you come across is the pollution of air; a thing that has been taken care of in. other countries.Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of this pollution or the pollution that we are creating can be prevented without taxing the industries in question. One would not like to say that	difficult to prevent pollution. But what I am saying is that time has come for -this country to ensure that pollution is prevented as early as possible, and that we do not have to wait until all the rivers and all the air has been polluted man than we wake up to the situation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in so far as areas that pollution has been created are concerned, I think that the local authorities together with the Government should join hands together with the industrialists concerned to ensure that pollution is prevented One does not need to "be an expert one pollution to find out what has happened because when you look-at our rivers you see the sortTHE MINISTER OP STATS, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Kyalo) (Ctd.): of metals that are coming out of those industries and those metals are just flowing into rivers. This pollution is likely to create problems that can be dangerous to this country.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we know that it is expensive to; prevent ? some of the pollution that is being created by industries. But. if plans are made on time, this is something that can be prevented, And, as I have stated, local authorities the Government and the industries themselves should be able to do this.When it comes to other aspects of pollution, one finds that there are problems that have to be solved. For instance problem of disposal of waste matter. This is also connected with pollution Disposal of waste matter, in so far as this country is concerned, is lagging behind. You will find that industries have been put up in areas where disposal system has not-been, given priority I think, that time has come for this country also to ensure that once it has been agreed upon-that a particular area is going to be an industrial centre, proper system, for sewerage, and other- aspects of disposal are looked into Once we ignore- this.-fact we shall -run .into tremendous-problem at a-later stage It will-be very difficult and expensive to prevent some of- the damages that have been-caused  as a result  of riot taking care - of: some- of these problemsTHE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Kyalo) (ctd.): I do not think that it is very difficult to ensure that disposal of industrial waste is taken care of. What we need is to make sure that local authorities, where industries are likely to be built can borrow money for the purposes of disposing industrial waste. I am-sure that we have adequate engineer’s to.look into the matter and enable us to prevent damages that are likely to be created as a result of ignoring this aspect.Mr. Speaker, Sir, this also leads into the. question of infrastructure. Industrial and factory buildings go hand in hand with the type of infrastructure that have been created. One of the biggest problems we have is that of getting enough water for some of these places where we are building industries, and it is not difficult to provide water. What we need are concerted efforts, by the Ministry of Water Development and the local authorities concerned to ensure that there, is of water in these places.. It has not been easy to do that, and in some areas where industries have been built, you find that in cases of fire breaking out there is no way of extinguishing it because of lack of water. I think the time has come when we should look into the question of. Provision of water if. We are going to. Industrialize this country as fast as we want.Sir, although electricity has been provided in-some areas. where industries are coming up, the electrification. has not been adequate. For any factory, to be operational, there has to be adequate supply of electricity. We know that, our demand for electricity is ignore than what we can supply but, at the-same time, we must remember that if a nation is to be industrialized, there has to be enough power.Turning to the question of infrastructure in general I think this country can be industrialized faster to ensure that there is employment. We should think and plan ahead in order to provide a lot of these things.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think this Bill is an improvement on what has ever existed before, and what we need is to ensure that the provisions of the Bill, are complied with in so far as these various aspects concerned In particular,THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Kyalo) (ctd.):we should ensure that the workers in industrial concerns are properly catered for of course, without happy workers we cannot be efficient in so far as industrialisation is concerned.Sir, I think there are other certain aspects which should be looked into in order to ensure that we cope with the various aspects of our industrial policies. To do that, I think the time has come for this country to realize that industrial development and all other aspects go hand in hand in the improvement of the climate to investment. We should be in a position to encourage both local and foreign investors by providing whatever is required.With those few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mr. Mak’Anyengo):Ahsante sana, Bw. Spika, kwa kunipa nafasi hii ili nami niseme maneno mawili au matatu juu ya Mswada huu. Kwa hakika, ninamshukuru Waziri wa Wafanyakazi kwa kuuleta Mswada huu hapa ili tuweze kufanya marekebisho juu ya sheriaiile ya zamani.Ama kwa hakika, wafanyakazi ni lazima wafanye kazi mahali. ambapo si hatari kwa maisha yao. Kwa mfano, wafanyakazi wanaofanya kazi katika viwanda vya nguo wanafaa kuangaliwa vizuri sana ili maisha yao yasihatarishwe na vumbi inayotokana na pamba. Kungekuwa na sheria kwamba wenye viwanda vya nguo ni lazima wawapatie wafanyakazi wao vifaa vya kujikinga kutokana na vumbi ya pamba. Vile mambo yalivyo sasa ni kwamba wafanyakazi wanadanganywa kidogo kwa kupatiwa maziwa baada ya kazi. ni ni wazi kwamba maziwa hayawezi kuondoa vumbi ya pamba kabisa. Wakati mwingine unapata kwamba wafanyakazi wanaoandikwa katika viwanda vya aina hiyo hupatwa na maradhi ya akili. Ni maoni yangu kwamba sheria yafaa itungwe ili kuwatetea wafanyakazi wa viwanda vya nguo.Bw. Spika, sisi kama wanasiasa tumezungumza mengi kuhusu viosk ambavyo  vinawapikia wafanyakazi wa viwandani chakula. Ninafikiri kivamba wakati umefika ambapo Waziri wa Wafanyakazi angeweka sheria kwamba kila mahali ambapo kuna kiwanda kinachoajiri wafanyakazi 20 kuwe a canteen safi ambapo wafanyakazi wanapata chakula bora. Ni kweli kwamba chakula kinachopikiwa katika viosk huwasaidia wafanyakazi.THE ASSISTANT MINER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mr. Mak'Anyengo)(ctd.): lakini huwa si kisafi na huwa ni hatari kwa afya ya wafanyakazi. Ikiwa katika Mswada tunaozunguaizia hakuna sheria kama hiyo, basi yafaa Waziri aurekebishe na amshurutishe kila tajiri mwenye kiwanda kikubwa, hasa kama yule anayeajiri zaidi ya wafanyakazi 20, kuwa akitoa chakula kwa wafanyakazi hao kwa njia inayofaa na inayoaabatana na afya nzuri.Jambo la tatu, Bw.Spika, linahusu ajali viwandani. Kuna wafanya kazi wengine ambao husafirishwa kwenda na kutoka kazini na niagari ya makampuni. Ingefaa sheria iwekwe ili kuwasaidia wafanyakazi kama hawa ambao mara kwa mara wanapatikana na ajali wakisafirishwa na magari ya kampuni. Inavyoonekana sasa ni kwamba inachukuliwa mfanyakazi atalipwa ridhaa akiunmia akiwa kazini, lakini, vile vile, inafaa kuonekanakwamba mfanyakazi yuko kazini hata anaposafirishwa na gari la kampuniTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mr. Mak'Anyengo) (ctd.):Bw. Spika, jambo lingine linahusu conpensation kwa wafanj kazi. Ni lazima wakati malipo haya yanapofanywa uchunguzi ufanywe ili mfanyakazi huyc ajulikane kama ana watu wengine ambao walikuwa ranamtegeniea kabla ya kuumia. Hii kwa sababu kiwango cha asilimia kinachopendekezwa na madaktari huwa kidogo sana. Iia itufai  kuendelea kufuata sheria ambazo ziliwekwa na wabeberu ambako malipo yaliyotolewa kwa mfanyakazi yalikywa chini ya bei ya ng'ombe. Kwa hivyo, ingawa tangu tupat Uhuru sheria kama hizo zemerekebishwa bado zinahitaji kurekebishwa zaidi ili ziambatane na dhamani va maisha ya binadamu. Kwa hivyo, Waziri anafaa aliliangalie jambo hili ili wakati mfanyakazi anapofariki maisha yake yachunguzwe ili ijulikane kama alikuwa na responsibilities gani ili alipwe kulingana  na mahitaji ya vale aliowaacha.Jambo lingine linahusu agro-industries au viwanda vinavyo- jengwa huko mashambani. Ingawa kuna sheria zinazoambatana na ustawishaji wa viwanda hivi ili visichafue mazingira, utaoua kwarmba kwa wakati huu si viwanda vyote vinavyozifuata hizi sheria. Hii ni kwa sababu unaweza kuona mabaki na maji machafu yanayotoka katika viwanda kama hivi yakichanganyika pamoja na maji ya mito. Kukifanyika hivyo wananchi wanaoyatumia maji ya mito hiyo hupata shida sana kwani hayo maji ndiyo wanayotumia kwa mahitaji yao pamojana ya wanjrama wao. Kwa hivyo, katika kupittsha huu mswada Waziri angehakikisha Icwamba hivi viwanda vinazifuata kabisa sheria zilizowekwa kuzuia uchafuzi wa mazingira.Jambo la mwisho linahusu manispaa. Kwa mfano katika njia ya kwenda South Nyanza kutoka Kisii kuna mahali panapoitwa Daraja Mbili ambako luchafu wote utokao Kisii unawekwa huko. Katika mahali hapo hapo kuna mahali pamekaa kama ziwa ndogo hivi kwanto kuna harufu mbaya. Kwa kuwa kuna wananchi wanaoishi karibu na hapoTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mr. Mak'Anyengo) (ctd. ):jambo hili lisiporekebishwa maisha yao yanaweza kuwa katika hatari. Kunafaa kuw na sheria ambayo itayalinda maisha ya wananchi kutokana na mambo kama haya. Kwa hayo machache, naunga mambo mkono.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY. (Mr. M’Mukindia): Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to support this very timely Bill whose amendments create a fully-pledged factory inspectorate which will have more responsibilities. This Bill is welcome for that fact and more for the fact that it creates the National Advisory Committee for occupational health and safety. The Bill has further enumerated the members of that committee. . Finally, the Bill is also welcome because of the formation of Occupational Health and Safety Fund which will assist in caring out research and advising the Minister on what steps to take to ensure that the health of factories workers is improved and maintained.	One of the items that I note is not clearly explained is fire prevention. Although fire prevention comes under, the Factories Act, it is possible that we have to look into more details on the aspect of fire prevention. For this reason, I think there is; a need of forming say a special national fire prevention agency or committee that will specifically look at fire problems in factories and buildings. This will ensure that we have a co-ordinated approach; towards fire prevention in factories and buildings. I am saying so because most all building especially here in Nairobi have yet to meet the international fire prevention requirements. In fact, most of them £a do not meet fire prevention requirements. This is because in such buildings you will find that fire escapes which can be used in case of a fire breakout are locked. In the event of a fire breaking out most of the occupants of these buildings would perish.TIIE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. M'Mkindia) (ctd.): This means that the buildings themselves are fire-traps. So the Minister should look into this and if possibly have a committee that will be advising him on fire prevention measures b where and when necessary. This might include ensuring that such tall buildings have their own firefighting pumps or equipment.The other item, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is on section 42, sub section 2 (c) and (d) where warnings on dangerous gases chemicals’ have to be displayed. It is stated here that the warning has to be in either Kiswahili, English or any other locally understood language. We know that most people in this country are versed in both Kiswahili and English languages; but not everybody in this country can read and understand English,-. I-would therefore suggest it is made mandatory to have the warnings first in Kiswahili so that every person in this country can understand what the contents of the container are. We can then, of course, have the warning written in English as a second warning. This will cater for those workers who might not be well versed in the English language.The others good news in the Bill is that those factory workers who might be exposed to dangerous chemicals or fumes or generally those who usual^ work in dangerous and risky environments will be subjected to medical check-ups. In the Bill it is further stated that it is not only the current employees who will be medically checked but also those who retire. It is a well-known fact that it is not all employers who are safety-conscious because in some cases, employees you will find employers preferring casual employees for risky jobs to permanent workers. Such employers have no obligations because these casual workers are not employees as such. I think the- Bill should clearly define what an employee is - whether a casual worker who works in a dangerous environment for week, two weeks or a year is an employee or whether we mean some body on regular employment.TIE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY (M'Mkindia) Ctd:Mr. Speaker, Six, I think the Minister should consider coming upwith a policy to the effect that ; casual workers should not be .333201 exposed to dangerous environments which will force them to seek medical attention • from the employer. The question of medical attention for employees is extremely important and we know that they have "been .exposed to dangerous chemicals, fumes and radiation in various industries. I would suggest that the Minister looks again at the possibility of applying this particular retroactively clause retroactively with regard to those employees who may have, worked in dangerous environments so that they can also benefit because they contributed', something to the well-being of that factory or the employer. In other words, once this Bill becomes an Act, those who have already left employment should also benefit.The other item that is of utmost importance is research and development on occupational health and safety. Obviously, ours. Environment here is - different from that of the western countries whose laws we have been following. As a matter of urgency, I. think the "formation of the research fund ought to be done so that" it can start work and advice the Minister accordingly. On the membership of the national Advisory Committee on Occupational Health and Safety, I' note that it does Not include, an expert from the Attorney-General's Chambers. I think the Minister should look.into it as to see whether it would not be appropriate to. include somebody who is knowledgeable in labour laws, perhaps, from the Attorney-Generals Chambers to be part and parcel of that committee because he will, be able to= advice on the legal implications of whatever the committee would deal with . In this way, it would not have to go to the Attorney-General's Chambers for approval before it goes to the Minister.THE ASSISTANT MEJISESR FOR ENERGY (Mr. M'Mkindia) Ctd:While looking at the schedules, I noted that in the seventh schedule itemizes various dangerous environments. Although I may have missed it, I see that radiation is not explicitly mentioned. I think that ' the danger from nuclear, X-ray or other forms of radiation, ought to be mentioned explicitly so that we know that it is covered also. Since the effects of radiation are felt many years after the act, it would, therefore, be appropriate to include it rather explicitly as one of the dangerous environments.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>(Mr. Speaker left the Chair)The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. kagwima) took the Chair)In general, you will find that most industries will always complain about the cost of safety precautions. They always say that improving the environment will cost something and they may come back to the Minister and say "Look, this is too expensive. We cannot be able to meet all these strict regulations because it would be too expensive." I think this is where, perhaps, the Minister can have a look at the possibility of giving physical incentives to industries to see whether they can implement some of these safety requirements.Generally, if you do not improve the safety environment, somehow, the cost would be realised through medical expenses of injured workers and so on. Therefore, it would be useful to improve the working environment and to give some incentives to the £ industries so that they can implement whatever the factories inspectorate and the national advisory committee on occupational health and safety proposesWe should also look at the possibility of reducing the usage of dangerous chemicals in manufacturing, such as, lead. I have in mind for example, oil refining and water piping where the usage of lead affects workers in an adverse manner.This is also the case where asbestos is concerned.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER "FOR ENERGY (Mr. M'Mkindia) Ctd:Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, some of these things would, lead to changes in the manufacturing process and it is something which is quite E± complicated. I am not quite sure whether this will fall -under the factories inspectorate or other Ministries out certainly, it is a question that should be addressed with regard to whether certain manufacturing processes are appropriate for the kind of environment that we want to create. If they are not appropriate we should look into what other manufacturing processes can then be used to replace those in existence.Again, there is the cost element here cut I believe that the creation of a better environment will also be able to absolve that cost. In the same vein, I believe, that the question, of the relationship between occupational health and safety and general pollution ought to be looked into. I have a feeling that without;-drawing and possibly implementing a stricter pollution control law, a lot of the requirements of the Factories-Act-would not be met.  They ought to be synchronized in such a manner that certain manufacturing processes should be used so that pollution to the employees and to the- environment as a whole can be controlled. For example, if you look at a cement factory, you will find that employees breathe in a lot of fumes and dust that comes out of. The chimneys.. "You will also find that people x living about two kilometres from the factory, also breath in the same fumes and dust. As for as this bill is concerned, it only covers the people who are within that- factory, when a bigger population outside the factory is also affected.I believe that we need to have a pollution control law in line with the amended Factories Bill. In this way, we will not enforce things-that are not possible although we may wish to do so.With those few remarks, I beg to support<\NEWSPEECH>The assistant minister for technical training  aid applied technology<NEWSPEECH>(Mr. Thuo): Asante sana, Bw.

KIPKORIR: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to contribute to this Bill. When you look at this Bill, you find that it is meant for those people who work in our factories. As you are aware, Kenya is a developing country, and we need to follow our President's advice to the effect that all wananchi be very co-operative. This applies especially to those who are in charge of industries. In that they should really work and assist our President to co-ordinate the needy sections of our industrial procedure. It is high time that Kenyans really contributed positively to the development of this country.We have many industries, and we must congratulate our Government on maintaining the position of peace, love and unity. We must also congratulate His Excellency the President on being the most sincere and wise leader who has accepted to serve this country properly. We must accept his wise leadership. Those of us who are behind the President must contribute positively and productively. Since Kenya is a growing country, we need a lot manpower, income and products in order to feed the nation, whose population is increasing, day after day. It is the duty and responsibility of Cabinet Ministers, Assistant Ministers and the Executive arm of the Government to look into the question of' industries. These industries should be spread to rural areas so that the people there, instead of flocking into towns, stay and work in the rural areas. Small Jua Kali fanning industries should be centralized to the district level. I must congratulate the Government on having created various institutions where wananchi can seek support. The Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation in particular should be decentralized so that its money may be given to efficient Kenyans who are willing to develop this country. If our economy grows bigger, more people will be employed in various sectors.. I know that there a few people who are not interested in this country. We should condemn this kind of people and not allow them to run industries here. They should be sacked and allowed to stay at home in order to make sure that every industry is productive. In this case, our people will be protected.As you are aware, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, education has become very expensive. We are faced with the so—called cost-sharing, and our people have no money to meet this cost-sharing. The cost of books and other educational materials has gone up, and it has become very difficult for the ordinary mwananchi to get money. I appeal to the Government to send out more experts to our farming sector in rural areas to advise wananchi there through public rallies and ensure that everybody works and contributes to the economy of the country. This will ensure that there is no failure at all<\NEWSPEECH>	<NEWSPEECH>AN HON. MEMBER: Why are you crying?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.

KIPKORIR: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have said that I am appealing to the Government, especially the Executive arm of it, to implement wananchi's decisions so that there may be development all over the- country.We have people who are interested in keeping livestock, which is a very useful type of industry because it can produce a lot of milk, besides other products. However, a time comes when you find that there is some failure on the part of the Ministry concerned in sending out experts to look into the well-being of these animals. There was a time recently when several thousands of animals died in my home area. We appealed to the Ministry concerned to send out an expert to look into this problem, but it has become difficult for the few officers available to look into the problem. It is our duty jointly to advise our people on how they can be protected. This can be done by calling them and advising them in our meeting, in chiefs barazas Kanu rallies and so on.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it must be appreciated that. Our country is very productive.. We have coffee, pyrethrum and other cash crops that are needed in the markets. It is our-duty, therefore, to assist in their continued production. I appreciate one fact that the people in my constituency are very hard working so that there are many developments in the area.  Mr. Temporary 'Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to request the Minister for Agriculture to visit my constituency. There are very many problems in my constituency. Sir, our President has occasionally asked us to visit every area of our country in order to give our people the necessary help. Sir, managers of some industries in this country are very bad. There is a company in Nairobi which is known as Philips International, where workers are mistreated. The managers of that company have no respect for their workers at all. The workers of that company are frustrated a great deal Sometimes some workers are given compulsory leave, but when they come back they are told that there is no employment for them because the company is not making any profits. How can that company treat a person who has Worked there for 20 years like that? Sir, the company has no respect for workers at all Therefore would like to request the Government to investigate the activities of that company. I do not "want that company to be protected^ there is no need of protecting somebody who is wrong.Sir, I would like to appeal to the Ministry of Labour to make sure that workers are not frustrated. We fought for u. our Independence so that we can match majestically in. this country and foster development. Sir, there should be no room for frustration of our people in this country. We should protect our " country as Kenyans.Sir, I would also like to say that we said should take moreindustries to the rural areas, and also expand the already existing ones. We should also encourage farmers to carry on with irrigation work. I would also like to congratulate the Government? for creating the Ministry of reclamation and Development of Arid, Semi-Arid and wastelands, so that it can help in reclaiming of arid and semi-arid lands of this country. That part of industrialisation. Our people can be employed in that industry, and very many crops can be produced.Sir, T would also like to touch on exportation of goods. Sir, the type of business should be given a priority in the export trade. There are some Kenyans who can run such kind of business very successfully, and therefore they should be given that opportunity. Sir, just before I conclude, I would like to talk about employment in Kenya. Sir, whenever c vacancies for employment occur, Kenyans should be given those jobs, regardless Of their position and where they come from. I would like to request industries and the Nairobi City Commission to assist people with low education, so that, they can also cam .a living. "These people also have their own families and they would like to develop just like anybody else. We should not consider those people: with good qualifications only we should also consider those people with low qualifications. We should consider the welfare of a person without considering, his professional qualifications. Sir all people for example, cannot passing division one  Most of the students at the rural schools only manage- to get either division three or four, and therefore, I think that they should also be assisted.- If we do not assists such people they will become a , problem to this country in future. He should be as absorbed in our industries so that he can also earn a living.I would like, to appeal to the Minister it is possible. Those people who are in a position to employ should & help those low qualified people.?Sir, His Excellency the President has occasionally asked us to be mindful of other people’s welfare.with those few remarks, I beg to support the Bill<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKAU: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.First of all, I would like to commend and congratulate the Minister for Labour for having brought this Bill for amendment. This is a very important Bill, especially for a country that has embarked on industrialisation. Sir, the Factories Act that used to govern factories before did not look into the welfare of employees to make sure that they are protected as far as the health is concerned .that bill was enacted in 1954. The Bill has got some sections which are very important. The Bill seeks to set up an inspectorate under where an inspector of factories will be appointed As far as the factories are concerned, work will be easier All the workconcerning industries used to be done by individuals about now inspectorate will, be set up. There will be some efficiency in factories since operation will be checked by inspectors.Sir, if you visit some industries at the Industrial Area, you will find some workers locked up in factories the inspectors check and take sure that people are not locked up in factories so that if factories catches fire, the workers can escape. Therefore, the setting up an inspectorate is a very important factor of this BillSir, the other very important amendment that has been included is the creation of an occupational health and funds. That is a very important development„ The Bill is asking the employer to contribute to their employees medical scheme there health should be taken care the bill  says that if a factory is. .handling toxic material, the workers will be medically checked by before they start working there while working there and also during their retirement. That is a very important aspect, because the health of the employees well taken care of. Sir, this country is encouraging foreign investment and of also moving into the creation export, processing zone,therefore, it is important to look into the-health of the workers. The foreign investors should check the health of the workers before they are employed, during employment and also on retirement. Sir, the health of the worker is is not only important to himself, ~ but also to the employer also, because if his health is good the production will also be high. The creation of a health fund is part of sharing, and it is very important. The employee. will take care of the medical bills, and that is  a very important development. Sir the important aspect that has introduced in that Bill," is that containers with harmful? Chemicals will be marked. so "that the workers can know the danger that is involved and how they will be handled. That is a very important move<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Mr. MAKAIJ (ctd):This is a very important point because if you looked at the international position, you would find that the health of a worker is of paramount importance to the company for which he works. Today, Sir, there are things that we take for granted to be safe For example, when you take your clothes to the dry cleaners, you never stop to think what kind of chemical they use to clean theme Various countries in the world today, particularly the United States of America, axe doing a lot of research in the chemical?) used for dry- cleaning clothes in order to make sure that whatever is used is safe to the people This is why I said from the very beginning that the introduction of this Bill by the Minister for Labour is very important because it incorporates research, to as make sure that whatever is being produced in the factories or in the industrial plants, is not dangerous to workers in those factoriesMr Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister should make sure that that the inspectors in these factories do their job properly. These inspectors should make sure that these factories maintain the required standards. If a factory is dealing with the production of a given product, the inspectors should make sure that the product is of a required standard. I am saying this because there are certain companies, which come into this country and start producing goods of very inferior quality. I was pleased when the Minister was introducing this Bill, to hear him say that some of the standards that are followed in some foreign countries, may not be the standards to be followed. here Therefore, the inspectorate should make sure that they devise standards goods for various factories to make sure that whatever they produce axe of the required standards.Having said that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that one of the things which this Mil is going to do is to motivate factory" workers to be more productive. At the moment, Sir, the most serious problem that we are facing in the country today, is that of unemployment, and the Minister for Labour is well aware of this problem. Every leader in this country, whether in politics, in business or in they will service should bevery much concerned about this problem I am saying this because unemploymentcould be caused by lack of productivity in factories. Therefore, if a worker is not" motivated, his production will he minimal. Therefore, if whatever is in this 11 is going to be passed and implemented, we are going to eliminate the aspect of casual labours in this country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir this Bill provides that each employ err will make sure that his employees undergoes a thorough medical check-up recruitment and periodically in the course of work This means that the factories will employ only those health workers and this would further mean that the factories are going to be very productive. Countries where factories are known to have high productivity, are those where the workers are healthy. I am saying this because if the workers are not healthy, then their productivity will "be low. I am stressing on this problem of unemployment because every boy is aware that it is the most serious problem that we have in this country. We have very highly qualified manpower in this country rand our e due at inn system, especially the current 8-4-4 system is giving our people basic skills. These people moving into-the market in big numbers but they are findingit very difficult-to get employment.. However, we are grateful to the Minister for 3ax bringing this till which will try to make the working place an  idea place for worker and this will enable them to produce more. However, we should ask ourselves what we can do to create employmentMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, everybody is aware that we cannot  look for employment in the public  sector, already the expenditure an salaries is very high and it constitutes 22 per cent of the "budget while the creation of employment there is mm almost non extent. Therefore, we have increasing now to think about/production in the private sector so that we can create employment opportunities there. However, first and foremost, we should ask ourselves what can be done to create more employment in the parietal bodies. I am saying this because Government has invested a lot of money in these bodies with a view to creating employment for our people. His Excellency the President has said time and again that the parastatal bodies that do well should be motivated by having their workers paid better if a parastatal body makes a profit due to its efficiency, then	<\NEWSPEECH>	QUORUM<NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. There is no quorum in the House.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMP0RARY DEFUTY SPEAKER (MR.Kagwima): Yes, there is quorum. Will you ring the Division Bell?(The Division Bell was rung;)THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER  (Mr Kagwima)  We have a quorum now. mil you continue, Mr. Makauo<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>SR. MAKAU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was saying that unemployment problem in this country is very serious and^ therefore, we should all he looking for ways and means of creating employment opportunities for the youth, in this country. I skid that one way in which we could do this is by making sure that parastatal bodies are efficient. If there is efficiency in these bodies, obviously, they would be able to make profits and consequently, there would be expansion which would create employment for the youth in this country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, another thing that we should do to create employment opportunities for our youth, is to encourage private entrepreneurs in this country. If we could encourage our people to start small- scale-industries in this country, there would be more am job-creation There are countries that have done very well in the. world today through the establishment of small-scale industries ([for example, India Therefore, through the encouragement of the jua kali industry, which is a farm of snail- scale industry, we can create jobs for our people.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir here I am referring to kiosk owners. When somebody establishes a kiosk he creates a job not only for himself and members of his family but also for about three to five people So, if we encourage the establishment of small scale industries we will create more employment.' I am happy to note that some EShsJ120 million has been set aside to start small scale industries in the country This is because the future of creation of employment lies with the encouragement of entrepreneurs in this countryMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is a certain trend in this country that should not be allowed to go on unchecked." If that trend is not checked there will creation of more and more unemployment in the country."1 when you read. the newspapers you will find that there are very many companies that are- going under receivership in this country^ This means that the moment a company goes under receivership unemployment is created So the time has come for us here to try and do what other countries and particularly the "United States of America, have done In the United States of America. - they have enacted laws regarding   companies that go under receivership  in the U.S  if a company finds itself unable to continue with production, it . resort to what they call Chapter Eleven  At one time I mentioned here that such- laws are used to prevent companies from being liquidated If we  adopt such  laws in this country we will be able to create more employment for Kenyans.": This. is because if a company goes under receivership, unemployment is created for the youth." We should encourage foreign investors to come and invest in our country. Those in-problems should be helped so that they can continue to offer employment to our peopleMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am happy the Attorney-General is here to hear what I am going to say.' The success of industry in America and other countries is as a result of those countries having enacted laws to ensure that companies do not go under receivership so easily. If we do not encourage investors to come to this country we will continue to have unemployment in the country." We should encourage. The creation of jobs in both the private and public sectorsMr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, another area that I would like to touch on is the area of joint ventures arid particularly where foreign investors are involved. We should encourage foreign investors to come to this country and set up joint ventures with our people. I am happy that the Export Processing Zone is going to he able to encourage more joint ventures in this country and that is going to create more jobs for our people.Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we should address the problem of unemployment in this country because it is a very serious problem. People in the private and public sectors should find ways and means of solving this problem of unemployment." I say so because this country has been very successful as far as the education of the youth is concerned." The 8-4-4- system of education-" ~ is equiping the children with basic skills.' Training opportunities in this countries are very many and as far as the availability of manpower in this country is concerned, I would like to say that this country has sufficient manpower. So, we should find ways and means of creating more employment in this country.' We must be able to create employment from within and that is why I am saying that we should encourage our local people to start industries inthis country. We should do everything within our power to encourage foreigners to come and invest in this country and create employment for our people.? MR MAKAU ( CTD);If that is done, tins country will definitely prospers Kenyais a good country where investors can come and. invest." We shouldsustain a good climate that is conducive to foreign investment. I sayso because the Factories (Amendment) Hill is linked with the motivation of- our workers. So, the Minister for Labour did a very good thing to bring this amendment to the House." This Sill is very important to this country, as we prepare ourselves for the creation of Export Processing Zones.' This is because when investors come to this country they should find us ready with the necessary mechanism that will ma tee it easy for them to operate in our country. The amendment to the Factories Act is a relevantmechanism intended to ensure protection for the Kenyan worker.' This is because as we expose ourselves to the international investment market, we will get people from all over the worlds If they find that they can save by spending less on the worker All investors are looking-for profits." We are now setting, the proper. mechanism to protect- and motivate: the Kenyan, worker, by amending the' Factories Act.. This Bill must be supported-by everybody .Mt. it an important Bill which is going to bring about industrial: revolution: in this countryWith those few remarks, beg to support the Bill<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MANGOLI: Thank you very much, Mr Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to contribute on this very important Bill." It is a very important 3ill "because it touches oh the security and welfare of factory workers in this country. I would, like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister, for Labour for Presenting this Bill to the House in such a nice manner.' But I hope that whatever is contained in this Bill will be implemented to the letter? This is because we pass Bills here but at the end of the day they are never implemented So whatever we say here .may never be put into practice. So, I request the Minister to .make sure that he implements this 31.11 His Excellency the President .said here during the State Opening that he even knew the conditions under which the ordinary mwananchi is working in the industries^ If you pay a visit to one of these factories to see how the ordinary mwananchi is treated, especially as it pertains to the handling of dangerous materials, you really wonderSir, I one time visited a factory that deals with soda ash. The person, off-loading the soda ash. does not look' like a human being and. yet the factory owners are driving sleek Mercedes Benz- vehicles," their children, living comfortably and., so on." I am hoping that the purpose of. this Bill will be to clean thosewananchi who are made to look like monkeys in those factories;" This is why I believe that this Bill hgs been brought here at the right time and the Minister should move in immediately so that he has his inspectors doing their work in the factories, as is proposed here.1 If we do not follow up on what we pass here, we will not be doing anything helpful to those poor wananchi in the factories who are sufferingSir, some of these people have had their hands chopped off and no compensation is paid even over a period of 20 years While that is happening to the poor mwananchi, the bloody Mhindi MR.

I am praying that the essence of this amendment will he to look after the interests of such wananchi who have actually been working in bondage in the-factories.These people have suffered a lot. Even there are other areas too where people have suffered equally. Maybe these areas of the Bill will be amended when the Minister comes to reply.

I am capable of bringing their names here, if given time. So, I am saying that they should be looked after under this Bill. The Attorney-General drafted this Bill very well and catered for these people. So, they are going to benefit. There are also other people that' I want the Minister, to take note of. There are other.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): .On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The question of a worker who has been injured in a factory is an extremely important one", for an employer and investors, and the way the worker is treated afterwards. We have the Workmen's Compensation Act under which those workers are looked. after, and under which it is also required that an accident must be reported Immediately and the matter looked after. Now, if the hon Member is making a statement that here have been employees who have been injured, in that'-way and they have been neglected and ignored, he .should then substantiate that.. Now, if he does not mean that, he either puts the record straight or-withdraws because it-is damaging to keep that on.-record.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.MANG’OLI: Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker,' I am not with drawing anything!* It is common practice There are many Africans outside here whose hands have been cut or chopped off and they have never been compensated.

You have already made a ruling to the effect that either the hon.Member substantiates, or withdraws his allegation. My point of order is that every hon. Member- is responsible for any utterance in the House   because the hon.Member made am categorical statement -to the effect that a. mwananchi'.s hand was cut off and a Mhindi is "driving, a Mercedes benz and nobody is compensated. That was a categorical statement. So he-either.

I do not think it is any longer necessary to know whether Mr. Mr.Mang’oil is going to "bring any names or not The 'fact is   that you had made a ruling that he should withdraw his allegation, and he should stick to that. !<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Yes, I think, Mr. Ogle is quite right because I had already made my ruling. I had already made a ruling by which I still stand. So, my ruling still stands. !<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BOY:  On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy': Speaker.

(Mr. Kagwima): I think, hon.” Member we should  be serious with our Standing Orders If the hon. Member had made that request before I made my ruling, I' would. Definitely have considered it.'

Mang'oli. You have been here long enough, and I am sure you are very clear in your mind how to go about substantiating your remarks. That being clear to you, you can substantiate by laying on the Table documentary evidence to prove that a certain worker in a. certain factory was injured and the case has not been reported and the worker has not been compensated. Unless you have another special way of substantiating, that is what is required by our Standing Orders.MR. MANG’OLI: Unless I. am required to bring the fellow here physically, his name is Otieno, who was working with a wholesale factory.HON. MEMBERS: Substantiate! Substantiate!<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER.FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL. DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Ogle): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir. We have one million and_ one.

You- so wish.<\NEWSPEECH> (There was noise in the House)<NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Order, hon. Members. Mr. Mang'oli, you have mentioned a Mr. Otieno. Can we know it is Otieno from which factory? We are not going-backwards. We are not going by facts that you cannot prove, otherwise you will be asking for more points of order - calling upon you to substantiate, and you have not even substantiated your earlier remarks.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL HERITAGE (Mr. Lalampaa): On a point of order, Mr Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Was it in order for hon. Mang'oli to just stand there as if he was crossing We buy Market when you were making your ruling?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Hon. Members, this is the last bit of it. I do not want to go on making further rulings on this matter because my original ruling is very clear that hon. Mang'oli either withdraws his remarks or substantiate them.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MANG'OLI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, and the person I was referring to is known as George Otieno Onyango, and he was working with Ramisi Factory, Kwale District. If the Minister wants to see the gentleman, then I can come with him here. <\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr.Kagwima): Hon. Mang'oli, you may carry on with your contribution.. The. Chair is satisfied that you have substantiated your- remarks.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MANG'OLI: Thank. You, Mr.Temporary. Deputy Speaker, for your able' counsel over that point of order. I. Appreciate that you had to really strain your— self to enable the. Ministers, to understand my point.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are some factory employees who have worked for- over- six years as casuals, and I. Urge the Minister' to implement this law to ensure that those workers who have served -for the stipulated period as casuals are absorbed on permanent basis. In fact, there are even some Government corporations that have been employing workers on casual. Terms for over three years. If we are really enacting this factory law, we should take, the interests of such workers into account. After all, the people who really matter in the manufacturing industry are the ones who operate the machines, and who are employed casual terms. Those are the ones who should be employed on permanent terms and even be pensionable. It is,, therefore, important for the Minister to ensure that all casuals, who have served for more than three months are employed permanently I even thought that the amendments being proposed by the Attorney-General included that provision.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir; I do appreciate that the scope of the Bill is wide and that it touches on very important areas. I have been to some of our factories here and I have seen some of the dangerous-chemicals that workers are exposed to. In fact, some of the workers are no longer men because of beingexposed to these highly dangerous chemicals. This/particular Bill is very important because Wazungu will understand that. Africans have taken over. The Bill, in its original form, -had denied Africans the right to be medically examined and to be given proper medical treatment. I am happy that the Minister, in his amendment, has provided that any factory that employs more than 20 regular workers should have a health committee. That is very important because that committee will see to it that workers medical rights are given to them.Sir, now that this Bill has been presented to us, we would like, the Minister-to go ahead and implement every bit of it so that workers can benefit. – The Minister: has been-given enough powers.by this Bill, and ‘I hope that: he will. - use. Thosepowers. Accurately and ably to ensure that workers, get their -rights The Bill should benefit the ordinary mwananchi working in these, factories. .It. is stated in the Bill that a factory building cannot be: constructed “without involving the Ministry of Labour. I am happy that the Bill so states because I" know of cases where .health centres are built without consulting, the Ministry of"' Health.. It is gratifying to. Note that the- Ministry of Labour will be: involved even at. The stage of installing things like boilers. I am saying this because I happen to have walked in some of the factories, especially where the boilers are. Installed; ~ and I have noted that the heat is unbearable. In fact, I wonder what Africans who work there do. I have realised that in most of those places the majority are Africans. If I am required to substantiate that, then I will do it very well, because Africans are exposed to unbearably hot conditions in factories. They are very little and yet they are the ones who suffer most.Mr Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I hope that this Bill is going to protect that factory worker who is not provided with protective clothing. I wonderMR. MANG'OLI (ctd.):how that man who is exposed to that dangerous heat survives. You find that the temperature in a factory far exceeds the one specified in this Bill, yet those workers have no protective clothing. In fact, protective clothing for factory- workers is very important and,, therefore, should be taken very seriously.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOP. LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The hon. Member has made a very serious allegation about the exposure of workers to excessive heat. I would be grateful if he c could give men the information relating to this factory where the workers are presently being over-exposed to heat. This is because that- is exactly- what we are trying to prevent. So I would be extremely grateful if. He could give-me that information so that I can send my inspectors there tomorrow to have a look at this particular factory.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MANG'OLI: Mr- Temporary Deputy Speaker, Siri wonder whether the Minister does not want sie to contribute to the Bill! This is because what I am talking about is the obvious! If you go boiler rooms of East Africa Industries Pan African paper Mills in we buy where I. come from and even the Kenya Limited you will see these things for yourself. Go there and- see the- number of Africans in those rooms and you. Will. Wonder whether they are human beings or not. Vitiate-' else do you want me to say i am talking of things that' I have seen and. witnessed. I am not here to make-baseless allegationsAN HON, MEMBER: ' Address the Chair!		MR.MANG OLI: Mr Temporary Deputy- Speaker-,Sir i am- sorry for getting carried' away- and addressed the.Minister directly But all I am s trying to say is that .since the Minister has. Machinery and the inspectors, he should, visit .these factories for himself This is because it is very difficult for one to even stay-for 10e minutes in the boilers that I am-taking about because of the. heat. The workers who are exposed to this heat really suffer a: lot. – So I would like the Minister use his' powers' to. Protect the workers- in such conditions, by ensuring that there are given protective clothing. There are even cases where evokers handling some dangerous chemicalsare supposed to get milk but they do not. This, is provided for in the bill; but "when i talk about it the Minister stands up on a point of order. Why are these workers not getting their milk? I am talking of things that are happening because I am part and parcel of them. I am not imagining these things. So it is important that the Minister understands   such things. .I am talking of what happens right there the factory. My mentioning these things is the only/through which I can help the wananchi who work in those factories.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Bill gives the  Ministers power to put a stop to some of the things we are saying here and even to send inspectors to these factories. Unfortunately I have never seen a factory inspector which makes believe that post are being created now. There cases of factories existing for even 10 years "without being visited by factory inspectors. But I hope that "the£ will now start visiting factories. On ray side/ I. will also start keeping records to see whether-.they will really visit the factories. The reason for our being here is to ensure that the welfare and the interests of the people are catered for. So we would like the Minister take note of our suggestions to ensure that the plight of the workers in the factories is attended to.In the Bill it is stated that the Minister shall appoint one person from the Ministries of Health, the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, the Government chemist and from many other Ministries and Government organisations. Since these are experts they will be used fully by the Minister. This is because sometimes such a thing might be in print but fail in practicabilities. There are cases where decisions have been made without consultations with, other Ministries. In- such cases an officer -who lacks the necessary technical knowledge might End up making the wrong decision if he does not seek the advice of the other concerned Ministries. So the Minister should ensure that Mien he is taking any step he will consult the other relevant Ministries so that the right decision is made. We should not let unqualified clerks to make decisions like those on setting up of- factories. So the Minister needs to look into this to ensure that ii consultations are carried out all round. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir, the duties of the chief inspector are set out very clearly in the Bill. It is- also stated that when conducting any research the inspector will give out his report after seven days. I think this period is too long. This is because in those seven days workers  like those I have mentioned working in boiler rooms^ would still be suffering What should happen is that the factory should be  closed  down  first and then the report is written. What, if during those seven days something worse happens? So before .a certificate is given by the Minister that, a factory can operate again, it should be closed down until after* the investigations So I hope that the Minister will take, that' into consideration to ensure that the reports do" not take as .long as seven days. That is the only way of ensuring that we take" care of the interest- and the welfare of the factor workers. After the report has been mads^ the Minister should, also ensure that action is taken immediatelyI am glad to read from the Bill that the Minister is going to establish a National Advisory Committee-on Occupational Health and Safety-. This is where the heart of the matter is. This is where	life is. a So I hope that the members of the committee will be people of high integrity who will not bend the law to enable Patel to open up a factory cheating that he will create employment. So I hope that with the involvement of the Minister this committeewill not become another rubber stamp.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as my colleagues have said. Factories should provide fire-fighting equipment. So as the Act is trying to provide, there should small team in a factory that will deal with fire prevention and fighting. This will ensure that the worker has enough protection in the factory. This is because a the economy of this a country depends on the workers which means that we have to give them our total support and ensure that they are safe to continue working for this country.There are various amendments that the Minister has referred to in the Bill. But 1 do not know what the Minister means that has removed "labour commissioner" and is going to insert "chiefinspector". Does this mean that the title of that officer; has been changed to chief inspector? In our normal lives we harbour the feeling that an inspector is a sort of police officer who is trying to arrest peopleWe are wondering whether the chief inspector who is referred to in this Bill is a police officer who will go out and arrest people. We aa hope the Minister will explain what this means when he comes to reply so that we and the ordinary mwananchi, can know the difference.This Bill has touched on a various amendments' and we would like the Minister to implement them so that the workers in the factory can be protected fully. That is the purpose of this. Bill. Sir some of the cases which are reported to labour officers are neverattended to and the wananchi. keep on wondering what the Government is doing about it. I hope that the labour inspectors who will be accorded this duty will be able to work with impartiality, so that the common mwananchi can benefit.I' support this amendment and I hope that the Minister will implement it because it will be for the benefit of the common mwananchi in this country. We would like him to do so that the- factory owners can start to feel, the: pinch, because they have relaxed..  For example, in the .course of constructing a factory, the Ministry of Labour-should be involved; so as to make-sure that standard health requirements are adhered to.I beg.to support.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT A1TD MINISTRY OF SO(Mr. Keah):- Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sirfor giving me this opportunity to contribute to this important Bill.

I trust that hon. Members, did hear your plea, Sir that they consult a little bit quietly than they have been. This is an important "Bin because it touches m on the sanctity and welfare of our workers who axe, in fact, the cornerstone of our industrial development in this Republic.This Bill is also very important because His Excellency the President made reference to it in his address during the State Opening .of this House. It is, therefore, ay great pleasure to make a few comments on it. First of all, ALL would like to congratulate the Minister far Labour far the manner in which he has introduced this Bill.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDSET AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah): CtdThis Bill is well prepared and I am not going to deal with its semantics. 1 would like to make a brief reference to the Bill which could be misconstrued and misunderstood, like I did until the hon. Minister pointed out that my interpretation was wrong.I would like to refer to Page 35 of the 3ill which, deals with the Attorney-General's Memorandum of Objects and Reasons. The last paragraph reads as follows:"There will be no additional expenditure of public funds as a result- of the enactment of this 3ill which will be provided for through the annual estimatesI find that a little bit ambiguous because if there is not going to be any expenditure from the Treasury, I cannot see. How the annual estimates come in. I suppose "that is a matter of semantics, and, perhaps, It could. Bebetter placed lest, it creates some confusion air. later stage.I. would, now like to-turn* to-page 18 of the Bill. Clause 16" 45B (l) — - which reads as follows: " -Where: the Minister is satisfied that any work: involves a risk, to the health of the employees, he may make rules requiring(a) medical examination, of the employees.	THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE THE UIC^PBESIDEKT AND MINISTER FOH FINANCE (Mir. Keah.) (CTD):My only worry on this particular subsection that it is silent; on what will happen to the employees who have a"1 ready been affected by shortcomings in certain 2 factories. I wish to suggest that, perhaps, there! Be a clause provide- for compensation in these cases. Perhaps, this is already ±31 provided for elsewhere. If this is so, in his reply^ the Minister could, perhaps, assure us that workers x have a remedy in such cases.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, -Clause 24 creates a National Advisory Committee on Occupational Health and Safety. This " is a very commendable thing, indeed, and I would suggest that itincludes representation from the Industrial Promotion Centre (IPC). - I am saying this because many industrialists and investors. Seek- '" information relating to their activities from the IPC.  I am thus sure a representative from' the IPC would be feeding this committee with information from, prospective industrialists.I would now like to comment on clause 27 on page 28, which. Establishes an Occupational Health and Safety Fund which," once again, • is a very commendable thing, indeed. While I like this idea, I find this clause a little bit weak on accountability of the Fund." Every clause contains the words "There shall be", which is a definitive instruction. However, when it comes to the rules governing the management and administration of the Fund  the words "The Treasury may", are used- belong to the 'Treasury and I would like- to see a little stronger wording in this case so that' the matter becomes imperative and not just an option. According to the way	it stands now it appears as if the matter is optional because the Treasury may or may not. While I realise that the Treasury -.Till, in fact, do so, THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT AND ? MINISTRY OF FINANCE (E Mr. Keah)(CTD):I would go a little further and recommend' that, just as it is the case in all. funds created  by this House, it be made imperative for the Auditor-General (Corporations) to audit this Fund.' However, if my colleague, the hon. Minister- for Labour, is satisfied that everything is in order, then he does not have to effect the changes I am recommending. THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Ctd):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the next page that I would like to turn to is the one on general matters. We have the creation of the inspectorate. I am delighted that the chief inspector has now been hived off from the labour U.C-- commissioner. These two will be separate offices. The chief inspector of factories will have his chief duties as those of looking after safety in our factories. One thing that I would like to make an appeal for here is the seriousness of the inspection. I would like to emphasize that the- inspectors should be seen to actually carry out the inspection and report accordingly. The reason I am saying that is that time and again we make rules and laws but it is like the common saying that states, "You can take a horse to the well but you cannot force it to drink." I would, therefore, like to see ethics evolved in the inspection and that these ethics are followed to the letter. I would like to see the Minister meeting out punishment to the inspectors-who do not do their work. I would like to see stoppage of the' system where inspectors connive with industrialists; I would like to see some regulations made where when such connivance takes place the inspector is not only heavily penalised and sacked, but that the industrialist is also penalised.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is sometimes a weakness in the implementation and execution of the laws that we make in this House. I would like to emphasize on. this point so that the inspectorate is seen to be strong. We have professionals in the inspectorate because, if it is a pharmaceutical firm, there should, preferably. somebody who has some pharmaceutical knowledge. If a factory relates to an engineering concern, then I expect an inspector who is an engineer, or somebody who is knowledgeable engineering. This aspect is left silent here and we have left it to the discretion of the Minister and his Ministry to ensure that professionalism is exercised; to ensure that ethics are established and strictly adhered to.Having said, that, I would now like to turn to the issue of our factories environmental factors. As we are all aware, His Excellency the THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah) (Ctd):President is the number one environmentalist in this Republic. I am particularly worried about industrial effluent that is discharged into our rivers as well as the air that is polluted-. I would urge the Minister to take sterner action to ensure that .Nairobi River, for example, is "not polluted in the manner that we are seeing it today. Not even a frog can survive in Nairobi River. I would like to see Athi River being effluent-free and the same goes for Galana River, among others.I know I am asking for extensive measures to be taken but if we are to become the industrial nation that we intend to be, then these things are necessary; they are a very necessary investment to our industrial, growth and development.At this juncture, Sir, I" would like to turn to the infrastructural. development of the countryside, given our wish to develop as an industrialised nation. I would like to share a previous hon. Member who has talked about1 the need to ensure that electricity, roads and water are- provided. When you talk about health hazards, just look at some of the factories in Indus trial"-" Area, Nairobi- To get into the factories, you have to wade through pools of muddy water.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah) (ctd.):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, lack of good fresh water is problem facing £ some factories. There is lack of proper sanitation facilities in some factories. Sir, if you visit the toilets of some of the factories, you will find that they stink very badly. Therefore, I would like to request the inspectors to make sure that stinking toilets in the factories are cleaned properlySir, it is important for all factories to have adequate electricity, and s all the safety measures involved-taken care of. There are some safety rules on the use of electricity and we commend our engineers and experts who have devised those rules. Those rules should be followed, and this Act provides the machinery and the power to make sure that the rules are followed.Finally, Sir, I would like to touch on a point which is not necessarily related to factories our labour laws and labour officers. Time and again, I have sacked from their employment and. to the labour officer or Your member of parliament or anybody else, but nothing-will be done to me". That is very true, because I have personally taken such complaints to the labour officers who make empty promises, in the end nothing actually happens. That gives an impression, that there is an element of collusion in certain cases. I cannot prove that, but there could be an element of collusion between unscrupulous labour officers and unscrupulous employers like ensure that the worker is frustrated I would like to?THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICEPRESIDENT AMD MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah) (ctd.):	request the hon. Minister to ensure that the labour officers are certainly good. The same thing should apply to the inspectorate that will be created by this Act.I think I have made enough contribution, and. therefore, with those few remarks, I beg to support the Bill.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT (Mr. Lugonzo): Thank you Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to contribute to this bill. This nation is very lucky to have His Excellency the President because he is very creative. His creativity is being applied in all our fields of activity. He has come up with this Bill which will eventually become a law and go a long way in improving the workers welfare. Sir, this Bill should be fully implemented by the Minister for Labour so that its value is properly appreciated by the workers. .I believe that the employee has to be protected in very many aspects. THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT(Mr.Lugonzo) (CTD.):At the same time, there is a lot that the worker himself has to do. The first thing that we have to make sure is that the worker is well educated so that he can know the implication of this bill. By this I mean to say that seminars Should be carried out especially by factory Management who will be affected by the bill .Through these seminars, workers will be informed about the implications of this Bill, but if this is not done, there is a lot of information that will bypass the workers., Some of the information that needs to be given to the workers would be simply displayed on the doors in their working place So that they are totally aware of certain dangersMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, there are certain materials used infactories which could be dangerous to the workers? and workers in these factories continue r to be Episode to Danger actually knowing, for example, that the smoke produced "by the materials can affect their health. Similarly, chemicals produced in sane of the factories am dangerous to workers and it I the duty of the employers to educate their workers how to protect themselves, by displaying information regarding the danger that exists in the production of these chemicals. They could also hold seminars to educate their workers* and the public in general. I am saying this because Tm even members of the public who visit these factories ought really to know the dangers involved. Therefore, wananchi should also be educated either through, display of information or through publication. Members of public should be given a list of factories that produce dangerous chemicals or fumes so that when they choose to visit these factories, they may know x how to protect themselves. This list should be displayed somewhere or published in the Official Gazette fardangersthe information of the general public. There are certain dangers that even weas Members of Parliament do not know regarding sane of the products in these factories. Therefore, this information   should be made available to the workers and to the general public.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is also the aspect of compensation to workers when they get sick .as a result of inhaling fumes or?THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT (Mr.	Lugonzo) (CTD.) while working Workers should be aware that they are entitled to compensation under these circumstances.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to support hon. Keah on what he said regarding inspectors. Within this Bill, it has been stated that if an inspector discloses son information regarding what he has found in the factory, he may be guilty of an offence.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT (Mr Lugonzo)(ctd);Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Bill does not say inspector will be whether the penalised by a fine or imprisonment. In this case it looks as if the law is not going to take any action at if a factory is found guilty of disclosing information about a certain factory. The law should be specific as to whether the guilty person will be punished by a fine or by imprisonment. If it is a fine then we should be told the magnitude of the fine Perhaps this Bill was prepared by factory inspectors and they did not want to specify how much fine they will pay for disclosing information about certain companies.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is not the only offence an inspector can be charged with There is also the question of corruption; Any job to do with inspection  and approval of anything like this one here maybe a team of Inspectors can be easily tempted to take bribes; They will go to a factory, inspect it and	discover a lot of faults precautions that have not been taken by the industrialist and the factory man may take the inspectors to his office and try to corrupt them by giving them a huge sum of moneys If  it is found out  that an inspector has taken a bribe why has it not been clarified here that he would be punished? These inspectors ought to be honest fellows and .the Minister should take note of that these people must be experts; they must know their job they must people capable of making the right decisions about a factory they should base everything on facts. They should have equipment that is capable of measuring to what extent the factory has polluted the air;"' They should be able to know to what extent a factory has not protected its workers?THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT (Mr.Lugonzo) (ctd);Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if an inspector goes to a factory which produces poisonous fumes how will the inspector determine the toxicity of these fumes unless he is given very good equipment? These inspectors should be given equipment to enable them to make correct measurements." I say this because some fumes may not be dangerous until they reach a certain stage of intensity so, the Minister should have experts of different sorts and lie should equip them very well so that they can even measure the toxicity of the fumes that are g being emitted in whatever factory they are inspecting.But Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question of these inspectors being people of integrity is very important otherwise they will take bribes and leave the workers in danger." So, they should be aware that they will be prosecuted if they fail to tell the truth. It appears that when this Bill becomes law, it will be good for foreign investors for the simple reason that it is the foreign. 1investors who know already the requirements of each and every factory.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT(Mr.Lugonzo) (ctd);When they come they will have all instruments for probably controlling fumes and whatever is rejected from of their machines. They know it and their can also afford it. But I am wondering whether this will not affect the young local entrepreneurs. It may affect them for the reason that most of the local entrepreneurs do not have a lot of funds to inject into business or a factory. When they start a business they do so with very meagre funds, or very little capital. It looks as if unless first of all, Government comes 16 the aid of these investors who are locals, they may not come out to invest if they find that there are so many restrictions to their investments. So, maybe, the Government should be able to assist the local investor first of all, poor and, secondly, ignorant.The Ministry of Industry or Labour should come out with a way or measure to assist the local investors so that we do not discourage local investors. If we apply the law 30510 	to a foreigner and the same way to a local investor, we may find that there are no local investors. There should be money to subsidise and also to enable the local investor perhaps to purchases the required gadgets and instruments that would be used to control the factory emissions so that they do not in the end pollute the air or the water.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,, in order to assist the local investor also, with things like lighting of the factory, ventilation and so on, there should be definite designs which will be displayed or given to the local investor so that he does not impinge the law when putting up a factory. So, unless they are given instructions showing what kind of ventilations and 30 we may not be able to enter the investment field of our own? THE ASSISTANTMINISTER FORMANPOWERDEVELOPMENTAND EMPLOYMENT (Mr. Lugonzo) (Ctd.):country because of ignorance and lack of knowledge and probably because of lack of funds. What will the. Government do to enable the local Kenyan to be able to compete with a foreign investor in the field by implementing this law? Although this may not seem to be very important, "but it may discourage the local investor. So, something, should be done to assist the local investor with designs, funds, advice and so on.. I hope this will not apply to the Jua Kali Artisans and the cottage man.I support the Bill, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker.ADJOURNMENTTHE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Hon.

Wabuge: Mr. Speaker, Sir, L. appreciate that detailed answer from the Minister. When working, these percentages on an. average of about two cents per litre or so on sales of about 60,000 litres of. File a month at a given petrol station,, it gives the operator a Masson of, say, Kshs.12,000.This has been stagnant since 1986 while the oil companies on the other hand have had a much higher margin than the local operators. Could the Minister consider giving a better margin to the service station operators so that they can sustain their operations?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR: BIWOTT:  Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all I would like to correct the figure used by the hon member in working out what the sales. The hon. Member mentioned two cents but I would like to say that itis more percent per litre.I do agree that the margins available to petrol stations have been declining relative to that of the oil companies. Essentially, the retailers should be seen, to their principal who are the oil companies 1 am afraid that the oil companies have not been looking after their retailers adequately. X do agree fully that there is a case for petrol dealers for a greater margin "but it will not come from the consumers but from the oil companies themselves with. Regard to the margins they are enjoying at the momentMR. BIWOTT. (CTD):I am now Pursuing this matter; I would have done it last time "but I thought that the oil companies. Would look after their own outlets adequately. However, as it turned out they never did it; this is an issue that is well known to both us and the oil industry, and it is being pursued at the moment' I thank: the hon. Member for raising this Question. .<\NEWSPEECH>MR.Kubo: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the	Minister's concern, could he also Viewing proof it. margin for the retailers fact the fact to that oil companies keep on raising rental charges for their' services to the retailers so that the profit margin is being "eaten" even more by the high rental charges ?	MR.BIWOTT : Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, that a very good question. But. I myself have never owned a petrol station and. so 1 really do. Not know where the squeeze is coming from.. However, would encourage the petrol retailers to come forward pinches so. That we can help them accordingly.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Mr.Mangioli.Mr Speaker, Sir, we appreciate the kind of answers; effecting, the measure of answers the Minister gives whenever. Question is out to him is very precise in his clay Now that there "has been a delay  the Minister has talked of, will he assure the House that this measure, will be effected 7 short time. Tins is because most petrol stations are either closing down, or changing ownership, too frequently.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIWOTT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure the House  it has been very kind my Ministry and has passed quite number of Bills enabling the Ministry to advance the interests of this country in the energy sector that this matter will be vigorously pursued so that local petrol retailers get a fair share of the cake.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Mr. J.N.MUNGAI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thought hon. Mangoli wanted to know how long it would take the Minister to adjust the prices, while we appreciate the fact tilt the Minister sounds very informed about what is happening, could he tell the House how long he expects it to take him  to adjust the prices? This is business in which. Africans',' who are 	the majority' retailing, are losing, money while the o the reside is gaining.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>.MR. Biwott: I think the hon. Member must have been 	considering some other important matters in his mind and so did not hear what I said. I said that right now we are vigorously looking into the matter In fact, I will be meeting the leader of. the retailers some his afternoon. As soon as we are through with this process it will naturally come out.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. JALANG'O: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in view of the assurance from the hon. Minister that he will be seeing the oil .retail operators this  I' think I will be patient and wait, because it; seems as ix the Minister is	already aware and is concerned about the plight of. The oil retailers. Thank you, Sir (Mr. Wabuge stood up) MR. SPEAKER: Mr.Tabuge, you are out of" order<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WABUGE: Mr.' Speaker, Sir, I appreciate your having given me this opportunity.' Since the Minister shown concern over this  Question, and in view of the fact the Question is now the property of the House, would he, after consultations with the people concerned, come back to this House and state clearly the ' outcome of his consultations so that the House knows it been given the proper answer?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIWOTT: Mr.Speaker, Sir, I think the pricing structure of oil is always announced after negotiations have been finalised.MR.BIWOTT (CTD):This process will also be gazetted after everything, is settled so that everybody will read about it. We should not forget that the retailer is more or less an extension of the parent oil company. Therefore, I will encourage the two to reach an agreement regarding the profit margin. In fact, I will ask the oil companies to pass part of their profits to the retailers so that the profits will be fairly distributed. However, I will not ask the public to pay more to the retailer. 'This is because the current profit for oil industry is adequate; if anything, at the moment I am even thinking of lowering price of oil I did not want to go into extraneous matters, but now hon. Jalang'o has a petrol station and. I would like to attend to his needs.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MANGOLI: On a point of order, Mr.Speaker. Sir. Hon Wabuge whether, in view of the fact" that the Question is. a property of this House, the Minister could come back to this House and give usa conclusive agreement has been, reached  So, will the Minister assure us that he will report back the s outcome of his consultations rather, than announce it outside the House? <\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIWOTT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is very simple. If this House would like to know the agreed position between the oil companies and the oil retailers before I announce it,. I will, only be .too glad to come and announce it here and then immediately go and announce it outside the k House. So, I will do that.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Let us go to Mr. A.H. Kimemia's Question.<\NEWSPEECH>Question No. 31Outcome of Mr. Wanyeki' s Injury Assessment Case	MR.A.K.Wanyekiasked the Minister for Health what the outcome of the Medical Board consitituted to assess the injury sustained by a Mr. William Mwangwanyeki as per the Ministry's authority ITo. 21461234906(2) and letter No SURMEDBD87 dated 4th February, 1988 addressed to the complainant by P.M.O., Nakuru was.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Dr. B.A.Godana): Mr. Speaker, Sir, Ibeg to reply.A medical board was convened on 8th February, 19Q.8, to assess the injury sustained by Mr. William MwangiWanyeki, who works with the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation, following a road accident on 24th March, 1979 The board consisted of Mr. M.S. Malik, who is the Provincial Surgeon, Rift Valley Province, as Chairman and Drs. J.M. Ayallo and S.K. Yego, of Provincial General Hospital, Nakuru, as members.The following were the Board's findings:(a) Central nervous system: he is fully conscious, alert and well—orientated. He has slight slurring of speech but is understood. Cranial nerves are intact. Power, tone, reflexes and sensation are equal and normal in both arms and legs. Coordination is quite normal and there is no ataxia. His memory of the accident, past and recent events is quite good. There is a craniotomy scar on the left side of the scalp.(b) The respiratory system is normal.(c) The cardio—vascular system is normal(d) The gastrointestinal system is normal(e) He is fit for further service.(f)  Permanent disability in terms of Workmen's Compensation Act is. Twenty five (25) percent..(g) Permanent disability in terms of Regulation 24 of" the Pensions Regulations 1950 shows that he is slightly impaired — five sistieth (5/60) (h) The medical board's opinion is that Mr. Wanyeki received a serious head injury resulting in subdural clot which was not diagnosed for about, nine months. When it was discovered, it was adequately dealt with. He recovered his higher functions quite satisfactorily but has been left with residual dysarthria. This causes a slight slurring of speech. His memory is quite good and he has not had any serious long-term complications, like epilepsy, the board, in conclusion, was of the opinion that Mr. Wanyeki is fit for further service. His ability to support himself through gainful employmentTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Dr. B.A. Godana)(Ctd.)has been slightly impaired. This is evidenced by the fact that he used to work on the technical side in his pre-injury days but now he can only" work indoors as an office messenger as exposure to the sun gives him a headache. The Board therefore recommended a 25 per cent award compensation in terms of the Workmen's Compensation Act.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. A.K. KIMEMIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to a report I have here, it would seem that this person was attended to by two doctors: One of the doctors assessed 25 per cent permanent incapacity while the other one assesses 50 per cent. Could the Assistant Minister, therefore, deny or confirm that the doctor who assessed the injury at 25 per cent on behalf of the Board was not accurate?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is true there has been two assessments; the one I have just read out here is the most recent one. It is also the one we consider most authoritative. A medical board was convened, in. 1986 which gave Mr. Wanyeki an award of 60 per cent under the Workmen's Compensation Act. The board had arrived at this decision of permanent disability before discovering that Mr. Wanyeki received a serious injury resulting in a sub Dural clot Which was not diagnosed for about nine months When it was discovered, it. was adequately dealt with.. He recovered his high functions quite satisfactorily, but has been left with residual dysarthria, which causes a slight slurring in speech. His memory is quite good and he has not had any serious long—term complications. The diagnosis of subduralcan be made difficult by the biz are presenting symptoms. It is sometimes diagnosed by continuous medical reviews that can lead the neuro—surgeon or the neurologist to request for the special test called carotid—angiogram, or a brain scan. All in all the condition goes through many phases and it could have resulted in "the high percentage award of 1986 under the Workmen's Compensation Act, with later phases coming down to 25 per cent.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. A.K. KIMEMIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not want to argue with the Assistant Minister, but could he consider rewarding a higher figure than the 25 per cent because this person is not normal even now? On the other hand, could the Ministry try to get another assesment board to review the case?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not necessary to get another assessment board because a board, consisting of very highly qualified surgeons was constituted precisely to deal with- the problem of the extent of his injuries. The latest report is the most authoritative. As I said, at the time of the first assessment, the recovery process of his injury was still undergoing some phases and had not been fully realized. It was subsequent to that that he was given the right treatment. So, the assessment that we have is quite sufficient<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. A.K. KIMEMIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said earlier on, I do not want to argue with the Assistant Minister.. When will this person be compensated?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir,. I beg you-pardon. I did not hear the hon. Member properly.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR- A.K.KIMEMIA: Mr- Speaker, Sir, when will Mr. Wanyeki becompensated?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir-, the award has already been made, and I would ask the hon. Member to advise the individual concerned to go to the relevant Ministry as soon as possible.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MANG'OLI: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I appreciate the reply given by the Assistant Minister, but I. am at a loss to understand one aspect here. This person is one the hon. Member's voters, and he is still unsound according to the hon. Member. Sometimes, laymen understand these things better than even consultants. The hon. Member knows this gentleman, who is still not normal and cannot function in a normal- Since the Assistant Minister is a doctor, could he be a part of the new team? It would appear to me that, as the hon. Member says, the gentleman is not normal. Could the Assistant Minister review this case?<\NEWSPEECH>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it would seem that the hon. Member did not listen properly to the lengthy answer that I read out. - We have admittedDR. B.A. GODANA (CTD.):that this person was injured and I said that he is still suffering from a slight suffering of speech. We have also assessed that he has a certain amount ofpermanent disability, for which reason we constituted a board composed of experts and there is no way in which we can accept that an hon. Member here or any other individual is a better expert on medical matters than qualified surgeons of the calibre who constituted this board. So, I do think there is a case for review<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. J.N. MUNGAI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. When the Assistant Minister answered the main Question, he said that the first diagnosis did not give a satisfactory answer and that is why the case was reviewed. He said that the review gave an authoritative answer, but the hon. Member still claims that even after this review, the man in question has not appeared to be improving. In response to a subsequent point of order, the Assistant Minister said that this does not matter because the last diagnosis gave some hope that the person concerned was not seriously injured that that he had recovered. If this person continues to show signs of suffering, that is he is not recovering and he continues to be abnormal, could the Assistant Minister assure this House  that the same board is going to be constituted again to review this persons.' s case so that he may be given adequate compensation?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. B.A. GODANA : Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Mr. Mangoli:On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir The Assistant Minister seems to be threatening the House.He has said that he does not care, because he Knows that hon. Membersare not experts. The man in question is still suffering. CananotherMedical Board be constituted again in order to reviewhis case?The Assistant Minister has threatened this House, that the Board is constituted of highly qualified persons, andtherefore, it does not matter whether you are a Member ofParliament or not. Is he in order to threaten the hon. Memberfor webuyDR. BA. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure thathon. Mangoli knows that T did not threaten him and I do not threaten people. But, for his benefit I would like to inform this Housethat the law in this country actually states that, if somebody has suffered injuries and an expert opinion formed, but subsequently new information comes to light entailing that if the experts had that information before theirjudgement, theywould have given a different award the matter can be opened up again.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. A.K KIMEMIA: As honJ.N. Mungai had asked, could the Assistant Minister allow that case to be reassessed?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. GODANA: At the moment we do nothave any grounds to justify reassessment.<\NEWSPEECH>                        Question No. 62Commissioning of Bungoma Rural Water Supply ProjectMR. MAKHANU asked the Minister for Water Development when the Bungoma Rural Water Supply Project, which covers cost of East Bukusu Location, Kanduyi Constituency, be commissioned since all design works were completed in .1993.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINSTER FOR V.'ATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Kisiero) Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg1 to reply.I would like first of all to correct the impression given by the hon. Member that Dungoma Rural water Supply Project should be commissioned. The Project has not even been implemented and, therefore, it cannot be commissioned.Secondly, there are no funds available to start implementation of the project. The project is estimated to cost nearly50 million. This money is not available. Every year my Ministry has been recommending the project for funding, but no money has so far been allocated to it. I cannot, therefore, say when the project will be commissioned.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.MAKHANU: while appreciating the answer- given, by the Assistant Minister, would he tell us who has been refusing to allocate funds to his Ministry. He has told us that every year his Ministry recommends that that project should get a funding, would he tell us who has-been refusing to issue the-funds? Is it this Parliament? Sir, that water supply project is a priority project of Bungoma District Development Committee (D.D.C.).<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KISIERO: Sir, after requests have been Is made by the -various D.D.C.s, they are then presented to the Treasury for- funding but I am sure that the hon. Member will appreciate the fact that the requests always exceed the supply of money. Therefore, nobody has refused to fund that project, but the requests for funds of projects are more than the money available.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKHANU: The Assistant minister has told us that the Ministry has requested for the funding of that project every year. I have looked at the forward budget and the previous annual budgetary allocation, but I did not find that project there, and yet it is a priority project in Bungoma D.D.C. When will the Ministry put that project in its forward budget?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KISTERO: Sir, my Ministry’s forward budget always reflect that that proposal has been presented, and I can show the hon. Member the Ministers forward budget documents which include that project. But as to what happens there<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR- MATE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Sir, think that we are being presented" with-some kind of a drama because we are discussing a project which has never taken off. The hon. Member for Kanduyi is taking of a project which exists, but the Assistant Minister is telling us that the project has not been started. Why are they making us discuss something which is not existing?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KISIERO: The hon. Member is quite right in that the project in only in the design form. It has not been implemented yet. I was informing- the hon— Questioner that the Ministry- has always - presented that project, along with others for- funding. The- questioner to as/to whether it has been reflected in development projects that are presented to this House is a different matter altogether, but the Ministry has been presenting the project a to the Treasury for funding.<\NEWSPEECH><\NEWSPEECH>MR. MANGOLI: While appreciating the answer given by the Assistant Minister, would he consider other projects in BungomaDistrict which have also not been funded. Some projects in Bungoma District have been designed, and have been put in the forward budget but they have not been funded yet. While the Assistant Minister isMR. MANGOLI (ctd.):looking for money to finance that project, can he also look for funds for those projects which have already been gazetted?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KISIERO: That is an entirely new question which I cannot answer right now.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MANGOLI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, SirI think we need your guidance here. My supplementary question was/about other water supply projects in Bungoma District. How does it become a different question and yet it is about water projects? What kind of supplementary questions are we supposed to ask, if we cannot be allowed to ask a supplementary question about some other water projects which have not yet taken off? We cannot bring all those questions here,, because if we do that, we shall only have time to handle questions only. Is the Assistant Minister therefore, in order to tell me that that was an entirely new question, and yet it was a supplementary question?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR- KISIERO: The hon. Member generalised the whole issue of water supply projects- The Question that we are dealing with is very specific. It is about a specific water supply project, but now the hon. Member wants me to assure, him" about the funding of several other water supply projects which he did not, name- He should' bring a specific Question on a specific water, supply project.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. MISOT: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. That is a very important water	project. The Assistant" Minister has confirmed that it is a big project which is worth 50 million, and that money has not been available. Therefore, the Assistant Minister should have advised the hon. Member to try and request for implementation that project in different phases- rather than put it in the shelf and wait for 53 million which may not come at a go. That is what the Assistant Minister should have told the hon. Member. By so doing you can the 50 million in ten years.<\NEWSPEECH>	MR. SPEAKER: That is not a point of order, Dr. Misoi.

WAMBUA asked the Minister for Public works why the Ministry has failed to repair Nditha drift on the road from Mwala Market-Musaalaai Myanvani Primary School-Mumbuni  Amundu to kabaa Market despite numerous undertakings made by the Minister last year.<NEWSPEECH>TIE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Maiyani): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Ministry has not failed to repair Nditha Drift because plans are at an advanced stage and funds have been set aside for this project. In February, 1990, K.Shs.270,000/- was released to the District works Officer Machakos to enable him start the construction of a new bridge near the present drift. It is therefore not prudent to invest more money; in repairing the present drift<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAMBUA:Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant Minister's reply, would he tell this House what steps his Ministry is taking to ensure that the construction of the new bridge is started, as soon as possible.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would 11 to assure the Souse and the hon.- Member that the construction work on the new bridge will start, as soon as the current rains stop<\NEWSPEECH>MR.

MQMANYI asked the Minister for Public Works since there are no tippers in Nyamira and Districts, what plans the Ministry has to provide tippers in order to facilitate the maintenance of roads in these districts.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Archbishop Ondiek): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.At present, there are two unserviceable tippers in nyamira and Kisii Districts. Attempts by my Ministry to repair these tippers have not been <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSlSTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Archbishop Ondiek) (Ctd) Successful because the required spare parts are not available locally and Nyamira are included in the list of priority districts which are earmarked to get new tippers in 1590/91 Financial Tear <\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.

He wants to know what are the makes of the tippers for which the Assistant Minister claims they cannot get spare parts locally.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>ARCNBISHOP ONDIEX: The two makes are Isuzu and bedfords.<\NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question.Question go. 81DR. WAMETO asked the Attorney General when the Public Trustee will pay-the-family of the late Mr. Shebami Okumu (deceased P.T.	6O/76) the money received from Mumias Sugar	CompanyLtd. in respect of the sale of sugarcane on plot East Wanga/Lubimi 920.<NEWSPEECH>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. The Public Trustee in September, 1979 received. Shs.27,140/90 from Humias Sugar Company Ltd in respect of the sale of sugar can on plot East\Wanga/Lubinu 920. Further still, another sum- amounting leg to 13,782/45 was received from the Public Trustee's office at Kisuna in October, 1984 being the transfer of assets in respect of this case. Out of the above mentioned monies, the Public Trustee Liquidated as an I.C.D.C. Loan which together with arrears of interest came to 19,084/90. A sum of K.Shs.3,500/— was also advanced, to the widow of. the deceased towards the maintenance of the family of the deceased.<\NEWSPEECH>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (.CTD);Mr. Speaker, Sir, after providing the Public Trustee fees and administration expenses estimated "at KShs.2,820.00 the net balance currently held by the Public Trustee shall he KShs.25,079.55 However according to the law of Succession Act it is not possible to release the entire balance held by the Public Trustee on account of the deceased while the finalisation of the  administration of this estate is still in.an uncertain state- The heirs of the deceased will have to be requested to confirm whether Title No.920, East Wanga, as disclosed in the death Report Form is registered in the name of the deceased, and if so the whereabouts of the certificate of title." : I it transpires that the said property is in the name of the . Decreased, then, the above cited approximate expenses shall pro-rata be adjusted on the higher side- At the moment, it will not be prudent to make any maintenance allowances or any remittances, until the aforesaid confirmation' is received."<NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: Mr." Speaker, Sir, I thank the' hon. Attorney- General for that answer and also for supplying me with a copy of the written reply- However, whether- one did. the 8-4—4- Arithmetic: or the previous Arithmetic, it' is quite easy to know that if you add the money paid to I.C.D.C -that is KShs.19,000/	to the Public Trustee fees of KShs.2,820/— and also add on a sum of KShs.3,500/-, you will find that the balance cannot be KShs.25,000/-; it is much less. May I know from the Attorney-General if the Public Trustee received more money and which has not been mentioned in this answer?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MULI: Mr. Speaker, Six, at the moment, I have mentioned, the sums of money received by the Public Trustee. If ~he figures do differ, it could be because of the interest that has accrued. This aspect can be gone into in detail, if hon. Dr. Wameyo could come- to my office and go through the whole file.I do not think: we should quarrel about the. figures.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KUBO: 'Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have listened to that reply very carefully and this case appears to have been taken from 1976 up to today. But you will find" that the Attorney-General still insists in his answer that he wants to know the particulars in the land registry regarding the ownership of this plot - East Wanga/ Lubinu 920. Since that is a very simple job that can be done by his officers at the kakamega Lands Office, could the Attorney-General help this -family by merely checking those facts and making a search  at the lands office so that he can finalise the administration of this estate?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MULI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we do check every aspect of." a matter like this one.' But we would like  to get a confirmation from the heirs or From the intended heirs of this estate.' They should co-operate and. make available all the documents — title deeds arid, any other information that may assist us to finalise the administration of the estate So, although this case has taken so long, sometimes it is not the fault of the Public Trustee; it is the fault of the heirs or i anybody in that line withholding the relevant information. We would like this estate to be administered as quickly as possible to benefit the relatives remaining and particularly the children of the deceased. I would like to request hon. Dr. Wataeyo to ask one of the heirs to come to our office and we will try to guide him on how to speed up the administration of this estate.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MANG’OLI: On a point of order, Mr." Speaker, Sir.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. .SPEAKER: What is your point of order, hon. Mang'oli?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MANG’OLI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, hon. Kubo asked a straight forwarded question. He has requested the Attorney-General to assist this family. He can telephone ahis officers in. kakamega and I am sure the information from kakamega will reach his office very quickly." The Attorney-General is the custodian of our law in this country and he should not try to evade questions. Is he in order to evade this question? This case has been on since 1976 and we would like the Attorney-General to assure this House that will ring up his officers in kakamega tomorrow and tell them to forward the 'relevant information to his office here in Nairobi? We respect the Attorney-General very much and he knows that justice delayed is justice denied. Can he assure the House that the answer will come tomorrow?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.'MULI: Mr." Speaker, Sir, could you perhaps assist by advising hon." Mang'oli that this House is an august House that dancing and gesturing in the Chamber does not help anyone? But at the same time I would like to assure him that- the Public Trustee has got an office in Kisumu. Also the district commissioners in all districts in the country act as agents of the Public Trustee.' So, if any of the heirs of the deceased would show some little interest- in this matter for his own benefit and the  benefit of the other heirs, we would advance  the administration of this estate and finalise it as soon as possible.</NEWSPEECH>DR.WAMEYO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I know from the Attorney-General whether this case should be sorted, out in Nairobi or  his or rice m Kisumu? Definitely it would, be	cheaper for Ordinary folks in the rural areas to come to Kisumu than come to Nairobi only to find that they have nowhere to sleep</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MULI: Mr." Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure hon- Dr. Wameyo that if any of the heirs goes -co our Kisumu office, the Kisumu office will be able to obtain the particulars we want and transmit them to the	Public Trustee's office in Nairobi we will finalise the administration of the estate." However, I would, prefer that we finalise a long-outstanding estate this one in Nairobi to avoid, anyone else - in-Kisumu or elsewhere – starting all over again." I think it will be quicker for us to finalise it here. The heirs have been written to several "times and if any of them goes to kisumu to see our officers there, the information will reach us without the heir involving himself in transport to Nairobi</NEWSPEECH>Question No. 83Money Spent on Sewerage Studies for Wajir TownshipMR. I. MOHAMED asked Minister for Local " Government how much, money has The Ministry spent in the several sewerage disposal studies carried out in respect of Wajir Township and. what action he has taken to implement the recommendations made thereon.THE ASSISTANT MTHISTER FOR LOCAL GOVESHMEUT (Mr- Wagura):Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.<NEWSPEECH>The Ministry has spent KSh-2 million on studies. MR. I.MOHAMED On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Can the Assistant Minister: clarify what kind of studies [are} these/ on sewerage disposal? Is it feasibility studies or what kind of studies are these?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was asked this same Question last year, and X said that because of still complication of the soil structure in Wajir township a lot of studies must be carried out. In fact even after having spent KSh.2'million, the studies are still currently going on and they will </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. I. MOHAMED: On a point of order, Mr.Speaker,Sir- I seek your guidance here because I have an answer here which, reads-, and I quote:"The Ministry of Local Government has not spent any money on several sewerage disposal, studies at- Wajir township	.Now, the Assistant Minister is telling us that the Ministry has already spent. KSh.2 million. Which is which?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the correct figure is KSh. 2 million. The money has been spent by the Ministry of . Local Government through NORAD. That is why I am ' saying we, as the Ministry of Local Government, have not spent any money at all on this project</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think a similar Question was asked here last year, and according to the answer if my mind is correct the Ministry had spentMR.CEEPKOE (Ctd.):KSh.5 million and the money was paid direct, to the contractor.  What happened today that the Assistant Minister comes to the House and says that the Ministry has not spent any money on this project at all?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a very important" and sensitive Question. So, X would request that hon. Members listen to me carefully. What. I said and I repeat is that the Ministry of Local Government has not spent a single cent on this project up to now, but KSh.2 million has been spent through NORAE and the Ministry of Water Development to carry out the studies.To add on to that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the project will cost kshh.l7 million on studies and implementation.<NEWSPEECH>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is not following what we are asking here, and. it is important for him to reply to what we are asking. Government spent money on a project - and that is why there is the collective responsibility and the Assistant Minister gave an answer here in this House last year concerning this Question he said that XSh.5 million was spent on. Feasibility studies alone, and I even questioned that. The Assistant Minister comes into the house today and says "No money Has been spent". It is only - KSh.2 million which has been spent. Which is which? This House wants £ to know how much money has .been spent on this project. We do' not want to hear unparliamentarily words. Is him in order to give conflicting answers? He has given about two or three answers</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Ole Kaparo): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is hon. Mang'oli in order to rise always on a point of order to advance a point of argument?</NEWSPEECH>AN HON. MEMBER: Are you the Speaker to rule on that?<NEWSPEECH>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if only hon. Mang'oli could be more orderly and ask a specific question, be would get an answer. The actual amount spent on this project is KSh. 2 million and there is nowhere I ever mentioned KSh. 5 million. .. Therefore, up to now, we have spent KSh. 2 million on studies on this project This is the official figure I am giving. So, the question of KSh.5 Billion or KSh. 10 million does not- arise at all.</NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: On a point of order," Mr. Speaker, Sir I think if my mind is sound, I remember very well that the answer given by the sane Assistant Minister to the same Question was 25h- 5 million. He said that the donors paid this money direct to the contractor for the same project. Is he now in order to tell the house that they have not spent any money at all on this project? The feasibility- studies are supposed-to be done through the Minis- of Local Government. Is he implying that his Ministry has done nothing towards the work this project? Does it mean that the money given by the donor is not for the Ministry?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not want an upper cut! However, hon. Chepkok should recall that I have just said that we have already spent KSh. 2 million on this project through the Ministry of Water Development but not through the Ministry of Local Government. So if he wants to know whether the Government has spent any money on this project, I will say "yes", but the Ministry of. Local Government has not spent even a single cent on this project.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SALAT: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The second part of the Question asks "What action baa the Minister taken to implement the recommendations made there on, and he has not replied to that.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already talked about the studies- However, implementation, of this project will be possible after the studies which are currently going on are completed. I think I had better be very sincere with hon. Members. There is no way we are going to implement this project in the near future because a lot of technical work is required. . I think I had better be frank to hon. Ibrahim Mo named- There is no way we are going to have this project implemented immediately are still going on. In fact, we are likely to spend more money on studies on this project.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. A.I. MOHAMED: On a point: of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We need your guidance here because this is a long overdue project. Can.- the Assistant Minister tell us when the project was started? Wajir people are subjected to health hazard because of the sanitation situation in that town.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not mind repeating the original reply. I said that the soil structure of Wajir town is so bad that it may take aware years before this project is implemented. In fact, we are thinking of getting water outside the town to facilitate sewerage of Wajir town.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. A.I. MOHAMED: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: The Assistant Minister is replying to your point of order</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have already said, there is no way I can give a definite date as to when the project will be completed. Due to the poor soil structure in the town, the project is expected to take more time.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.A.I. MOHAMED: On a point of order, Mr.. Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to mislead the House by saying- that there is no water in Wajir town, when, as a matter of fact, in. that, area we cannot dig pit latrines because of. water? If you dig about four feet deep you get water. What does he-, mean, by saying that, there is no water in Wajir town?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MANG'OLI: He is misleading the House.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did not talk, about water; I" am talking of soil structure</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Can we now go back to Mr. Bidu's Question-Question No. 43Termination of Mr. Dele's ServicesMR. BIDU asked tile Minister of State, Office of the President why the services of P.C. Chuphi Bati Dele, P/No. 42110, formerly stationed at Eldoret Police Station, were terminated on 29th December, 1989.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Kamuren): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to apologise for hot having been here when the Question was called the first time.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Kamuren) (ctd.): Having Said that. Sir, I beg to reply.The services of ex-police constable Chuphi Bati Dele, P/No. 42110, were terminated as a result of a conviction against a serious disciplinary offence under Police Regulations, Cap 34 Laws of Kenya.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I cannot even thank the Assistant Minister Of because the answer he has given us is very short. Can he tell us/what nature was the disciplinary offence?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the benefit of the hon. Member, I wish to give some further information with connexion to ex-police constable, Dele. On 22nd December, 1989, at about 1.30 a.m. at Kambi Karatasi Estate within Eldoret Municipality, ex-police constable Dele, while on beat duties was found by his Officer Commanding Station (CCS) having given a member of the. public, namely, Geoffrey Limuti, police uniform to wear- Lucaiti, who was in the company of ex- police constable Dele, was found wearing a peaked police cap and a rain -coat both bearing Dele'3 Force Number- It should be noted that ex-police Dele was caught by his OCS outside his beat group and in the company of a civilian in police, uniform in a highly suspicious,, irregular and offensive set up.Subsequently, Mr. Speaker, Sir, ex-police constable Dele was charged under Regulation 3 (41) of the Police Regulations, Cap 84 of the laws of Kenya. He pleaded guilty to the charge and was convicted on his own plea of guilty.. Due to the seriousness of the offence, the inspector who presided over the charge remitted the proceedings to the Provincial Police Officer, Rift Valley, who sentenced ex-police .constable Dele to dismissal with loss of all benefits.Ex-police constable Dele joined the Kenya Police Force on 27th.November, 1982. Therefore, prior to his dismissal from the Foce he had a service of seven years and some two months. During his service, he had undergone training on the dos and don'ts for police officers and had received lectures on wearing of police uniform. He knew, is a police officer, of cases of robbery that are committed by criminals who impersonate police officer by either wearing full or part of police uniform.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MVAMZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant Minister's reply; can he tell this House what kind of crime Dele was suspected to commit, although he had given part of his uniform to a civilian? What kind of crime did the 0CS suspect Dele would commit?</NEWSPEECH>\<NEWSPEECH>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Speaker, Sir. this is quite a matter of common sense to all of us in this House. If a police constable, in his position, is found having given his uniform to a civilian, then you can understand the criminology part of it.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir- Is what the Assistant Minister said really common sense? I mean, the uniform could have been stolen without the knowledge of Dele. Is the Assistant Minister in order to put it that whatever was suspected Dele could have done is common sense? What crime did the 0CS suspect Dele could have committed?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KAMUREN: Mr.Speaker, Sir, it is in itself a crime for a police officer- to give his uniform to a civilian.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MATE: Mir. Speaker, Sir, I think, the- Assistant. Minister can throw some light on the kind of mitigation this ex-police man gave when he appeared before his boss. I am saying so because it can be assumed that Dele had two sets of uniform and, maybe, because he was a honest Utumishi Kwa Wote, assisted this other fellow who might have had 3ome headache or it was raining and he was only assisting him. Can the Assistant Minister tell us what kind of mitigation when he appeared before his bosses? Maybe, as I suspect, the ex—police officer could have been assisting a mwananchi who had a stomach-ache or something else. Can the Assistant Minister tell us what he said in defence?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no authority given, under the law for a police officer to give his uniform to a civilian; even when you apply the principle of Utumishi kwa Wote. That is just not allowed.</NEWSPEECH>?<HEADER>POINTS OF ORDER</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>MR. MANG'OLI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise on a point of order to draw to the attention of the Chair what happened yesterday. When I was contributing: to the Factories (Amendment) Bill, a situation arose whereby I was on the verge of being thrown out- of this House, what happened is that there are members of our society whose hands have been chopped off while working in factories and that some of them have never been compensated, and I was challenged to substantiate. I have brought them with me today. In fact, they are outside here and I want the Assistant Minister, Office of the Vice—President and Ministry of Finance, hon. Keah, to go and compensate them.You see, Sir, when we make statements in this House we stand by them. I have come with same people whose hands were chopped off while on duty in factories. In fact, one of them was working with Firestone Company, and big company owned by a multi-millionaire in this country  yet he has not been compensated for his hands.MR. MANG'OLI (ctd.):These people are here within the buildings of this House. In fact, yesterday, when I arrived at my office there were very many calls of such people who wanted to accompany me to this House today. Yesterday when I mentioned these cases I was nearly thrown out the House being accused of saying things that I could not substantiate. I said clearly here yesterday that there are very many workers who have been working in factories where they were involved in accidents but so far they have never been compensated for the loss of their limbs. I remember when I said that, the Assistant Minister was even suggesting that I lay such workers on the Table of the House but fortunately the Speaker overruled him. So if he wants to see these workers, they are available for him outside this House and if there are funds he can compensate them.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Order! Order! Although I may not be very conversant with what took-place yesterday I would like to suggest that: if you have such workers you help them file their cases in court; but you cannot bring them into the House.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.

Mutwol aorabe msamaha na ayaondoe maneho hayo.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: - Order! Order! That was absolutely unnecessary because we know that you are very normal and you do not suffer from any mental disability. That we know very well. I think this was a simple misunderstanding between you and Mr. Mutwol. Why do you not react to that unfortunate situation?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Mutwol): Mr. Speaker/ Sir, it is very well known that all of us here are of sound minds including hon. Chepkok. I would like to say that I have nothing against him and I would like to withdraw the remarks that I had made about him.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, sir. I did not hear Mr. Mutwol apologizing!<\NEWSPEECH>MR- SPEAKER: Order! In the-interest of understanding and good co-operation and particularly that you are both elders and very highly respected hon Members of this House and since you are not new hon. Members, her you have been here for a very long time, could you apologise, Mr. Mutwol?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Mutwol): Mr. Speaker, sir, if the hon. Member heard me properly, I said that each one of us here is of sound mind. Since I had no intention 'of saying that Mr. Chepkok is not of sound I apologise.<\NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Next Order.<NEWSPEECH>MR., KILIKU: On a point: of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think that. Mr. Chepkok should lay-on the.

We have passed that stage and are now on the next Order. BILLSecond Reading The: Factories (Amendment) Bill (Minister for Labour ) (Resumption of Debate interrupted on 3.4.9Q)<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EMPLOYMENT AND MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Otwani): Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, sir, for the opportunity to air a few views in support of this Bill. My first point is the fact that this Bill has broadened the scope of operation of the inspectors of factories. The Bill has also been broadened to cover godowns and agricultural workers. The factory<\NEWSPEECH>?THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EMPLOYMENT AND MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Otwani) (ctd) inspectors are now going to handle many more workers ranging from the recent few thousands to millions when this Bill goes through. I would therefore' like to suggest to the Minister to seriously think of expansion of logistic support in order to make this Bill effective when it is operational. He will definitely have to employ more personnel in the inspectorate, expand analytical laboraratories and other facilities, transportation, offices and mobile health clinics- If he does not do that the Bill will not be very effective.Mr. Speaker, Sir, my other point is about casual workers. It has been noted many times in this House that the casual workers in factories are exposed to the most dangerous machines and gases in the. Factories. The Bill provides for the medical examination of employees but it does not specifically cover the casual. workers who have hitherto been subjected to a lot of torture. From common experience most, of the workers are never engaged for more than a month and when, they are- injured and impaired in the factories they leave the factories without, anybody identifying their calamities.. Even if they are identified the employers have the excuse, of being, covered by the terms of service. This is because the casual worker has no terms of service which means that he cannot resort to the normal legal procedures. So my suggestion .is that the Bill -should include the mandatory examination of casual workers before they are' employed.I would also, like to comment on the safety of construction sites. Of late we have many examples of victims of construction work. We have heard of craves collapsing and building stones falling and killing people. I would like to suggest that the Minister should ensure that there Enforcement of inspection of plants particularly boilers, compressors, lifts and cranes. All these are supposed to be periodically inspected as specified in the old Act. But the employers have been negligent. So when this Bill goes throughTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EMPLOYMENT AND MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Otwani) Ctd, would like the Minister to enforce this clause so that the specified periods for examination of these machines are adhered to TIE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOE MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT (Mr- Otwani) Ctd:For example,if lifts axe supposed to be serviced after six months, they should be serviced accordingly so that we do not continue to record loses of lives. Sir, recently we heard that some construction workers had died, for example, at the new General Post Office site, N.S.S.F. building,Ukulina and in Westlands I would like the Minister<\NEWSPEECH>QUORUM<NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I guess we may have to adjourn for tea because we have no quorum in the Souse. MR. SPEAKER: Yes, We have no quorum. Rlrg the Division Bell.<\NEWSPEECH>(The Division Bell was rung) MR. SPEAKER: You may continue, Mr. Otwani.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOE MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AHD EMPL0YIENT (Mr. Otwani Mr. Speaker, Sir, I suggest that we send out a crux questionnaire to find out why there is no quorum whenever hon. Wameyo is in the Douse. Before I was interrupted, I was talking about the health situation in factories. We should also not ignore the mental state of inspectors and the workers. The workers One area which. I would like the Minister to look at is with. Regard to terms of service for/factory inspectors. The term 'factory inspector' is a. broad  one covers all types of professions, such as, engineers, medical doctors, biochemists, chemists and so on whose counterparts elsewhere have specific terms of service. Factory inspectors do not seem to have specific terms of service am and they, therefore, envy their counterparts elsewhere who are well placed when, they themselves are lumped together-: The Minister should look into this matter and establish terns of service for them or consider them along the lines of their fellow professionals. In this way,	we shall reduce the demoralising working situation that day prevail."We realise that these factory inspectors should be holders of master’s degrees in various fields and I think the Government, through the Minister, should be directly concerned with the training<\NEWSPEECH>	THE MINISTER FOR LABGKJR (Mr. Okondo): On a point of information, Mr. Speaker, Sir- I would like to inform the hon. Assistant Minister that factory inspectors are civil servants who are recruited under the Public Service Commission 'Terms. and are covered by the general recuperation of the Civil Service whose terms are reviewed from time" to time There is, therefore, no way 1a which we can say in this house that they are- unhappy with their terms of service. 5Te can only know that through the normal Civil Service channels.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>TIE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT' (Mr. Otwani) I thank the Minister , for that piece of information but I would still request him to establish why factory inspectors are not satisfied with their terms of service and/they appear to think that their counterparts are better off.Before I was interrupted, I was talking about inspection. I wassuggesting that the Minister considers sending factory inspectors for furthertraining so that they can acquire masters’ degrees in various disciplines.This--is because, at the moment, we still have many officers who need to be.Trained, further but their training is pending because we depend on the BritishCouncil or the Finnish Institute of Occupational health.On the welfare of workers, I would, like to say that the mental situationof the workers has to be considered along with the physical requirements. Sir,most of the lower cadre employees travel very long distances every day to workin various places. They travel from. Pandora, Kibera, Kangemi and so-on whichare distances of beyond eight kilometres. The Minister should consider negotiating with employers so that they can subsidize the workers' transport. I wonder why even open Lorries cannot be availed to the ordinary workers tohelp them reach the factories with ease.<\NEWSPEECH>Most of the workers are withering away due to lack of lunch. I think lack of proper feeding is an even greater danger than the risk of working near boilers, gases and so on.Finally, I would like to comment on the hazards of noise in the factories. I think common observation shows that most of the machineryTIE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVEL0PMENT AND EMPLOYMENT (Mr. Otwani)Ctd,used is most factories is archaic and noisy and this may cause deafness. Deafness is not very well covered under this Bill and it is not automatically compensated for as to the case with other hazards. THZ ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVEL0PMENT AND EMPLOYMENT (Mr. Otwani) (CTD):Whenever cases of injury arise, the excuse given is that the workers have not used the appliances as advised. Maybe, since the factory inspectors have more factories to inspect now, we should x consider using the right machines right from the beginning in order to reduce the risks instead of relying on employee's protection, which he may not provide, although he will argue in any court that he provided the equipment and that it is the workers who may not have used it. Perhaps some factories have the safety equipment but they do make them, available for use by the. Workers, So, when cases of injury arise they produce. The equipment to substantiate a false claim that they made them available but the worker never used them Therefore, maybe in future we will use modern plans and stop using the plans of the existing factories so that the noise aspect is taken care of. When this Bill goes through, I would like the Minister to consider regulating for the fact that compensation, should paid automatically without evidence of a doctor or going to a court of law.MR. Speaker, Sir, finally we note that in towns and elsewhere, we have plants like printing presses and so on that have been installed in enclosures that were not meant to house factories at all. Machinery that been installed in small enclosures between buildings are of course, extremely dangerous. ..After this Bill is passed, there should be a deliberate attempt to discourage installation of machinery, especially printing presses and other smaller types "of machinery which are very dangerous to human life, anywhere, which seems to be' the practice at the moment.With those remarks, I beg to support.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.TERER: Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this very important Bill. would like to congratulate the Minister for the way in which he presented this bill. He did it very ably and in his opening remarks he said that between 1978 and 1988 365 people died at their places of work, which is a big number. He also added that during the same period 22,226 people suffered injuries at their places of work; .I think many more contracted diseases at their places of work. This Bill been brought at the right time and i hope its passage will be in the interests of factory workers. I would like to join my colleagues in expressing a wish that new factory employees should medically checked to establish their health conditions before they are employed and thereafter be periodically checked, to- determine whether their health continues to flourish or deteriorate. I am saying this because unless there are frequent checks on the workers we may not be able to monitor the health conditions of the factory employees. The factories.Should be asked to keep medical records of their employees. These records should he made available to the Factory Inspectorate personnel whenever they go round to inspect the factories; the inspectors should scrutinise such records so that they can monitor the health conditions of the employees.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to touch on factory machinery. I think this machinery should also be checked from time to time to established whether it is dangerous to workers and perhaps, to the members of the public in general. Checking the machinery from time to time reduces, or eliminates, the risk to the workers. Checking also ensures that the machinery does not affect the environment. There certain factories that emit dangerous gases, or fumes, that actually affect the environment.?ME. TERER (CTD):I think this is the work of the Factory Inspectorate personnel and they should actually ensure that they do their job properly.Mr. Speaker, Sir, this bill has also touched on the question of research. I think continual research, experimentation and demonstration are necessary in order to formulate criteria for the formulation of safety and health- standards of the workers and the environs of the factory. The Ministry should come up with a research programme so that the money it collects from the levy is well utilised. The research work should be a permanent institution that should operate on a daily basis and carry on research concerning factories. This will actually improve the safety of the workers and also the environs of the factories.Sir, I note that now Parliament will appropriate some money to the Occupational health and Safety Fund. I think this should be subject to the normal audit and its audited accounts annual accounts together with the annual report of the Chief Inspector of Factories should be laid so that hon. Members can have a look at them and in this way the Factories Inspectorate will become accountable to this House through, the Minister.With the regard to the National Advisory Committee on Occupational Health and Safety, I think the Chief Inspector of Factories should not be its chairman. The Chief Inspector of Factories should be the chief executive, and the Minister, or somebody else appointed by him, should chair this committee. This is because the Chief Inspector of Factories, as the chief executive is supposed to implement the decisions of the committee, but he cannot be the implementer and at the same time be the chairman of the policy making body. So, we need somebody to chair this committee.Mr. TERER (CTD):Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue of distribution of factories is not clear. In certain areas, for example Nairobi, We have a congestion of factories .While factories are supposed to be distributed all over the country. Of course, we have to look at the economics of the. factories, but I think the investors should be persuaded to establish factories in other areas of this Republic. This will actually encourage urban—rural migration. We know that many people are moving from rural areas to big towns like Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu., Nakuru and so on in search of employment. I think if factories are evenly distributed all over the country, we shall not have job seekers concentrated in one place like Nairobi. We know that such a high concentration in one place overstretches the social facilities provided by a place like the City of Nairobi I now wish to turn to the issue of the NSSF. I think I heard some time back that the Minister would revise NSSF contributions upward. MR. TERER (CTD.):My appeal is that the. Employer be made to contribute the money that is contributed by employees. This is actually going to give<\NEWSPEECH>	<NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): On a point of order Mr. Speaker, Sir.. I realise that the hon. Member is not-very old in this House, but he is completely out of order because the National Social. Security Fund (N.S.S.F.) has nothing to do with this inspectorate, and I wish he could continue to talk about the inspectorate as that might be more useful.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. TERER: Mr. Speaker Sir, I would have thought that factory employees contribute to the N.S.S.F. and that it would actually be for their benefit to get more money from their employers. Maybe the Minister feels that. these two parties are not related but, as far as the employee is concerned, he is employed by the factory and he needs to get something substantial at the end of his employment.Since much has already been said on this Bill, I would now- beg to support the Bill<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.MALEBE: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to support this amendment Bill. In sub—clause 3 (a) (1), the word "or" seems not to stress the application of the. Bill, and I propose that. This word be replaced with the word "and", so that it reads:-"the provisions of this Act shall apply only to factories and other places of work as defined by this Act	On the approval of plans, which are mentioned here, I think it would be fair if the Minister amalgamated the Building Act with the Factories Act so that when plans are to be approved, they are taken from local authorities to the Chief Inspector of Factories for the purpose of being approved. This is a point that the Minister should take into account if the approval of these plans has to be consistent. Such plans should move from local authorities to the Physical Planning Officer, and from here they should go to the Chief/ inspectors of FactoriesOne problem that the Chief Factories Officer encounters is-the inspection of machines. Chief/ factories of should be competent persons MR.MALEBE:trained in various disciplines, particularly mechanical, work. This would mean that some inspectors of factories could be mechanical engineers capable of carrying out regular checks on machines with respect to safety measures in order to protect employees from getting injured. In this case, these inspectors would be able to identify those parts that are weak or worn out and need repair so as to issue orders to the employer to stop using certain machines or to rehabilitate them. This falls under the chief inspector of factories and his staff, who should be competent enough to protect workers against machines that can disintegrate at any time.I have read through the amendments proposed here, and I wonder whether the machinery on site, and not necessarily in factories, has been considered for the purpose of ensuring the protection of workers on site. In drilling — water or geothermal - there are machines that could be used without any protection for workers, particularly when the drilling site has highly inflammable or explosive gases.. When such gases blow up, they could kill the operator on the surface.Mr. Speaker left the ChairThe Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Wabuge) took the Chair/ I wonder whether, during the drafting of these amendments, those concerned considered the machinery that is outside the factory. There are instances where employees have been killed by blow-ups of various gases,, particularly when drilling for oil or water. The chief inspector of factories should be able to inspect such machinery to see whether they have blow—up preventers. This amendment should be taken care of under Section 36 of the old Act so as to prevent fatal accidents from machinery that is not necessarily in the factory- With regard to the amendment to Section 37 of the old Act, competent inspectors have to confirm from certificates on boiler specifications that the maximum permissible working pressures are adhered to. In this case, the chief inspector of factories has the option of the overseas manufacturer<\NEWSPEECH>	QUORUM<NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. There, is no quorum in the House at the moment.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): It is" true that there is no quorum in the House now.Ring the Division Bell.(The Division Bell was rung)THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge) : Order we now have a quorum. You can now continue, Mr. Malebe.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: Just before I was interrupted. I was talking about the specification of water boilers. I had said that the chief inspector of Factories should be able to test those imported boilers and ascertain their maximum permissible working pressures.We require very competent personnel in the Ministry to do that work.Sir. Today we are being faced with the problem of imported gas cylinder some of those cylinders have caused fatal accidents in kitchens, because maybe their specifications were not certified by the chief inspector of factories or the certificate which was issued by the manufacturers of the cylinders was not proper. Here it becomes very difficult to find out who is to blame, particularly when an accident is caused by imported gas cylinders which have not been tested locally and accepted by the Kenya Bureau of standards. Sir, I think the Minister should come up with a system which would help to identify who should be blamed in such a case and punished accordingly. The Minister should also look for ways and means of stopping the importation-of substandard gas cylinders or water boilers, so that we can. Save the lives of the people who use those items.	Sir, when gas cylinder or water boilers are manufacture overseas, they should be checked thoroughly before they are used locally. If those items have been manufactured and specified abroad, it is very difficult to get a local person who will carry out a thorough examination on them, because they are already finished items. Unless you dismantle the commodities and check whether they are properly manufactured, then those problems of fatal accidents shall continue. How does the inspector of?  factories certify that those imported gas cylinders comply with the Kenya bureau of standards requirements We are a dilemma there. The Minister should address himself to such issues. Again, if the Ministry accepts the test certificates of the commodities from the overseas manufacturers, and later on the commodities are proved defective, how will such a person be charged? I therefore, think that the Minister should amend the Act in such a way that he will be able to counteract such important sub-standard water boilers and gas cylinders.Sir in most factories you find that the work force is As you know, Sir, the illiteracy level all over the -world is about 53 per cent. Kenya’s illiteracy level is somewhere near that percentage. Most of our labour force is not very learned. Warning signs are displayed in factories to had like highly inflammable or no smoking, how would the chief factory inspector ensure that the literate	worker understands the meaning of those warnings? Although we Say that ignorance is no excuse how will the chief inspector ensure that the semi-illiterate people understand the meaning of those warnings? I think that our workers should be given some training on those warnings. But, unfortunately, most employers' are not willing to train their employees, they just want the to work for them so that they can make huge profits. That is the situation whichexists in most factories at Industrial Area. Most of the factories are owned by Asians, and they just want to milk those illiterate workers. Therefore, how will the chief inspector assists in that regard? That is a problem which the Minister should also address himself to.?MR .MALEBE (ctd.)Sir, Section 16 calls on the employers to notify the chief inspector of factories accidents that occur in their factories. Most of the employers tend to cheat because they will be penalised, or be asked to pay heavy compensation to their workers, sometimes when workers get injured the employers do not report the incidents Today, during Questions time, hon. Mang’oli said that he knew of some people who had had their hands cut off while working in a factory and up to now they have never been compensated - possibly they were ignored. I think the Minister should be very strict on the notification of accidents. If the employer does not notify the inspector of factories about any accident, his factory should be closed down, because by so doing he will be is lying to the Government. . The Ministry should come up with, very tight rules so that every accident is reported to the inspector of factories, so that he can find out the circumstances that led to the accidents. He could find out that the accident occured because a machine was not properly installed or due the negligence of the worker.I would also like to request the Minister to look into the Workmen's Compensation Act, and find, out how it can be merged into the Factories Amendment Act. In the workmen’s Compensation Act, a person may loss his figure and he is only paid Kshs.100/- he may even loss his arm— and he is paid only kshs. 10, 000/-. Therefore, the compensation rates of accidents that happen in factories is very low. The Minister should have brought a recommendation stating that the employee’s compensation should be improved. The workmen’s Compensation Act is colonial, and the compensation that is paid to the workers is very low. If a person dies while working in a factory , I think he not paid more than kshs.48,000/- although today human life is very expensive .MR. MALEBE (Ctd.):I think the Minister should also review the Workmen's Compensation act to bring it in line with, the present Factories (Amendment) ActFinally, I would like to touch on the safety and health committees in the factories. I would like to say that it was a very good idea in thefirst place to establish these committees within the factories to take care of the welfare of workers. However, the figure ofv2Q employees as given here is not appropriate for we know for sure that there, many factories which employ more than 20 employees. Secondly, representation of workers in these committees should be at least five employees although each of these committee will be comprised of seven or more members*. This would assist the employees a great deal because where an employee is involved in an accident, then these committees can be able to say what happened and will always do sane thing far the welfare of the employee.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think it is timely for thisAct to be amended. I do know that there are many more Jets which should alsobe amended. I have in mind here the Mining Act which needs to be amended ‘and brought up to date. I would appeal, to the various Government Ministersto follow the good example of the Minister for Labour and bring out-of-date. Acts affecting their Ministries to this House for Amendment. You will findthat the Mining Act and the Water Act, are very old and outdated pieces oflegislation which should now be amended. These two lets are colonialAnd it is unfortunate they have never been presented to this house for amendment, and i wouldappeal to the Ministers concerned to make sure that they bring these two Actsto this House far amendment.With those few remarks, I support the amendment Bill.<\NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): Thank you very much ,Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to also contribute to this very important Bill which, I think ought to have been brought to this House many years back. I support most hon. Members in the sentiments that they have expressed on this 3ill, namely that occupational health has not been taken seriously in the past. This is why the Minister for Labour found itTHE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Ctd.)fit to bring this amendment Bill to improve the working conditions of our people. However, it appeared, to me that most hon. Members confused occupational health inspectorate with the workmen’s compensation Act Sometimesit is very difficult to differentiate between the two because compensation arises after sane thing wrong has been done to an employee. However, occupational health committee does not necessarily deal with accidents caused at work, bat it deals with health hazards such as very loud noise, smoke, gas and so on. hon. Members who have SZBK spoken on this Sill may not know that noise could be a very bad health hazard. If a factory is sited in, a residential area, that factory can be very dangerous to the people if it operates for 24 hours.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there was a time I was working in the Ministry of Labour and I know that at that time, the staff of the inspectorate department were very much dissatisfied with their terms and condition of service. One of the reasons why this amendment has been, brought here is because we want to create a levy for the inspectorate so that the inspectors will from now onwards have is improved terms and conditions of service. I am told that quite a number of factories do not keep good medical records and I think this is true. The reason why these factories do not keep such, records is because they do not want to pay compensation to the injured employees. I hope that the inspectorate will take a very serious note of this. We JULL would like to make sure that if -an employee was hurt by sheer and. unexpected accident, he would be compensated. However, the crusial matter here is to prevent these JS kind of accidents and this is one of-the main reason why this will has been introduced to this house.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is. The national advisory committee whichhas been established to look into the activities of those other committees. This committee must monitor the duties of these committees which could sometimes overlap. I think the Ministry of environment and a Natural He sources should be Silly involved in all matters that affect our environment0 For example, when a factory is being established, the Ministry of Environment and NaturalResources should be involved straight away . If the establishment of a factoryTHE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Ctd):is likely to pollute water for human consumption, or  if it is going to produce materials which, emit had smell, like the Bata Factory in Limuru, then this factory should not be established in a residential arsa0 Sugar factories also produce affluent which cause bad smell and this offends the people. .Thi3 is part of occupational health hazard should be looked into at any time when a factory is to be established in any place in the Republic.MT. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, a certain hon. Member said thatwe should establish factories all over the country.- This is not very easybecause factories are established in appropriate places where infrastructures and raw materialare available. If for example wewanted to establish a factory to be producing mats, the most appropriate placewon Id perhaps be in 2unyala. However, if we established such a factory, sayin the North-Eastern Province, it would be very difficult. to transport theneeds from Bunyala: to North.—Eastern. So, when establishing a factory in the country,anywhere in the country due consideration should be made with regard to the availability of raw materials.THE MINISTER. FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (,CTD) ;Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the	ChiefInspector of Factories is actually the chief executive. I think hon. Terer was complaining that the Chief Inspector of Factoriesshould be the Chief Executive.- He is indeed the Chiefexecutiveand that is the purpose of this amendment. No "Chief ExecutiveChairman" is mentioned anywhere in this Bill.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.' I just want to give some information regarding the previous speaker because of the point which the Minister has just raised The previous speaker had said that instead of the ChiefInspector of Factories being the Chairman He never talked aboutan executive chairman.'' This is because the Chief Inspector of Factories is the Chief Executive of that departments But within the national Advisory Committee the Minister should appoint an independent person as the Chairman7 This is because the Chief Inspector of Factories cannot be an implementer as well as a policy—maker." That is what hon. Terer said. <\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER. FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (.Mr.Midika): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,. Sir. I know that hon. Male be would like to have the Act amended so that he can go drilling for water and other things But that is even more dangerous and I think if the Chief Inspector of Factories was to look into anything other than what we are talking ' about the Mining Act would be brought here to be amended so that hon." Malebe is excluded.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to assure the hon. Member " that the Chief Inspector of Factories will not at any time be biased because the Act is going to assist to act fairly." This i why the Act is here."" But if you begin to doubt and have reservations about the type of officers that are going toan Act As I said earlier this Bill has been brought rather late. It should have come a long time ago because I know how manyTHE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (CTD);People suffer. We in the Government have found it fit thatthis Bill be passed almost immediately so that who have been suffering in good time.' The hon." Member raised a point of argument and I will not dwell on that.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>ME. KUBO: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir." I have listened to the Minister but he appears to be forgetting that he is now the Minister for Regional Development." He is still talking as if he is an Assistant Minister for Labour. He is speaking as if he is defending the Ministry or answering the views raised by hon.' Members." Can he make his own contribution?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (.Mr. Wabuge) : You will realise that he is no longer an Assistant Minister in the Ministry of '. Labour, but with collective responsibility he is entitled to say what he has already said."<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr Midika): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir," the hon." Member who is-- a lawyer and-? a very good friend of mine should know that I am a Minister in. the" ' Government but not a Minister for Regional ' Development"Alone If I behaved, like the Minister for Regional Development and nothing else, I would be a very narrow Minister." But I would like" Be a Minister in the Kenya Governments The hon. Member is my friend I am sure that when I need him, -especially when X' do not understand something legally, I will go to him. At the moment I am competent enough and I can say that I know exactly what happens in the Ministry of Labour. I am also very happy that this Bill was brought in good time. All that I am saying is that if all the hon.' Members could listen very carefully and read every page and every sentence in the Bill to assist us in getting the right Bill passed in this House, the better.<\NEWSPEECH><HEADER>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (CTD)<\HEADER>Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, one aspect of this Bill which we need to look at very carefully - and I am sure that theMinister is very g keen about it - is the collection of levy.This is important and that levy might need an -institute to look after it." But I think that at the Committee Stage we could agree that a regulation can be introduced by the Minister to control the collection of this 'money so that this money, is spent by the Ministry ofLabour and for the purpose it is meant." This is a very important point because it is only then that the Inspectorate will be able to. Do its job as stipulated in the Act.'' I do not think that the amount will be very big.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also agree with, the rest of the hon. Members that it is about time that the Workmen's Compensation a Act was amended so that compensation is done in a more satisfactory manner." The KShs . 48,000/- that hon. Malebe was talking about is indeed very little money. I agree with hon. Malebe he that KShs .48,000/- in the present Kenya cannot do any good to anybody But I  am sure that the	; Minister for labour,who is a very competent man, is aware of this problem I am sure, that he is going to look into every aspect of the Act including the compensation paid to our people7 AS I said before, the two Acts are very, very close to each other; one causes the other one to' happen." Accidents occur when proper- inspection of machinery has not been doneMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also agree with hon. Male be entirely that the inspector should he able, at a certain stage, to say yes or no	as to when	machinery should be imported into this country. Hon." Malebe also wondered – whathappens in a factory where machinery has been installed and the people there are illiterates What happens is-that factories are labelled andpainted with such paints as to show which area is dangerous and which area is not dangerousTHE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT ( CTD) ;Even if you are x literate you may not be able to read, everything Inthe factory. But you will find that the painting is done in such a way that certain paints mean danger and certain paints mean safety.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in as icing the Minister to take certain aspects of this Bill very seriously, I think the factories that are in the rural areas have been neglected. They have been neglected in the sense that they have not been inspected regularly.' But this is because the Act had not been amended the	inspectors were not able to visit the places.' When this Bill is passed, there will be sufficient funds for all the inspectors to make regular inspections of factories.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, some employers are indeed very unscrupulous and can be dangerous. Some of them have in fact used the old Act to disregard everything.' As I said, I am on their financial side of this Bill because if we get the money and the money is used by the Ministry of Labour, there, is no reason whatsoever why the Ministry cannot be efficient. A situation should be created where the workers will see a change.'' A change always made our people suspect or disregard certain offices." A. change must be seen to be done in this area." As soon as the Act becomes operational, we must see- a change. A Change is important in that many workers who lose their limbs as a result of accidents will be this time be reduced in – number  At this point I do not think literacy or illiteracy matter.' The inspectors should be able to conduct seminars to educate workers - and so on. I do not want to dwell so much on this Bill  because its objectives are quite clear.' Hon. Members who have read the THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (CTD) ;Memorandum of Objects and Reasons know that the objectives of the Bill are very clear. The Bill proposes the establishment of a tally fledged Factory Inspectorate headed by the Chief Inspector of. Factories. The Chief Inspector of Factories will be a competent Kenyan and I am sure that the Ministry will ensure that the Chief Inspector of Factories is a man of high calibre and that the work will be done to the satisfaction of every Kenyan.With those few remarks, I beg to support the Bill.<NEWSPEECH>ME. MUREITHI: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me - this opportunity to say a few words .on this Bill.Firstly I would like to talk about Clause 14 of the Bill. This amendment is the one that makes provision under the new sub-section 39(a)- for the designing and manufacturing of cylinders for compressed liquefied gases would like to say that this section is not very clear in   sense that when it comes to the specifications that will be used, it states, and I quote“That it shall conform to a standard specification prescribed under the Standards Act, .or where/standard is not prescribed c.a. standard specification approved  in writing by the Director, Kenya Bureau of Standards".Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think it is necessary that whoever is manufacturing any cylinders is sure from the very  beginning of what, the general standards are. I say so because I am aware of one particular- case where they have been manufacturing, cylinders and. one oil'-company has refused to supply those cylinders manufactured by that particular company, while all the other oil companies have agreed that the cylinders meet, certain specific standards. I would, therefore, urge that the mode of approval and the requirements that are necessary for-the manufacture of cylinders be comprehensive and clear- from the very beginning. I would further say that the new section 69G.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Nassir): Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda. Maneno haya ambayo ndugu yangu anayosema ni yale yale tu tuliyoyasema jana- kwa hivyo, ningeomba Waziri aitwre ajibu, kwa hisani yako.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): I think hon. Nassir is right- But, unfortunately, looking at the records, he has already spoken on this Bill. Therefore, if he had not spoken on this Bill then his point of order would be in order.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MURSITEI: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir I will be very brief; I will riot take more than two minutesI was talking about the new section 69G- which deals with approval of plans by the Chief Inspector of Factories. The Act does not provide what requirement an investor or a "builder of a factory is to before his factory is approved - I would urge that it is necessary for those people who are investing to be certain of the requirements that will be required "by the Chief Inspector of Factories. These rules should be specifically provided for, even if it is under the rules to be made under the Act. I say so because there have been complaints by some investors in this country that they are not certain of the rules under which they should operate. So it takes a long time before a project takes off the ground. Therefore, I would urge the Minister to make certain that the rules are there and they are understood by _ everybody who wants to invest in this countryMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, with regard to the issue of this committee that is the new committee to be provided under amendment number <\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr.Chesire) On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.- In view of the fact that this Bill has been debated very exhaustively, may I move that the Mover be now called upon to reply.<\NEWSPEECH>(Question, that the Mover be now called upon to reply, put and agreed to)<NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I believe that this is an important amendment of the laws that are still colonial but have been with us for so long. When His Excellency the President told the House to debate on this Bill, we made sure that? THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Ctd.):it came. This is "because it is our duty to obey the orders and go ahead to implement whatever has been recommended as soon as possible.	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this country is galloping forward in every aspect, and so it is right that the Factories Act also be brought up to date to accommodate the changes in technology that have occurred since the last Act was amended. The last Act was enacted in the 1950’sMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as we are getting very modern ,developed and moving on very fast, it does surprise us sometimes when you read newspapers that some people are unhappy with this country and they want to run to other countries. I even understand that one persons went to Canada probably thinking it is warmer there, hut Canada is quite a frozen to stay place, and he may find that there is no room for him/Up there - Probably, he will, soon be begging to come back to this very beautiful country.THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (ctd.):Some of us have travelled quite a lot. and we know that despite the few difficulties we may have here, this country is a lot much better than many other places you can go to. I have visited Canada several times. It is a nice place to go but I would not say that it is the nicest place to exchange for Kenya.Mr. Temporary Deputy speaker, sir, our factories are producing a lot of goods for us and, as such, we need to make rules and regulations that suit them. I would like to say that most of the criticism of the amendment have been constructive and we are set to accept most of it which will enable us to move forward to improve in the Bill. Those we think are not good enough will, of course, be dealt with accordingly and, perhaps, not taking any action about them.Sir, at this point, let me say that hon. Otwani made several good points. However, I did draw his attention to the fact that as a Minister, I am not at the moment aware, and I have no indication, at all, of any inspectors of factories who are presently unhappy or dissatisfied with their terms of service. At present, we are all one team working happily together. The terms, of service are in accordance with those established by the Public Service Commission for all civil servants and the scales of pay are in accordance with those approved for the factory inspectors. That is what they get in accordance with their qualification and experience. If anyone is unhappy, of course. he is at liberty to mention it to the chief inspector of factories and onwards to the permanent secretary and to thePublic Service Commission. I do not think that this House is the right place to discuss the pay of civil servants. I am sure that the hon. Assistant Minister did not mean to bring the matter up in that manner; he was only drawing my attention to the fact that if we are going to be effective, then everybody who is involved in the operation has to do his part and do it well. That is what he meant and it is what I understand, and that is what I believe the Government understands.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question of correct labelling of materials that, are used in factories has been raised by many speakers. It is true that unless materials are labelled properly they can cause trouble and accidentsNevertheless, we have provided in the Act that it is the owner of the factory who imports material that shall be responsible for ensuring that> the produces he brings are safe. If workers in a factory are injured due to unsafe materials, then, the factory owner shall be the one to blame. Of course, it is not possible for a factory inspector to see these things in advance, but if he happens to, then well and good. All in all, it shall be the responsibility of the factory owner to ensure that everything is well done. To help him in this respect, we have proposed that each factory with 20 workers or more should have a safety committee which will be responsible for seeing to it that any situation that may create a hazard is as far as possible either eliminated, contained or controlled. That shall be the purpose of the safety committee in each factory.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, one may argue that this safety committee will take care of factories employing 20 people or more, which is true. As we know in smaller factories these issues, do not arise to the. Same-extent; you do not get that agglomeration of things that create the same kind, of problem. This is drawn from experience. Of course, you can to to an extent of saying that even one person in a factory can be endangered,, which is also true. Of course, I agree that' one person in a factory can be endangered. For instance, a driver can be be endangered. When a driver is sitting in the sit of his. Car driving, he is in his work, place. How do you safeguard him from an accident? Of course, you can make all the regulation, but it is very difficult to say that a driver may not meet an accident along the road. He could sleep, for instance, and you cannot make a law against sleep. In the same way, you can say that occupational safety of a driver is put in danger by a lorry which is left parked without lights. That is true because the driver's occupation is to drive and his work place is the motor-car, which is endangered by a lorry parked along the road without lights. We can regulate and do everything possible, but it is not completely possible to negate the situation by removing those kind of dangers. The driver should also be careful, and it is also dangerous for a lorry to be parked along, the road without lights. Whoever does it must be prosecuted. 3ut sometimes perhaps he does it and two minutes later a driver arrives and meets the accident. So, this is the dilemma. To what level would you decide? That is why there must be some kind of area in which you decide, and experience shows that a lot of accidents begin to happen when people are more the 20, and that is why we have used the figure twenty in our Act. in constituting safety committees in factories.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there has been talk of asbestos being unsafe, and it is true that the material is unsafe. However, it is not all asbestos that is not safe; it is only certain kinds of asbestos that are not safe. , Even that being so, asbestos has to be in certain situations to sake it unsafe. Although asbestos of that type has been banned in many developed countries, we do not use that kind of asbestos here. We use the other two varieties which are relatively safe. Also, whenever we use the two varieties, they are usually encased in concrete or in. some other plastic material. It is true that when you have to use asbestos you have, to grind it, but we try to protect the workers as-much as possible. So, the debate on asbestos continues. You will, remember that, it is only recently that the Director of Medical Services appointed a committee to look into the use of asbestos in industries in Kenya. We have had rather inconclusive situations. I, personally, am an advocate of banning asbestos altogether, but I have also realised that there are areas where certain, types of asbestos are used such that you cannot really ban it. For instance, you cannot ban asbestos when it comes to fire-fighting material. What do you replace it with? Is the type of asbestos used in firefighting equipment dangerous? Our experience, and what is known world over, is that it is not.When you think about brake-lining, there is no suitable substitute for brake—lining to asbestos. There are various types of plastics which are being developed, but they are not yet sufficient to make a substitute.So,THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (ctd.):  So we will go ahead with world opinion and use our own research eliminate the use asbestos from as many areas of industries as possible. But I must also at the same time confess that it may take time to eliminate it completely and entirely from every aspect of our industrial operations.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there has also been a request from the work-oriented hon. Members of this House that the Occupational and Safety Committees that represent the workers should be nominated by the workers themselves. But of course that is the purpose of the whole thing. We are a free tripartite organization in Kenya and we do practically everything concerning the workers, factories and labour markets this way. We try as much as possible to use this approach. So you will, find out that in clause 24, we have, provided for the National-.Advisory Committee on Occupational. Health and Safety which, includes, the Federation of Kenya Employers as well as the Central. Organisation of Trade Unions. When we say that, the health-.committees will consist of workers-we mean that the employees will also sit with the management, in. the safety committee. So that, suggestion, has been provided for already in the Act.	It had also been suggested that the factories should each have a list of doctors am sure that any worthwhile employer, has a number of doctors: that he refers his workers to. Most employers do that. Although that is so this is a democratic country; a country where individuals- have the freedom of choice. This is what Nyayo is all about. The philosophy of peace, love and unity establish the freedom of choice. So every worker must be free to choose his own doctor. If we put down a list of doctors and say that it is only the doctors on that list who will treat the workers in a certain factory, some of the workers might refuse to be attended by them. Suppose a worker has a friend who is a doctor, he might wish to go that doctor rather than the factory doctor. If a worker gets a job in a certain factory and he had a personal doctor for a very long time he is not going to drop him just because there is a doctorin the factory. So we must allow the freedom of choice and flexibility in this kind of thing. If we do not do that then we shall be' going against the Nyayo Philosophy of flexibility in such matters ensure that we remain a democratic societyMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there have been criticisms that the inspectors should be learned and all kinds of things. Such suggestions are right because our .inspectors are professionals. They are chosen for their specific knowledge of factory The purpose of this Act is to improve the quality of these inspectors.. If we need a boiler to be checked we will use a person who knows about them and so on. We will use and do use experts in such matters. We do not take any Dick and Harry to do a certain inspection when he has no knowledge about that thing at all. We go by qualifications. So those who raised this issue were right so that I  could use this opportunity to give them the realities and inform them more about what we intend to do. The people we employ as inspectors are not ignorant people but people who are knowledgeable in their respective fields.There have also been repeated comments that we should ensure that the factory' construction is safe  they contain harmless things and that they should be built in a manner that is going, to ensure that it is safe. This is why the Act requires the plan for a- factory and the details of all its instalments to be brought in to the Chief Inspector of Factories for approval. If he is not satisfied that the factory will be safe, he will not approve the plan, which means that such a factory will not be built. This is why the Act states that all the plans have to be submitted. We have also provided in the amendments that where the Chief-Inspector finds that a factory has undesirable aspects, he can issue a notice to inform the factory owner that the factory is so in what respects. If the owner does not comply with this then the inspector can issue a prohibition order to prohibit the factory form operating until they have made' all the required adjustments and reconstruction. We are have been very careful on this issue. But at the same time I am grateful to the hon. Members who have pointed this out because it is a reality. There are cases where factories are changed or built in contradiction to what has been planned. So we are now saying that until the factory owner has received approval from the Chief. Inspector of Factories, he cannot build that factory alter it, or maker adjustments to it.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, a question has been raised in other quarters, not in this House about alterations in factories. The contention is that some alterations could minor which means that they would not need the authority of the Inspector of Factories. I do not agree with this. There is nothing like negligible alteration to a factory. This is because one might think that moving a door from one wall to another is negligible. But it might be very material depending on the way the' fumes in the factory go. Also because escape from a fire may be very material depending on the situation of the machines in the factory. So all these things are important.A factory owner may sometimes think that moving a machine slightly isa negligible move; but it could prove that that slight movement reduces space between workers or machines which might cause a lot of danger to the workers. Or a factory owner may say that he needs more space for a desk; but that desk may be endangering-the workers in the factory. This is why we are insisting that all changes in a factory must be notified to the inspector and that until and unless he approves those changes they should not take place. Unless we do that factory owners could adjust a factory little by little, door by door, block by block, machine by machine and at the end of: it after a year you will find  that the factory that is being used is not the factory which the inspectorate-approved. THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (ctd):When an accident occurs, that would be a different factory from what is on the plans in the inspector's office. That may very weII, endanger the occupational health of the people working in that factory. That is why we insist that all changes must be brought forward to the inspector and his authority solicitedOf course, where the inspector sees that the change is immaterial, he may choose not to reply. In that case, after a period of time, the factory, owner may choose to implement his changers. But where the change is material, definitely the inspector will reply and I intend to bring an amendment to the Souse to the effect that such a reply shall be communicated specific within a specific time.	These are some of the suggestions that have been brought forward and the hon. Members can rest assured that the limitation of time within which the chief inspector of factories must reply will be specified in the Act. At  present this is not specified.It has also been requested by some hon. Members that we should  state the number of people who are going to be on the safety committee. I do not think we can legislate this kind of thing. We should leave it to the factories because one factory may find that five members are enough while  another- factory which has a thousand employees may find that 12 are required. We have to be practical because if we legislate about the number of members required, we would be too rigid and make it impossible for the factories to operate properly.I would like to say that the word "workplace" as I explained earlier on, encompasses any other place that is not a factory including all jua kali operations. This is because of all jua kali tools could be dangerous to the workers unless they are looked after properly. For example, a  driver's workplace n which is his seat in the vehicle and the road on which he is driving must be made safe for occupational purposes.Therefore, I do not accept the notion that we must legislate on how many .people each safety committee should have. The factory owners are very intelligent people and, in fact, that is why they are able to run a factory. The workers are no fools either because they have organised their trade unions well and are also very intelligent people. He must, therefore allow them to use their brains and set up safety committees according to their wishes. Our requirement from the inspectorate would be that a committee exists in practice and not in theory. That will make sure that such a committee is in existence.The question of casual workers arose in the contributions of various hon. Members. The first thing that we must realise and accept is the fact that health, conditions are the same for permanent and casual workers. At the time of working in a given place, it does not really matter whether you are permanent or casual. Therefore, the safety conditions must be exactly the same. We must not distinguish between casual workers and permanent employees. I do not accept that.	Where the difference occurs is. Whether, a casual worker should also be examined for medical fitness when being taken on.  If a casual is going to be taken on for a long time, he should be examined also. What is a casual worker? He is a person who is paid daily after rendering services .He is at liberty to choose to come to work the following- day or to stay out.  For that kind of person, it would not be very easy to require the factory to have him medically - certified. It would not be fair because he will be there for only eight hours or for one hour, say, to clean or to:, move luggage. It would not be very easy „ to take such a person for. Medical examination before rendering you services. That would make it impracticable and unworkable. That is why we are saying that casual workers must continue as at present and I do not think we would require them to be subjected to medical examination. If he is ill, he will, obviously, not be a casual worker.At the same time, we have to accept that casual workers are a lubricant in the industrial situation. This is because without casual workers, certain jobs would not continue. For example, if a building contractor was required to take all his workers on permanent terms, it would be impossible because the moment he completes. a given building, he does not need those people and he may not have another job for a year. What, will he be doing with these people for a year? We have to be practical and agree that this is the case.Casual workers can fill in an area where labour is sought, and move again to another place where they may be required. They are, therefore, a lubricant in industrial set-up you cannot legislate against having casual workers. Moreover, there are certain people who can only work as casuals. For example, there are people who have their own equipment and are called in to mend something and go away on completion of the job. They do not want to be permanent. Casual workers will always be there and I think we better accept that they are a necessary part of our industrial structure.Indeed, Six, in the more developed countries like western Europe and North America, more and more people prefer to be casual workers than permanent employees. This is because the skills change so quickly with modern implements, such as, computers, electronic machinery and so on, that no one wants to be tied to one type of skill in case it goes out of date and he is forced to move elsewhere. They prefer to be flexible and to fit in to the new industry and new skills as they come. This is the way the world is moving.When we complain about  casual workers, we should talk about their terms of remmeration rather than the question of whether they are permanent or not.It is true that some employers cheat in this field but we do not' operate on the principle of those who cheat but on the truthful ones. It is for those who cheat that this Act and similar Acts are meant.? We have the Employment Act which looks after those who cheat. If a factory owner forwards a false report about his factory, he will be dealt with. That is why we have factory inspectors who make sure that the information which is given is true and if it is false, the Act provides for punishment in accordance with the cheating that may have taken place. THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (CTD):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it has also been suggested that we have to be very careful because the Occupational Health and Safety Fund that we are proposing here could have have. Financial problems. It is true it could have financial problems and is that is why we are saying that the Permanent Secretary, Treasury, will he responsible for the management of that Fund until a later stage when its own management will be set up. That is also why we are saying in? This Bill that the Ministry of Finance will issue accounting regulations to .control and direct the management of the Fund. I am not sure what else we can do beyond that. This is because financial problems do not occur due to lack of rules, but usually because somebody connected with a financial system or within it chooses to be fraudulent. You can make all rules and regulations, but it is not possible to stop fraud, because this is just stealing. There is no country, or organisation, where stealing has been wiped out .God gave a commandment — for those who are christians,I believe it is the seventh commandment - which says, "Thou shall not steal”, and I am sure the Koran also forbids stealing? But we still, have thieves because some people are horn with the habit of always wanting to steal and there is no way you can cure that kind of “disease". That is why the law provides for thieves to be punished.So we- cannot stop operating a f fund simply because there will he, or there could he, financial problems. After all there is no human organisation that runs perfectly. All organisation have hiccups, or faults, and that is why managers and leaders are required. If everything went on smoothly, there would be no need for a manager. I cannot deny that this Fund could have problems, because the people we will employ are not Angels - they will be THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (CTD):liable to making mistakes. But that is why the Bill provides for punishment for those who are found making various mistakes. We will therefore, make every possible effort to ensure that the Fund rules are not infringed.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, a point has been made to the effect that the Occupational Health and Safety Committee should be comprehensive enough to look after polution and disposal of waste.Of  course, this is precisely why we have proposed the creation of a commitee for ensuring that a factory which is increasing polution unnecessarily, is stopped from doing so a factory that disposes waste in a manner that is not conducive to the development or maintenance or sa the environment, should be controlled or punished; Or that a factory that, pollutes the air for miles, is punished. That is why the Bill provides for a factory inspector and gives him the power to inspect factories; and also that is why the Bill gives the Chief Inspector of. Factories power, to prohibit the operation of such a factory until it has corrected all violations that it has been, found effecting.So, effluence should go into the rivers in a pure state. The effluence may contain some chemicals, unless those chemicals are - injurious to human-health, fish or water, but it should-be pure hydrogen oxide and not hydrogen Dioxide or hydrogen chloride. If it happens to contain some sand or leaves this does not matter because they are not chemically harmful "and they degenerate as the effluence flows. However, if such effluence contains some harmful chemicals, we will definitely make every effort to ensure that it does not cause polution.Much a has also been said about fire extinguishers in tall buildings and so on. Of course, occupational health means a lot?THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (CTD)more than fire extinguishers; it refers to the very environment in which the worker is located for up to seven working hours. In fact, a work spends one third of his working life in a factory, an office or some other place. 3y amending this Act, we want to make that place conducive to his well-being; we are not just interested in the risk of fire. We want to ensure a± that he breathes clean air; that the operation of his work are healthy;that he gets sufficient exercise; that his area of work is not polluted by other products from the factory machines; that these things should not render him to be sick within a year, or immediately. So, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the ideal of Occupation health and safety is broader than just fire safety, which is taken care of by the Building Code. I cannot say that fire safety is strictly is a matter of occupation health. The Building Code requires that every room in a building, like the one in which we are, there should have sufficient doors and passages through which occupants can escape in the event of fire. I would, therefore say that the issue of fire safety is already taken care of because construction plans have to be approved in accordance with the building Code.It is also true that the operations of the factory affect the whole area. This is seen in some developed countries where you have  phenomenon called smoker, In some you have poluntants that hover in the air; they cause a mist and prevent you from seeing properly; they also damage people's health, make animals die, make some trees dry up, they make some people get skin diseases and so on. These are the things which we intend to prevent from happening in our country to the same extent that they are happening in. other countries.THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (CTD.):To come back to another example of the motor-car, one of the worst things a motor-car does is to produce a gas called carbon monoxide, which is poisonous. How poisonous is it? When you breathe it, it goes into your system and takes the oxygen there to form carbon dioxide. So, you run short of oxygen, and you die because your body has no oxygen. Therefore, carbon monoxide is a very dangerous gas, but every motor-car that runs on petrol produces this gas through its exhaust pipe every time you ignite and run the car. Many countries have taken steps to reduce the emission of carbon monoxide by putting gadgets in exhaust pipes.. In this country, we have not done so but, with this amendment, the safety organisation may, at one stage, come to require that manufacturers of motor-cars that are being brought here install gadgets in exhaust pipes which extract carbon monoxide from exhaust fumes. Presently, however, we have no way of doing that, but with the amendment that we are putting forward, we will have an organisation that can recommend that this be done.. In this way, we will be improving our environment.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, a lot. has been-, said with regard: „' to factories that lock their workers inside,, and it has been said that" this is J bad practice... This will depend on each factory and which area, inspectors find it- not to be suitable. It may be necessary to lock doors to prevent certain things from happening from outside, but if it is not necessary to lock doors, they will be left open. However, where the nature of work is such that doors have to be locked, this will have to be done. If you are working in an ammunitions factory, you may not be required to carry any ammunition outside the factory. If you are working in a diamond cutting factory, you may not be allowed to just walk in-and out of the factory because there has to be control against stealing, and so on. Therefore, this question will depend on the effect of locking doors, and I cannot say that this is something we can legislate against and say that there will be no locking of doors as this will depend on what the inspector of factories finds so as to .make rules rather than to legislate on it. Of course, we hope that the amendments we are making will not necessarily influence adversely any situation that can create employment; we are only doing what is required for the safety of our people. At any rate, if we get employment which is dangerous and injurious to health, it will not be justifiable or necessary. It must be employment which gives livelihood and makes sure that the person who is receiving this livelihood cam live long enough to enjoy it, but if it is that kind of employment which kills the person who receives the money, obviously, it will not be required. So, the question of this Bill reducing employment opportunities does not really arise.Yesterday, hon. Mang'oli said that some workers are very exposed to temperatures that are ultra-human. We asked him to substantiate this claim but, unfortunately, he did not do so this afternoon. He said the Kenya Breweries, the East Africa Industries and Panafrica Paper Mills expose their workers to temperatures that above human endurance. It could very well be so but, so far, we have not heard any complaints that workers in these factories are exposed to such temperatures. So, since hon. Mang'oli has not substantiated his claim, I must take it that it was not true. These factories are important in this country, and I do not like the idea of their being charged with doing things that are not right when they such big employers, contributing so well and so much to the national growth, and I hope that hon. Mang'oli can see to presenting his arguments in a better way than hurting other people unnecessarily. However, no matter how important an industry is, we will not tolerate it if it hurts its workers. If the Kenya Breweries or any other industry is exposing its workers to too high temperatures we will have look into this matter. All I know is that these factories and others have high tempearature places, but these places are so well guarded that the temperature around them is suitable and, in any case, workers do not stay there for too long. If the temperature-in these places goes beyond tolerance, an alarm bell rings, and the machines in there are cooled down. We should not make statements in this House that can have disturbing effects on manufacturers of the various commodities that we use. THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (CTD.)Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we were given the name of Mr. George Otieno Onyango in Ramisi Sugar Factory as having had his fingers cut and has not been compensated. Again, hon. Mang'oli is not here to say whether he has produced evidence relating to this gentleman, but I hope he will have an opportunity to produce this evidence in due course.We require that a medical examination be carried out on workers for many reasons; firstly, for the employer himself to be sure that he is employing healthy people, and not sick ones, to maintain production at a high level and, "secondly, to ascertain that the employee is healthy at the time he enters employment so that if he gets an occupational disease, we can later- say that this occupational disease resulted from his employment. Thirdly, the employee himself undergoes a medical examination to see that he is strong and healthy enough to undertake the job that he is required to do. These are some of the reasons why we undertake medical checks.. If is it later found that one's. Employment has caused him illnesses, it is very unfortunate because we should be sure from the outset that-the employment is not conducive or induce occupational illnesses. This is the purpose of the whole of this, operation, but,: if a medical examination later reveals that the occupation itself does that, of. Course, we make sure that this .kind of thing is eliminated. The Federation of Kenya Employers is represented in this thing to ensure that employers' interests are looked after. The Central Organisation of Trade Unions, Kenya, is also represented so as to ensure that employees' interests are looked after.It has been suggested that the Fund should be subject to the Auditor-General (Corporations)'s audit, and this is precisely what we have provided. The Treasury will make rules on it to bring it into line with the terms of reference and accounting rules of the Auditor—General (Corporations).THE MINISTER FOR A LABOUR (ctd): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, quite a number of  hon. Members have raised complaints about factory inspectors being corrupt and so on I cannot guarantee that all the factories inspectors that we employ are 100 per cent honest. That would be giving a false-impression. In any organisation some employees are corrupt while others are honest. We cannot generalise and say that all the factories inspectors are corrupt. It would be against human nature to say that majority of them are corrupt. It is normal to find majority people who are straightforward, and a few odd ones who are nottherefore, majority of the factory inspectors are honest people Who do an honest job, and expect an honest pay at the end of the day, and that is what .we must go by. We must give every factory inspector the benefit of doubts, that he is doing an honest job since he is not be corrupt. But we cannot say that. Out of 200 inspectors you cannot get one person who is corrupt. It is only fair to say that out of a number of people. you will find one person who is corrupt. You cannot find two people who are alike. Therefore, there is no way-that you can put down a yard and say that they will all behave and conduct themselves in a certain manner.Sir, in a world where temptation is very high, you cannot expect that a 100 per cent of factories inspectors will be free of corruption. I accept the fact that some of them will be corrupt, but whoever will be found to be corrupt, will not be spared, He will be brought to justice and be treated as a corrupt person that he is. But let us not use that one individual to say that we think that all factories inspectors shall be corrupt. The moment we.?adopt such an attitude, we shall be adopting an attitude of possibilities. In that ease, you might as well not have any employees, because you expect every employee to be corrupt.Sir. all our systems operate under certain norms.. Those norms are followed by the normal person who is also reasonable. Since the person is reasonable, we expect him to behave in a reasonable way. Tine factories inspectors are within that category of reasonable people. If one of them goes wrong, we take action against him individually, but we do not generalise and say that all of them are corrupt. I am sure that is not the positionSir, I can assure the hon. members of this House that most of our factories inspectors are honest people, whom we have not found to be corrupt in any instance. They have given us very good reports about the factories that they have inspected, they have told us the truth about them, and on cross checking we have found that their reports were correct. Hon. Members should" also note that every factory inspector who goes to work is also subject to  being checked as to how his work is being carried out.THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Ctd.):If the Inspectors find the cross-checking to be tedious, then we can take the necessary action this is a very old problem. In fact, it goes as far back as 2,000 years when the Roman were the first to say, "When you put a guard in a place, he can do anything he wants to do, because he is the guard". So who will guard him to prevent him "from doing whatever he wants? The solution here is to also guard the guard "by counter-checking to make sure that whatever he is doing is being done correctly in accordance with the regulations. So, the factory inspector should also counter-check his reports to make sure that they are correct We cannot leave everybody unchecked because in this world, no one is 100 per cent honest® It is the Bible that tells us that in this field, even the Angels failed to be honest and God had to condemn some to hell. There was the chief Angel called rosier who was bearing the light of the world, but he led a rebellion against God and he is now awaiting eternal punishment. So, if things fail at that level, how would one expect them to be perfect at? Ourlevel? If you are a Christian, it would be ideal to consider this position. Jesus Christ had 12 apostles 	MR. WASIEB-NDOMBT: On a "point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. I would hate to interrupt the hon. Minister, but he is a very senior Government Minister should not be giving room for dishonesty in the Government by saying that no one can be 100 per cent honest. The Minister is peaking in. front of the Attorney General and he should be telling the nation that Government expects every officer to be 100 per cent honest making this kind of a statement, the Minister is leaving a loophole for dishonesty so that these inspectors can go out of their way and say, "after all the Minister said in Parliament that one cannot be 100 per cent honest". Is the Minister really in order to be so lenient? <NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): If I heard the Minister from correctly, If he said that it is the intention of this Bill to protect workers/ dangerous hazards in factories. He continued to say that the Bill intends to establish an inspectorate to ensure that the Bill is implemented. I know that some hon. Members have been complaining that sane of the Government officers are corrupt, but the Minister is saying that every individual has his own weakness However, you will find that while some Government officers are honest, others are not honest and this is why this Bill has been introduced in the House so that anyone found to be dishonest, would  be dealt with according to the law. I think that is what I understand the Minister to be saying. He is not saying that Government officers are corrupt and dishonesty, but perhaps he would like to clarify this point. . After all, I know there are some very honest Government officer and this Bill is seeking to introduce an amendment to the existing law so that those found to be dishonest, can be dealt with according to the law.<\NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR LAB0UR (.Mr. Okondo): Thank you very much., Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. You have understood me very well." It is the hon. Member who- did not quite follow what I was saying I was only saying that among so many people, very often you find some who are not very honest and that is true. That is what you understood, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.' That is why this Act is being amended." That is how we are going ahead. But that .also shows that sometimes we understand and hear things differently.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, one hon." Member quoted one clause where it says that an inspector who contravenes sub-sections 1 and 11 shall be guilty of an offence. The hon.' Member: complained that there was no provision for punishment.' Of course this is precisely the point I was making, that in every organization you may find a lot of men and that is why we are providing in this section that an inspector who does not conform to or who breaks these rules will be guilty of an offence. The punishment for that offence w-n i he found in the main clause in the main Act under that section. Under that clause a provision to punish people who fail to observe these rules has been made I do hope that my hon. friend at the corner there will follow what I am saying about the possibility of someone falling.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, those of us who are christians no very well that you cannot have a perfect situations Even our lord Jesus Christ had 12 disciples and one of them was bad.' So, this as is something you cannot have a water-tight situation about.' But we know that everyone we employ is going to be good.' But you cannot guarantee that all of them will be good.' We try our level best; human nature is human nature.' But anyone who breaks the rules will be guilty of an offence and punishment will follow. Definitely no one will be allowed to get away with any kind of corruption or cheating.?THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (CTD);Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, you will find that the Act in Chapter 505(14) provides for the penalties for those who are caught behaving in a manner that is contrary to the spirit of Nyayo. Also a very worthwhile point has been made, that .we  should have mobile clinics to safeguard occupational health.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KYOHDA: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I do-not intend to interrupt the hon." Minister but I beg to move that the Motion be put to the vote.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge) : That is not a point of orders The Minister is replying and at the end of his reply the question will he put.; Proceed, Mr. Okondo please.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. If an hon. Member stands up and says "I beg to move that the Motion be put to vote" that is a procedural Motion.'' It is a procedural Motion and at that point- the question must he put." If the "Ayes" have it, fair enough; if they do not have it, the Mover continues. It is a procedural Motions Therefore it takes precedence over any other Motion and any other speech. I am talking about procedures of. debate.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr.Wabuge) I did not hear your point of order, Dr.Wameyo Can. you repeat it?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: Mr. Temporary Speaker, Sir, sis I said that if we are- having debate and you want to cut short the person sneaking because the matter has been understood, you say "Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move that the Motion he put to the vote" and this becomes a procedural Motion. It takes precedence over any other matter that is being discussed k at that point .Since he ' said that the Motion should be put to the vote that is his Motion.' So, the question should" be put If those who are in favour are in themajority then we move to the Motion.' Ii they are in the minority then the speaker continues to speak.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Order! I think allhon members are conversant withstanding Orders. We are discussing a Bill, and always a Bill is proposed and then it is open for debate. Hon. Members raise their points and after that the Mover is called upon to reply. In his reply, he goes one to explain point by point what hon. Members had raised. So, I think hon. Minister - according to our Standing Order No. 80 - is in order. He has now time to reply, and in the course of replying, he will be answering various matters that had been raised by hon. Members in the debate. Therefore, I think we should not lose our sight in the debate. Let the hon. Minister continue.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. With regards to mobile clinics and other health clinics, these are very desirable. But these are some of the things that the Inspector of Factories will specify where it is necessary to have a mobile clinic. We cannot legislate about that. We must leave it flexible that where the Factory Inspector thinks, it is necessary, he will do so. But, again, this is a question of the factory to make sure that this happens and it is near other clinics and things like" that. But where, it is necessary, it will be implemented and we shall provide that in the rules.So, it is with the Fund, as I said earlier. A Fund will be established and run according to regulations. We hope and trust - that it will work properly in accordance with Government accounting regulations.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question of providing food to workers is also a commendable suggestion, but we are more concerned with what the conditions of work produce as a health hazard. Of course, hunger is a hazard to health, but then it does not only occur in factories. It can also occur at home orTHE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Ctd.):anywhere else, and provisions against hunger oust he made in every place, whether it is at home, on the road or anywhere else. If you are travelling on the road you should carry food with you so that you do not suffer from hunger. We do not need to make laws about this, hut we encourage every factory owner to provide a place where the workers can feed themselves.An hon. Member made a statement that deafness should he looked into. It is true and it is one of the reasons why we are providing these rules of occupational health. We hope that the Committee on Occupational Health will look into matters of that kind. But, at the same time, we must also be aware that deafness can come from natural deterioration of health of a person himself so that we cannot say that every deaf person in a factory gat his deafness caused by the operations of the factory. But I think itis a legitimate point which the committee on occupational health and safety will include in whatever rules they are making for each factory.These are the things that we have been looking into to ensure that the factories are rendered safe for workers.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Malebe made some very useful .observations and pointed out that in Clause 3, we have printed, the word "or" instead of the word "and"This, of course, will be amended accordingly. As you can see at Clause 2,the last but one line sets the words to be inserted after the word "factories". In fact, the words to be inserted are "and other places of work". So, that is the form it should take. The word "or" appearing in the beginning of the' third line of Section One of Clause' 3 is, obviously, a misprint and will be replaced by the word "and" when we come to it. I am very grateful to hon. Malebe for having discovered that but because' it makes a difference'.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the: same1 hon. Member dis also make: a very legitimate point about blow-buts and connected that to cylinder's. Blow-outs are very difficult to control, especially when it come to mining industry. As you may have read several times, in the! North Sea blow-outs have blown away various equipment used for mining oil. However, I am sure that, with our rules and with inspectors who are qualified for things like that, we  will make every effort to make sure that blow-outs can be prevented, controlled' or foreseen in areas where drilling takes place below ground. When you are drilling for something underground, you cannot tell whether it will blow out or it will come1 out in a trickle. So, you can take all the! Precaution, but you cannot take adequate precaution for all situations; that would be almost impossible?, but we will' make all" endeavours to protect people who drill for oil or gas. W6i will; take all precaution to contain possible blow-outs that can- hurt them. However, as it is, that contribution was worthwhile' and I appreciate! it very much .Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, a lot be reference was made to the Workmen’s Compensation Act requiring amendment to bring it in line with what we are doing now. Hon. Members should remember that it was only in: 1987 that we' amended the Workmen’s Compensation Act, bringing it up from the figures that we're provided in the colonial time to figures that are reasonable and realistic today. It is quite possibly most of the; hon. Members who came to this House in 1988 have not seen' those amendments,- but I want to assure them that the? Act has been amended. Hon. Members may be thinking of old figures that Existed, which were 54th of the wages that an injured worker used to received. We have now amended that figure to the 60 th of the wages that a worker was receiving. So, that was quite a big increase. We did that in 1987, but if the' situation dictates that we' increase the figures, we are ready to take the necessary action. As it is now, indications are' that that action is not called for now. In any case, that is the Workmen’s Compensation Act and not the Factories Act. Of course, I do' agree that the Factories Act, which deals with occupational safety, does intermingle with a part of the workmen’s compensation Act. Compensation is controlled by a different Act, and as be now we should concentrate on the Factories Act which requires us to look after the safety of the factory worker.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WASIKE—NDOMBI: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Minister in order to rule out that there will be no need to revise the Workmen's Compensation Act when in actual fact it is contained in the Presidential Address that it is one of the things that will have to be brought before this House?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,. Sir, in this Act we are not revising the Workmen's Compensation Act and we' are thus not taking it into account at present. But when it comes before this House in its own time we will definitely revise it. But we cannot do that here at the moment. We can only tackle them in a sequence. If the hon. Member believes that we can do them concurrently, I have to inform him to the contrary. So when the time comes for the Workmen's Compensation Act to be revised, we will do so. But presently, to repeat, we are dealing with the Factories (Amendment) Bill.>These are the various things that-we have had to .handle and I would, like to say that the Fund proposed in section 70 (a) will help the factories inspectorate to employ skilled people like scientists,, engineers and such professional people who will inspect the factories and prevent occurrences that need prevention. These are the various .Things that we are proposing to do and when time comes to amend the   related Act we shall certainly do so. But we should rest assured that when the: Fund is established it will enable the factories inspectorate to do research in factories. For instance  if a factory comes from Japan with Japanese conditions it may not necessarily suit, our conditions which means that we may have' to change some of its specifications to fit into our conditions. This can only, be done by a research unit which can only be' provided for by the factories themselves using the funds to enable the research to be carried out. For this research to be successful we need qualified people. This means that we are not going to have very qualified personnel to look into this kind of thing. This is why. The is of such importance to the wholeTHE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (ctd.):amendment.

WAMBUA asked the Minister for Health in view of the fact that patients are now- paying the recently introduced hospital charges in all the Government hospitals and health centres, what measures he is taking to- ensure that prescribed drugs for use by the patients are readily available in the-hospitals instead' of referring, them to private  chemists.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER. FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur ) Mr. Speaker Sir,  I beg to reply.	I would like to assure the hon. Member, that prescribed Drugsare available, in Government, hospitals, health centres  and  dispensaries. Essential drugs are packed and distributed, in sealed labelled cartons for each, and ever hospital,, health- centre and  dispensary in. the country Currently, there are enough drug supplies to last for six-months and arrangements have already been made for continuous supply of drugs from successful tenderers. The Ministry has given specific instructions that no patient should be referred to a private chemist as enough drugs are available in Government hospitals, health centres and dispensaries.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sorry but the Assistant Minister has not replied to my original Question. In my Question I have stated that patients go to	hospitals "and after paying therequired charges they are later on referred to private chemists for drugs. I have seen many patients who have been issued with such prescriptions. Could this cost-sharing arrangement be reversed so that the patients pay the charges only when there are drugs in the hospitals? This is because normally there are no drugs in the hospitals.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, one needs to .fall sick to understand how we operate. We would not know before a patient visits our hospitals what he is suffering from. So we cannot know before hand the drugs that he would need before he is examined and diagnosed and a drug prescribed for him. So the patient has first to be examined by a doctor after which he will be given a prescription. It is from this prescription that we would be able to identify the type of drug that the patient needs. But as I have already said, drugs are available in our hospitals.<\NEWSPEECH>	.<NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister has been asked a specific question which is that when patients go to hospital and they are given a prescription. to collect drugs from the hospital pharmacy, they do not get the drugs and they are thus - forced to buy these drugs from private chemists. That is the question and it requires a specific answer we do a not need a story from him.<\NEWSPEECH>	<NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, Dr. WAMEYO is a doctor by profession and has once been an Assistant Minister in the Ministry of Health! Dr. WAMEYO therefore knows that we cannot start from the opposite direction when treating patients! It is true that one gets a prescription after he has been examined by a doctor. It is only after examination that a doctor can tell the patient the type of disease he is suffering from. After that diagnosis and after being given the prescription, the patientMR. OGUR (ctd.):has to walk  to the hospital pharmacy for his drugs. As I have already said, all drugs are available in our hospitals. On the other hand if a patient fails to get a certain drug we can always prescribe for him an alternative drug.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. LEWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, instead of the Assistant Minister generalising and saying that the patients have to be diagnosed first before the doctors can know the type of drugs they need, could he tell us specifically what arrangements they have for drugs that have to be available to meet specific cases that occur once in a while like malania and meningitis? This is because these are the drugs that we need because we know that these diseases occur seasonally. As of know there is a shortage of chloramphenicol injection in the country for the treatment of meningitis. Could the Assistant Minister tell whether these specific drugs are available for the patients or not?<\NEWSPEECH>			<NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the drugs are available.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BOY: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for the Assistant Minister to try to dodge the question? In the supplementary question raised by hon. Lewa the Assistant Minister was asked, to tell the House whether-chloramphenicol injection is available in hospitals but instead of replying to that specific question he just says that drugs are available. Is it in order for him to try to buy time so-that you, Mr.. Speaker, Sir, can go to the next Question while he sits back happily?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I am standing here addressing the House, there is no attack of meningitis in any part of this country where we have failed to go because £ of lack of drugs. There has not been any such incident.<\NEWSPEECH>	<NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, a patient called Protus Hacmba went to Bungoma District Hospital on 26th January 1990 DR. WAMEYO (ctd.):and the doctor prescribed for him a drug called tofranile ?25 milligrams, three times a day for four weeks/but up to date he has not received these drugs from the hospital  which has  forced him to resort to s seeking help from me to buy him the drugs.   Could the Assistant Minister tell me whether this drug is available in the hospitals?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the patient had seen Dr. Wameyo to get the money, then it is another matter all together. This is because I know  of some patients who are given prescriptions by doctors and who would  not walk straight to get the medicine from the hospital pharmacy but prefer to go round to look, for their Members." of Parliament to tell them the drug is not available so that they can be given money.<\NEWSPEECH>	<NEWSPEECH>MR. EKIDOR: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to evade the question he was asked? He was asked to say specifically whether the drug is available in the country or it is out of stock. Can he answer that question?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have the drug that treats menengitis and it is available in Government hospitals.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. LEWA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am a pharmacist by profession and I am very well informed about the availability of some of these drugs. As of now, patients are coming all the way from Machakos, Kiambu, and Murang’a and so on to the Nairobi Hospital looking for chloramphenicol injection for the treatment of menengitis. I do not believe in hearsay and that is why I am stating facts. If the Assistant Minister does not know what he is talking about, can he do some research and tell this House later exactly how muchchloramphenicol injecting drug, is available in. this country for the treatment of meningitis?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is-no one particular drug for the treatment of menengitis because it is- not one type. The drug -that was referred by Mr. Lewa, is just one of those that we have available.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. LEWA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. If the Assistant Minister says that the drug I referred to is not the only one responsible for the treatment of menengitis, are the other drugs available? For example, is Penicillin G available?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said that we have many types of drugs for the cure of menengitis. The drug referred to is just one of those that we have. Even though we may be short of one type, we still have a good stock to look after our people.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BOY: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. This issue is of national importance and should not be played around with as is- the case now. hon. Wameyo has shown us a prescription detailing the drug that a patient could not get in a Government hospital and hon. Lewa who is a pharmacist has mentioned a specific number of drugs for the treatment of menengitis which are not available in the country. Now, the Assistant Minister, without doing further research is just taking the louse and whole country for a ride. If the Assistant Minister does not have proper information, can he go back and do research so that he can respond to this issue later on?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am saying what I know.  For example, when a prescription is given for a particular type of drug, we always give an alternative drug. If the drug hon. Wameyo mentioned was missing in Bungoma District Hospital on that day, he could have been given an alternative drug for the- treatment of menengitis and & we have several of them.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BULYAAR: Mr. Speaker. Sir, can the Assistant. Minister tell this house the drugs that are available in the country for the treatment of menengitis.<\NEWSPEECH>	<NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the louse wants that information, I will bring a list of all the drugs that treat menengitis tomorrow.<\NEWSPEECH> MR.

One category ‘B’, three category 'E' and four - category ‘F’ staff houses were constructed in March 1979 at a cost of kshs.1.74anll2.

MOBAMED: Mr. Speaker, Sir, since it is the prime objective of our Government to meet the health needs of the nation, why did the Ministry neglect to expand this hospital to the required standards?

Shame1 Shame 1.<NEWSPEECH>DR. B.A. GODAHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think hon. Members should  be a little bit more careful before shouting 'shame' because the statements made by the Questioner may not be entirely accurateI would like to correct the allegation that the Ministry has neglected the people of Wajir District. In fact, at the time of Independence and thereafter, Wajir District had the best hospital facilities and it was a referral hospital for Marsabit, Mandera and Isiolo. As I said, the Government has slowly expanded health care programmes within Wajir District. In the provision of health centres, dispensaries and so on. Some of these districts are so large that apart from providing intensive medical facilities in one place, one has also to take into account the question of distribution of those facilities. Whereas that particular hospital has not yet been expanded, the people of Wajir have had three health, centres<\NEWSPEECH>		- <NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The hon.

The Assistant Minister should tell us whether there is only one bed which is used by delivering mothers and also by all the mothers who are admitted in the maternity ward.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR.

Have been taking those of us in the Back bench for a ride, especially when they are answering Questions. They have a tendency of sometimes giving very misleading answers.  For example, the hon. Member has pat it to the Assistant Minister that there is only one bed in the maternity wing of Wajir District Hospital, but. The Assistant Minister has said he cannot answer that supplementary question because it is irrelevant. The Ministers keep evading questions with the hope that the Chair-will call the next Question before they have answered the one on hand sufficiently. Can we have the ruling of the "Chair as to whether it feels that we are always given satisfactory answers?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR SPEAKER: Well, up to this minute I am convinced that you are receiving very good answers.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. I.A- MOHAMED: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Assistant Minister is "denying that patients in Wajir Hospital are living with wild animals, but I am saying dead bodies are eaten by cats, hyenas and dogs. In fact, over 10,000 marauding vultures can be found in that hospital and the hospital is stinking because the waste spread around by those vultures and lives of patients are  threatened by the existence of giraffes in that hospital.	<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: What is your supplementary question, Mr. Mohamed?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. I.A. MOHAMED: Can the Ministry fence off the hospital to protect the lives of the patients?<NEWSPEECH>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I insist that patients in Wajir District Hospital are not living wild animals. I think it is common sense that	there cannot possibly he over 10,000 marauding vultures within the small area occupied by that hospital as the hon. Member is claiming - this is not imaginable. Earlier on.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. I.A. MOHAMED: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as far as I know the in-patient using and the catering faciliteral Wajir District Hospital are unfit for human occupation. There is even an open place where dead bodies are eaten by cats and hynas.  It is also true that there is only one maternity bed which is sometimes shared by two mothers. Since this is a very pathetic situation as conditions in that hospital are unhygienic, what immediate action is the Assistant Minister taking to improve conditions in this hospital?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, although I do not accept that the hospital is not fit for human occupation, I was actually about to tell the  hon. Member the action the Ministry is taking to provide even, better, medical care to the  people of Wajir District. I had begun to say that, in fact, now we have a plan of constructing a virtually new district hospital with 172 beds for Wajir District with an X-ray unit, intensive care unit, laboratory, pharmacy, theatre and so on. I am sure that, when that hospital is completed the people of Wajir District, considering their population per capita, will be among the best served in this. Country as far as medical facilities are concerned<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. FALANA:  Mir. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for his theoretical ideas, right now the situation is bad, because I have witnessed that human beings in Wajir- District - Hospital live with wild animal, which is a very serious matter Therefore, while awaiting the construction of the new hospital that the Assistant Minister is talking about, what immediate plans does   he have to at least protect the weak human beings from wild life?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, with all due respect to my hon. colleague, it cannot be true that the patients in Wajir District Hospital are living with wild animals.DR. B.A. GODANA (CTD):I had wanted to interrupt hon. Boy when he was on a point of order because I also think that we need some guidance from the Chair. From time to time the Back-benchers tell us that our answers are lies. I think hon. Members should learn to say that answers are not correct, because I think that is more diplomatic and Parliamentary.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. kILIKU: On a point order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister should note that we come here to talk, seriously about the welfare of our people. He should, therefore, address himself to the current problems in that hospital by accepting to accompany the hon. Questioner to that hospital in order to confirm whether there are problems or not and then come back and report his findings to this House. We are not going to tolerate the attitude where Ministers fail to take issues like dead bodies being eaten by wild animals seriously.  The Assistant Minister should address himself not only to the expansion of that suit al but the current problem affecting the hospital. Fortunately, or unfortunately, the Assistant Minister comes from North-Eastern Province and should, therefore, be more concerned about the problems in that hospital than anybody.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTAST-MINISTER FOR PUBLIC W0RKS (Mr. Maiyani): On a point order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  It is obvious that fiction has been introduced in this House. If wild animals were going to Wajir District Hospital and eating patients, they must first of all have eaten the doctors and nurses. Therefore, if there is truth in the claim, this is not a matter for Ministry of Health to deal with; it is matter that should have been reported to those concerned with security matters. But I think this is fiction.<\NEWSPEECH>Question No. 42<HEADER>Delay in Paying Gratuity of the Late Katana<\HEADER><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU asked the Minister for Transport and Communications what has delayed the payment of death gratuity to the family of the late Mr. Joshua J. Katana, P/No. 3203, formerly working with the Provincial Engineer, Coast, and who died in July, 1984.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Dr. P.K. Momanyi):- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not have the answer. to this Question, but my colleague, who is the House now, has the answer and he can go ahead and apologise.<\NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI:  On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Another Assistant Minister is ready to reply to this Question. If this Assistant Minister does not have the answer, why does he stop the other Assistant Minister from replying to the Question? Could we get the reply from the Assistant Minister who has it?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MRS. NDETEI:  Are they confused?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Mutwol): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.<\NEWSPEECH>	<NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I would have thought that these, two. Assistant Ministers, who come from the Ministry, would have consulted each other in advance- There seems to be a conflict between them, and we are at a loss.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: I am satisfied that they had consulted each other, and that is why the Question is now being replied to.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Mutwol): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Mr. Joshua J.Katana, P/No. 3203, worked as Mechanic Grade III with this Ministry. However, at the time of his death, he had not been confirmed, and action has now been taken to confirm him post—humously in order for death gratuity to be paid to the family of the late Mr. Joshua J. Katana.It is, however, regretted that, as a result of this oversight, the payment of death gratuity to his family has been delayed, but action is also being taken against the officer responsible for this delay.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I appreciate the Assistant Minister's reply, I would wish him to tell this House how come that the Ministry did not know that this man, who had been working as Mechanic Grade III and died in 1984, had not been confirmed until now that I have asked this Question. Why was this so?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUTWOL: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said earlier, action has been taken against the officer who did not confirm the late Mr. Katana. In any case, the hon. Member concerned did not ask the Question all those years.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I became a Member of Parliament only a year ago and, apparently, this Question came up when I had not joined Parliament. However, the Assistant Minister has either been misled or is misleading the House, because this person, who had been working with the Ministry, died in 1984 and it is only now that action is being taken against the officer responsible for this delay. Is the Assistant Minister satisfied that this is proper?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUTWOL: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the late Mr. Joshua J. Katana started working as subordinate staff of the Ministry on 14th January, 1959, and his terms were translated to professional service in 1981. .Then, he died in 1984, at the age of 35 years. There as an oversight on the part of a certain officer against whom I have said action has already been taken. We regret. The delay involved, but the truth is that action has been taken against the officer in question.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.MWAMZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister-tell this House what the oversight in question was, what was not done and what action the Ministry is taking against the person who did not do what had to be done?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUTWOL: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the oversight which the hon. Member is questioning was that our inquiry has shown that the relevant file had been missing. This file was in somebody's office, this being the officer against whom action has been taken for having kept the file for too long. Otherwise, there was nothing else against him.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BOY: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister has not answered hon. Mwamzandi. He asked what the oversight inquestion was. The Assistant Minister is telling us about the loss of a file, and I wonder whether the loss of a file is an oversight that can stop one's family from being paid its dues. He should tell us whether the oversight was lack of confirmation or something else. That was hon. Mwamzandi‘s question.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUTWOL: Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course, you cannot confirm somebody without having his personal file. The missing of that file was the oversight under review.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MRS. NDETEI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the Assistant Minister in order to address the hon. Member direct rather than through the Chair?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUTWOL: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Lady should have said that I only looked at the hon. Member direct, and not that I addressed him because I did not do so.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if there was no notification to the Ministry of the death of Mr.. Katana, it means that his salary continued to be sent to his office. We would be entitled to know who was receiving- this salary.<\NEWSPEECH>	<NEWSPEECH>MR. MUTWOL: Mr. Speaker, Sir; no salary was paid to Mr. Katana after his death, because nobody gets a salary after-his death.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has said that Mr. Katana's file was  lying in one particular office, which means that there was no notification to the Ministry that Mr.. Katana had died until hon.. Bidu raised this Question. That was when the Ministry came to understand that Mr. Joshua J- Katana had died. Where was his salary being sent to before then?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUTWOL: Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course, the Ministry was aware that Mr. Joshua J. Katana had died; what we were not aware of is whether he had been confirmed before his death or not. This is why we are trying to assist the family of the late Mr: Katana as much as possible. A letter has been written to the Directorate of Personnel Management to grant the relevant authority for action. The letter is reference No. 3203/81, and it asks for the authority of -the Directorate of Personnel Management as per the Civil Service Code of RegulationsSince this letter has already been written, we expect. to get the relevant authority as soon as possible so that we may pay death gratuity to the family of the late Mr. Joshua J. Katan<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr. Sneaker, .Sir, now the Assistant Minister has come back to the right track. Due to the. Delayed payments of death gratuity of the deceased person, his family is now suffering, in fact they do not have clothes to wear. The Assistant- Minister has told this House that the family of the deceased shall be paid as soon as possible. when exactly will they be paid so that they can also be happy like other people Can he give us a specific date.<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUTWOL: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as soon as we get authority from the Directorate of Personnel Management to pay death gratuity to the family of the late Mr. Katana.<\NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Next Ouestion, Mr. Makhanu.Question NO .61Arbitration Over- Land Parcel No. 436	<NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKHANU asked the Attorney-General what action. He has taken to resolve-the issues raised in Question No. 90 of 1989- involvinga dispute between Jothan wamba- Ludebe and John Willy Kisaka Baraza over land parcel No. 436 — Kamukuywa Scheme, Bungoma District is one that goes as far back as 1972,  and has been a subject to Nairobi high Court Civil Suit No. 26 of 1978. As I had informed this hon. House on 4th May, both parties represented by advocates, filled their joint letter Ref. CL 505, dated 15th july, 1988. That letter was duly signed asking the court to refer the case to the District <\NEWSPEECH><HEADER>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Ctd.)<\HEADER>Commissioner,  Bungoma, for arbitration. An order was thus duly entered in the terms of that letter on 18th September, 1988. On 8th December, 1988, an advocate by the name of Palumaks who appeared for Mr. Ludebe, confirmed to the High Court Nairobi that the District Commissioner, 3ungoma was served with that Court Order.Sir, the latest information that I have on that matter is that the two parties were summoned to appear before a panel, of elders for arbitration which was due to take place on 3rd April, 1990, which was yesterday. The dispute	will thus be before the District Officer for Tondaren Division in Bungoma District. I would like to add here that the parties have not been very co-operative. All that the administration can do. is to follow the normal known procedures. Both parties agreed that the dispute should be sent to the District Commissioner, Bungoma and the Court Order was passed and sent there, but the parties did not avail themselves to the District Commissioner, Bungoma in order to have the dispute solved. Therefore, the delay was caused by the concerned parties themselves. I cannot see how the District Commissioner, Bungoma, could have finalised the dispute if the parties did not co-operate. I hope to get some information. as to what happened yesterday. If I get any further information, I will be quite happy to pass it over to hon. Makhanu, but I would advise him to plead with both parties to co-operate with, the administration so that the dispute can be finalised.<NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKHANU: I would like to thank the hon. Attorney-General for that reply. As he has already mentioned, this matter came before this august House in May last year, but it won only after I had?MR. MAKHANU (ctd.):raised Question No.61 that action appears to have been taken. Would the Attorney-General inform this House what has really delayed the finalisation of that case, The Attorney-General himself had promised this House in May last year that the matter would be referred to the District Commissioner, Bungoma. Would he also confirm that this is a case where justice has been deased because there has been a lot of delay?<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MULI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not agree with hoi-. hon. Makhanu‘s last comment. The misadministration of justice has been caused by the concerned parties themselves, If they did avail themselves to the District Commissioner, Bungoma, who was ready to arbitrate, in which other way can I assist them? I think that one of the persons, X think Mr. Baraza is a very unco-operative person. I would liketo suggest that the hon. Member should try and persuade his: constituent toaavail himself to the District Commissioner, Bungoma, and all steps will be taken. So that the matter can be finalised.<\NEWSPEECH>	MR. MAKHANU: -Sir, I am- representing the case of Mr. Jatham Pwamba Ludebe.  Sir, Mr. Ludebe has not been unco-operative I have visited the Attorney-Generals office pursuance of pursuance of   the same cause an also written, a letter to the Attorney— General and handed it over to Mr. Ludebe so that he can pursue that matter. If the other party has been unco-operative, would the Attorney-General tell us whether there have been any ignored both parties? As far as I know, the D.C. Bungoms which have been ignored by both parties? As far as I know, the D.C. Bungoma has never summoned those two parties at all, unless there is some latest information from his office<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MULI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the parties themselves Are the proper people in the should appear before the D.C. Bungoma. They should request the D.C., Bungoma, to give them a date on which he can arbitrate. The Attorney-General is not a party to that suit. That is a civil dispute involving  land ownership. It is not a criminal matter, for which I have issue summons to witnesses.<\NEWSPEECH>Those two parties should be interested in the finalisation of that long standing dispute. The court is still waiting to enter final judgement as soon as both parties have their dispute arbitrated by the D.C. Bungoma. I can only plead with hon. Makhanu to tell his constituent to go to the D.C. and request that the other party in be summoned.As I have already stated, this matter may have been dealt with yesterday, and I will check as to whether both parties appeared before the district officer who was given the duty of arbitrating on that dispute.	MR. SPEAKER: Can we go back to Mr. Mwenje’s Question? Question No.86 Electricity for Aerodromes Staff Houses <NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER.: Mr. Mwenje not here? We will defer his Question. Can we- now move to Questions by Private Notice. <HEADER>QUESTION BY PRIVATE. NOTICE<HEADER>	Retrieval of Funds for Mochenwa Eberege Traders <NEWSPEECH>MR. P.K. MOMANYI:Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the following Question by Private Notice.In view of the fact that Mochenwa Eberege Farmers Traders Limited, of P.O. Box 48, Keroka, had deposited an amount of Kshs.219,000/- with M/S Growth International Limited (in liquidation Winding Cause No.7 of 1976),  what urgent steps has the Attorney- General taken to assist those people get their money back?<\NEWSPEECH>? <NEWSPEECH>THE ATT0RNEY-GENERALL (Mr.Muli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. On the 5.11.76, the High Court of Kenya at Nairobi made a Winding-up Order against Property Growth International Limited and by the said order, the official receiver of the Republic of Kenya was appointed the provisional liquidator of the company.Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently, it may not be possible for me to assist Eberege Farmers Traders Ltd. get back the money they claim they deposited with the company because it is not possible to ascertain the assets of the company and the extent of its liabilities as a statement of affairs indicating these among other items as required by the section 232 of the Companies Act, has not been submitted. Moreover, the official receiver has only a SUM of K.Sh.51,684/70 standing to the credit of the company and these funds would not be adequate to pay out the required sumo If any dividend isto be declared and paid, the official receiver shall give a notice in the Kenya Gazette of his intention to do so two months before the declaration of the dividend. This would enable the parties who have proved their debts with the company, to have their claims paid.<\NEWSPEECH>	MR. MOMANYI:	Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Eberege Fanners Traders Limited, comprises of about 150 farmers who started collecting money between 1973 and. 1974. Would the Attorney-General tell this House whether there are  other creditors who are owed money Property Growth International Limited, apart from  this group of farmers, and if there are, could, he give us a/List of the creditors<\NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MULI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we can do, is to ask the directors of this company to file in what we call, "Statement of Affairs", and as soon as this is done, we will know the liabilities of this company and the creditors as well. After this, the sun that is standing to the credit of the company, will be paid to those creditors who have proved their debt with the company.<\NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Next Order please!<HEADER>MOTION<\HEADER><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the following Motion:-MR. KILIKU (Ctd ):That, following recent increases in prices of most essential commodities and the decontrol of prices of others, it is evident that the purchasing power of all workers has been tremendously reduced; this House therefore, urges the Government to effect compensatory measures by scrapping the   current wage guidelines and increase with immediate effect, salaries and wages for all categories of public and private sector employees.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have decided to bring this Motion to the House due to the current economic factors which now affect workers who are earning fixed income. One of the economic factors affecting the workers is the devaluation of the Kenya shilling which has been devalued by 46 per cent since 1984. This has greatly affected the purchasing power of our people. The other economic factor affecting our people is the decontrolling of prices of essential commodities, something which has made businessmen to charge exorbitant prices. As a result, our people who are earning fixed salaries cannot afford even two meals a day. The other economic factor seriously affecting our people is the introduction of the cost-sharing system in our hospitals. Today, Sir, everybody attending public hospital is required to pay for treatment whether he is earning a salary or not. The other big economic factor affecting wananchi is the' introduction of the Value. Added A Tax and. the Services Charge which again are greatly affecting the salaries of the poor workers.Mr. Speaker left the ChairThe Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Tuva) took the Chair Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, when the Minister for Labour was.introducing the Factories (Amendment) Bill last week, he said, that he likes the workers in this country very much. Therefore, by accepting this Motion, he is going to confirm that statement to this House and to the nation as a whole. Today, people earning salaries. Cannot even afford to buy lunch. If you went to the streets of Nairobi during lunch hour, you would find workers opting to listen to the word of God, not because they like it, but just because they have nowhere to go. Some of these people may not. Even afford a decent breakfast and it is Unfortunate that they have to go without lunch. We know that there areMR KILIKU (Ctdo ):certain economic factors which are beyond the control of the Government, for example, the increase in the price of oil, hut it is important to appreciate the fact that workers in this country, have for a long time been affected by continuous inflation. Therefore, it is high time the Minister for Labour announced salary increases to compensate the workers in this country, As we all know, every public policy is aimed at improving the welfare of the people in the country. Therefore, by increasing salaries, Government would be improving the welfare of the people. However, it is unfortunate to note that as we discuss this Motion here today, Government has already withdrawn the medical vote for outpatient for the civil servants. At the same time, Government has withdrawn hardship allowance which used to be paid to the civil servants working in the most remote parts of Kenya. This is now causing a lot of problems to the workers and something ought really to be done. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the wage guidelines that I have mentioned in the Motion, are contrary to what we expect private companies inthe country to do about the plight of workers. This is what the wage guidelines say:-"The court should endeavour, to prevent salary increases in one industry which could lead to such as increases in other industries which cannot: afford such increases salaries”These. Wage guidelines axe cautioning the. industries not to increase salaries, of workers, and therefore, they should be scrapped entirely. The guidelines go further to say that if workers’ salaries are increased at all, this should-be. Under the domestic inflation rate which sane times is of a double-digit nature. By this I mean to say that the rate is always, above 10 per cent or 11 per cent. It was in 1982 when the domestic inflation rate was 22 per cent, although, in 1988 it came down to 11 per cent. However, this rate is still too high and therefore, if these wage guidelines continue to say that the salary increases should be below the domestic inflation rate, this means that the increase will not be felt at all.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, following the decontrol of prices, the victims of the so called structural adjustment programmes, are those workerswho are earning fixed salaries. You will find that these people cannot even afford to buy a loaf of  bread and I do not know what the Minister intends to do to compensate these people. This is affecting not only those working in the public sector, but also those working in the private sector. There are people in this country who used to be earning big salaries, but these salaries can no longer be regarded as big salaries.MS. KILIKU (.Ctd) ;Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it, is.high time the Minister for Labour came out with positive announcements regarding the welfare of workers in this country. He should show concern for the workers because the workers are the backbone of the economy of this country. Kenya is a developing country which cannot do without workers. We rely heavily on the labour-intensive system. We must make our workers more productive and we can only do this through increasing their salaries.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I speak now workers in this country are complaining about a host of forces which are working against their salaries. Parents have to buy textbooks for their children and so on. We have free primary education in this country but there are certain forces that are working against that policy of providing free primary education to our children. The price of textbooks is really going against this policy. Parents are also being called upon to build classrooms, workshops and so on. The prices of essential commodities have been increasing but the salaries have remained, stagnant. So, I do not know how you expect the people to be productive. How do you expect the morale of the workers to go up if the salaries are-so low? You will also find that many people do not travel to their rural homes because bus fares have been hiked. There are so many forces that are working against the salaries paid to workers in this country today.Mr Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, last year the Minister for Labour talked about looking for ways and means of compensating the workers. I think time has come when wokers should be adequately compensated. When I talk about compensation here I do not mean a 10 per cent salary increase; I mean compensation as per the inflation rate in the country. When you compensate workers, they become more productive.?MR. KILIKU (CTD);Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it you compensate the workers, you should not expect any strikes, or industrial unrest. When you compensate workers you must expect economic growth to .take place because the economic growth of a country depends on the productivity of the workers in that country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is unfortunate that the prices of raw materials on the international markets have been fluctuating. But people are suffering and the Ministry should establish a permanent committee to investigate the problems of the workers particularly when prices of essential commodities are increased.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the current Wage Guidelines are very much against what I am saying here. This is because they if you want to increase the salaries of the workers of any parastatal body, these increases must be approved by the Minister. But I am not talking about the public or the private sectors; I am talking about all the workers in the country. They should be all compensated because the increase in the prices of essential commodities have affected everybody. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the cost-sharing, policy has also affected workers in this country. I support, this policy but I do not think. it should be implemented in some sectors I think it is high time that the cost-sharing policy-was withdrawn, particularly with regard to medical services. This is because those people who earn no salaries at all cannot get medical treatment at the hospitals because they cannot afford to pay a fee of KShs.20/-. When they go to hospitals they are turned away because they cannot afford that fee of KShs.20.00. The Ministry of Health should halt the implementation of this policy in hospitals so that we can ensure that our people are healthy. If the Government does not withdraw the?MR.KILIKU (ctd);cost-sharing policy from hospitals, then our people will not only he poor in wealth hut also poor in health.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRSAND NATIONAL HERITAGE (Mr. Lalampaa) : On a point of order, Mr.' Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir." The hon. Member made a categorical statement to the effect that poor- and unemployed people. who go to Government hospitals are turned away because they do not have KShs.20.007 Can he substantiate that allegation? It is  serious allegation.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Mr."Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, you will find that even in hon." Lalampaa's constituency there are some people who are very poor." Before the introduction of cost-sharing in Government hospitals, the Coast General Hospital used to receive 2,000 out-patients every day." But you will now find that the attendance has dropped to 1,00U patients per day." When I conducted a personal survey, I discovered that the other 1,000 people who do not attend the Hospital are poor peopled That is my substantiation and I am calling upon the Government.</NEWSPEECH>	<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL - HERITAGE (Mr.' Lalampaa) : - On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.- The reduction of the daily attendance to that" Hospital, is completely- different from turning a patient- away from a Government hospital.'.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR."

Kiliku was categorical;1 He should tell this House the names of those people who have been turned away from Government hospitals simply because they cannot pay KShs. 20.00."</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do sympathise with the Assistant Minister because he is behind news. On 26.3.90 the Director of Medical Services said that there will be a Ministerial Committee to find ways and means of making the poor people gain access to Government hospitals-. The. Assistant Minister does not read newspapers." I was basing my-remarks on what the Director of Medical Services said.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS AITD NATIONAL HERITAGE (Mr. Lalampaa) : On a point of order, Mr.' Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir." The hon." Member cannot twist his words." I know that it is Government policy to assist those who cannot afford to pay KShs.20.00.

KIPKORIR: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me "the opportunity to second this Motion.As you are aware  it is the policy of this country and also of Kenyans to be mindful of other people’s welfare. From experience we have seen several people tarmacking along the streets trying to look for employment which they cannot find. It is high time that the Government looked into the welfare of all Kenyans. The Government should take care of Kenyans and see to it that there is progress and respect among the wananchi. Several times our President has been preaching the call to be mindful of other people's welfare, and it is high time the Government and those in. authority looked into the problem of our  people. Experience has just shown that the value of the Kenya Shilling has gone- down and the price of " most essential' commodities has gone up very high such that wananchi are not: able to keep up with the standard of living today. Therefore, it-is necessary for ? the Government to, set up a committee to look into these problems so that the- workers of this country are taken care of.As somebody has mentioned, we agreed, that we must have the coat-sharing everywhere because it has become very difficult for the Government to maintain, everybody. However, the purpose of this Motion is to advise the Government to increase the salaries of all workers so that they are able to pay for their expenses especially in housing and so on. The rents have gone up as is the car expenses for other essential commodities. If you look at an ordinary family, you will find that they have three or four children in secondary school whom they are paying school, fees' for. So, it is necessary that we should increase the salaries  of all workers in the country because we are protecting the democracy and we are also maintaining peace, love and unity which have become the symbol of this nation. We need to look into those areas so that the welfare of our people is take care of.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in some areas you will. find that people are making a lot of effort in as .far as development matters are concerned, but this is a big problem without money. For instance, there is a lot of work in the area of co-operative development and so on. We also need manpower in the production side. We need to produce a lot for export in order to earn enough foreign currency for this country. There is good market for our tea, coffee and all other products from this country. So, we need to advise our people accordingly. The producing industries should also be improved.We have said several times here, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, that those people who fail industries should he sacked and dismissed immediately. They must he disciplined because they ought to show a good example to others. When we come up with a  Motion like this one on increase salaries,, it should be supported.- by hon Members. We should .be able to handle our national economy because without production we shall not be able to realise this money that' we are looking for. So, I would like to appeal to everyone and, the country at large, to become productive wherever one is If you are in a Ministry or private sector, you should see to it that there is production there so that we can export some of our products and earn the much-needed foreign exchange. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,. I just felt that we should move this Motion so that we can have a committee set up to look into the problem of workers in the country. For example, in. My area of Kerio Valley, some teachers travel over 200 kilometres to became the rural areas where there are no matatus or other means of transport  to called their, salaries and Sometime find it is not there. For instance, some peole earn as a little – as KSh.150/- per month in the Ministry of Culture and Social Services. This money is not-useful at all. Also, this honoraria of KSh.150/- which is paid to somebody by the Ministry of Culture and Social Services is not a salary at all. A number of Adult Education Teacher in my area travel, distances of more than 150 kilometres away from the Headquarters. By the end of the month they travel all the way from the rural areas to come and get their salaries from the district Headquarters. Sometimes, when they get there, they are told there is no money while have already spent KSh.200/- to go and collect the KSh.150/—!  I think it is time the Government and the people in charge of various projects were concerned and helped His Excellency the President. He said several times that we should "be mindful of other people’s welfare. Let us discipline ourselves especially those who are heading Ministries, Departments and 30 oh. We would like there to be good conduct among our people and the Government so that we can have progress. We shall continue talking on behalf of those people who do not understand anything, because even in the Bible Jesus said, "There are some people who see things but do not understand".Let us all see and understand. The time has cane for everyone of us to contribute positively to the development of this country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I must congratulate His Excellency the President for the , creation of the Ministry of Reclamation and Development of Arid, Semi-Arid and Wastelands in this country- If well looked after, that Ministry- can ensure adequate production of raw materials in areas of its jurisdiction. Those responsible should execute all Government policies to ensure increased development of this country. We must set an example, for other countries within this region I am sure, therefore, that all of us will support-this Motion because it is in the interest of our people.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I know that money has become a problem both in the urban and rural- areas.. I am told that. some people- say-that even if you increase money it can never be enough, but I..think it is always good to improve" situations as . they arise. There should be salary and wages-, increases that should take-care of our people. We-should not live in frustrating situations when we ' - are actually supposed to be a developing democracy. .I will continue speaking on this matter. Even in any own constituency, I have, always told the people to come forward and work hard, because. I can foresee greater-problems in, say, five years to come.With those few remarks, I. second the Motion.</NEWSPEECH>(Question proposed)<NEWSPEECH>MR. BOY: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this very important Motion. I want to support the Motion and give. reasons as to why I do so.In the Motion itself, there is a part that says, "scrapping the current wage guidelines and increasing with immediate effect salaries and wages of all categories of public and private sector employees". I have a copy here of the salary guidelines, and I want to quote part of it. The Salary Guide thatwas formulated in 1973, says in Section One:-"So long, as the economy continues to expand, all sectors of the population have, the right to expect some regular improvements in their - standards of living".Another relevant part of the Salaries and Wage Guideline says:-"In order to avoid widening inequality  and frustrating employment creation…."Sir,. I am supporting this part of the Motion that calls for the scrapping of the current Salary and Wage Guideline because most of the document has been outdated. The other relevant part says:-"The main objective of these guidelines was . to ensure that employees working, for wages and salary can acquire a fair share of the national products".Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, are those employees working for wages and salaries today in a position to acquire a fair share of. the national products? Definitely not. with the salary they are earning, and that is. why I. am saying that the.- current salary and wages guidelines should be scrapped.. I. do fully-heartedly support the Motion before the House because the current guidelines have been overtaken by events. Furthermore, the-Salary and Wages Guidelines I am referring to assets: —"Since then",, that is 1975,. "it had become clear that Kenyans economic situation is deteriorating even more rapidly thatn expected, indeed, to such an extent that the growth of real per capita income projected in the Development Plan for 1974/78 may, at least, for the next few years be turned into stationary and even declining levels of real import and produce".It is expected that at the time of formulating the guidelines, things were expected to move from bad to worse, and that is exactly what is happening with the Kenyan worker today. One has to depend on a salary of KShs. 1,000/- or KShs.2,000/- per month, and that worker has to pay for his water,, electricity and transport,, charges for which services have been increasing day after day. How can such a worker survive? I am supporting this Motion, especially where it talks about scrapping the current wage guidelines and increasing salaries and wages with immediate effect. Let us face it. Sometimes we have to speak the truth even when it is painful to do so.Most of our people living in urban areas have to take their children to school,-and we all agree that today school fees for a Form I student in any school is not less by KShs.4,000/- per tern. We are taking an example of a man working as a messenger in one of the Government offices. That messenger - earns a salary but, after deductions, he., finds himself getting a net pay of KShs.400/-,- with which he is expected to send his children to school, where he is. Required to pay KShs.4,000/-. Life has become very difficult and it is. this thing that  is encouraging corruption. Why? Because workers' income cannot, match expenditure. People are involving themselves in corruption in order to supplement their income. Of course, "with a net pay of KShs.400/- per month, you cannot afford to send your children- to school and you cannot even afford to pay rent.Mr...Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.,, talking about, rent, we should note that. today in Nairobi, in an area called Korogocho, rent for a single mud room is KShs.400/— per room. That does not include water and: light, and here you are talking about somebody who is earning a net salary of KShs.400/— per month. We have many of" them earning that, little. Forget, about the messenger and talk of the middle-class worker who earns between KShs.3000/- and 5000/-. Most of those, people have mortgagers to  meet, and those charges are increasing every year and making it very difficult for people to survive. That is why I call" upon, my hon. colleagues to support this Motion. They should support it clearly with an intention of helping the common man.Sir, when talking about this Motion, let us not think that we are talking about the urban worker. Even in the rural areas we have our district offices where you find the district officer. We have all kind of people who live on salaries.MR. Boy(Contd): Usually when we talk of workers earning salaries, we tend to- think of those who work in urban centres and forget that there are factory workers. land, civil servants working in the rural areas. All these people earn and depend on their salaries to meeting their day to day needs. This is the reason why  I am supporting this Motion. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, you are all aware that the Kenya Power and Lighting Company is seeking Government approval to increase its charges. So apart from paying electricity charges a worker has to pay for water. Electricity and water have become essential things in these modern days. To make matters worse^ apart from meeting the costs of water and electricity a worker has to contend with school fees for his children. Is there any Harambee secondary school that charges less than sis.4,000.00 for school fees? If that is the case how do you expect an office messenger-to pay school fees for his children, meet electricity and water- charges? How can such a person live? Although we are alive, we are living. very difficultly.  This is why I am strongly supporting this Motion.If you walk around Nairobi around lunch  time you will see find many workers sitting idle around their offices because they cannot afford to buy even chips for- themselves.. You will', see millions of'. - workers just sitting, outside, their offices waiting for 2.00 .p.m. to go back, to their offices. Even around here,, you. will find, the National Assembly workers sitting outside the offices around-'lunch time.. Why can they not go to the Bunge Staff Canteen for lunch? It. is because they cannot afford to buy lunch. They do not have the money. .Why do they: not have money for lunch? It is because their salaries are too low. That is why you will find them around lunch time sitting around yawning nicely' and just grinning around for the sake of it. That is an example of the many. That is the reason why I am calling upon the hon. Members of this august House to come out and give their full support to this Motion. This is because it is these people who elected, us through the queueing system and it is the sane people we shall need to elect us in two years' time. These people today need us to speak for them.. Since yesterday we needed them to elect us, today they need us to speak for them.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we should soberly look at the Motion and the situation the way it is. We should not take it as a matter between the Back-benchers and the Front-benchers. We should neither look at it as a national issue. No, we should not do that. V.re should look at and address ourselves to it as a national issue. V/e should try to accommodate the. realities. By saying that I am not saying that the salaries should be. increased by a. 100, - 50 or- 10 per cent- No,. I am not saying that.. All I am saying is- that we should look at and. address ourselves to the situation the  way it is. That is what is important. That is the reason, why we are here. It would be very pathetic if we do not do that and we would not deserve being, here. That is why I would; like to , call upon the Front 3ench and the Ministry of Labour to support this Motion. .	 I know that the Ministry is. doing, a good job, but-they would be doing a better job if they supported this Motion. They should try  and pass the Motion the way it is. This is because the. current wage guidelines are outdated and cannot fit within, the expanding., economy of this country.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</NEWSPEECH>MR. WASIKE-NDOMBI: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to contribute to this Motion which has come at the right time. Why do I say that? This is because the history of the wage guidelines is that they-'-were introduced back in. 1973 jointly by the then Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Labour. A year after that, in 1974, and then later in 1975, 1976 and 1977 they were revised. After that they were again revised in 1979. After that they were not revised until 1987 after a. lot of pressure from the workers. Since then they have never been revised again. Since they have not been revised recently, they should be scrapped as stated in the Motion. This is because  since we have whole heartedly accepted decontrol of prices, we should now accept ‘decontrol’ of' the  guidelines. so that an employer, will enumerate his employee according to his capabilities. Such a thing has been stated more than once by the President. He has even said that State statutory boards that make good profits should enumerate their employees according to their- profits. When we talk about the age guidelines being scrapped we are saying that while you allow manufacturers to increase the prices of their goods on a daily, weekly, monthly and yearly basis, we should also allow a. rise in wages any time when a need arises.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, sometime back in this country there used to exist what' was called cost of living allowance which meant that whenever the cost of living went up, the salaries were automatically adjusted. We need this kind of protection so that manufacturers do not have-the chance to raise the prices of their goods without taking into consideration the salaries of the workers. .who produce these goods for them.One would be surprised to learn that in the Civil Service, an employee in Job Group A earns a salary of 725.00. It does not matter where he is stationed, be it Voi, Wajir, Bungoma, Kakamega, Nyeri or Busia. The salary is the same. This same worker working in the National. Assembly or in the Treasury earns a house allowance of shs.240.00. Such an employee earns such a house allowance when  we know very well that landlords are not controlled at all. Thewage guidelines do not apply to the landlords at all. If the wage guidelines have to apply, to the employees then they should also affect the landlords so that they do not increase house rents when they feel like it.</NEWSPEECH>(applause) <NEWSPEECH>MR. KUBO: On a point of order, Mr. 'Temporary Deputy. Speaker, Sir. in order.Is the hon. Member/to say that rents are not controlled and yet there is a rentrrestriction tribunal office where everybody can go and complain?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WASIKE-EDOMBI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the message I was trying to bring foward is that whereas these guidelines as far as workers are concerned. restrict revision of salaries to a minimum period of 24 months, the landlords can revise rents any time they want and a tenant is forced to seek redress in the rent tribunal court.What I am trying to say is that if we have to accept the continuation of guidelines, then they should go further. We would like to be told by the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Manpower Development and Employment how much employment has grown in this country since the introduction of these guidelines apart from natural employment m growth. For example, we would like to be told how much employment has been attained as a result of these./guidelines at the end of 1989.I an saying so, Sir, because whereas workers, restrain- themselves, according to the guidelines, unscrupulous employers make a. lot of profits- which they plough back to their countries of. origin. I have in mind the multi-national companies. We would like these guidelines to be applied to the employers so that they make returns to-show, for example, .the number of people-they employed in a quarter of a year as a. result of these guide lines. We are saying this because this country is plagued with  unemployment. We would, therefore like the manufacturers and private. entrepreneurs to tell the Government what they have done as far employment is concerned, in say, quarterly or half yearly In this way, there will be justification for the Government to continue to modify the guidelines. Otherwise, if we continue to leave employers to make profit and plough them back to their aim countries, ire are being unfair to our own people in restricting the revision of their salaries.?We would like to state to the Minister for Labour that those employers who do not make returns about their employment records, should be subjected to disciplinary measures including imprisonment and closur_e of their businesses.I know of some employers, particularly in the hotel industry, who employ bar maids and pay them as little as Kshs. 150/= or Kshs.200/=per month and assuming that they will be given tips by those who go there to drink. This is a very serious issue .We would also like the Minister for Labour to amend the N.S.S.F. laws so that any employer who employs one or more person, should be subjected to N.S.S.F. deductions. According to the currents requirements of the law, it is only an employer who employs more than five people who is supposed to deduct money from such people and remit  it to N.S.S.F. If a person who  employs four people is exempted by the law to forward. H.S.S.F. contributions, it then;  means that such, employees will not qualify for- retirement benefits and will have nothing to  revert to. I hope that    the Minister will address himself to this issue.	With those few remarks, I beg to-support.</NEWSPEECH>	<NEWSPEECH>MR. BLDU: Asante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipa nafasi. hiiili  niunge roja hii mkono. Roja hii imeletwa wakati unaofaa kwa sababu sisi viongozi tumeambiwa mara kwa mara tufikirie juu ya maslahi ya watu wengine.Wakati tulipojiuyakulia  Uhuru mwaka. wa 1963, Serikali. yetu. ya Kama illiahidikwamba  tutapigana na maadui watatu. Maadui hawa ni umasikini, ujinga kutojua kusoma na kuandika –na maradhi.  Ningependa kusema kwamba hatuwezi kupigana na maadui hawa  watatu vilivyo kama hatuna pesa. Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, unafanamu pia kwamba maisha siku hizi yamekumu kwa killa mtu. Ni lazima tukumbuke kwamba tunswawakilisha watu milioni 22 katika Bunge hili ambao wengi wao ni wafanyakazi wa roapato ya chini. Tunajua kwamba bei za bidhaa hazina ubaguzi kati ya tajiri na niasikini. Bei ya mfuko wa unga, maziwa ya K.C.C karo ya shule na kadhalika ni ile ile. Ikiwa ni kweli tunafikiria juu ya aaslahi ya watu wengine, ni lini tutaona kwamba mishahara ya watu wa mapato  ya chinina ya wakubwa imeongeswa. Nafikiri Waziri wa Wafanyakazi atakubaliana name kwamba hat a yeye ana taabu kwa mshahara anaopata. Ningependa kumwambia asiyapinge maoni haya kwa sababu ya kutaka to lakini atwambie ule spango Serikali liyo was wa kuongeza mishahara.Ni lazima sisi viongozi tutame lie hali tulio nayo sasa na ile tuliyckuwa zamani.  Kwa wakati mu, hakuna kitu kinachouzwa shilingi moja. Kwa mfano, mashirika  mbali mbali ya Serikali yanapata faida kuowa kila mwaka kutokana na  jasho la wafanyakazi na halu hawafikiriwi katika nyongeza za mishahara. Matusemi kwamba ni lazima waongezwe pesa nyingi. Ingefaa waongezwe kitu kidogo hata kama ni Kshs. 5/= mradi tu wawe wameongezwa mshahara. Kwa njia hill watuajua Kwamba wako katika nchi  hii.Kwa mfano, siku hizi kila huduma matekelezwa kwa njia ya arambee ambayo haimchagui tajiri au masikini. Tunaaabiwa kwamba kutoa Sarambee. ni hiari ya. mtu binafsi. 	 Ikiwa mtu anayepata mshahara.wa Shs.250/- au Shs.300'/- atatakiwa kulipa pesa za  Harambee katika shule ambako mtoto wake anasoma, atazitoa wapi ikiwa mshahara wake  ni wa chini namna hii/ Mzazi huyu huyu anatakikana anunue vitabu, ambavyo ni. ghali alipe kodi ya nyumba alipie matumizi ya nyumbani na kujistarehesha kwa yinywaji Wakati umefika kwa Wizara ya,Wafanyakazi  kukubali mwongozo wa kuongeza mishahara, ambao umesomwa na mhe Wasike—Ndombi, uwe ukirekebishwa kila mwaka kama ilivyokuwa ikifanyika zamani.  Pia kuna haja ya marupurupu ya madiwani ambayo ni ya chini mno ingawa madiwani wanaifanyia nchi hii kazi ya muhimu. Ingefaa wafanyakazi wote katikanchi hii  wapewe nycrngeya mshahara kulingana na ongezeko la bei za bidhaa, hali ya kukua kwa uchumi na hali ya maisha ilivyo.Bw. Naibu Spika wa muda, kuna haja kubwa ya kuongeza mishahara kwa sababu siku hizi hakuna kitu cha bure. Tena mishahara ya chini imewafanya watu kujiingiza katika magendo. – Utaona kwamba. watu wengi wanaacha utumishi wa Serikali na pia wizi umezidi katika mashirika ya  Serikali 'kwa sababu ya kulipwa mishahara ya; chini kabisa. kva sababu hii ninawaomba Mawaziri, ambao ni marafiki zangu waiunge mkono Hoja. hii inayotaka" wafanyakazi wetu waongezwe mshahara Nina VIPTH VA. hatmna. mtu atakayelpinga Ho ja hii. kwa sababu sote tunajua Kwamba bei za bidhaa zimeongezeka sana  na wafanyakazi  wzongeza mishahara. Ninamwomba kila mtu-awaombee wafanyakazi waongezwe mishahara kila mahali katika nchi£ hii yetu ili waweze kuishi vizuri.<NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.

MANG.'OLI: Thank you, Mr.- Temporary Deputy Speaker,, for giving me this, opportunity to contribute to this very important Motion. The core of this. Motion requires the Minister for Labour to review salaries and  also scrap the anything in this motion. All that we are saying is that  now expenditure requirements of our people are in excess of their earnings. This  has been so because prices of many commodities have  in the past tended to go up. The Mover of this. Motion has always had the welfare of the people of this nation at his heart. I hope the Minister will let this Motion to be passed, as it is so that when it is implemented it will benefit the ordinary .worker. This Motion is not aimed at benefiting managers. but the lowly paid workers so that they can afford to live in the present economic conditions.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Bidu talked about Harambee: We have never at one time exempted the lowly paid workers from contributing to Harambees, because they are part and parcel of the Harambee movement. I can see. the Minister looking around, but I hope he will go out to ask other Ministers, to come into the House in order to. defeat this-Motion. Since today we Back-benchers are more than the, Front-benchers I think the Minister is worried. However, whether he supports it or not, once the Motion is passed, he should implement it.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>HON. MEMBERS: Ministers support the Motion.</NEWSPEECH>  <NEWSPEECH>MR. MANGOLI:  I am told that the Ministers support this Motion and hope they, will continue supporting it.I am told that Ministers are going to support the Motion, and I hope that this is going to so. When we talk about salaries and wages, we talk about the morals and values of human beings in terms of income. I am sure that the Minister, who is himself an expert in terms of economic theory and practice, having been involved in business, knows how the expenditure of the ordinary person, who earns little money, can be eroded by price increases. Although it may not have been the wish of the Government to make these increases, it is a fact that prices have been increased and the Motion here calls upon the Minister to scrap the current wage guidelines in order to give free bargaining power to trade union members in respect of getting workers' salaries and wages increased. That is what we are saying. Since commodity prices have been - decontrolled, the Motion is asking the Minister concerned to decontrol the present wage guidelines so that we may operate on the willing-seller-willing- buyer system.I am sure that the Minister knows that we are talking for the people at the-low level, who are the majority. These are the silent workers-who have no other means of saying what they want. These people are told, "You will have Shs.200/=" and that, is it. These are the people we are concerned about, and we are requesting the Minister to note that it is important that this Motion is passed in the light of what the Mover has said. The recent decontrol of commodity prices is evidence of' the erosion of the purchasing power of the workers in this country. Therefore, we, especially Back-benchers, are asking for assistance from- the Front Bench in this, very important Motion. Workers need to be paid a little more than they are getting today, and this will be made possible by scrapping the present salary and wage guidelines and maing it possible for workers and trade r unions to have a free hand in deciding how much workers should be paid. Even if the Minister does not scrap these guidelines, he could increase salaries even by Shs.200/=, this will boost the morale of workers.Before the Minister can reject this Motion in its totality, he must take into consideration the workers in the countryside on behalf of whom we are speaking. These workers know that we are talking about their salaries, and we have to be very careful in what we say about this issue because these workers are the majority of our voters. They need a little more money in order to take care of their families and contribute to Harambee funds drives, besides participating in other aspects of our economic growth.When the Minister finally approves this Motion, we do not want to become a mere paper to be kept in the archives; it should be implemented as soon as possible. The experts of the Ministry concerned should expedite the decision of this august House so that workers may see that what we have said here is implemented. Time and again,, we have passed Motions here but they have not been implemented, which makes us,. Back—benchers, wonder whether we are only meant to debate Motions here without achieving any positive results. We .pass very important Motions here which affect the common mwananchi, the defender of the. Nyayo Government, and yet thereafter, the Ministries concerned do not do anything to - implement them. If the Minister to whom this Motion is- being addressed is, indeed,, with us in the same boat as these workers who voted for him, should- ensure that, once the. Motion is passed, the officers charged with the responsibility of informing those concerned do their duty immediately. Then the effect and economial impact involved will be felt in the implementation of this Motion.The reason why we are brought here is to work together as hon. Members- in respect of. matters that" concern; the common mwananchi, which are, indeed,  sensitive. We do not talk just because we want to talk, but because the matters we talk about are very sensitive. The next Labour Day is just around the corner and, if the Minister says today that something will be done about this Motion, workers will turn out in big numbers for the activities planned for that day, 1st May, 1990. We are dealing with the morale of workers, and these workers are requesting the Minister to offer them whatever he can. We have ably tried to convince the Minister that workers need to be compensated, and I. am sure that he is now fully convinced of this fact. This Motion is not an attempt to question Government machinery in terms of increasing salaries; its intention is toidentify the Government's move towards increasing workers' salaries.I am sure that all of us share the sentiments of the Mover and that we ail with him. This Motion is very important, and you can see that every hon. Member of the Back Bench. wants to speak on it because it touches on the various roots of the nation. We are speaking with a bit of emotion because we believe that it is time for workers to be compensated a little bit. With humble respect to the Minister, we are requesting him not- to tamper with our intention as it is good for the nation. Once implemented, the Motion will help to build morale in Nyayo  supporters, and they will speak the language that all of us understand. This is the basic reason why this Motion is asking the Minister to scrap the present wage guidelines and increase salaries with immediate effect.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KYONDA: Thank you very, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to join my colleagues in support of this Motion.  This Motion has come at the right time. We have seen transport charges go up, as has the; cost of education in terms of fees, books and equipment. When everything is put together some schools charge as much as Shs.15,000/= a year. This- cost does not apply only to the children of Ministers or managers; it applies even to the. Ordinary wananchi in rural areas. The price of soda has gone up several times, perhaps after every three or so months. The prices of beer, sugar and even some foodstuffs have also gone up. We know that some of the extra money generated goes to farmers, but a lot of it goes elsewhere. We cannot exhaust the list of commodities affected as it is very long. We are talking about the basic needs of wananchi. It is time our workers were compensated adequately.</NEWSPEECH>When you talk about somebody earning Shs.600/=, Shsi700/= or Shs.800/= a month, one wonders how some of these people manage to live.Mr. Temporary  Deputy Speaker, Sir, as it has already been  said, corruption/seems to be in the increase. In some Government offices.  you find people coming in two hours late  and  leaving  two or one hour earlier, because they are running the country losses  because the worker is trying to survive by all means. Just as somebody else pointed out here, living is very expensive today. In fact, I do not think that we are living, I think we 'are merely surviving,, with a lot of difficulties.. Sir, most of the increases on prices of various commodities go to benefit the employers only, and yet they have  got a lot of money. Factories  are very few as compared to the workers and the unemployed people Therefore, most of the price   increases-go into the hands of workers for  two or three years. If one is a casual worker, one earns very little money and one can be sacked any time. -W- earns very little .money-and ke/can be .sacked -.1' " any time. Sir, the workers of this country are the one who uphold the economy, on  this-country, and3 therefore,  they should be well .considered. Those Workers are our voters; brothers and sisters, and so we should consider their plight very seriously.Sir, medical allowances for Government workers have also been withdrawn. Sometimes, a child of a person who is earning Kshs.700/- in the public sector may fall sick, and he cannot take him to hospital due to lack, of money. That is a very pathetic- situation. I am not against the costs sharing system in Government hospitals, but how do you share costs with somebody-- who is earning almost nothing?The purchasing' power of the middle class workers has been very much eroded, and therefore, it is only fair that this House supports this Motion unanimously, without any apposition. I  would like to appeal to the Minister concerned not. To Amend that Motion because it is straight forward and it touches on the livelihood of our workers which is very important. Our workers should be well paid so. that they work with dignity and feel that they play a very important role in the development of the economy of this country. If they are well paid, they will feel that they are important Kenyans. In fact,, workers are very important and also indispensable, because if they were not there, you can imagine where the economy of our country would be. But the same workers are paid very poorly so we should address ourselves to that issue very seriously. Sir,. I would also like to raise the issue of  councillors salaries and allowances. Last year; there was a Motion here requesting the Government to increase the salaries and allowances of  councillors. Councillors earn only  Kshs. 1,200/- per month, yet they are very busy. They are also involved in" many Harambee meetings, and we expect them to live and contribute during Harambee meetings, they are highly respected our in society. Therefore, it is surprising for one to find corruption being  practised those involved can make ends meet. If we want a- good, and honest work force, we should all support this Motion.Sir, it is surprising for  the Government to come up and decontrol prices of very many commodities, without saying anything about the salaries , of the workers. The workers  salaries should be increase  even if there is no money in most cases there is a lot of money. Some of the factories are  making a lot of money. You only  need to look at their cashbooks, and you see the millions of shillings that they are making. We also read in some newspapers that some banks are making very many million per year, but their workers earn very little. I think some employers take some of their money outside the country, because they think it is too much to be kept here. Just ago, a lot of money was being taken to other countries. Sir, very many employers in this country Kan are capable of paying their workers betters. This is a very  straight forward Motion, and therefore, it should be passed unanimously.With those few remarks, I beg to support the Motion.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR(Mr. Okondo) : Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this; Motion has  a lot of good intentions in it, and as  such, we are going to treat' it with the good-spirits' and intentions that it  deserves. I think that this country is very lucky. We have a Government system that allows  us to debate- very intimate-things and" we must be grateful- to- His Excellency; the President for establishing a system of-peace in this country, and a Government system that  allows us to-debate. the wages and salaries' of. Our workers freely. That is a. very unique situation in our continent and therefore, we should be very grateful to a our President. Those people who sometimes think- that we are unlucky or we are experiencing difficulties do not know what they are talking about. If those people visit some African cand European countries, they would not enjoy the same liberty that they are enjoying in this country. Sir, today ,. Eastern Eurppe.i.is discovering horriblethings which used to-happen a few years a_go in -Governmentsystems which were supposed to be for the worker. Those Government systems pretended that they were doing things for the worker,, but instead a lot  horrible things were done. This country has" got only one philosophy, that, is, "we should all be happy and peaceful. We should all work in a peaceful atmosphere, and everyone should do what he thinks is the best That is the established Nyayo Philosophy of His Excellency the President. That is why we should thank and follow our President, because he certainly knows where he- is going and where Kenya is heading to, and we must follow him.TIE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Cntd):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, sir, as far as I am concerned, Us Excellency the President loves the ordinary workers in this country. In fact, the President himself is number-one worker in this country.  He works for the nation and since we have elected him to work for us, he has proved to be a number-one worker. Therefore, I would like to say that -Government is going to do everything it can far. the welfare of the workers in this country. We want to-make sure that the ordinary worker, has satisfaction and peace at his place of work, and  therefore,/anyone who attempts to disturb this peace, should watch out. Our Government is capable of doing what is necessary to maintain  peace in this country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am happy that hon.  Kiliku moved this Motion, bat there are certain words in the Motion which ought to be adjusted a little hit. Therefore, in order to maintain the spirit of co-operation between: the employers and the employees, I am going to propose a small amendment to. the Motion, although the spirit of the Motion is: acceptable. to us. Therefore, I propose that the Motion should now read as follows.THAT, following increases in the prices of certain essential commodities and the decontrol of prices of others, which has affected the purchasing, powers of workers; this House urges the Government to effect prerequisite measures to review the wages-guidelines.	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, by this "amendment, the spirit of the Motion is maintained and it- is only the wording of a. few sentences that has been adjusted. Therefore, I think that in all earnesty the Souse should accept the Motion as. amended. As far as workers are concerned, they are completely free to arrange and organize their wages. I. am saying this because under the workers have Trade Disputes Act, under the Trade Unions Act and under the Employment. Act/all the right to use their ability and skills to negotiate with their employers and reach a collective bargaining agreement. Workers have been doing this through their unions every other year. So, the workers, as a matter- of fact, do to a very large extent, guide their own wages. I am saying this because they :negotiate freely with their employers and this is provided for under the law. There is no single day that the Government has imposed acertain wage on any group of workers in this country. The wages that pertain in any industry or in any working place, have come about as a result of a collective bargaining agreement between the workers and. the trade union movement and. the employers as members of the Federation of Kenya Employers.  When this agreement has been mutually signed, the Ministry of Labour endorses it, and is then registered in the industrial court. During the period of this agreement, the wages stipulated therein, continue to take effect in that industry. How - much more free can workers be to determine their wages. In fact, you cannot be more  free than this ! - The worker has the optimum freedom to negotiate for his wages between himself be to determine their wages. In fact, you cannot be more free than the and his employer. What a wonderful situation to be in? There is no: developed country/ whether in Europe, America or in Japan  where wages are reached at in a better way than this. Mr. Temporary Deputy. Speaker, Sir, this is why I submit that the : workers in this country are as free as they possibly can in determining their economic activities. This is a record : . that we as Kenyans should be proud Should of wherever we go. We as a matter of fact, be proud of this. We axe on record in the International Labour Organization as one of the nations that adhere very effectively to the tripartite system whereby the Government, the. workers and the employers come together and agree on how the; wages and other, terms of service should be implemented. We do this freely every year and this shows how free this nation is .Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the minimum wage is merely an indication from the Government that any employer who pays a worker below that level of wage, is paying a wage that is below the poverty line which, would be an offence. This is all we are saying, namely that, below such-and-such a wage, no employer should	employ anybody. However, when you go around in any industry, you hardly find anybody g. being paid a aim minimum wage and the majority of workers are paid a wage that is agreed on in a collective bargaining agreement which is registered in the court and is reviewed from time to time "between the workers and the employers This is what happening  in Kenya today.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me explain a little bit further what these wages guidelines are Wages guidelines are simply an evaluation of the national economic performance. We would-like to know how our  economy  has performed in increase of productivity can go to ways. The Minister for Finance has a formula which determines this growth of national economic performance. After he does this, the Minister issues guidelines to the industrial court  saying, "This is the. range within which,, wages should be settled in case the collective bargaining agreement fails". So, these wages guidelines are used only in cases where the performance of the collective bargaining agreement has failed This is an issue that hardly arises. Perhaps there could be about nearly 150 out of nearly/2'million workers with such disputes out of which maybe five or six cases would be settled in the industrial court. This is an issue where we get very emotional although it may not really have any effect on the wages of the majority of. workers. There are very few cases where the industrial court has had to resort to the wages guidelines to determine the .wage level".- Instead the industrial court is busy interpreting the meaning, of the collective bargain agreement. That is what the industrial court doing/most of  the time.Mr. Temporary. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is the reason why  I think _ hon. Members should not spend so much time in thinking or wondering about the effects of the wages guidelines.	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as trade unionist we should be concerned with how our collective bargaining agreements are arrived at. That is the key thing. How do you get your collective bargaining agreement arrived at. This is an important thing. This is because 90 per cent of the workers in Kenya are paid their wages in accordance with that. The question of rural workers is a different matter. They are the majority of the workers but are usually not on permanent terms. This is why I find it quite in order to move this amendment and also believe that this amendment covers everything that the Mover of the Motion has asked for. The amendment covers everything in a manner that is acceptable and that is in accordance with .Government policy and in a manner that will help the workers better than the Motion proposes.Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if we were to accept the a Motion as it is and. implemented it, there would be dire catastrophy. This is because we would destroy the basis of' the economy. Once you have done that, the worker will be worse off; he will not get paid; he will lose his job and the economy will be in a mess and we would have a. terrible state of affairs So,, because of that, we cannot accept the wording of the . Motion as it is. I hope that the amendment will help us get into the situation that we are looking for.I beg to move the amendment.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr.Mibeij) : Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to second the amendment. In fact there is no war between the Front-benchers and Back-benchers. The Government is not fighting the workers; in fact the Government is fighting for the workers. So, the .amendment has maintained the spirit of the original Motion and therefore I wish to thank the Mover for moving this Motion. The Motion, when, implemented will go a long way in looking for ways, and means of solving the problems brought about : by the inability of the workers to meet their day-to-day needs.' The Motion seeks to increase their purchasing powers Since the amendment has carried with it the original idea of the Mover, I find that it is right that we should pass the Motion as amended.: The Mover of the Motion has-looked for a fashion that will be practicable It is no good to pass a Motion that cannot, be implemented.With those few remarks, I beg-to second the amendment.</NEWSPEECH>(Question of the first part of the amendment, that the words to be left out be left out, proposed)	<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr-.MIMkindiaj) : Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,-Sir, for giving-me this-  opportunity to support the Motion as amended.  As the Minister-for Public Works put it, the spirit of the Motion remains the same even after the amendments. Only minor details have been changed and</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.KUBO: On a  point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva) : What is your point of order?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KOBO: Mr; Temporary Deputy. Speaker, Sir, since the amendment has been adequately explained, I think we should be talking' about the words to he deleted and not the amended Motion. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY  Mr. M'Mkindia) : -Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I do support the amendment because one must look at the Wages Guidelines to know exactly what is ' happening-' These Wage Guidelines are one of the instruments that form part of the package that manages .the economy of this country . So, we should not look at these Guidelines .  merely as an instrument that is meant to control the wages and salaries . of employees alone. We must look at them in relation to the rest of the instruments used to manage our economu. Therefore, on this basis, I would say that Kenya has done very well even though we are still, a developing country with limited resources. When one looks at these Wage Guidelines, one must ask the question why these guidelines are necessary. If we removed these wage guidelines without perhaps looking into, .other areas of our economy what would be the likely results? One is reminded of what has  happened in several other countries where . wage increase is  followed by inflation — when, prices are increased then wages are increased immediately and then, you have this inflationary spiral which goes on and on. It is a more dangerous possibility than keeping everything under control. Therefore I do support very strongly-the. amendment moved by the Minister to retain the Wages Guidelines and keep on up-dating them and reviewing them. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WABUGE: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Shall I be in order to move that the question of the first part of the amendment is put so that we can discuss the.

A.K.- KINYANJUI: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy-- Speaker, Sir, for giving me a-chance to join my colleagues in supporting this Motion as amended. The Mover of  the Motion Stated  very clearly that the aim of this Motion is to compensate workers in this country. For us to arrive at what salary should be-paid  to man  to enable him to afford a  decent  standard of living ---- The workers in this country earn very-low salaries. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Members have rightly pointed out the rents of the houses in Nairobi area. One has given a very good example of Korogocho area. The rent is KSh.400/-there. Hon. Members have also given very good examples of what a worker who has children pays for the education of a child. Hon. Members have also very rightly expressed the meaning of expatriate and a worker in Kenya in as far as the daily requirements are concerned. The price of essential commodities - the necessities for instance, unga, Sugarland so on has gone up tremendously. It is, therefore, important to note that it is high time a committee was set up to look into the total salary structure, in the country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are talking of a salary for a small, man, the minimum, and I am glad that the Minister has said what the minimum salary of a worker, should be. But the  Minimum salary of a worker today in Kenya cannot maintain anybody. This is the purpose of having an economy. We work in the country so as to improve the economy of the country and, therefore, the ordinary mwananchi should get a. share, of the economy.- However, because of the salary structure of workers in Kenya today, it. does not allow the worker to enjoy an, increment of salary or whatever  increment of the economy in the country. Therefore, I. would like  to call upon the Government to set up a committee to work..out a salary structure for all the workers in the country. With those few remarks, I beg to support.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KTLIEU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, with your permission, I would like to give five minutes to hon. J.N. Mungai, Member for Molo, to contribute.<NEWSPEECH>MR. J.N. MUNGAI: Thank you very muck, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to take this opportunity to thank my colleague here for giving me five minutes to say something.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, a lot has been said about this Motion. It is a very, important Motion at this time of our country's-development. Most of what I would have said has been said by. the hon. Members who have contributed before me. But my concern here Is that we have had to debate various very important Motions in this House, and a lot has been said- by the Ministers concerned towards such Motions. However, when it comes to implementation of such Motions, hardly anything is done In this particular Motion here, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, which all hon. Members have echoed so much, and through examination of the situation prevailing in the country today, it has been seen   that it is necessary .we review the salary structure of workers in the country. I would like to urge the Minister concerned to go back to- the office immediately now that even in. his amendment he quite agrees  with the situation prevailing in the country as far as money to the- wage earners is concerned, sit with his team, and increase- the  wages. Let us have the- wage-earners in this country have their salaries increased.	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, these are the people who come to cheer us when we call them to our public-rallies or when it comes to- national days. These are the people who support the economy of this country because without them the economy cannot move. The country would be at a standstill. Therefore, I urge the hon. Minister to think about them. We would like the-Minister to go back to his office and increase the wages of the people in the country so that they run at the same pace as everybody else in the country. We are on the run. We go to Harambees together.We share all the purchases together. There is nothing for the rich or the well-to-do people and the wage-earner. We are sharing the whole of our economy or the whole of our national cake equally well. Therefore, if we have to be on the same pace with our development move, let us have our wages reviewed. </NEWSPEECH>With those few remarks, I beg to support.<NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Thank you very much, Mr Temporary Deputy: Speaker Sir. Before I continue, I want to pay special tribute to His Excellency the President for being very mindful about the workers' welfare. It was on 1st May, last year, when His Excellency the President announced the increase of 13 per cent to the basic- salary of all workers in the country. I think the same spirit has also been expressed by the Minister for labour, and I thank him for the way he has responded to this Motion. The amendment to the Motion was very much in line with what everybody expected.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, what we want is that when-a Motion has been passed by this it is better for it be implemented because wananchi have confidence in the House.	 When Motion has not been implemented then the hon. Members have problems with questions from wananchi back. in. their constituencies There-fore, in order for the Minister to save us from many questions from workers it is better for him to go and implement  what he has promised.I appreciate the fact that a salary review must be associated with the economic growth of the country, and I know we have economic growth in this country. Therefore, the economy should also grow with the workers' wages because they are the ones who determine that economic growth. I am sure without those workers we cannot expect any economic, growth. So, they are the base of the economy. The workers are the ones who contribute, to the economic growth.Therefore, it is better to make them more productive. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Motion, has called for a salary increase and wage increase to affect all workers- in the country, regardless of whether they are represented or not, or whether they have collective bargaining agreement or not. This Motion is for all workers and it is in view-of the economic problems that have been experienced by workers.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I-agree with the Minister. He has explained his case very well, and I hope that if he implements this Motion, there will be no problems with-the workers.I am sure there will be no strikes in the country or complaints. In fact, I thank the workers-of this country for maintaining stability and remaining  peaceful people. They have also contributed very much towards the political stability of the country. They played a very major role during-the pre-independence  days. So, I think we should thank them very much, and this is the only  way we  can, thank  them meaningfully.I thank  all. the hon. Members  who have contributed to this Motion and  also those who wanted to contribute but, unfortunately, did not 'catch the Speaker's eye '  Also, I thank those who did not-contribute due to the time factor.  I also thank the Minister and hope that he is going to implement this Motion before 1st May because we. are being forced, to-talk for the workers.   This is due to the prevailing economic problems in the country which have been caused by the salary structured adopted in the country. With those few remarks, I beg to move.( Question of the motion as amended put and agreed to )Resolved accordingly:THAT, following increases of certain essential commodities and' decontrol of prices of others, which , has affected the" purchasing power of workers; this House urges the Government to effect prerequisite measures to review the wages guidelines. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I move this Motion, I would like to make some changes in order to remove some words which are not supposed to be there. I am proposing to delete all the words appearing in the first line between the. ", " after the word "THAT" and the word  cost-sharing" and substitute the word "since" in place thereof. I am also proposing to delete all the words from the word "to" appearing in the sixth line up to the end and substitute, the word "all" in place thereof.Having done that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I. beg to move:-Re-introduction of Free Medical Services to the Poor.THAT, since cost—sharing for medical treatment in Government hospitals is proving to be beyond the reach of unemployed and financially handicapped people, and while noting that it is a Government obligation that the public get treatment; this House urges the Government to devise a method of raising  funds from employed persons to provide free medical medical services to all.THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Kibaki): On a point" of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. We do need your guidance here. " As you know, the drafting of Motions is approved and goes through the Clerk to the National Assembly, the Speaker, and everybody else concerned. The point of order I am raising is that the hon. Mover of this Motion is revising it substantially to read that he wants free medical services for "all" and not to the unemployed and financially handicapped people as originally stated. - He is presenting that amendment to you. Sir, through our Standing Orders,, as if he was just making a verbal amendment like inserting a coma or a semi-colon. I am suggesting that what the hon. Mover has done is that he has proposed substantive amendments to his Motion.Secondly, Sir, and we also need your guidance on this matter, the' House was given a written statement by the Ministry of Health, which was tabled in this House and which did state categorically - and all Government officers have repeated it - that the unemployed and the so-called financially handicapped will not be charged for medical treatment. That was a written statement, and it has been restated at least five times by myself and 10 times by many Government officials. The House has to be treated seriously because, the introduction of the Motion states “That, in view of the fact that these unemployed and financially handicapped people are being charged ………..”Now,-is it a fact? Now, I mean, as a House, can we not be taken seriously? We have our constituents and other people.... </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>AN HON.MEMBER: That is a point of argument!</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Kibaki): No, I am not arguing. I am only referring to the drafting of the Motion. I am, not objecting to the Motion because an hon. Member has a right to move any Motion.- But he cannot, tell the-House, that something is  a fact when. it: is, not a fact. </NEWSPEECH>	.<NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva): Mr. Minister, do sympathise  with you,, but-this Motion was presented to the. Speaker, and approved.- I think the . Sessional Committed also went through it and approved it. "So, I think the right way of going about it from your side should be either, amending it later-or opposing it.. Although the Motion is not properly drafted, I think we should give- time to the Mover to carry on and then you will deal with it when your time comes. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is very unusual because we have never seen a case where, after a Motion has been moved, a Minister stands up immediately on a point of order to reply' to it.' As far as I am concerned, the Minister for Health has already replied to my Motion because, according to him, the unemployed and the financially handicapped people are not being charged for treatment in Government hospitals. However, this is what is happening at the hospitals. The Ministers in the Ministry of Health, are fond of being misled by their officers. If you do not have money you do not get medical treatment.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Kibaki): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I raised something very substantial. It is true as the Chair ruled that the Motion was drafted and approved. However, in moving the Motion, the hon. Member amended it substantially to read "all" at the-end and not as originally stated, that is* "the unemployed and financially handicapped people". Am I not right, according to our Standing Orders, to state that an hon. Member should move; ah amendment to a Motion through the normal manner? This is not a verbal amendment where you are required to insert a comma or a semi-colon. The- hon. Mover's amendment has changed the substance of the Motion, which should have been done through a genuine amendment before the House. It is not something that can be done by one hon.

MWAMZANDI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Motion, as it appears on the Order Paper, does not read the same as the Notice of Motion. I gave here. My Notice  of Motion stated "all" at the end, and that can be confirmed from the HANSARD.. In any case, I do not mind moving, the Motion the way it appears on the Order Paper.  My argument is that this Motion does not mean that I am against- .the principle of cost-sharing. We have accepted that principle' and it is  for that reason tha we have been buying school equipment. Our argument here is that cost— sharing in other fields</NEWSPEECH>		<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL  HERITAGE (Mr: Lalampaa): On. a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.

Mwamzandi, please stick to the Motion as on the Order Paper</NEWSPEECH> Re-introduction of Free Medical Services for the Door.<NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have agreed to do that and I beg to above the following Motion:-THAT, in view of the fact that cost-scaring for medical treatment in Government Hospitals .is proving to be beyond the reach of unemployed financially handicapped people, and while noting  that it is a Government. obligation that the public get treatment; this House urges the Government to devise a method of raising funds from employed persons to provide free medical services to the unemployed and financially handicapped people.We would like sick people to be treated as soon as they fall sick. This is because on. Many -cases since-some people, cannot afford the ±s.20.00 fee when they fall sick, they decide to remain at borne until .such a time when" they get the ±s.20.00. . As a result by the time they visit a hospital their condition would have worsened. It is very difficult, especially for the unemployed and the financially handicapped people, to get this shs.20.00- So if we say that for them to get treatment the;-- must pay this s.20 .00 then there is a possibility that by the time they can afford to visit a hospital their condition .could have  worsened to. the extent that they might die. In fact,  if the condition, of a patient worsens, then it might mean-that the said patient will have to stay longer in the hospital. The Director or Medical Services has been saying that there are committees  that will investigate the financial, capability of patients who cannot afford the charges; but these committees are only heard of  and not seen. They do not exist in our hospitals because I have never seen one. The policy is currently that a patient either pays the charges or he is sent away. In fact, I have never seen any of these committees exempting a patient from paying the charges. But if at all they exist, how long will it take them to investigate the financial capability of a patient? This is a problem because it might take them long to reach a .decision. So, the process does not work because</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MAIIIHU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary- Deputy Speaker, Sir. I do not know what the hon. Member means in his Motion by saying that the employed people should provide funds to pay for free medical services to the unemployed and financially handicapped people.  Could he enlighten mc on that because the way he had put it is very confusing</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY .DEPUTY' SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva) Order Order , hon. Mahihu! That is not a point of order but a point of information. Could, you enlighten him, Mr. Mwamzandi?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.MWAMZANDI:Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir , since the- hon. Member has been  here for sometime he should know what  a point of order is. He is a former provincial commissioner and he should' know that this is not a province but the august House. So in actual fact the g; policy of exempting patients from meeting the charges does not exist. When I said that  a method of raising funds  from the unemployed</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MARTHU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the hon. Member in order to suggest that this is not the province where I used to' be the 'governor'?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MHANZANDI: Sir, it seems like  hon. Maidu likes the word ‘governor’ and I would like to say that I did not use it; it can be checked from the MANSARD.When I say that the employed should contribute for the unemployed, I have in mind the fact that already those who are employed contribute Kshs. 20/= every month to the National Hospital Insurance Fund, from ass which very few people benefit. This is because if you go for medical attention at a private hospital, you have to pay the doctor’s fees and buy drugs. The only assistance which the national Hospital Insurance Fund a gives a contributor is subsidizing the cost of the bed. For example, if the bed charge is bed 400/= a day, the Fund will only pay Kshs.90/= a day. This is a amount  and that is why people a feel that they do not benefit from this scheme. The National Hospital Insurance Fund has a lot of money which is now being lent, to other companies for the purpose of accruing  interest . The  money in this Fund should be given to the Government to supplement medical - expenses incurred by those who cannot afford cost sharing in hospitals. There should be no scheme whose purpose-is to assist contributors to meet a portion of medical expenses in a given day.	We as workers do not-mind even if this contribution is increased from Shs. 20/= to Shs.30/= so that our brothers and sisters who cannot afford medical treatment can benefit. Sir, you can see that free medical treatment  is essential as far as dries life is concerned.In this country we have many non-governmental organisations like the Lions Club, Visa: Oshwal Community and so on who, on given days, give free medical treatment to our people. For example, they give free eye treatment and give deserving patients reading glasses operations and so on. Many people who are sick stay at home because they cannot afford treatmentin Government hospitals and wait-for the Lions Club, Rotary Club and the Visa Oshwal Community to give them free medical services. Some of these organisations  operate free dental clinics which are normally packed to capacity by the wananchi. These are indications that people persevere with pains until they get free medical treatment.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I know for sure that when I say here that some people are not able to Shs.20/- those who have had good life right from the  beginning, like son or daughters of senior chiefs, cannot  believe that somebody can fail to raise Shs.20/- yet the President recently when he was conducting a fundraising for the Presidential Bursary Fund said that the had decided to assist bright children from poor families by paying for their education so that after their studies they could also help, in the development of this country. There are the  who know what exactly poverty is. Sometimes some families fail to get sleep because, they happen to  have been, unable to get their dinner, although this is a surprise to people who were brought up in rich families. In fact, when people brought up in rich families become leaders they take very little notice of other  people 's problems. We should ensure that members- of the general public are assisted, and do not suffer unnecessarily.Sir, we have enjoyed free treatment for the last 26 years, and I do not see any reason why we should, start paying for treatment at this time. I urge the Government to re—introduce free treatment immediately because I. think paying for it is harmful to the public. We should never deceive  ourselves here that some people are happy with the cost-sharing,-because if one had a barometer to check whether people are complaining about it, then he would know people are not happy with it. Our Ministers should not wait until the President says that people cannot afford paying for treatment. I know the Minister will repeat what he said earlier on, namely that 'the handicapped are not paying. However, right now they are paying .and he should tell his staff categorically that</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.

There have been many arguments as to what should be done to these people who cannot afford to pay for medical treatment. The first question that I would like to put goes to members of the public themselves.I know that it is common to see people in this country carrying out self-help projects on a Harambee basis. This applies to people in the villages even in pre-widding parties, and other similar occasions. When somebody dies, people are ready to contribute a lot. of money. I still believe that if somebody does not have Shs.20/= in any part of the country, it will not take a long time to get a Good Samaritan to help him. I do not believe- that we are all that poor. When you go round saying that our- people- sire too poor, you,  in fact, encourage them to think that they are very poor.

If the officials from the Ministry had gone out to explain to the people about the cost sharing system, then the people  would have mobilised themselves in order to help the poor people. The public relations department of that Ministry has not gone, out to the public. They just issue circulars which are just kept in the hospitals.

Can you go on hon. Kubo?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KUBO: Sir, the Motion is trying to request the Government to do something about cost sharing. The Ministry Health has not done its best to inform the public about the cost sharing system. In fact, the, public are fearing to go to the hospital because they do not understand what is happening there. They fear visiting  hospitals because they know ±k± that they will be charged Kshs.20/-.Therefore, I would like to request the Minister to make sure that his personnel go out and accompany the administrative officers and chiefs in their public, meeting so that they can educate the public on the cost sharing  system with regard to medical treatment. I have attended very many meetings, but I have never seen the personnel from the Ministry of Health addressing the public on that very important issue.	I would also urge the people to think more seriously about the issue of 5 cost sharing a regards medical treatment. It is not the -intention of the Government to make the people suffer, but it is over stretched. The Government has to spend a lot of money on other things, and that is why the public has been asked to contribute something towards their medical treatment. I believe that the public is capable of paying that money if they are well, educated about the cost sharing system.Sir, I would also request the Minister to think seriously about the National Hospital Insurance Fund. I think that it should be used to subsidize some of the medical, expenses. Just as the Mover had said, the National Hospital Insurance Fund helps the contributor after he is admitted in a hospital. The National Hospitals Insurance Fund (N.H.IFF.) should be utilized in such a way that it covers , the unemployed and self-employed people. The Ministry should also make sure that the N.H.I.F. pays for the medical bills of the contributor, even when he is goes for out patient treatment in the private hospitals. Sir, tcost sharing is, a very important thing, and therefore, I would like, to request the Ministry concerned to go out and explain what it is all about.the handicapped are not supposed to pay for treatment.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Kibaki): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.

FALANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant Minister’s answer it would not have made much difference, if the deceased body was taken to his home a day later. The late Gufudied, while serving this nation as an Administration policeman at Kibish on a Sunday, 25th February, 1990, but his body was not taken to his home for burial until the following Thursday, five days later when it was already decomposed and unrecognisable. Dead bodies are supposed taken to deceased's homes on time for identification. Now, is this the kind of treatment we expect for people who die in the service of this nation? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.KAMUREN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope hon. Falana will be satisfied with the following information. The late Gufu Abuka Golicha was an Administration police officer attached to KibishDivision, Turkana District. On 25th. February, 1990, Mr. Golicha disappeared from his duty station while he was off duty and was dead the following day, 26th February, 1990 about one kilometer away from the Ethiupia border. His body, which had two spear wounds, was removed from the site and takeu to kibishcentre. The matter was reported to my office on the same day the body was recovered. However, due to very bad weather conditions at that time, the body could not be airlifted to Marsabit immediately. It was eventually airlifted to Marsabit District on 1st March, .1990,-five days after the late Golicha-'s death, for burial. It isemphased here that there is no 1slamic law,or sharia, which stipulates that a	muslimto be buried immediately he or she dies. It is only a matter of practice that muslimsbury their dead relatives as soon as is practicable in order to reduce further grief among themembers, of the family of the dead person. An inquiry into the death of the Administration policeman has been opened , at Lokitang, as inquiry file No.1/90. A postmorten was not done, but the doctor who examined the body: concluded that the death was caused by two stab wounds on the chest inflicted sharp instrument resembling a spear. Normally, postmortems are not done on muslims.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.

FALANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am just trying explain point to the hon. Assistant Minister. When secretary in the office of the commandant of the Administration Police depot, a Mrs. Jane Nyakiribo, was contacted for air transport from Kibish to Marsabit she gave a very reply If I may quote, she asked, many dead Administration policemen's bones have been buried; you are just complaining about a dead body. Mrs. Nyakiribo had the guts to say that from the Office of the President. Is the Assistant Minister aware of that statement?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Speaker, I am not sure of that statement. If any statement like that one was made, the hon.

KUBO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. My point of order is on the procedure we follow here. It is very unprocedural for an Assistant Minister to inform another Assistant Minister of anything when the latter is answering a Question. Therefore, I think it was not in order for hon. Nassir to have intervened when another Assistant Minister was answering a Question.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: What is your question, Mr. Falana?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. FALANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, now that the Assistant Minister knows that there was this negligence on the part, of his office - and since Gufu is not the only nor the lastpoliceman that Kenya has at the borderwhat measures can he assure the House he will, take in this case? We need sympathy from people who just, go to Nairobi Hospital and who have never travelled out— Now that the Assistant Minister knows that there has been such a rude officer in his office,  what action is he going to take to prevent such misbehaviour being, repeated?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KAMUREN: Mr.Speaker, Sir, with, due respect, to my honcolleague, the Assistant Minister, I think he should allow the Office of the President to dwell on the reply to this Question. He comes from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. However, I said that the hon. Member concerned should come and see me in my office about this, particular complaint, we will look into it.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SALAT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Assistant Minister said that it is only procedural that Muslims bury their dead the next day following their death. I still maintain that when a Muslim dies, he is supposed to be buried immediately. From which Scripture or other authority is he quoting?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Hon. Members, we are dealing with Question No. 85. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SALAT: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, My question relates to. Question No. 85, too, and the Assistant Minister said that, according to the information that he has, the late GufuGolicha was not buried too late, but I maintain that he was buried very late according to the Muslim traditional beliefs that when a Muslim dies, he is supposed to be buried immediately. I want to know from the Assistant Minister from what Scripture or other authority he believes that the late Golicha was not buried too late.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said that there was a problem with air transport which we could not solve immediately the late Glicha was found dead. If there had been means to transport his body to Marsabit at that time, we could have transported on the same day, but when information of his death was received in my office, we could not get an airlift and there was no other means of transportation to Marsabit then. However, we respect the Muslim Religion.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr.Speaker, Sir, would the Assistant Minister agree with me that at the time the body of the lateGolicha was transported, home, it was alredy decomposed? If this is so, what, would be given as compensation to the family of the deceased since they did not see their relative, before he was buried?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KAMUREN: Mr.Speaker, Sir, with regard, to this question,my office is preparing the late Administration. Policeman's death gratuity for payment to. His dependants.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr.Speaker, Sir, I am not talking about the normal death, gratuity; damage has already been done to the family of the decesased and  the mistake here lies with the Office of the President, in which case, I wonder whether- the Assistant Minister consider compensating the deceased's family since they were not able to view the body before burial. There is need for such compensation because those concerned buried the body without knowing whether it was that of the late Golicha or not.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was not our Mistake because we did all we could to find the late Golicha. When detectives moved round, they found the body of the late Golicha the following day, 26th.February, 1990, and I would have thought the hon. Member would appreciate what the Office of the</NEWSPEECH>President did.<NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Let us move on the next Question, Mr. Mwamzandi.</NEWSPEECH>Question No. 89Gazetted Entry- Points - Kenya/Tanzania Border in Kwale DistrictMR.MWAMZANDI asked the Vice-President and Minister for Finance which the gazetted point of entry into Kenya along the Tanzania/Kenya border in Kwale District are, and how many people have been arrested for illegal importation of goods along these entry points since 1988.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr.Keah): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.There are two gazetted points of entry into Kenya long the Kenya/ Tanzania border in Kwale District for both importation and exportation of goods. These entry points are Shimoni Port and LungaLunga. border station.No people have been arrested at these two authorised entry points since 1988. A total, of seven people have, however, been arrested since 1988 for illeagal importation of goods at Diani and Majoreni areas, which are unauthorized  entry points.</NEWSPEECH>	<NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI:Mr.Speaker, Sir, sugar was exported from Kenya to Tanzania last month, but it was seized at the border with the help of Special.  Branch officers. Does it mean that when the lorries carrying the sugar were seized and detained at the border, the people involved were not charged, but were illeagally released?</NEWSPEECH>	<NEWSPEECH>MR. KEAH: Mr.Speaker, Sir, I was not aware of these seizures at the time this Question was submitted, but I am, certainly, aware of seizures at other entry points..If hon.Mwamzandi is aware of what he alleges or has privileged information,. I would be gatefulto recieve this information so that I may take the necessary action.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Speaker,. Sir, is the Assistant Minister-aware that these illegal exportations and importations which happen at Diani, Majoreni or Bodo, which are not gazetted entry points, are encouraged by his own officers who use the areas for their own corrupt purposes?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KEAH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am certainly not aware that the arrest of illegal dealers in these other areas encourages corruption among my officers, and I very strongly refute this claim because I have evidence to show that people have actually been arrested. Although I said that the authorised entry points are only Shimoni and Lungalunga. there are three points that are patrolled regularly by Customsand Excise officers and, in fact, since 1988, we have made several, arrests which I would care to read out to the hon.. Member as evidence of the fact that, as far as we are aware, there is no encouragement of malpractice by our officers. However, I would also dare add that if the hon. Member is certainly aware of any particular incidence of malpractice, the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance, through me if he wishes, and the Customs and Excise Department will only be delighted to take up the matter. I would like to read out to the hon. Member, as evidence of what I am saying, the fact that on 16th March, 1988, five people were arrested at Majoreni Village for illegal importation of 52 half—bags and 26 bags of clothes. They were- arrested by Customs, and Excise officers.END BAgain two persons were entered at diani area, for illegal importation of the following goods; 44 desk stands six water pumps, 24 pairs of childeren’s suite, 20 paires of long trousers, 48 Assorted dress materials, and 61 lady handbags. Those people were arrested and they had it very through under the laws of this country. On 27th July,1989 another five persons were arrested at Msambweni while attempting to export the following goods; I believe that the hon. Questioner comes from Msambweni1,916 cups, 222 basins, 2,180 plates, 480 pairs of shoes, 3,906 bowls, 417 petty coats and a 165 bags of sugar. Possibly that is a the that the hon. Member was referring to. All those people have been arrested. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.MWAMZANDI:IS THE Assistant Minister aware that all those arrests have been done by the police force, but the customs people? Also whateves arrests are done by ther customs officials, the culprits are later released after they negotiate with the customer officials, and the negotiations appear to be on their favour. If the negotiations are not in the favour of the customs officials, they take away the goods from the people and the chase them away? Is the Assistant minister aware that the customs officials along route are corrupt?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.KEAH: Mr. Speaker, sir, we hold our officers like all other civilservice with the highest integrity until found guilty. I am not aware that the customs officers are guilty of offences at the border, but since the hon. Member has said so, we shall certainly be alert, but if indeed if he knows of any particular incient, he should come and inform us, otherwise he will also be an accomplice to the crimes. Next time he talks of corruption of the customs officers, I will ask him to substantiate, but right now I will spare him.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR.VAMEYO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The hon- Assistant Minister is imputing improper motives about hon. Mwancandi, by saying that he would be taken an accomplice, which is against the Standing Orders of this House.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.KEAH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not aware of that  Particular Standing Order, but with due respect, XI certainly withdraw it if it is offensive to the hon. Member I wanted the hon. Member to let us know of any incidents of corruption that he is aware off. If he disclosed any incidents uniting corruption to us, he would be helping this government a great deal. I did not in any way say that he is an accomplice, and therefore, I have withdrawn that word with all due respect.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister should withdraw that word without giving any conditions, because he has contravened the Standing Orders of this House.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KEAH:Mr. Speaker. Sir, I am not ashamed of doing that. The word, is completely with drawn</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.

My Ministry has already initiated rural electrification works in Wajir District. Wajir Township which was accorded first priority by the District Development Committee (D.D.C) has already been electrified at a total cost of Kshs. 12 million. Further works in the district will be planned in accordance with the D.D.C. priorities as funds become available. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. A.I.MOHAMMED: Sir, while agreeing with the Assistant Ministers reply,is he awake that out of the seven divisions in the district, only the central, division, has so far been electrified. As. early as1983, the Wajir, D.D.C recommended two divisions in the district to be electrified, namely, Bute  Division and Ebasueni Division. Would the Assistant Minister, therefore, tell us whenMinistry will initiate thoseelectrificationprogrammes in the two divisions?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MKINDIA: My Ministry is aware of the thatwajir D.D.C gave to the projects recommended electrificiation as follows: Wajir Town bute Divisional headquarters, Griftu Divisional Headquarters, Buna DivisionalHeadquarters and Ebasueni Divisional Headquarters. Those are thepriority projects which we are aware of As far as the first priority is concerned, my Ministry is still working or it. In fact, in the forward budget we have budgeted some money to cover theextension of services within Wajir Town. However, if the Wajir D.D. wishes to change their priorities and, perhaps wishes to out Bute Divisional Headquarters as number one, rather thanwajir town itself, they weshall to quite willing to do what thewajir D.D.C. will say.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. A.r. MOHAMMED: . I would like to thank the Assistant Minister for that reply, Sir. thewajir Town electrification programme started  in 1935, and I think the Ministry has done a lot of work, but would the Assistant Minister tell us when the electrification programme of the second phase will be started in the outer divisions of Bute, Griftu and Ebasueni which he has just recommended as priority projects the Wajir D.D.C.?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. M:MKINDTA: First of all, I would like to inform the hon. Member that my Ministry cannot change the priorities of Wajir D.D.C. Therefore, if priority number one for this year</NEWSPEECH>	<NEWSPEECH>MR. A.I. MOHAMMED: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, sir, I did not ask for any change, I said that the electrification programmewajir Town was started as early as 1985. Therefore, would he now tell us when the second Phase of the programme will be initiated in the other divisions that he had named as priority projects?</NEWSPEECH>	<NEWSPEECH>MR.MANKINDIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the first thing that we shall do is tostrengtherthe electrification network within Wajir Town first. But I think that is it is important to put everything in to proper perspective. The demand for electricity in Wajir District is very is low, and it is not possible to supply electricity to Ebasueni Divisional Headcuarters in Wajir District using the mains because from one divisional headquarters to the other one headquarters is several kilometers, and there is no demand inbetween. Therefore, my Ministry will think of supplying electricity using dreed generators. The Government agent kshs.l2 million to electrify  Wajir Town, and Annually we are spending an additional kshs-2. million to subsidise the running of that project. (END C)Mr. Speaker, Sir, whatever we do, we must be able to recover the expenses to supply electricity in that divisional headquarters. It is important for us to do that otherwise, the expenses would be too high. However, if the Wajir District Development Committee does not want any more work to go ahead within Wajir Township, they should inform us so that we can move on to the next divisionalheadquarters.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>ME. A.I. MOHAMED: Mir. Speaker, Sir, I feel concerned about what the Assistant Minister is telling the House because I am not saying that the work in Wajir Township should step. What I would like, to know is when work will  start in the other divisional headquarters as has been recommended by the Wajir District Development Committee. The Assistant Minister has gone out of his way to tell us that the supply of electricity in Wajir District is iradequate, and I do agree with him. We know that at the moment, the Ministry is using diesel engines for the supply of electricity in certain, areas, but this is not good enough, and therefore, can he tell the house when the Ministry is going to supply electricity in the seven divisions in Wajir District?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>ME. M'MUkINDIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we shall simply electricity in the divisional headquarters in question as and  whenfunds become available as per the recommendations of the Wajir District Development Committee.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>ME.

Work on Sigor Health Centre commenced in February, 1984. Originally, the health centre was to be built as a type I health facility. In April, 1984, His Excellency the President visisted the site and after touring theproject, the following changes were agreed upon:-(a) The bed capacity was to be increased from 12 beds to 36 beds, (b) the maternal child health unit and the out-patient department were each expanded to have a large waiting room, (c) the service block, (Kitchen and laundry) was extended to cater for increased bed capacity, (d), sir category E staff houses were re-designed, into 2 blocks of category E flats, (e). the septic tank capacity was increased to:40,0OO to 90,000 litres and (f) the road leading into the health centre was changed from murrain to tarmac.Mr.Speaker, Sir, all these were major structural changes fundamentally affecting thexoriginal contract. Furthermore, the estimated value of the project was as a result of substantially increased to an extent-that funds were not available. It was then decided that the work should be done in phases as funds became available. Since then, however, the following work has been carried out:—(a) a generator house has been constructed and a generator provided,- (b) an out-patient department: has been constructed with an increased waiting area (c) a. maternal child health unit has been constructed with an increased! waiting area (d) one block of. 6 category E flats has been completed(e) the bed capacity has been increased from 12 beds to 36 beds, (f) a kitchen, andlaundry block has been completed and (g) associated services including toilets, paths garage water and-, drainage have been completed-.	Mr. Speaker, Sir,- the above work, has been done at a cost of K.Shs.13,341,727.50 However, the following, work has not been carried out:(a) the construction of one block of 6- category  E flats, (b) two category D houses, (c) road works, (d) fire, fighting equipment, (e) two servant quarters, and (f) direction signs- The above work will be carried out as soon as funds become available.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. arap SOI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, would the Assistant Minister tell us the value of the original contract, and how much, money has been spend of the completed work. Could he also tell us what  is the estimated cost of the pending work in the health centre.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SOMPHISHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, tie amount of money that was allocated to the original contract before all these changes Were instituted, was K.Shs.-5,175,370/- So, that was the original value of the contract.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>ME. arap SOI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the Assistant Minister said, these changes were instituted by his Excellency the President when he visited the site in 1984. Could the Assistant Minister tell this house why his ministry has since 1984 not included this money in their development estimates for the approval, of this house. Why have a they neglected the directive of His Excellency the President?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SOMPHISHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said, the original contract was shs.5.million but up to this time, the work that has been done at theofhealth centre has cost the Ministry shs.13million. This clearly shows that some ofthe changes that had been instituted have been carried out and our Ministry has done its best to look for money to complete this project. At the moment, the project is almost complete and the hon. Member should rest assured that very soon his people are going to enjoy the full facilities in this health centre.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. arapSOI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, would the Assistant Minister tell, us when the Ministry has included the cost of the remaining work in its development estimates, of the next financial year?</NEWSPEECH>	<NEWSPEECH>MR.SOMPHISHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have already said, only a small amount of construction work now remains undone and I would like to assure the hon.

The borrowed graders are from Kajiado District and the Department of Staff Training in my Ministry.Mr.Speaker, Sir, to facilitate adequate roads grading and the coverage of the whole District, distribution, of graders in Machakos District has been reviewed.

We have discussed this matter at the Sub-D.D.C  level and also at the D.D.C. level. I am therefore surprised to hear the Assistant Minister say that he does not have this information. Could the Assistant Minister take up this matter and make sure that these roads are classified because people are suffering a lot?

The Ministry's Head Quarters then classifies the roads in the maintenance schedule if funds are made available for their improvement and subsequent maintenance .Mr.Speaker, Sir, a road which has been approved by the D.D.C. could be rejected by the Ministry's Headquarters for the following reasons: (a) Lack of funds to improve it to maintenable standards that is if the road has  a large bridge or other; drainable structures which might render the improvement of the road  economically unviable and particularly if the road is serving a very small population and.

MAKHANU asked the Minister for Local Government since all local authorities are now receiving substantial revenue from crop cessand service charges, whether he could introduce sitting, ward responsibility and a general increase of the allowances for councillors throughout the country.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr.Wagura): Mr.Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Let me correct the impression which the hon. Member has in latered in his Question..?Not all local authorities get agricultural cess.. In respect of agricultural cess, there is a directive from mis Excellency the President to the effect that the money so collected should be ploughed back into repairing the roads in those areas. So, there is nothing much we can do about the cess.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other source of income is from service charges. The money so available has been used in capital development which include road making, debt servicing, water-supply street lights and so on So, it is not  possible at the moment to increase councilors sitting allowances, as the hon. Member has requested. The Ministry cannot afford to implement that immediately. But in due course, if the local authorities can very aggressively getthe money owed by the creditors, individuals andcorporations the request,by the hon. Member will be considered.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MRWASIKE-NDOMBI: Mr.Speaker, Sir, I think the AssistantMinister is misleading the House because it is this very Souse that passed a Motion here some time ago urging the Government to increase allowances of councillors. Again, the then Minister for Local Government promised that when the cess collection and service charges improved the Government would automatic ally increase those allowances. Today the hon. Assistant Minister is telling us that at the moment  he uses the words at the moment the Governmentcannot do it. Now, is he telling us that that Motion .will not beimplemented or what? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Motion was passed and the Ministry is ready and prepared to implement the terms of the Motion when the financial position of the Iocal authorities has improved. It has not improved at the moment.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>ME.KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the Assistant Minister is misleading the House The same Ministry of Local Government accepted a Motion passed by this House calling upon the Government to increase allowances of councilors. Can be tell us whether he is going against the wishes of his Ministry?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, although I am entertaining that idea of a Motion, that is slightly irrelevant to this Question because the Questioner wants to know when we are going to give not salary increases and so on But we are talking about the Motion at the moment.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the bulk of the original, reply by the hon. Assistant Minister to my Question was most irrelevant because I did not ask whether the money was going- to be used, for capital development, maintenance of roadswhich is not being done and so on I asked for an increase in the allowancesof councillors. In Question Bo.83 of last year, the then Minister for Local Government accepted that allowances for councillors would be increased in the near future when money from crops cess and service charges	What I am asking now is that since this money is flowing-inmoney from service charges and crops cess  thereby Increasing the general fund of the council, and most of the councils are able to have a reserve or something extracould he consider increasing the allowances of councillors?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.-WAGURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will categorically say “no”. I say that because, currently, many local authorities are operating on sank overdrafts.?MR. WAGURA: (Ctd. ):For instance, Bungoaa County Council, Meu County Council, Kisii Municipal Council, Kisumu Municipal Council, Mombasa, Kitale, and so on they are operating on banks overdrafts. All local  authorities in Eastern Province owe creditors who include the N.S.S,F.,Local Government Loans Authority, national Housing Corporation and so on, a sum of over KSh. 44 million.</NEWSPEECH>END F<NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Question has nothing to do with the balance sheets of local  authorities but, rather we  aretalking about the increase of councilors allowances. Is the Assistant Minister in order to evade the-Question?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR- WAGURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, with such large sums of money that Iocal authorities owe other bodies. how can the Ministry implement such increase proposals It is just impossible because many of the local authorities are Operating an Over drafts. There is no way the Ministry, can implement the request immediately. But, definitely, we are looking at the issue very critically.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question.</NEWSPEECH>Question No. 44Outcome of Criminal Case No. 2882 of 11987MR. BIDU asked the Attorney-General what was the outcome of criminal case No- 2882 of 1987,the Republic versus Mr. Barak Salim. Awath, in the Chief Magistrate's. Court, Nairobi.<NEWSPEECH> THE  ATTORNEY GENERAL  (Mr. Muli): Mr.Speakeir, Sir,I beg to reply In criminal  case No. 2882 of  1987, the Chief Magistrate's court Nairobi, Mr Barak Salim Awath was charged with three counts, namely:	(1)Forgery of a Charity Sweepstake ticket;	(2) Uttering a falser document, i.e. the Charity Sweepstake ticket ;and (3) Attempting  to obtain Kshs.40,000/ by false pretences In its judgment of 20th January, 1989, the tiral  court in the presence  of the accused and his advocate ordered for the acquittal of the accused under Section  215 of the Criminal Procedure code. The court further ordered for the release of a cash bail of KShs.5,000/- and the accused's passport, both of which were returned to him.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I appreciate the reply given by the Attorney—General, can he assure this House that since the accused was acquitted, meaning that he was not guilty, he will order the Charity Sweepstake to pay the man his money? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MULI: Mr. Speaker,Sir, I do not  understand that supplementary question. The accused was tried by a competent court and was acquitted, his bond and his passport were also released to himWhat money does the hon. Questioner want the accused to be paid, having been released by a competent court? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is evident that Mr. Barak was acquitted of the three offences he had allegedly committedsince he had won KShs.40,OOO/- from the Charity Sweepstake, then he should get the money which he had won through the charity sweepstake ticket. Can the Attorney-General order the Charity Sweepstake company to pay Mr. Barak his genuinely won KShs.40,000/-?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MULI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the accused was acquitted, yes, but that does not mean that the money he was attempting to obtain was genuinely his. He was only given the benefit of the doubt. I have not however, addressed myselt to the aspect of the KShs.40,000/- but all what I can sayis that the acquittal, of the accused bythecourt did not mean  that her should get theKShs.40,000/--. In any case, I. can look into the matter as a separate issue. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr.Speaker, Sir. I appreciate very much the fact that the Attorney-General has promised to look the  matter of the KShs.40,000/— as a separate issue. Thank you very much.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Let us now go back to Question No 30</NEWSPEECH>Question No30	Payment of workmen’s Compensation Claims to Mr. SuleMR. KIMEMIA asked the Molester for Labour why, since Mr. JoabBitaSule, former employee of Rift vaelley Products Limited of P.O. Box 1023, Nakuru, was injured while on duty on 23rd march 1989 the management terminated his services and how much compensation is due to the complainant in terms of the Workmen's Compensation Act (Cap 236).<NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): Mr. Speaker, Sir, the answer I was given to this Question was not satisfactory and, therefor, I decided that I would answer it tomorrow.</NEWSPEECH>QUESTIONS BY PRIVATE NOTICE Release of Benefits to Workers of Former Nakulines Co. Ltd.<NEWSPEECH>MR. WASIKE—NDOMBI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the MinisterforLabour the following Question by Private Notices.When will the Minister release employment benefits for the five hundred employees of the former Nakulines Company Limited. Nairobi?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okonodo): Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is really a matter of history that does not  arisd any mo re. There are no further benefits due to the former employees of Nakuline's Company Ltd. If the hon. Member had checked the record - presumably he was not herd in 1985 - I replied. to a- similar Question herd and I said that the wages had been paid in according with the relevant act in 1985. As a result, at themoment there is nothing owing to the former workers of that company and, therefordnothing formatting.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WASIKE-NDOMBI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, only 15 per cent of the workers money was paid At that time the official receiver had not collected all  the money due to the company from itscreditors. At the time I am talking now, all the money has been collected. So I am asking about the 85 percent  of the total sum payable to theworkers and which was not paid. Since all the money dud to the former company has been collected from the creditors and banked in a fixed account, and theAttorney-General is award of that fact, can the Ninister release the money to the workers? The money is earning a very high interest from the fixed deposit account.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OKoNDo: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the hon. Member enlighten me as to what is 15 percent and what is 85 percent of the money dud?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WASIKE—NDOMBI: Mr.Speaker, Sir, money which was owing to unsecured creditors amounted to KShs.81. 1 million, and that is part of the former workers money. The money owing to secured creditors, which was paid let  the Minister deny that the money was paid  was KShs.41.3 million. The preferential creditors wered paid KShs.11,610/- It is out of this KShs.81. 1 million that we  are asking the Government to  released the workers dues. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon.  Member has not yet told me what the 15 per cent and what the 85 per cent represent. Can he elucidate that point because he seems to be asking a misleading question?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WASIKE—NDOMBI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I am saying is that these former workers of Nakulines Company have not beenpaid, and they havebeen running from one place to other when, really all this money has been collected. Their total claims amounts to about Ksha.47 millions.</NEWSPEECH>ENG G<NEWSPEECH>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not understand what the hon. Member is trying to say. I have said that on 28th November, 1985 when replying to a Question in this House on the same issue, I said very categorically through the then Assistant Minister Mr. Obure, that the workers wages for the four months were paid which meant that there was no more obligation on the receivers to pay the workers at all That is still the position today. The workers were paid their statutory requirement of four monthspay.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WASIKE—NDOMBI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us call a spade a spade The Minister seems not to have done his homework well because he has not consulted the Attorney-General who is conversant with such cases. Could he be asked to go back, consult his colleague and bring to this House a proper reply next week?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I. have given the proper reply to this Question.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.I think the Minister is not in order to say that he has given the House  the right, reply because the said workers were paid only 15 per cent of their money. The hon. Questioner has further asked him about the remaining 85 per cent If the workers were, paid four months salary how about their benefits?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR- SPEAKER: Mr.-Kiliku, that is an opinion— The Mininisteris convinced that he has given a satisfactory reply to the House and if you are not you, can discuss it with him</NEWSPEECH>Next Question <NEWSPEECH>MR.SALAT: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The hon. Questioner has  said that _the workers have not been paid 85 per cent of what is due to them. We cannot gamble with the lives  of the workers in this country. Could the Minister be asked, to consult with the hon .Questioner find  out whetherthereris still any amount due to these workers? This is because the hon. Questioner has talked of Shs.7 million which is not a small amount could the  Minister tellus where this money is and why the workers have not been paid their dues?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Order! You, of course, know the right procedure to follow about such things If you are not satisfied with the Ministers reply you can consult me and we can see what we can do.</NEWSPEECH>	Next Question.Shortage of Wheat Flour in Makueni<NEWSPEECH>MR. KYONDA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Supplies and Marketing the following Question- by Private Notice .</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Since there is wheat flour in Makueni Division, what urgent steps is the Minister "g to ensure that this essential commodity is made available to the wananchi?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Mudavadi): Mr. Speaker,Sir, I beg to reply. I am not aware of any lack of wheat, flour in Makueni divisionMachakosDistrict. However,I have directed the National Cereals and Produce Board to liaise with, the millers who supply the area and take the necessary steps to ensure that  the supply of the commodity to wananchi in Makueni is maintained.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.KYONDA: Mr.Speaker, Sir, since the Minister saysathatoee is not aware of any shortage of wheat flour in that area, I would like to inform him that there is no wheat flour there at the momentthis has forced the sellers to travel all the way to Mombasa or Nairobi to try to get some By the time this wheat flour reaches Makueni, it is sold for something between Shs.198.00 and Shs.300.00per dozen packets Could the Minister promise to dosomething about it?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUDAVADI; Mr. Speaker, Sir, the supply of wheat to Machakos District and Makueni Division does not come from Mombasa but from Nairobi. I have said that I have directed  the National Cereal and Produce Board to liaise with the millers responsible for the supply to ensure that the people get adequate wheat flour.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MRS. NDETEI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Minister in order to say that Makueni gets some wheat flour when we know for sure that this does not happen? The same applies to Kibwezi Division; we have been having such a shortage for a very long time.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUDAVADI: Mr. Speaker. Sir, I did not  say that there is no wheat flour that is supplied to Makueni Division. They definitely do get some wheat flour. If there is a shortage then it might mean that perhaps what is there is not enough to meet the demand. As I have said we are looking into this problem. For the information of the House, we always ensure that Machakos District gets about 2,000 bags of wheat flour per week which is enough to cater for the various divisons there.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MRS. NDETEI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the crux of the matter here is that there are small kiosk, and hotel owners who need this wheat flour to make mandazi and chapatis The reality is that some of these businessmen have been forced by this shortage to close down their businesses So the Minister should be a bit more serious and tell the House how much wheat flour-they distribute to every corner of Makueni Division.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUDAVADI: Mr.Speaker, Sir, the amount of supply is given according to the districts and not  broken down a divisional leavels. I would, like to reiterate that we are going to look, into the aspect, of improving supplies to areas like Makueni. I would also like to point out that initially there was</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr.Speaker, Sir. I think that Minister- is misleading, the House because a miller is not a transporter which means that, he cannot transport the wheat flour to Machakos I think the Minister has an agent there and if that is so why can they not consult with this agent instead of consulting with the millers?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUDAVADI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this case the millers are the ones who get the wheat from the National Cereals and Produce Board mill it after which it is collected by various people who might hot be agents because  even individuals can buy the wheat from the millers.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.-KYONDA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could I know from the Minister if there are any particular millers who are supposed to supply to the Machakos so that our people can buy from them directly? This is because from experience I know that it is almost impossible to get wheat flour from these millers in Nairobi.I know of a hotel owner who has had to close down and travel all the way to Mombasa to go and look for the flour which is a very expensive way of doing business.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUDAVADI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are a number of wheat flour millers in Nairobi like Unga Limited, Premier Flour Mills, Kabansola Millers Rafiki Millers, Kirinyaga Millers and Kenya Spices Millers. Since these millers are stationed in Nairobi I am sure that if the people of Makueni approached them they would be able to get some wheat flour from them.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr.Speaker, Sir, I think the best way of solving this problem is by the Ministry having an agent in Machakos so that the people around there can get the wheat flour from this agent. Could he confirm whether they are going to have such an age at inMachakos?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.MUDAVADI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it would not be proper to appoint a single agent for this commodity in such circumstances  because I think that would be creating more problems for ourselves This is a food item which means that we cannot confine it to one particular agent to supply or distribute in a given area.</NEWSPEECH>	<NEWSPEECH>MR.

The Voice of Kenya should have checked with the NANSARD regarding the Motion that we as passed in this house yesterday Some of the local newspapers like the daily nation reported, well on this issue the terms of the Motion, which we passed yesterday, are as follows:"THAT, following increases in prices of certain essential commodities and the decontrol of prices of others, which has affected, the purchasing power of workers; this Souse urges the Government to effect requisite measures to review wages guidelines."? That is the Motion we passed yesterday, and it is not sayings that we are going to increase the wages. It only says that the Government should review or put into motion the machinery that reviews -he wages guidelines.That is the Motion we passed yesterday, and it is not saying that we are going to increase the wages. It only that the Government should review or put into motion the machinery that reviews the wages guild lines.As I explained here yesterday, the wages guidelines are used for negotiation of collective bargaining agreement and by the Industrial Court in deciding the levels of wages in settling disputes. They are therefore, not an increase, a decrease or a movement in wages. It is a guide on how the employers and employees should agree when negotiating wages. It is also a guide on how a judge in the Industrial Court should proceed according to the guidelines which are issued ay our chief economic officer the Vice President and Minister for Finance.I also went further to explain that the wages guidelines are only a guide and that the effective thing for workers is the collective bargaining agreement which, the workers enter freely and deliberate with the employers with regard  to what the wages shall be in particular workplaces  Wig is the important  thing which I explained yesterday.If the Voice of Kenya went astray, it is not because of what was said here. What they said is their own opinion and if they have misled the nation the fault is with them and not with this house.Thank you, Sir.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR NEALTH (Mr.Ogur): On a point of order,Mr. Speaker, Sir. When I was answering Question  here yesterday with regard to the type of drugs taken to hospitals, health centres and dispensaries, I said that I would bring additional information to a supplementary question raised by hon. Wamego who wanted to know the names of drugs which curemenengitis.Meningitis is a medical term used to mean inflammation of the membranes of the brain. The causation of this inflammation is by many organisms grouped as bacteria or viruses. Some of them are examples of bacteria while others are examples of viruses.? Under bacteria we have NeisseriaaMeningitidis Type A, B and C. We also have NaeaophilusInfluence and Streptococcus Pneumonia Under viruses we have  Entero viruses  Measles viruses, polio viruses, Coxsachis Viruses and Vermicelli viruses just to mention a few.	These organisms reach the brain through the blood stream and there must be bacterieamia and viraemiafor someone to be sick. Therefore, the drugs for treating and curing meningitis is a long list according to the diagnosis made on the causative organisms. Drugs for causative organisms are as follows: - (1) Neustria Menengitidis	.(a) Prevention for risk groups; we give Polyvalent (A +C) vaccine apart from health education since type A and C are the commonest in Kenya. Type B has never been reported anywhere in our country this mouse should not be worried about the drug that treats it because we do not have it.(b) For Prophylaxis, it is recommended that they take these drugs(a) Sulphur drugs (Sultadianine or Sulpurdimizine)(b) Ampicillin Anoxic drugs (c) Rifampicin	(d) Chloramphenicol.	 (c) Treatment of confirmed cases triple therapy using three antibiotics as follows:—	Penicillin	— Chloramphenicol— Sulphur drugs(2)	Naemophilus Influenza and Ampicillin the drug of choice must be combined with chloramphenicol.(3)	Under viruses, there are no specific drugs that kill them but drugs are given for supportive therapy and they include-—Antibiotics such as Pando, which most people think, is asmall thing. It is a good drug. We also have Aspirin and Chloroauine.— Broad-spectrum antibiotics, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and ampicloracillin injection.—	Vitamins.(4) In treating this disease Meningitis — it is important to note that symptoms of menengitis simulate malaria and that is why it is important to include ant malarial chloroaqine in the group of drugs.Nearly all of these drugs are in the kits taken to health centres and hospitals It is important, therefore to note that many other organisms in our environment can reach the brain through chest or blood infection and cause meningitis therefore, it is a disease that cannot be eradicated but need to be controlled as vaccination of measles polio, - andsmall pock have reduced the processes of menengitis by these organisms.END ITHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH. (Mr. 0gur)(CTD):The bacterial cannot be eradicated as bacteria are always within our environment andbodies.Therefore the mast important methods of fighting the disease are providing health education for treatment promotion of primary health care, use of good nutrition well—ventilated shelters, non-overcrowding, especially during a cold weather like we have now.</NEWSPEECH><HEADER>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING(Mr.Waithaka): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

I rise to respond to a point of order that was raised here by hon. Member yesterday. Iwant to try and throw asome light on the frequency of earthquakes that have been experienced in Mombasa. To date, there have been 10 recorded earth tremors in Coast Province between Tuesday, 13th March 1990 and yesterday, Wednesday, 4th April 1990. The first tremor occurred on 13th March 1990 in the morning and lasted 2 minutes, 06.35 seconds. The second one occurred on 16th March 1990 in the morning and lasted 31-1 seconds the third the fourth and fifth was on 16th March 1990 in the evening. The sixth tremor was on 18th March 1990; theseveth was on 21st March, 1990 in the evening and remaining 8th to 10th tremors have all occured in the evening.An instrument called “Earth Tremor graph, which is installed at the Chiromo Campus of the University of Nairobi, has recorded these tremors. To be able to determine precisely thelocation of the source of the tremor, at least three such instruments are required. However, from the records obtained from this instrument. It has been determined that the source of the tremors. I have mentioned above Ivies between Nairobi and a point that is 500 to 526 kilometres away from the recording machine taking this distance therefore, the distance would seem to be approximately 70 kilometres inshore from the Coast in Mombasa. We have contacted our counterparts in Tanzania and Ethiopia who have similar instruments to give us any information that they may have recorded in their instruments.In the very near future, we expect four new such instruments from the Government of West Germany.	END JTHE MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (CTD.):These instruments will be handed over and given to the University of Nairobi. The four instruments will be stationed by our experts at appropriate locations in the country in such a way that two of them will be stationed west of the Rift Valley, and the other two east of the Rift Valley. The latter two instruments will also cover Coast Province.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I might add here that a machine that has been lying unused in the university’s store has also been discovered, and our Senior Geologist and Senior Geophysicist, Messrs, Githinji and Machaira, respectively, are on their way to Mombasa to select a suitable site for stationing this machine. Fortunately this second machine has come at the right time and ray Ministry's Department of Geology and Mines will together with the University of Nairobi, ensure that it is installed there as quickly as is humanly possible.It is important to note that our country is divided into two by the great Rift Valley. which is a volcanic structure and the rocks beneath the surface of the earth are always adjusting themselves This leads to earthquakes and other tremors which are also small earthquakes  and there is nothing human beings can do to stop them What can be done, however, is to minimize the damage caused by an earthquake. Last night, a professor in the University of Nairobi gave the nation some of the precautions that would be useful to take in the event of such an occurance and Iwould request my hon. colleagues here to try to educate wananchi on how to behave when an earthquake or tremor occurs. The professor gave about 70 different ways of taking precaution during such troubled time, which is usually a very short time. Examples of these precautions are: —1.	Avoid being anywhere where you might get falling objects. If necessary one can dive under a table, a bed or a workshop desk to make sure that you are not hit by an object that might be upset by such a tremor.2.	Do not run from a building carelessly, as you are bound to expose yourself to falling bricks from the building from a direction that you cannot see.3.	If you are in a high-rise building, please do not rush to staircases or lifts. Seek safety elsewhere, such as the places I mentioned earlier. THE MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (CTD.-):4.	If you are in a house that is made of brick, and it is not reinforced, that kind of structure is likely to be affected. It is safer to take a chance and stay outside rather than stay inside. Leave as quickly as you can, but as cautiously too, as you can.5. If you are outdoors, try and get into open ground away from structures, power lines and even trees.6. If you are in a moving car, calmly stop your car away from buildings and always keep to the left, if you can, or somewhere safe, and away from structures, such as houses, if you can and if you are near them, bridges, et cetera and remain in the car until the shaking is over. There are more than one shock associated with that wave, but they are not many. Each shock signifiesaftershocksthe arrival times of different seismic waves. Also, aftershocks which occur after major shocks: may follow several minutes, hours, days or even weeks after the main, shocks.	Mr. Speaker, Sir, the cause of the problem that we have today should not alarm people very much.The last time we had heavy earthquakes was 1910 and 1928, and from records, only oneperson's death that was caused. So, we should not be terribly worried. At the moment, the Department of Geology and Mines andthe University of Nairobi are preparing what we call “seismic zoning map” to show those areas which are earthquake prone. We have done a little  bit of in Nakuru West, and when the exercise is completed, we will be able to advise wananchi on the Building Code so that they may apply it and minimize the effects of such an occurance. Thank you.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from the statement made by the Minister, he has not assured the people in Mombasa as to why the last tremors we had occurred only in Mombasa; all that he has done is to explain the theory of tremors, but he has not assured the people of Mombasa, who are the ones complaining of the source of these tremors. He talked about 70 kilometres inshore, which is somewhere near Taru, Voi or somewhere else around there. Relating to the theory of earthquakes, we have a rift valley between Madagscar and the mainland, which
