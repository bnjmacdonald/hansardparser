KIRWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I  beg to give notice of the following Motion:-THAT, while noting with great appreciation the excellent coverage of the proceedings of the National Assembly, provided, so far,  by the Kenys Broadcasting Corporation; in the ever popular programme "Today in Parliament" ; it is now an opportune moment to explore ways and means of enriching the flair and content of this coverage; hence, this   House resolves to establish a Select Committee to study the modalities for introducing sound and vision broadcasting of the proceedings of the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to give notice of following Motion:- THAT, in view of the fact that Host parents whose children are in secondary schools belong to the low income  croup and realising that most Boards of Governors in these schools have raised the fees payable in 1991 in the farm of various extra payments in addition to the tuition, boarding and examination fees thereby making it difficult for most students to  pursue their studies, this House urges the Government to instruct the Boards of Governors to withdraw the system of charging the extra fees and review the policy regarding tine funding of these secondary schools.</Newspeech><Header>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</Header> Question No. 563Payment of Retirement Benefits to Mr. ChemwengutMR. CHEPKOX asked the Vice President and Minister  arap for Finance why Mr. Kigen Cherirrengut P/No.. 15252- APN. PC. 35965; has not been paid  his retirement benefits and when he Will be  paid.  <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to  Mr. Kigen Chanwengut, pension file No. AFN/PC/35365 has in fact, been paid his retirement benefits by cheque No. 2/3131807, dated 16.11.90.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEPKOK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister I hope this cheque will be received. This is because last month the same Assistant Minister told the House that Mr. kamau had been paid his pension, but up  to this moment he has not received his pension  I have a letter from him telling me that he has never received his pension. I will be happy if Mr. Chemwengut is paid and not kept waiting like Mr. Kamau.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KSAH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, did I hear "Mr. Kamau"? I am answering a Question on Kigen Chemwengut,</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEPKOK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am referring to a Question I asked in this House about a month in reply to which the same Assistant Minister told the House that Mr. Kamau had been paid three months back, but up to now Kamau has never received his pension. This is why I am saying that I wish the Assistant Minister is  telling the truth that Mr. Chamvengut was paid by the cheque he has mentioned.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KSAH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could hon. arap Chepkok kindly advise this House what relevance Sir. Kamau has to the Question be fore the House relating to Kigen Chemwengut? Be that as it may assure  hon. arap Chepkok that this cheque was posted to Mr. Chemwengut  I am not saying Kamau. through the care of Cheborowo Farmers Training Centre.  P.O. Box 33, Moiben. Although written on 16.11.90  the cheque was posted on 19.11.90.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEPKOK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, why was Mr. Chemwengut sent the cheque through Cheborowo while a letter from the Pensions Department givces his post office box number as 249. Iten?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEAH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if hon. arap Chepkok has information that I do not have I will only be too glad to get hold of it and I will respond to it. Right now, I am not aware of the information he has with him.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASIKE-NDOMBI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is true that the cheque has now been addressed to the pensioner. It is  also true that the pension office has the proper address  Mr. Chenvwengut. The Assistant Minister has given the House the  address  through which the cheque was posted. In this case, the cheque is going to land in the wrong hands and at the end of the day, it may become a stale cheque, when this particular officer is anxiously waiting for this money. Will the Assistant Minister now, go and check with his officers and make sure that cheque is recalled and posted through the right address?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEAH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have not quite understood what the hon. Member is in fact, trying to tell me.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASIKE-NDOMBI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Question is very straight forward. Since the Assistant Minister has now informed the House the address through which the cheque was posted it is  a wrong address. , The cheque will therefore, land it wrong hands it may even be delayed beyond six months and become stale while Mr. Chewmengut is waiting for it anxiouly. Will the Assistant Minister go back to his office and instruct, his officer to withdraw the cheque so that it can be posted through the right address so that Mr. Chemwengut can receive it?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEAH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have an. Address given by the pensioner in our files. That is the correct address.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is misleading the House. I have given the exact address which the pensions department is using when writing letters to Mr. Chemwengut Iten. I have a letter from the same department addressed to Mr. Chenwengut, through P.O. Box Number 249 , Iten. How did he get the other address?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEAH: Mr.  Speaker, Sir, the right address that we are going to use at the Treasury, is the address that is given to us and authenticated by the pensioner and not by anybody else.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEPKOK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we shall not allow the Assistant Minister to mislead this House. The address which Mr. Chemwehgut gave when he retired was 249, Iten; not Cheborowo. Cheborowo was his working station. according to the pensioner, his address on retirement was 249, Iten. Why did the Ministry send  the cheque to  Chemborowo Farmers Training Centre?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: What was your question, Mr. arap Chepkok? MR. arap CHEPKOK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the address that  Mr. Chemwengut gave when he retired was 249 , Iten. That is his address. According to correspondence from Pensions Department, Mr. Chemwengut address is 249, Iten. Where did the Ministry get the other address for Cheborowo?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEAH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member should help us to have the correct address so that we can review the address authenticated by the pensioner.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question.</Newspeech>Question No. 608 Non-Posting of Mrs. Chongas N.S.S.F. ContributionsMR. LEWA asked the Minister for Labour why the contributions for the years 1975, 1976, 1977, 19 81 and 19 8 3 for Mrs. C.R. Chonga, N.S.S.F No. 036 755 816, Emp. No. .029238 , were not credited to her account.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR. (Mr. D.M. Amin) : Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Women were register as Fund members in 19 75 and they were not required to contribute to N.S.S.F., until 1977. Mrs. Chonga, N.S.S.F. No. 036 755 816, made no contributions to N.S.S.F. in 1975 and 1976 and, therefore, no money is credited to her account for the two years.In 1977 and 1981  the members account is credited  with an amount or Ksh.534.00 and Ksh.498.00 respectively. In 1983, the employer did not remit the standard contributions  and  did   not  submit annual contribution returns. Due to the above fact, Mrs. Chongas account has not been credited with the contributions for 19.83.Mrs. Chonga should, be advised to sort out the issue of contributions for the years 1975, 1976  and 1983 with her employer if she  made any contribution.MR. WASIKE-NDOMBI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the N.S.S.F. Act provides very clearly that a defaulting employer is liable to prosecution. The Ministry is aware that in 1983, the employer did not remit contributions to the fund. The Assistant Minister is now asking the employee to check with the employer instead of the requesting the N.S.S.F. inspectors to work the necessary sections  of the Act and prosecute the employer. Will the Assistant Minister now, instruct his officers to prosecute this particular employer for failing to remit N.S.S.F. contributions to the Fund?MR: D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are ready to prosecute the employer if he has not paid the money. We are not sure whether the lady is still in employment.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASIKE-NDOMBI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has informed the House that in 1983 she was in employment. Forget about today. Will he for that particular year take appropriate actions? He has a team of inspectors in his office  who can bring this particular employer to book?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speeket; Sir, we shall confirm that. If she is still in employment, obviously we. shall take action.MR. LEWA: On a point of order! Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The Assistant Minister is hammering on the point of whether the lady the lady is in employment, or not. It does not really matter  whethershe is m employment or not. The fact is I in 1983 this lady was in employment and he should also therefore, take the instruction from here and find out why BAT did not  remit the funds to N.S.S.P?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we do not know up to now whether she is still in employment or whether she is contributing. If we confirm that, obviously we shall take action.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEWA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I would to make the Assistant Minister aware of the fact that  BAT had a Kenchic project in Kiikambala. This project would up in  mid 1980. He should therefore, take up this issue with BAT. He should also ensure that all the funds that were deducted are credited to here account. I have the payslips	from the lady and deductions were made during those years and there was no remittance made to N.S.S.F.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: It the hon. Member confirms to us that the deductions have been made and has not been submitted, obviously we shall take action?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER:  Next Question.</Newspeech>Question No. 592Payment of N.S.S.F Benefits to Mr. ArubartaaMR. KIRNA  asked the Minister for labour why Mr. Kibil A. Arubarita. NSSF No. 010.557 has not been paid his NSSF benefits.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. D.M Amin): Mr. Speaker Sir, I beg to reply.The claimant applied for withdrawal benefits on 25th July, 1935 stating that he had worked for the following companies:- Tawala  Firm from I960 to 1969 S.K. Limited from 1971 to 1974; S.F.T. Firm from 1975 to 1933 but the Funds records shows that no contribution has been posted to the claimants account.On 1st December, 1937, schedules were sent to these firms to complete and send contributions collected but there was no  reply. On 12th November. 1990. the Fund sent a letter Ref. Ho. SFC 0107355710 to the branch manager, Kitale, requesting him ascertain the existence of this firm and compel them to fill the forms .and return them together with the contributions. As at this memering no reply had been  received. The Fund promises to pay Mr. Arubarita as soon as these firms send their contributions.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA :  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not think it is the mistake of Mr. Kibii. What steps is the Ministry taking to ensure that the claimant receives his benefits given the fact that Mr. Kibii had communicated with the Ministry Headquarters as early as 1987?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIM: We have ordered our Area Manager, N.S.S.F., Kitale to take action on those particular employers.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA:  It is just not enough to say that the Ministry has instructed that action be taken on these employs when will Mr. kibii get his dues?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN:  As soon  as we get contributions from. thass employers, we  shall  pay Mr. Kibii.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question</Newspeech>Question No. 610Extra Surveyors for Uasin GishuMR. MISOI asked the Minister for Lands, Housing and physical Revenue that since there is a lot of delay in the proposing of title deeds, transfers and  sub division of land	in Uasin Gishu District , what urgent is taking to post extra field officers to expedite the finalisation of land issues in this district. <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Mutiso): Mr. Speaker. Sir. I beg to reply.There is no delay in the processing of title deeds., transfers and sub-division of land in Uasin Gishu District. If the hon. Member has any specific case, he can give me the information for further investigation and action.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not true that there are no delays involved here. I have two farms in mind, namely, Parakeiyua Farm and Closes Farm which are owned  by farmers in partnership and there has been delay in processing their title deeds. Can the Assistant Minister inform the House why these title deeds have not been processed as quickly as possible? Whenever these people go to the Ministry, they are sent back to somebody else. They are sometimes told to form companies before their title deeds can be prepared, Where is the truth  in this matter? Is it necessary for them to form companies before they can be issued with title deeds?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO: The processing of title deeds is done by land registrars in the local area after the completion of the subdivision of land and subsequent title mappings. Secondly, transfers of land and handled by land control boards in the districts.  Subdivisions of companies and co-operative farms is going on in this particular area and there are adequate staff  to carry out sub-divisions and title mappings. The work is programmed. As it cannot be carried out at the same time due to inadequate resources such as, operating expenses and transport. For instance, the work progress   In the following 14 settlement schemes is as follows:(a)	Registered Schemes Sunet MoibenB1 Lahal(b)	Work in ProgressBurnt Fores: SuptekMile 13LelmokBiduraSabsagoiCheraiKahunguraBahariniTegeyaKordooThe sub-division of company or co-operative farms is done as soon the members are ready and as per the work programme. Sometimes minor delays are caused by directors of the farms if they do not supply us with proper inform¬ation. When this is the case, processing of title deeds cannot be undertaken.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISQI: I am prepared to accept that answer which is different from the original reply where the Assistant Minister had said that there are no delays. He has now accepted that there are delays which sometimes do occur within the Ministry, what the people require is accurate information from the Ministry so that they do not travel from Eldoret to Nairobi unnecessary because it is very costly. Can he, therefore, assure this House that such delays will be minimised especially within the Ministry Headquarters?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO: I said that when we have proper information and adequate information in the Ministry and when our staff at the district level have prepared and completed their work with no mistakes being noticed during mapping processing of title deeds became very easy and fast. The hon. Member can be can be rest assured that if the directors of these farms and if the staff on the field have completed their work, the processing of title deeds will be speeded up.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question.</Newspeech>Question Mo. 598Completion of Kiokeikei Motosiet RoadMR. KIRWA  asked the Minister for Public Works what has delayed the completion of Kipkeikei Motosiet  rural access road in Cherangany Division.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Archbishop Ondiek): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. The delay in completion of the  road in question was caused by a multiple damage of culverts spanning across the road. It had to take some time to find suitable culverts to repair the damaged section of the road which have now been delivered to the site. Another problem which caused the  delay is that our engineers who would do the job are presently deployed on another M bridge on rural access road No.  27  Wanyoyi Wataluk Road in the same district.<Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, unless the Assistant Minister is talking of a different road, the answer is mislead¬ing. What I am aware of is that there are no culverts that were laid down on this road earlier on. The v did the work  but they  never laid down the culverts. So.  when he talks of multiple damage. I do not know where the culverts were damaged. Can he explain that to us?</Newspeech><Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as far as I am concerned, the answer that I have before me states that the culverts were damaged and the ones that we are repairing are the ones that were damaged.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister is misleading the House, what I am saying is that there are no culverts that were laid on this particular road. So, when he talks of damaged culverts, I do not get him. I am not with him Can he tell us where the culverts were?</Newspeech><Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member should realise that I am not an engineer and, therefore, I am just handling the Question as it was brought to me by my officers.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I heard the Assistant Minister well, he did say that some culverts have now been delivered to the site.   Could he tell us when the work is going to be completed, despite the fact that engineers are, working on another road?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK: Mr. Speaker, Sir. the culverts have been delivered and the road will be completed as soon as the engineers finish the work on the other road.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister tell us when those damaged culverts were laid on that road?</Newspeech><Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Kipkeikei Motosiet Rural Access Road No.63 measuring a distance of 10 km. was completed to gravel standard in December. 1937. Sometime in August, 1990, an overloaded/before lorry  broke a multipleline of culverts. Engineers have been instructed to start the work as soon as they complete that bridge as all the materials required are at the site.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: Mr. Speaker. Sir, can the Assistant Ministertell us when the culverts were taken to the site?</Newspeech><Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEX: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe the hon.Member should be interested to see the culverts at the site, but not to know when they were delivered there.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.I do not know why the Assistant Minister is evading answering the Question. The House wants to know what date the culverts were delivered to the site. This is a very simple job. Let him make a commitment and then he can give us the answer afterwards.</Newspeech><Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP 0NDIEK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Members should appreciate the fact that the culverts are at the site at the moment and, therefore, the question of date   when the culverts were delivered there  does not arise. It is not important at all.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. "Old" people do not talk the way hon. "Archbishop" is talking. He should be serious when addressing the House. The question is very simple. A few minutes ago the hon. Archbishop ondiek had told the House that he is not an engineer. Well, we know that he is not, but he is in charge of engineers, and we do not bring engineers here in the House. He is here, on behalf of engineers, to tell the House what the House ought to know from engineers. He has been asked to tell us when the culverts were taken to the site? We are doubtful about he seriousness. They might have never been taken there at all.ARCHBISHOP 0NDIEK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said. That the culverts were delivered to the site in August, 1990.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the Assistant Mini star ought to take this House sore seriously. I left hone on Monday this  week in the afternoon and I checked on this particular road. There were no culverts. There were depressions where the culverts were supposed to be laid down. Those depressions have been there for the last four years. Prom the Question, it is clear that the answer ought to ^have dealt with the completion of the road, but not with the delay in the repair of the road  Can he, therefore, clear the anomaly because I was there on Monday?</Newspeech><Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP 0NDIEK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the hon. Member was there on Monday and today is Thursday, I think, he had better go back there again and check to  ascertain whether the culverts are there or not.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. ITDETEI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think the Assistant Minister is misleading the House. Earlier on he had said that the culverts were delivered in August, 1990.The hon. Member for the area left home :-on Monday this week but the culverts had not arrived there. This means that the culverts have never been dispatched to the area. Could he make a commitment to gooand find out when the culverts were dispatched to the area?</Newspeech><Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP 0NDIEK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as far I am con¬cerned, the culverts were dispatched in August, 1990, and they should be there by now. As soon as the engineers finish work on the other road, they move to the present site and complete the work.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Archbishop Ondiek, if you are sure that the culverts were dispatched in the month of August, 1990, you have been asked on what date? I think that is important to Members. The hon. Kirwa cones from the area and we should go by what he tells us.</Newspeech><Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP 0NDIEK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, according  to the information I have here, the culverts were despatched in. August,  1990, and I believe that they are already there.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: When? What date?</Newspeech><Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP 0NDIEK: Mr. Speaker, Sir. with all due respect to the hon. Members, I do not think the date is important at all. But the culverts  were delivered in August, 1930.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Archbishop Ondiek, I am sure you  are follow-ing what hon. Members are saying. That no culverts have been despatched to the site. So, can you take the trouble and kindly find out when the culverts were despatched, and whether they have reached the site?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. When you were giving your ruling, the hon. Archbishop Ondiek said the date is irrelevant. Is that in order? Is he in order?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: I did not hear that! Next Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: On a  point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am sorry to interrupt the House. But it is very bad if the hon. Assistant Minister is giving a very inconsistent answer and the members of the public are going to hear that the culverts were delivered in August, 1990. Yet I was there on Monday and no culverts had been delivered to the site.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Kirwa, we are already on Question No. 612, and I have requested the hon. Assistant Minister to  find out exactly whether the culverts were delivered to the site or not.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: When will he inform the House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: It is up to him.</Newspeech>Question No.6l2Repairs of Thwake BridgeMR.

AIYANI): Mr. Speaker, Sir his morning I was speaking on telephone with my people in Machakos and I requested them to give me definite and clear answer to this Question because there was something missing in the answer they had forwarded . to cur office. Therefore , I would like to seek the indulgence of the House to put this Question off until next week.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Okay, next Question, Mr. Makhanui.</Newspeech>Question No. 582Science Courses for Bungoma School StudentsME. MAKEANU asked the Minister for Education since very few students from Kanduyi Constituency  have been admitted for science based undergraduate studies in our public universities this year, whether he could consider offering science based studies to Messrs. Simiyu K. Wabwile - 62001002 - B Sigak Mudogo  62001003 - B. Masika Wafula  £2001007 B, and Mukcya Festus 62001011 B, who were former students of Bungoma High School and had met the basic requirement but were offered Arts based courses?<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION(Mr. Kanauri): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. The Joint Admissions Board, admitted Mr. Simiyu K. Wabwire, Masike Wafula and Sigak Mudogo for Bachelor of Arts degree because the three students had chosen the course as their first choices Mr. Festus Mukoya had applied for Medicine as his first choice but he did not meet the course cut off marks  and therefore, was not admitted for Medicine. However, he was admitted for the Bachelor of Arts degree course, which was his second choice. When these students report to the  university, they are advised to apply for inter-faculty transfer within the first two weeks, and are considered alone with many other students.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not know where the Assistant  Minister obtained this information from. I have a letter from the Headmaster of the school detailing the choices as per student and none of them choose a Bachelor of Arts degree course either as the first or second choice. According to this letter, Mr. Wabwile Simiyu; Index Number 62001002, chose mechanical engineering,  agricultural engineering, forestry and electrical engineering and he did not choose anything to do with arts. The second student, Mr. Sigak Mudogo, Index Number, 62001003, chose survey,  information science,   bachelor of education science and agricultural engineering. The third student , Mr. Masika Wafula, chose survey, veterinary science, information science, bachelor "of education  science. The fourth student, Mr. Festus Mukoya, chose veterinary science and not medicine as the Assistant Minister  says, wildlife management, bachelor of education science and animal production. Therefore, would the Assistant Minister, tell the House why these  students were admitted for.  bachelor of arts  courses knowing very well that they qualified for admission to bachelor of science courses?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not know from where the hon. Member obtained that misleading information. The information I have here with me is from the Joint Admissions Board, of the University . The first student, Festus Kokoya, had his first choice as Medicine, while his second choice was Bachelor of Arts and the third one was survey. The second student, Mr. wabwile Simiyu, had his first choice as Bachelor of Arts, while his second choice was Bachelor of Architecture and the third choice was Bachelor of science. The third student, Mr. Masika Wafula had Bachelor of Arts as his first choice, then Medicine his second and Bachelor of Commerce, engineering and survey as his third choice. In any case, these students did not meet the requirements for admission for Bachelor of  Science courses. The only student who   met the requirements of a Bachelor of Science degree course cut as I said these students were given time within the first two weeks to  make inter faculty transfers.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKEANU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in view of the conflicting information that the Assistant Minister is giving to this House    My information isauthentic since it  is from the source.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: In view of that, we shall go by what the Assistant Minister has informed the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: In the case we have the  fourth student who the Assistant Minister says that he had made the required cualifications for a 3achelor of Science Degree, could he tell us why this particular students was net admitted a for this degree course?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker,. Sir, the only student who would have been admitted for a Bachelor of Science degree course was Sigak Mudogo who had a total number of 44 points but he could not have been admitted for this_ degree course because he had not chosen it as his first choice.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

No. 642/221/39, Kisii, involving a Mr. Francis Ongwenyi Monyancha.<Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. The correct reference number of this case is High Court Case No.163 of 1990 and the number of the case given by the hon. Member is a police file number. The case in question involves two persons, namely, Mr. Sephania Aberi Omosa  and Mr. Samuel Sire Ongonai. Both these two people were charged with stealing stock, the property of Mr. Francis Ongwenyi Monyancha on the night of 23rd  and 24th July, 1939. The two were arrested, tried at the Kisii Principal Magistrate Court and found  guilty. They were convicted and sentenced to   two years imprisonment on 18th September, 1990. The first accused lodged an appeal on 2oth September, 1990 at Kisii High Court. The proceedings and judgment of the lower court are in the process of being typed for submission to the Kisii High Court for appeal  Subject to what I have said, it is clear that this matter is   and I do not therefore wish to say anything more about it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

MOMANYI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am asking whether, since these people were found guilty and sentenced to two years each, the court could release the cows which were used as exhibits to the owner pending the appeal?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MULI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the words that were missing were release the cows to the owner. I am sure that if the owner would apply to the court to have the cattle released that would be  all right. But, normally, you retain the exhibits until the hearing of the case and the appeal  are all concluded.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was very keen listening to Attorney-General, particularly the last part of his reply. He said that the proceedings have not been forwarded to the High Court by the subordinate court. This is one of the causes of delays in hearing of criminal cases. Could the Attorney-General inform the. House as to what his office is doing to ensure that those who are convicted get the earliest opportunity of having their appeals heard? Currently appeals are delayed by the typing of the proceedings? What is the Attorney-General doing to make sure that there is justice?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Mutiso): On a point of order, Mr.  Speaker, Sir. I think I heard the Attorney- General say that this matter is subjudice. I see that we are  dragging it along and, by so doing, we may be jeopardising the deliberations of the court.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MULI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, hon. Mutiso is quite correct. What I can tell hon. Kubo, who is a lawyer himself, is that he should realise the accusations he is making, while privileged to do so, are not easily received by the institut¬ion of Judiciary. If he were outside these premises, I am sure he would find himself before the court for contempt.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question. Mr. Chepkok, ask you Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I had a very genuine point of order in that I would only be subjudice if I was talking about the substance of the matter.  I am not talking about the substance.  I am merely talking about the procedure and saying that, in fact, there is a delay in typing court proceedings. I know the law, and it is not in order for hon. Mutiso to say that I am talking about the case before the court. I did not talk about the facts of the case but, rather, about the administrative aspect as to the delay in the typing of court proceedings. So, I was not out of order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MULI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, you may wish to tell the hon. Member, who is making accusations of delay, perhaps implying that the courts are lazy or not working, not to be protected by the privileges of this House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not suggesting that at all. All I amsaying is that there are always delays because the courts are not well providedwith equipment. Some courts do not even have typewriters. That is what I amtalking about and I cannot talk about the behaviour of judges or magistrates.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MULI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the courts will continue to expedite the dispensation of justice as they have been doing, and this case is not an exception.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

But that shows that we are learning gentlemen also.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Chepkoks Question.</Newspeech>Question No. 529Delay in Hearing Criminal Case at EldoretMR. CHEPKOK asked the Attorney-General what is delay-ing the hearing of the Eldoret High Court Criminal Case No. 51 of 1988.<Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. As a result of unexplained death of Mr. Philip Kipruto on 3rd January, 19-35, along Iten Singore road in Elgeyo/Marakwet, an inquest was registered with the Iten Magistrates Court on 4th September, 1985, and ruling delivered on 9thDecember, 1985. An order  was issued to arrest and apprehend Mr. Stephen Nyamu Gitonga and charge him with murder. He was arrested on 3rd December, 1988, and on 8th December, 1988, was charged with murder at the Principal Magistrates Court, Eldoret.Mr. Gitonga was then committed to stand for murder trial on 8th August, 1989, at the Eldoret High Court. So far, 11 witnesses have given evidence. The last hearing was on 13th November, 1990, and the next is scheduled for 26th November, 1990. Therefore, there is no delay in hearing the case.Mr. Speaker, Sir, as far as giving the information to the House is concerned, I could have relied on the principle of subjudice but all that has now been done is not prejudicial to the trial. However, anything further said may prejudice the proceedings of the court and I ask that no further discussion on the matter should be allowed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Let us now move on to Questions by Private Notice.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Not on Question No. 529.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I only wish to inform the hon. Attorney General that the dates he was given are wrong. It is only the family of the man that was called on 13th November, 1990, after I had asked this Question. The family was not informed when Mr. Gitonga was arrested and charged. I have asked this Question three times in this House, and I would like to request the hon. Attorney—General to follow it up. The information he: was given was wrong. In fact, I wish to inform the Attorney general that there is no case No. 51 pending in the High Court, Eldoret. In fact, the cases in that court are hardly 29, and that is why I am asking him to follow up this case.<Newspeech>MR. MULI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not see anything wrong here. Unless the hon. Member wishes to bring another case bearing the same number and involving the same people, this is exactly what is on court record. If the hon. Memberis dissatisfied with my reply, he can come to the office and then we shall see what the difficulty is. As far as I am concerned, the trial is continuing now.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER: Not on the same Question, Bw. Daktari. Let us move on to Questions by Private  Notice.</Newspeech><Header>QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE</Header>Shortage of Drugs in Bungoma Hospital <Newspeech>MR. MAKHANTJ: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Health the following Question by Private Notice.What has caused the consistent lack of drugs at Bungoma District Hospital and Bungoma Health Centre?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.I wish to inform the hon. Member that there is no lack of drugs at Bungoma District Hospital and Bumula Health Centre at the moment, or at any other time. The distribution of drugs, from the Medical Supplies Co-ordinating Unit is done through the provincial Medical Officer who  in turn, distribute the same to the district hospitals. The district hospitals then distribute the drugs to health centres and dispensaries. On 8th November, 1990, the Provincial Medical Officer, Kakamega received drugs for Western Province. Bungoma District Hospital received its share of drugs on 27th October., 1990. These supplies are distributed in the following batches:-(c)	Kit I and Kit II(d)	Out-patient kits, medicinals(e)	Dextrol 4-gauze, 70 rollsBumula Health Centre received its share of drugs from Bungoma Distric Hospital on 16th November, 1990. The quantities supplied were:-(e)	Kit I and Kit II boxes(e)	Chloroauin injections 2mm and 50 ampules(e)	Chloroquin injections 5mm and 150 ampules(e)	Chloroauin syrup(e)	Chloroquimarin (?) Malaria syrup, 5 litre units.There is  another consignment of drugs for Western Province which will be sent out  next week, beginning on Monday, 25th November, 1990. All the district hospitals in the Western Province will get their shares from kakamega. However, if the hon. Member is aware of any particular drug that is not available at Bungoma District Hospital, or at Bumala Health Centre, or whether he is aware of any losses of drugs, or theft, for that matter, I suggest that he informs my Ministry so that appropriate action can be instituted.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we appreciate the long answer by the Assistant in which he has even given the dates on which the drugs were delivered. But, at the same time he is misleading the drugs that these drugs have always been there. It is true what we have sometimes have had shortages of particular, drugs in some hospital units. I know of a health centre where there were no malaria drugs recently. So, could the Assistant Minister clarify that issue that there has never been any shortage of drugs in the hospitals and health centres?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me say that you will find patients visiting a particular institution more than the other within the same district At the same 'time, you can find a number of patient needing the prescription for a particular drug and this can cause a shortage but, that cannot be called a permanent shortage. In this case, for example, if there is a situation where patients need a particular drug, there is authority for the medical officer to prescribe it for them to go and buy that drug at the chemists. Furthermore, we have the option of referring a particular patient to the next medi¬cal facility, of district hospital and in emergency cases, even Kenyatta National Hospital.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the Assistant Minister for that elaborate answer. However, this Question raises a fundamental issue. If what the Assistant Minister has told the House is true, and I have no reason to believe that, then there is something wrong with the distribution or administration of these drugs at the end point. If at all on 16th November, this year drugs were received at Bungoma District Hospital and at Bumula Health Centre, this week on Monday 19th November, when I was getting prepared to come to Nairobi, I  found patients at the Bumula Health Centre who were suffering particularly from malaria and the clinical officer there told me that there were no drugs. I put them in my personal car" to Bungoma where I personally bought them drugs there from a chemist. Following what hon. Okondo has said, could the Assistant Ministernow confirm or deny that there has been shortages of drugs in Bungoma District Hospital. Bumula Health Centre and other health centres there? This is particularly the antimalarial drugs and Panadol. If he knows that, could he institute measures to investigate the causes of such shortages and why drugs are disappearing?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will not accept that because, if any one of us knows how drugs are disappearing, or how the shortages are coming about, that is a serious matter  on which one should report immedi¬ately. The Ministry cannot allow such a thing to continue. I would also request hon. Okondo, if he is aware of a particular health centre lacking a particular  drug to inform us so that, if possible, we can see what we can do; otherwise, it is very difficult to guess where there are shortages of drugs in a given area. I do admit, however, that if the hon. Member informs us of a particular drug that is in short supply in a particular institution, we will take action after he tells us where that is. The drug kits are usually packed at the Central Medical Stores and the names of the health centres to which they are to be despatched are marked. The medical officers of health do not open the kits; they only receive them and distributes them to the relevant-health centres. Therefore, I can only say that we will be very serious with anybody tampering with the drugs and will take very serious action if any of our officers is discovered to be messing about with the drugs that are supposed to be dispensed to the sick.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister has very wisely evaded asking the Question brought to the House. The Question specifically sought to know about anti-malarial and panadol, which  two drugs are nowhere in Bungoma District Hospital and not even in  the Bumaia Health Centre" He had been asked to confirm or deny that those drugs are not in the medical institutions there. The Assistant Minister is now making a long story and not giving the required answer on the two drugs.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have just said that we have already supplied these drugs. Malariaquin deals with malaria. The hon. Member knows this, although he may not have been sick with malaria as he does not come from areas where malarial diseases are prevalent. We have already supplied Kit I and Kit  II. We have a also given the out patient departments all the malariaquin and the tablets that cure malarial attacks. If these essential drugs are missing, I would only be left wondering because the supply was made. These are essential drugs which my Ministry cannot at all fail to supply. Chloroquin injections in 2mm and 50 ampules were also supplied. Chloroquin syrup was also supplied, as well as Chloroquinamin (?) syrup, 5 litres.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. 0KONDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister is very detailed in his answer, and I am grateful for that. However, that leads me to ask him whether they have a system in the Ministry to check on the packages that are packed in Nairobi and whether they are actually received by the respective units and signed for by the relevant medical officers in charge of the particular unit? In this manner, the Central Medical Stores can keep a record that the drugs have actually been received in the medical units.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Yes. This is because the supplies are sent through the Provincial Medical Officers of Health in the Republic. The P.M.O.s received these consignments and the Medical Officers of Health go to collect their shares from the  P.M.O.s Then the M.O.H.s wait for the clinical officers from health centres and dispensaries to come and collect their shares. The documents are duly signed in triplicate. It takes   time for these documents to be brought back to the head office and therefore we may not be very consistent but that is the procedure; there has never been a problem about this arrangement. But if a consignment goes missing it is very easy to check through the M.O.H., P.M.O. and later the Medical Supplies coordinating Unit.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think the Minister is misleading the House. This is because in his answer he   said that the Ministry will be delivering drugs to Bungoma District Hospital next week. Is that not an indication that there is a shortage of drugs in Bungoma District Hospital? Is the delivery arising from an order from Bungoma District Hospital?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we do distribution work every month. This Question has come to us when we are about to start distributing the drugs next week. Bungoma District Hospital will not feel any shortage. The hon. Questioner said that there has been "persistent" drug shortages in that Hospital and I am saying "no" because the consignement of 27th October, 1990, will also be delivered on 26th November, 1930. So, there is no reason for me to say that we are not good as a Ministry; we are very good.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

SPEAKER: Next Order!</Newspeech><Header>BILLS</Header>(First Reading)The Non-Government Organisations Bill(Order for First Reading read   Read the FirstTime Ordered to be read the Second Time tomorrow)Second ReadingThe Land Disputes Tribunals Bill(The Attorney-General on 20.11.90)(Resumption of debate interrupted on 21.11.90)<Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Hon. Mwenje  will continue,</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Mwenje): Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Before the House adjourned yesterday, I was saying that the tribunals proposed in the Bill will be of paramount importance. The tribunals should be given powers. This  is because a time will come when the tribunals will be required to call certain witnesses who will be required to give evidence before the tribunals. It is therefore important to give the tribunals powers to summon anybody whom they feel will give them important information related to whatever cases they will be handling. It is therefore important to give these tribunals powers to enable them to summon those whom they feel have useful information for the purposes of arbitration. At the same time it is important that a system be provided whereby they will be able to issue some kind of warrant to force those who have be  summoned to appear before the tribunal. We have also been told that there will be a register ox claims where all claims taken to the tribunal will be registered. The register should operate like a police Occurence Book.So, every claim   whether it is going to  be accepted or not and whether it will go through or not;   whether it is considered sensible or not should be entered in that register. The register should not be for those cases which somebody thinks have a chance of succeeding.  It should be a register where all cases brought forward to the tribunal will be registered a so that  nobody will in future say that he took his case to the tribunal and they refused to register or accept it;  All such cases should be listened to and accepted. The man at the counter should not have authority to decide whether a case qualifies to be listened to or not. All cases should be recorded and listened to so that everybody is giver, a fact hearing by the tribunal. Such cases should be recorded in the way they are brought forward, such that if my case is forwarded in the morning and another one an hour later, they are registered in sequence and heard on the basis of first come, first served. In this way, everybody will have a fair chance of being heard in time. When it comes to allocating hearing dates, this should be done on the same basis of first come, first served. The register to be maintained should never be tampered with by any clerk. There should a certain cadre of officers who can operate the register. When the register is full, it should be kept in the National Archives so that it may be used for many years to come.Mr. Speaker, Sir, it happens that we have the extended family. By nature, I cannot help to be biased when listening to the case of a relative. There is no guarantee that the tribunal elders themselves will not have their own cases to be heard. The Bill should take care of this aspect. If my brother has a case to be heard and I happen to be a member of the tribunal, how will such a case be handled? You cannot say that I am going to be fair or neutral. By nature, I will be biased. So, a provision should be made in this Bill to take care of this situation just as is the case in ordinary courts of law where a magistrate will not hear his brother's or relative's case. Such a magistrate is required to declare his interest in the case and abstain from hearing it. So, an amendment should be made in the Bill to cater for the interests of relatives of members of the tribunal. I have tried to look for this provision in the Bill, but I have not found it. Maybe we will be told when replying to the Bill how such cases will be taker, are of so that we do not fall into a trap when we come into the hearing of these cases. Mr. Speaker left the Chair   The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kubo) took the ChairI have noticed that some amendments are going to be made to the Bill, and I do not know whether it would be in order to mention.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY—GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Or. a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I beg your indulgence here. The Order Paper contains a notice of amendments, but it will be withdrawn and a fresh notice brought in due course.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Mwenje): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for the information given by the Attorney—General. I was getting a bit worried because I think the proposed amendments are insufficient. I hope that the fresh amendments to be proposed by the Attorney-General will take care of all the comments and views that have been aired by the various hon. Members who have spoken. The infrastructure  in this Bill should be taken care of early enough.As I said yesterday, land is one of the most important aspects of the African. I do not know whether this is the case in other parts of the world, but I would like to talk about the areas in which I feel competent. I know that land is a very important possession. So, when we deal with land cases, we should be very fair and careful. We have seen an example of some unscruplous directors of a land buying company decided to misuse their position to make the shareholders of the company pay money they were not supposed to pay. It is unfortunate that these directors clouded with lawyers. We have spoken a lot about lawyers in this country, and I have come to accept that we have many unscruplous lawyers.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in Embakasi we have the Embakasi Ranching Company has 16,000 acre farm and about 11,000  shareholders. This farm is during into quarter acre plots. Now, instead of the directors having the title deeds of these plots prepared in the names of the shareholders, they have deliberately prepared them in the name of the "Embakasi Handling Company  so that they  can  later transfer them to the shareholders at a fee. The transfer of the plots will involve lawyers . who are charging Shs.2000/- per quarter-acre plot; this means that for somebody who has 10 shares  each share is allocated one quarter acre plot  he will pay Shs.20,000/- legal fees to have the plots to transferred to his name. My simple calculation shows that the total legal fees payable by the shareholders is Shs.52 million. This is robbery without violence; I would expect lawyers to charge reasonable fee  for transfer- of a plot. Secondly, whether one is transferring one as 10-acre plot, the work involved is the same and  therefore,  one should a single legal fee figure. In this case, the shareholders are paying Shs.2,000/- per share because of connivance between the directors and the lawyers.It is in such situations that mwananchi feels that he is being explpited because he is the one who bought the land. I am glad that the Government  has now appointed a commission to look into the affairs of the Embakasi Ranching Company and I hope that this commission will stop what has been going on. Even if you are good lawyer and then you are given Shs.52 miliion, you become corrupt, forget your professionalism and simply look at the amount of money you are going to get.In fact, the question of land buying companies must be looked into; I wholly agree   with the Ministry's  directive that all land buying, companies should wind up by the end of this year.I hope the Attorney-General will appoint a liquidator to be in charge of those land buying companies which will not have completed allocating land to their shareholders by the end of   year. n such companies are allowed to ekist after 31.12.90 wananchi will feel   cheated and continue grumbling, The Ministry of Lands, Housing  and Physical Planning should   work in conduction with the Office of the Attorney-General to ensure that these companies, especially the Embakasi Ranching company, which has proved most unscrupulous,  do not exist after 31.12.90. Out of the 29 land buying companies only about five of them have allocated land to their members. I hope the Ministry will  ensure that the   others soon subdivide their land and allocated it to the members. Let  whoever wants to  continue being a chairman, be the chairman of his own plot  his wife can be the secretary and his children members.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in this City we have small businessmen who have been operating here. I want to thank his Excellency the President who yesterday went as far as having lunch in a  kiosko This showed that kiosks should not be condemned. I am glad that the Minister for Local Government has repeated that kiosks are here to stay and should never be condemned. All that we should  do is to position them in the right places to serve wananchi. We have said at any  one time said  that kiosks should be condemned.  But, unfortunately,  some officers in the City Commission tend to think that kiosks should be condemned. In some areas they have been demolishing  unnecessarily instead of advising the operator how to keep their kiosks clean.We accept that we do not need kiosks in the City centre  because we have hotels there. But operators in the suburbs of the City, industrial   area, and in estates should be given places for putting up kiosks  and to stay. This is because not all of us. can have meals at the Hilton Hotel; the common man has to eat his food in a kiosk. Now, the President himself had lunch in a kiosk, who else can condemn a kiosk I want to thank the President most sincerely for showing clearly that the common man must be catered for; that the small man should be allowed to do his business. In doing their big businesses, the big men should  live and let live by allowing the common man to do his business. I would like to appeal to the Minister for Local Government to ensure that no more demolitten of kioske takes place in the City. Proper planning should be done as that can be placed in the right places.I am glad that open air markers were  established in certain points in the City.	 personally the President buying bananas in one the markets  Umoja in my const money and I thank has very much for that. This shows that the President caters for all of us and that we should alsoremember the lower calibre persons so that they can do their businesses comfortably. I enjoyed eating one banana which was bought by the President and we were very grateful. The people of Embakasi and Industrial Area thank him most sincerely because he showed that he caters and cares for us. I am sure that the Minister for Local Government will reciprocate by telling the Nairobi City Commission to direct the people where to set up their businesses.We also thank the President for saying that Nairobi will soon be divided into municipalities to cater for the affairs of the commonman. The President's statement came at exactly the right  time and that the Minister for Local Government and the Attorney-General will come up with a Bill to ensure that these municipalities start working by next year, we hope that this will be done immediately. The time has come when the City cannot be controlled from City Hall.  That is why it becomes to render services to the residents of Dandcra, Dagoretti and other vast areas Time has come when services of the City should be decentralised and rave municipalities in. say, Emoakasi, Pagoretti and so on.  We shall support the Bill when it is brought to this House. When the wananchi heard this they were very grateful to the President.We have been talking of deteriorating services of the Mairoki City Commission and yet nothing has happened. He have now realised that the City is too big to be from one koliagramer. Where should several headquarters controlled from a major point. We have was these headquarters will be given the necessary authority when that time comes so that we can get the services. Hon. Members representing various parts of the city are very grateful that this time has come. We hope that the Attorney General will come up with a Bill very soon so that we can have these municipalities operational as soon as possible. We have a number of people in the city who still live head squatters. It is unformatted for people to remain squtters in their own country . the Mrunhu used to call them people living on other peoples land within Nairobi. This has necessitated some demolitions and it is pathetic because some of our people have been left homeless. It is evident as we have read about and it is there. It is pathetic. Something should now be done to settle the squatters. I would like to thank the Government form settling a number of squatters particularly in my constituency.For example, there are about 2,000 people living on other people's land in the Kukuru  area. These people were there since the inception of this world. These people were left there by the Maungu when he used to own  that land. They were also there when that land was bought by the Nairobi City Commission, where will they be taken? The Nairobi City Commission should look for alternative land and settle these people.  The time has come when   Nairobi should be expanded by, say, acquiring part of Kangundo and Athi River in order to settle some of these people. We should incorporate these areas in Nairobi. The question of squatters in Nairobi is not an easy issue. It should be looked into since most of our people would like to own some of the places where they live. It is important to give them settlement areas. I hope that this looked into.The other aspect in this Bill I do not know how much it has been taken care of is the question of land being charged to thanks. When our people borrow  money their land is charged to baris. For example. in some areas land is registered in the name of the eldest son in the family. I do not know whether banks will also be expected to be arbitrated by the same tribunals when there is a dispute or whether they will be expected to go to court. I do not know how banks have been taken care of in the case of land being charged to them. We have a lot of land that is charged to banks and we have witnessed many cases where banks want to sell land that is charged to them.We also have organisations like the Agricultural Finance Corporation which has land charged to them and they have interests which are  registered and recorded. Although.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kubo): Hon. Mwenje, I think you must have read the Bill. It is concerning itself with  unregistered trust  lands.

The Bill is not dealing with registered lands.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Mwenje): I do not know whether it me who is out of order or whether that is correct because I thought that the Bill was dealing with all agricultural land. Since all agricultural land is also registered, maybe, this is an area where the Attorney-General should clear the air as to what" lands the Bill is  concerning itself with. The Bill is talking about agricultural lands which are also registered. Since these lands are agricultural and are registered. I think that they are still covered by the Bill.</Newspeech>These are the same lands that are charged by the Agricultural Finance Corporation.<Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir, I thought in my marathon address when moving it Bill. I had done to what the hon. Member is talking about. With due respect to the Chair would like to say that the point at issue here is not challenging the title of land. I think hon. Mwenjo is talking about the title itself. Any dispute concerning with to the land will not come  under this Bill; it rust go to the high court. But anything to do with boundaries where for instance, a case of where land is registered in the name of the eldest son in the family as hon. Mwenje said  and he is deemed to be the trustee, the aggrieved party is entic hon. to go to the High Court. After adjudication the normal procedure of sub-division is followed.  we are now not dealing with the actual title.If you look at Clause 3 of the Bill, you will see where we are. Except land which is m an area.  declared to be an adjudication area. There is no title there.  This Act will not touch that area which is declared to be an adjudication area  because there is already   a system dealing with adjudication, consolidation and so on.But with the case of other agricultural land we must also. include land with title deeds but	the title deeds will not be a subject of a dispute. You can deal with	matters stated in clause three, but you cannot challenge that title deeds. The title deeds will have to go in the normal way to the high Court. How, with regards to the land which is mortgaged or charged, as you put it, to the bank the bank is holding the title deed but there could be disputes arising out of that land although the actual title deed is pledged to the bank. Now  those disputes will come and will be decided upon. Maybe members of that family are not satisfied that one brother should hold it. So, they must go to the land disputes tribunal and it is up on decision  by the tribunal to divide the land among the four brothers and. Then the usual machinery will follow, according to mutations, sub¬divisions and so on. That will be done in a normal manner. So; the disputes will be over and above the title deed The title deed  will not be a subject to a challenge. There will be a proviso to this section, namely, that this tribunal shall not have jurisdiction to disputes or to deal with matters related to titles.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AMD MARKETING (Mr. Mwenje): Sir, I believe now it is clearer to you and the House. In view of what the Attorney General has said, it is still likely that there can be a dispute over land. A case could go to the land disputed tribunal, say, where the land is still charged by the bank. If the land is owned by several brothers, for that matter, and one of them has charged the title deed with the bank and the dispute is to do with the boundary issue among them¬selves, yet  the valuation was done for the whole piece of land and it is for that reason the bank advanced the load.</Newspeech>then, if the land is subdivided, it will not  be  possible to do so because the bank still holds the title. They have to settle their disputes before the tribunal. Yet the title land is still held by the bank. Now in that case one bank still has an interest and the banks interest must be represented at the tribunal. This is quite a complex issue, out it is what I am trying to get at. So, where such a case arises and the bank needs to be represented in the tribunal and because the bank is an institution they will not be a party to the dispute, but they will be an interested party to the land. Therefore, their interest must be taken care of in the tribunal. So, how will their interest be taken care of? How will they come in? This is the question I was asking the Attorney- General. How will the Sill cover the interests of the banks so that we do not find a case where the tribunal is hearing a case on one end, trying to arbitrate between the family members and on the other end the bank is selling the whole piece of land altogether. It is very easy to get out of it. Once you know that we are going to the tribunal, then you rush to the bank. If the bank has got supreme powers over that piece of land, then the person with charges to the bank will have an upper hand in the matter.   He will simply ask the bank to sell the land. Simple! He will get away with it. So, the land disputes tribunal will have been rendered toothless.Sir, I am trying to look at a situation where if such a case arises, how will the bank's interests be represented.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr.Midika): On a point of order, sir, I do not want to with hon. Mwanje. I think he is raising a .very important issue, and if I may requestthe Chair, maybe the Attorney-General should give further clarification here. The argument is definitely they clear, as I can hear it,But then, the Attorney-General did  mention the jurisdiction of the tribunal and the Chair also said the  Jurisdiction of the tribunal covers only trust land. The confusion, therefore, as hon. the matter so  that we understand exactly what type of land will be referred to these land disputes tribunals so that our argument could make more sense.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli ): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me labour over the point again. I am not getting tired. It is quite a difficult Bill and I am glad that these points are being raised.Taking the points raised by hon. Mwenje, I would say that should there be a dispute  brothers, that is one way of deal¬ing with it. All of them should get together and redeem the land from the bank after that they can go ahead with the subdivision. There will be peculiar cases. There is no doubt about that, and we cannot cater for each and every case. There will be various cases. But as for the bank, I will give a little thought, with regards to what hon. Mwenje has raised.Now, as to what land will be dealt with, there is no question about that. There is no question that the tribunal is going to start and finish its work. All the land in the country will eventually be registered land under the Registered Land Act, or under the Titles Act when the exercise of consolidation or adjudication will have been completed in every part of Kenya. So, every land will be an agricultural lend being subjected over and above the title, disputes will arise.For example, a neighbour may wish to shift the boundary and encroach on a registered land. Now, hers, you are net challenge the title, but the action of your neighbour. I would like totake the matter to a tribunal winch can, if possible, decide on where the' boundary is bound to be, and if need be, we could then bring a man from the Survey Department. Now, this could have been avoided if every portion of land would be beaconed. But we know that it will take a long time to have every portion of land surrounded with beacons. So, from time to time, there will be greedy people encroaching over other people's land and. therefore, we are bound to have a way to retrieve or correct that sort of injustice. If you go to the High Court and say that hon. Makau has crossed my boundary, the High Court will not know that land  unless it visits that land, or it has some knowledge of now that sort o: boundary was fixed. If the Tribunal visits  the place and says. "You have lived here long enough. Where   do you think the boundary to Mr. Makau's clan was?". The elder  will be able to say where the boundary was and a decision by the Tribunal will have to be made.  That is the sort of dispute that we anticipate will be settled by the Tribunal. Other types of dispute  are related to trespass of land where people sight be squatting on land that does not belong to them. Somebody may say, I am not going to move out of this land. I save you Shs.2,000/- so that I can live on this land. So, unless the Tribunal comes into the case, definitely, there will be a fight. These are all disputes related to the working of land. There could be a case where land has been leased  under an agreement for several years and somebody may want to quash that agreement by notice. However, even after issuing a quit notice, somebody may refuse to move out. In such a case, you will not be dealing with the title  to that land, but with the working or contract to work on that land. There will be many case of this nature and they will continue to be there whether or not the land is registered under the Registered Land Act or under the Land Title Act in the case of land at the Coast.So, What I am trying to emphasize here is that this Tribunal will not be  seen to challenge the title to land. Vie know that the holder of any title to land is declared by law to be the absolute owner of that land and  the only place  you can go and object to this with a view to having that  title reversed or as cancelled, would be in the High Court of Kenya.  However, all other disputes that exists without touching the tile to land, shall be dealt with   by the Tribunal. In this way, a speedy decision would be made rather than having people from all ever the place going to  the High Court and hiring the services of advocates. That is the sort of  thing that the Tribunal will be trying to avoid. The basis of this Bill is  on agricultural land disputes which do not touch on the question of  challenging ownership of land In this case, I would eliminate any land that is under adjudication or where land has already been adjudicated. There is a Tribunal already set up by the  Actand this Tribunal  will the responsible for deciding on all matters related to land disputes, apart from disputes related to title to land.However, I would like to say that the point raised by hon. Mwenje is quite valid and this is why I thought I should clarify the resition and this has no doubt provoked more thinking regarding who aperation of the tribunal.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE:  On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,I would like to follow up the respond of the Attorney General regarding the point raised by hon. Mwenje. It has been said that the land registrar he has the powers to do this but if the parties concerned disagree, then he can file the case in the High Court. Would reach a case now be heard by the Land Disputes Tribunal or will they remain under the jurisdiction of the land registrars?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thought that is what I have been labouring on all along. The first place  to go where a boundary is challenged, is to the Tribunal, since this case would not be challenging the title to land. I thought I had covered that.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kubo): I think Mr. Malebe, in his point of order was asking the Attorney-General to explain whether after fees these Land Disputes 'Tribunals are set up, the provisions under the Register Land Act regarding land disputes are going to be overtaken by this new Act. I think that is the point Mr. Malebe was trying to raise.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, registered I know that Section 159 "the Registered Land Act deals with title to/land. Also under Titles Act, I know there is a provision gives the magistrate courts the powers to deal  with land disputes at the Coast Area. We are not dealing with this kind of land cut with agricultural land where disputes may arise regarding the working aspect of the land but net the title to the land. I would like to say that there is no provision in any  were land to in conflict with the enactment of this Bill. I have through their Actsseveral times myself and I cannot see any conflict in any of the provisions  unless somebody would like to point out were  such conflict is.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUREITHI: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I believe that Section 21 of the Registered Land Act makes specific reference boundary.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kubo):  You can continue, Mr. Mwenj  The point raised by Mr. Mureithi has beer, taken note of.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir, you can see what I was trying to get on at. With all due respect to all  the other Acts regarding land, there seems  to be a likelihood of some kind of overlapping with this particular Bill. We have the jurisdiction of the Registered Land .Act which could find itself engaged in cases which have already been dealt with by the Tribunal   but since the Attorney-General has said that he is going to look at this, I think I shall leave it at that. However, it is important to sake sure that the working of these tribunals will not be hindered by certain provisions in the existing land laws.Mr. Temporary deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like to know from the Attorney-General whether the tribunals themselves will be subject to injunction of the High Court of Kenya. I am saying this  because some-times when you are aggrieved in particular matters related to land, I do not know whether the High Court, having a much wider jurisdiction, will still have the powers to give an injunction to a Tribunal not to hear a case. I do not know    whether I should give the Attorney-General time to finish consulting with the Chair, because this point is very important and he should therefore address himself to it These are some of the problems that will face us when these tribunals start their actual work. It is.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>ME.

This is a very important Bill, and it is my belief that hon. Members have to understand its implications and what it really means for them to debate it properly and be able to pass it. It is a very important Bill, especially when we take in to account the fact that it is sort of repealing another law which has been operative all over. You will excuse me, Sir, because I am just trying to get some guidance for I feel confused.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I just want to look at the  definition of "land" here, and this is being now brought by the amendment</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Ignor that!</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Onyancha): Okay. Even if you  disregard the amendment by the Bill and not the normal amendment, it is said here that "land" means agricultural land as defined under Section 2 of the Land Control Act. I think we should now go to that Act, and I am feel¬ing confused because land, as defined in the Act. I think I should reorganize my points after looking at the definition.

So, I had better look at this definition before  I rash on a point of order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKAU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Now, having heard the confusion that every hon. Member seems to have found in this Bill, and also having noticed that the Attorney-General, is trying to tell us to ignore.  Something that comes to this House should not be ignored. When you look at the: definition of the  land that we are  supposed to debate here, that land does not exist because we are now restricted</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY—GENERAL (Mr. Muli): On a point of information, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER 	(Mr. Kubo): 	Hon. Muli, allow Mr. Makau to finish with his point of order and then you can inform him what you want.<Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MAKAU: 	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, going through this Bill, and looking at all the Acts that govern land in this country, and also looking at the definition of "land" that the tribunals are not going to be involved, then one is left with one major question unless the Bill is not defective. What land are we talking about that is going to be dealt with by these tribunals that we are setting up? All the land where problems are to be sorted out-is excluded. So, we are talking about some kind of vacuum land that does not exist. If youexclude all this land, then what are we talking about. We are Gassing a Billthat has nothing to be acted upon.<Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kubo): Order, hon. Makau: The Billis very clear in that it talks about agricultural land. So, I will take it thatthat is the intention of the Bill: all agricultural land.<Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKAU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. How do you define agricultural land?  There is agricultural land that has title deed. Indeed, most of the agricultural land has title deeds and is registered.What other agricultural land are we talking about? What I am saying is thatwhen you define the land as agricultural land, we have agricultural land thatis registered and that has title deed.<Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kubo): Order, hon. Makau. You arenow giving your opinion, but it is very clear here that we are talking aboutagricultural land which is defined under the Land Control Act. So, what youare giving is your opinion. Therefore, we are going to assume that this Billregards all the agricultural land in this country.<Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): On a point of information, Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I wish to inform hon. Makau that that amendmentslipped through my office without my seeing it, and it is already withdrawn, or we have already said that it is going to be withdrawn. Perhaps there will beother amendments that may not deal with agricultural land. Agricultural and may be Government land, trust land, Mazrui land or all sorts of land. But thetribunals will not deal with titles to any of those parties those problems are over that title.<Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MAKAU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. In view of that,then, when you look at the Bill and all what is in these papers and then lookat this area whereby the inclusion of land  Since this paper has not beenwithdrawn from this House  I mean, this amending Clause. Could you rule thatthe amendment be withdrawn since we have been reading it all through? Legally,when-</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER	(Mr. Kubo):	Order, Mr. Makau.	TheAttorney-General has already explained that he has already withdrawn those amendments.	In any case, they have not been tabled before the House and, therefore,they are not the property of this House as of now.	So, we can go on with theBill as it is.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: 	On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Although the definition of "agricultural land" has been brought, we know that we have what we term as the Indian Transfer of Property Act, and even that law talks of agricultural land.	Even today that law is affecting our Land ControlBoard Act.	So, will this Bill be able to touch on the Indian Transfer ofProperty Act which is a law which should not be used in this country at all? I am sure that when the implementation of the Bill we are discussing now comes into effect, it will also be touching on the Indians whereby they can come in and even decree levy distress without going to the land disputes tribunals?</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER	(Mr. Kubo):	Order.	Mr. Malebe,I 	think you should confine yourself to what is contained in the Bill. You are already into arguments and there are no arguments here. The question here is that the Land Disputes Tribunals are going to deal with all agricultural land as defined in the Land Control Act. That is what is before us and we will only discuss that.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING 	(Mr. Mwenje): Mr.	Temporary Deputy	Speaker, the points of order that have beenraised here mean that there are still some issues that need to be dealt withso that the Bill can be smoothened.	The Bill does not cover all the areasthat it ought to cover.	When I started contributing yesterday,  I madethat remark on the further amendment to the Bill and the Attorney-General clarified that no such amendments were forthcoming and that we should ignore any such successions because they are not incorporated in the Bill. So, as far as we are concerned, our debate covers only what appears in the Bill before us. That clarification by the Attorney-General still leaves the Bill wanting because the Bill still requires to cover much more than is the case now.	There are a lot of loopholes that could be used.	As theland disputes tribunals will be operating like courts, we know that we havevery many urgent land cases.	Previously we have been utilising the courtsfor such disputes	and where a case has been of urgent nature, people havehad to run to the court to get an injunction, or such a court decision. 	We would like to know, with the introduction of the tribunals, and knowing that the powers of the High Court will still be operational, if one, after a judgement by the tribunal will be permitted to go  to the High Court to get an injunction and serve it on the tribunal. This is because the tribunal may adjudicate on a case that touches on other pertinent issues. So, one may wish to have an injunction from the High Court so that thetribunal does not hear that case for the reasons that I cannot cite here.  So, Sir, those are some of the things that are actually running in our minds on the Bill and which makes us believe that it still leaves a lot to be desired; a lot to be tackled before it is passed. It is our hope that the Attorney-General will have time to go back and ponder on some of the proposals we are making so that we can have them incorporated in the Bill. Some of us are not lawyers but, apparently, I can see some learned friends here getting muddled up about the whole operation of the Bill. they also appear confused. Therefore, that is an indication thatthere is still a bit of homework to be done before we can pass this Bill.Sir, some of these problems are created simply because our ownpeople have not come to appreciate that the time has come when Africansmust start writing their own wills.	There is still that old belief thatwhen an African writes a will, he is about to die.	We have to teach ourpeople to forget that brainwashing on the writing of the wills because, when a will is written,  it helps to solve a lot of problems for the future generation. Most of the present land disputes have arisen because the owners of the lands did not write wills for the sons and daughters who have to inherit such land. 	Because there is nobody to make decisions after such a man has died,  there arises disputes on how the estate of the deceased will be divided. I think it is time even hon. Members, when addressing barazas and meetings in the constituencies, started telling the people to write wills and keep them either in banks, in trust, in mosques or wherever they may wish so that they can assist the inheritors of their estates when one has died. There will be less land disputes if people agree to be writing wills. On formation,  the land tribunals must be seen to be working because we mau come to find ourselves in a situation where we take cases to be adjudicated by the tribunals and, at the end of the day, those cases end up before the judges in the High Court. We must have the kind of integrity in the   members of the tribunals so that they are seen to be effective, able to solve the disputes and assist those with problems. This is because we will expect those appointed to have integrity and so that those who have land cases can respect he tribunals and realise that even if they take their cases co the High Court, after being adjudicated by the tribunals, the decisions will be likely to be upheld. We know that there is the provision for hearing of appeals and I think we should have fair judgements.	This is	why there must be anallowance paid to the elders of these tribunals so that they are noteasily corrupted by the rich individuals who will possibly get involvedin land disputes.	It has been seen before and such corruption will heruled out if the elders are paid an appropriate allowance.	It is up tothe Government, when the Bill has been passed, to make a decision on the amount of money that will be spent on such allowances. 	If the people who have land cases were prepared in the first place to contribute some money to pay those elders, even now there will be no harm in their paying a small amount when they register their cases. In that manner, the Government can earn some little revenue to be able to run the tribunals, instead of going back to the Exchequer for financial allocation. 	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is important for us to know the amount of expenditure that this Bill is likely to incur so that it can be worked out properly. The tribunals cannot simply work at the district level and I feel very strongly that they also need to operate from the divisional levels, too. In some areas, because we still have magistrate courts at divisional levels, there is no reason why we should not have the tribunals at that divisional level, too.  	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I say this because somebody who lives in Kangema, for instance, will find it very difficult to handle a case of person who lives in kandara	because he may not know the history of that area.	The tribunal mayhave the leeway to call the elders who know the history of that area but let me state that we can only succeed if we go to the divisional level.  There is no way the tribunals are going to succeed at the district level. 	It will not be easy for a tribunal to hear cases in a  vast district like Machakos which borders Nairobi and stretches up to Kibwezi. It is impossible to know who owned land in kangudo or Tala.  The tribunals cannot operate in that w 	So, I feel strongly that the domicile areas should be the divisions; that is where the tribunal should operate from because then and only then it can be effective. Otherwise the operations of these tribunals are going to be very cumbersome.  They will operate like magistrates' courts which depend on facts of law rather a than on the facts of the traditions which are supposed to be upheld in this Bill Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have much to say on this Bill but I will say more after the bill has been amended.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: 	On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.  From what hon. Members have said, this Bill is sketchly drafted and it is not very clear.  Since this Bill is going to affect a lot of land laws in this country - including the Indian Transfer of Property Act and the Land Control - I feel that the Attorney-General should accept to defer the debate en this  Bill and go back and study the 	Bill keenly and perhaps re-draft it I say this because if it is passed, the Bill is a going to affect the whole country.

So, do not accept that judgement. But I wouldalso suggest that if hon.

This  Bill  is  very  important  especially when werecollect  that a similar Bill, the Magistrates  Courts  JurisdictionBill was passed in this house in 1981 establishing thesepanels  of elders  to hear land  cases. However, these  panels of  elders  have  not  worked. I believe that  is reason  why weare trying to enact  another law to remove the  problem thatbeset  those  panels  of elders.   When  hon.  Malebe raised this issue,was  it  in order  for the  Attorney-General  to stand upimmediately before the  other  issue  was resolved? Was that  in  order?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPOARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kubo): Yes.  it was inorder because  no  other hon. Member  stood up  to  support  hon.

MAKAU:	On  a point  of  order,  Mr. Temporary DeputySpeaker, Sir. The  Standing Orders  of this  House  are veryClear.   The  issue here  is not  the complete withdrawal of the Bill. I say this because Standing Order No.102  governs the Second Reading of a Bill.	The  intention is  to give the Mover of theBill more  time to go  and  examine the Bill.   Probably we can suspend the debate  on this Bill and  select a few people as the Attorney-General has  suggested,  to  sort  out this problem.   These are little  matters  and there  is no need to withdraw the Thisshould be done lit under Standing Order	No.102.	If we do  it underStanding Order No. 21(1)  it will give a very bad impression.  I say this because under Standing Order No.102 we can suspend the debate to  enable  the  Attorney-General  to  improve  on whatever needs to improved.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kubo): That is true, Mr. Makau,but, on the other hand, is the duty of hon. Members to be alert so that whenone them raises a point of order, the others can support him. There must be aseconder to every Motion. So, the Attorney General was quite in order to standup and express his views. If there is a problem in the definitions here, it isquite in order for him to ask to be given time to study it carefully. It is onlythe Mover who can ask to be given such time. As far as I am concerned, he hasnot done this. So, I presume we will go back to square one so that Mr. Mwenjemay continue to make his contribution.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI: 	On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The majority of us, especially Back-benchers, agree that this is a very important Bill. When the Attorney-General was addressing the House a few minutes ago, somehow he expressed fear that he might get the Bill redrafted so that we may reject it later. 	I can assure him that this is not the idea. 	We all want to pass this Bill, but it is very crucial to have the Bill properly drafted so that hon. Members discuss it fully understanding what the Bill really implies. Nobody has the motive of rejecting the Bill because we all need it dearly.</Newspeech> The Temporary Deputy Speaker 	(Mr. Kubo) left the ChairMr. Speaker took the Chair<Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point raisedon the question of drafting the Bill is quite unacceptable by me because thehon. Member has not pointed out any defect in the drafting of this Bill. I didnot at any time suggest that I was going to draft another Bill. All I said wasthat I would like to hear as many views of the House as possible. I have officershere taking notes of hon. Members' contributions, and I will reply to the Bill as much as possible.  I would like to suggest that over the weekend or any other day, I am be able to assemble hon. Members in Conference Room No. 7,  Parliament Buildings, so that we may go through the Bill unless the House suspends this move and appoints a special committee for the purpose, which I would accept. Wecould suspend debate on the Bill and appoint a committee to assist in draftingthe Bill. However,  I would like to get more views than just getting down to making amendments to the Bill. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE:  On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  My intention on moving that we adjourn further debate on this Bill is quite clear to hon. Members. The Attorney-General stood up here and withdrew the amendments whose notice is given in the Order Paper because they were contradictory to the drafted Bill, and this alone is a good reason as to why we should not continue to debate the Bill until the Attorney-General goes back to his office and makes more amendments to the Bill. Some hon. Members do not even understand the Bill as it now standsbecause it contradicts other laws. So, I still request to be allowed to movemy Motion because I am sure I will be supported. If the Motion fails,  that willbe all right, but the Chair should allow the Motion to be voted on.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER:  Order, Mr. Malebe!  That is completely unacceptable. I would like to see the House discuss the Bill as it is.  If there any amendments to be made, they can be brought up later.</Newspeech> (Applause) <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING 	(Mr. Mwenje): Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I would like to agree with the ruling of the Chair because I still feel that it is too early to decide that the Attorney-General should go back and redraft the Bill. After all, why do we discuss a Bill? We do so .so that all the good points raised may be taken by the Attorney-General and incorporate them in his amendments. The Attorney-General has clearly said here that he is willing to bring up other amendments because the amendments whose notice has given in today's Order Paper were inadequate. There are certain shortcomings' in the present Bill and other areas that have not been covered which would hitch the operation of the tribunals if they operate within the limitation of the Bill as it now is. The views that we have or are going togive should be incorporated. I expect the Bill to be much bigger than it nowis. The Bill may contradict various laws but, being a lawyer, the Attorney-Generalwill definitely look into this situation and rectify it. Of course, we will havetime to criticise the Bill even after amendments have been made to it. If we still feel that the amended Bill is inadequate, we will say so. It has been proved this afternoon that land matters cannot be taken lightly. Brothers have been seen killing one another due to land disputes. So,nobody is going to play about with a Bill touching on land disputes. I am gladthat all of us seem to agree on this fact. The Attorney-General may go aheadand call us into Conference Room No. 7, Parliament Buildings, or any other room so that We may assist him when it h comes necessary. We do not want to see a Bill that will cause more confusion, but one that will help us to solve our problems.	So, the integrity of tribunal members should be very high because theywill have to make very important decisions.	These members should be paid someallowance.	Nobody should go there thinking that he could have made his dailybread in another place and that this has been interfered with by appointing him a member of the tribunals. Let members of the tribunals be paid fair allowances to compensate them for whatever earnings they will lose by sitting on the tribunals. These people will be hearing these cases continuously in that each man will be a chairman of a certain-case at a given time and, therefore,  they will spend quite a lot of their time in the The premises where the tribunals will operate are also infrastructures which need to be looked into.	Will they beoperating at the magistrates. courts or in halls?	Where are theygoing to operate?	These are important areas which will certainlycost the Government quite a lot of money.	That is why I suggestedthat those involved in these cases need to contribute to the wellbeing of the tribunal elders at whatever costs that will be incurred to enable them to arbitrate freely. If the suggestion of putting them in the districts was simply because of financial restrictions, then, I,  feel,  that should not be a problem at all. If there is some amount of contribution that will be done by those to be arbitrated then it will cover whatever the Government will spend to make sure that these people are placed in good places. There is no way, and I repeat that tribunals are going to operate from the district level. In my view, this is going to be very difficult because it will also cost those to be arbitrated quite a lot of money, if they have to go to the district headquarters. They will certainly not get their judgement because those fellows will not have know what is happening at the divisional level. If the fear of that is because of the financial constraints then, that should be covered by those who are supposed to be adjudged. They should be willing to contribute a certain amount so that they can cover whatever is going to be spent by these people.Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  I have said quite a bit and,  I therefore 	, expect, whatever hon. Mahihu said  which 	still view was important will be taken into account.   Particularly, he did say that the provincial administrator certainlycannot become the chairman of the appeal court".	This is because	he will never have time and cases will take a very long timeif they are left to the provincial commissioners to hear them. 	 We know that they are very busy people and so if they are appointed the 	Chairman it is going to be very difficult.	They can be made members of that Appeal	Tribunal Board,  but they should not be the chairmen,  because it means they will never convene the tribunals made because they will never	have time. However, they can sit there as eitherex-officio members or official, members.	In my opinion, they	should not sit there as chairmen because they will hardly be ableto convene the appeal tribunal	and it might take even longer thanit used to take when it was being heard by the High Court or even by the Court of Appeal. Mr. Speaker, Sir,  hoping that all these views will be taken into consideration by the Attorney-General when he brings the amendments, then, I beg to support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION (Mr. Munvi) : 	Thank you very much, Mr.  Speaker, Sir. I am going to give a very short speech on this very important Bill. 	I would like to inform the Attorney-General that he has done very well in that he has brought this Bill at the right time. We have been looking forward to a day when the elders can be honoured in dealing with land cases. I would	1ike to tell this house that we have very brilliant andHonest people in the countryside who can do a good job as far as fairness is concerned. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to tell the Attorney-General that these tribunals Should operate at the lowest ad7inistrative levels possible. For instance, the tribunals can be sitting in divisional or locational headquarters instead of at district headquarters. This will enable many People with land disputes to have them easily settled. As Hon. Mwenje has just said, every day we read in the newspapers about murder cases and suicides tame arising from land  disputes; matters connected with land adjudication or land problems.In my area, I see wananchi who have been misled by conmen intosurrendering their title deeds to them and as a result they have losttheir land. Those who have tried to file cases against those whotook their land have been told that in accordance with the provisions of the Land Adjudication Act, they are time-barred. Even recently,  there was a land dispute in Tharaka and the surrounding areas. The only way of solving this problem is for the Attorney-General to listen to the views of the hon. Members.  In appointing elders to these tribunals we should not look at the standard of education, what should matter is influence, honesty and contribution to the people's well-being in one's area. Even in the appointment of chiefs we have been told in this House that it is not educational qualifications, but social acceptability, that natters. Even if somebody is 70 years old he should be appointed to thesetribunals. After all he has a wealth of inherited experience in land matters.   Mr. Temporary Deputy Sneaker, Sir, when I talk of appointment of men to these tribunals I also include women. We   have already seen that where women have been appointed to land tribunals they have proved to be better than most of the men. Thisis because they look after children and know the  usefulness of land. I would appeal to hon. Members to suggest moreamendments to this Bill for the Attorney-General's consideration. Although he Attorney-General himself has left the Chamber  I can see officers from his office taking noted of what we are saying.I am sure that if the Attorney-General incorporates the suggestions we are making into this Bill everything will be all right.Let me also say that 1Pnd natters are very sensitiveEverywhere. For example, when Namibia attained Independence it had to start redistributing the land, which had been grabbed bythe colonialists, to its people. It is also mainly due the landissue that Mr. Mandela is fighting whites in South Africa. InSouth Africa,  just like in Kenya where the best land was taken awayfrom Africans and named ""White Highlands”, the best land has beentaken away from Africans by the whites. The spree tiling happened in Zimbabwe and. Zambia.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION (Mr. Munyi): Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think we should see to it that land issues are dealt with by the indigenous people; Kenyans themselves.  These are the people who are Africans in origin and they know the problems of land more in the country. This is a very important issue and I would not like tosupport what a colleague was saving that we should have another Bill insteadof this one. What should happen is-that we should have some amendments to thisBill as it is a good one. I thank the Attorney-General for having introducedit to the House. With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Onyancha): 	(Mr. Onyancha): Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 	I stand to support this Bill. 	The intention of this Bill is substantively to separate the provisions which are -provided by the amendments of the Magistrates (?) Jurisdiction (Amendment) Act of 1981 to a separate Act, which would carry the effects of those amendments and, probably,  introduce a few more provisions to make the Act work properly. When those amendments brought in 	1981 came in, the intention was that the law should be provided to take away the jurisdiction and powers of the magistrate courts to hear and determine land disputes. 	It was then felt that, probably,  due to the inexperience of many magistrates, at that particular time, and considering the manner in which they were considering the land cases, it was felt that justice would be better served if that jurisdiction was taken away from them and given to elders in our communities who understood -</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKAU: 	On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. If I heard the Assistant Minister well, he said that the magistrates appears to be inexperienced. Is it in order for him to say that? 	I do not think the Magistrates Jurisdiction  (Amendment) Act of 	1981 came as a result of inexperience on the part of magistrates.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: 	Mr. Makau, you will please wait until you catch the Speaker's Eye.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT 	(Mr. Onyancha): Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 	As I said, it was then felt that elders from our community who live amongst our people and who were taking care of the agricultural land being tilled and taken care of by the community would be in a better position to understand the people's rights and, probably, determine,in a better way, what their rights should be. They were found to bebetter than the magistrates courts. So, the amendments brought took awaythe jurisdiction of the magistrates'  courts. It was also understood that, probably, lawyers who were practising and,  also dealing with land were taking advantage of their legal knowledge to effect decisions which were not fair to the parties involved, So thatamendment took away the powers and jurisdiction of those courts. This Billintends to be an independent one, Specifying those provisions. In this Billland is defined as agricultural land, as defined in Section  2 of the Land Control Act.  If the definition of land is looked up in the Land Control Act,  it will be seen, in effect, that the jurisdiction of this Bill will only touch all land that is mainly agricultural and will exclude land that will be in towns and urban areas. So, strictly, land as defined under this Bill will mean all agricultural land in the country, apart from the exceptions I have indicated.Sir,  this will,  therefore, also mean that the provisions of this Act will also affect land which has already been taken care of by other legislation touching on land in Kenya, and there are many of such legislations. It is very important while we are debating or this Bill for this House to understand that there are various legislations touching on land in Kenya, particularly agricultural land. These legislations,  in many cases have defined proprietary rights,  interests in land which is registered under those various legislations. It is, therefore,  important,  that for this Bill to operate properly, and to achieve the intended intentions,  it has to take care of the provisions and effects of the law as provided under those other legislations dealing with agricultural land. 	If it does not, then it will not be operating properly when it is passed. 	I wish to  submit that for this Bill to operate properly,  as we expect that it till,  it has to take into account provisions of other land legislation in Kenya;  interests created by those other legislations and the manner they are now being applied; used by the citizens of this country. By so saying,  let me cite an example of the Registered Land Act, Cap. 300. 	Section 21 of that Act has provisions which allow for certain land disputes to be taken care of. There is a procedure under that Act,  in the various sections, which provides for certain disputes to be taken care of. For this Bill, therefore, to work properly, Sir, it should take into account the provisions like those I have indicated so that there is no indication and contradiction of our own laws when they operate together, they must operate in such a manner that it is easy to interpret them without contradiction.So, it is my submission. Sir, that the attorney- General will look into that. In fact, he had already promised to that, am I glad that he is willing to give everybody a chance in this house to give views that will help him correct anything that arises in this Act that may make it difficult to operate later on and also to accept their additional views that are going to make this bill work properly.Sir, I now wish to look at the provisions of the Bill. There are one or two provisions of the Bill that I wish to comment upon. Clause 3(5) states, and I quote:-“Each party upon whom a claim is several shall, unless the claim is admitted, within ninety days after service, file with the tribunal an answer containing a reply to the matters stated in the claim and a summary of the facts upon which he wishes to reply”.This means that when one party has filed a case someone should be prepared. The summons should be served on the interested party, and then it provides that if the other party is required to react, it can file its defence within 90 days. My comment is that 90 days is a long period. In fact, it is three months. If the defendant has been served with summons, he would probably wish to react quickly as possible so that justice can be seen to be done. In fact, it is said that “justice delayed is justice denied”. So, if the defending party has been served with summons, it should not take 90 days for him to file   His papers. I also note that three are similar provisions under the provisions providing for appeal, and I am submitting that period should be lessened a little. If the defending party has been served with papers, he should probably be required to file his defence within, say, 30 days so that the Process for	adjudicating lend oases should be quick enough so that justice is not delayed. So, I  Submit that that clause should be locked into and the period shorted a little so that the process can be a little quicker. Sir, Clause	3	(7) states, and I quote:-Tribunal shall adjudicate upon 	the claim a decision in accordance with recognized law, after hearing the parties to the dispute,-“ This Bill is stating that the Tribunal's jurisdiction is only going to be based on customary law.	Does it mean, therefore, that the Tribunal will not adjudicate on any provision thatare provided under any legislation already existing touching on land matters? 	if it does, then that clause would seriously curtail the operation of disputes. In fact, it would mean that we should ask how much of customary law does exist today in Kenya? A lot of land today is now registered in various areas of Kenya. Land is registered under various, Acts of parliament and interest in land has been defined or protected in accordance with that legislation.	Now, what is going to happen, say, under theRegistered Land Act which is supposed to be a complete Act? 	This is the definite and final Act on land registered under it.	All theinterests are defined under it.	Even  boundaries, are also defined.It is said in one section that after a title has been registered under that Act, it cannot be questioned anywhere in the court of law.	Are the Tribunals now going tri be involved with jurisdictionto open up cases which have been determined under the registered Land Act or other laws? Is this Bill going to give Tribunals or elders powers to open up  any disputes that are arising under those provisions?  Those are the questions that I am Putting across To the Attorney-General so that he can lock at them and then he can find a way of reducing contradictions in operations of this law hereafter when this Bill has been passed. Sir, I also note under the provisions of this Bill that the appeals tribunal is going to operate in such a manner that it appears to me to be a very professional manner. In other words, it is going to operate as if it was under the Civil Procedure. In fact, it has been so indicated. Is this good when we know that the members of those Tribunals are not going to be lawyers? they may not be conversed with the operations of the Civil Procedure law. 	So, I suggest that the procedure of the appeals tribunal should not be so strict as if-it is the under Civil Procedure when the members of the tribunal may be ordinary members of the society who are not professional.	For example, it would appear that whenthe appellant the man who has appealed has put his case to thetribunal, the respondent who is the defendant, will respond and then the appellant may, if he has any new issue, raise the matter. That is strictly professional. So, I am making this suggestion to the Attorney-General to think whether this is very necessary, or whether the procedure should be lessened a bit not to make it   too loose but 	make it a little loose so that these tribunals can operate freely.   Even if this is done at the end of the hearing, the tribunal should beable to give that person a hearing.	I trying to say that the tribunalshould act strictly and provisional.	Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is also the point of the provincialcommissioner becoming the chairman of the appeals tribunal.	As we all know,	the district commissioner is a very busy person to be able to head this appeals tribunal. Therefore, unless there is a Provision under this Act in which theprovincial commissioner would have the Powers to delegate his Powers, then I 	think  something should done. 	If there is such a provision, then it means that when the provincial commissioner is too busy to attend the appeals tribunal, he would send his deputy to represent him. 	Otherwise, it is my 	feeling that the provincial commissioner will not have the time to chair these meetings. If nothing is done about this, it means that this appeals tribunal will be forced to adjourn most of the times due to the absence of the provincial commissioner. Therefore, I would like to urge the Attorney-General to reconsider amending this Provision so that if the provincial commissioner has to be the chairman, then he is given the powers to delegate his powers to somebody else. Mr. Speaker, Sir, looking Quickly through this Bill, one tends to feel that	this Bill does not specifically take regard of other provisionsof land laws in this country.	For this reason, I would like to appeal to theAttorney-General to thoroughly consider the implications of this 	Bill in relation to the existing land laws in this country. 	I am saying this because we do not want to enact this law today, only for it to become a obsolete tomorrow. Secondly, perhaps the Attorney-General could tell us what will happen to cases that are pending in different tribunals.	There is no provision in this Billregarding these cases and I would like to ask the Attorney-General to		make a provision here to incorporate the question of these Pending cases so  that these cases are provided  or under this Bill. 	 Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, 	Sir. This Bill is also silent on the   question of having a lawyer in the tribunal.	When the original amendment tothe Bill was brought, it was intended to remove the representation of lawyers  in these tribunals and I think the Attorney-General id should reconsiderthis Point so that we do not go to these tribunals and then	start arguingamongst ourselves as to whether we need lawyers or not.	if lawyers aregoing to be allowed to go to the tribunals, then a provisions should be madeto provide for this.	if not, then should be clearly started inthe 	Bj11 so that we do not have any disputes later regarding this situation. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as It exists today, the Magistrates Jurisdiction Amendment Act, has given room to parties to re-open issues on cases which have been already decided before, either in the court of law or in other tribunals through arbitration.	Throughthis Act, elders feel free to re-open issues and re-discuss them and then made new decision when they 	happen to have been decided upon. This is not a very good situation because it reopens old cases which means eventually, we shall end up having so many cases unnecessarily coming up. Perhaps this Bill should be able to provide for this so that it makes it clear That once a case has been decided by a court or a tribunal, it should notbe reopened by	these new tribunals.Finally, 	I would like to thank the Attorney-General for brining this Bill to the House which will operate independently of the other 	 land Acts.	I would like him to	free 	to listen to everybody,lawyers, accountants, and so on so that everybody's views are taken into consideration according to the procedures of this House so that we can finally come out with a good Bill which is going to help our people. 	with those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MAKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you very much for giving me chance to contribute to this Bill.	I would like to say straightenedthat if there is any Bi11 that has  generated a lot of debate in this	House, isthe Land Disputes Tribunals Bill.	If you look at the magistrates jurisdiction Act of 1981, which is being repealed by this Bill, you would  	whetherthose who had passed this Bill considered the 	that	time with regard to the settlement of land inputs.	I am saying	this because  the object of the Bill is very clear, namely to re-enact the provisions of the magistrates jurisdiction amendment Act of 1981 which provided that certain disputes relatin2 to land shall be heard by panel of elders instead ofsub-ordinate courts.	when the	Attorney-general was moving this Bill, he madeit very clear that the reasons for bringing this 	Bi11 here is because the Previous  legislation  was found to have had a lot of loopholes which brought about corruption and frauds. 	Therefore, it is important that we look at this Bill critically so that we do not have another Attorney-General coming here and saying that this Bill was rushed through. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if you look at	what is happeningnow especially in my constituency, you would find out that	what this	Billis talking about is nothing new. We still have panels of elders still dealing with land cases and that this Bill is now trying to do is to remove those elders from the villages and taking them to the districts. So, in areas where title deeds have not been issued, for example in Mbooni Constituency, the district officer together with these elders are still hearing cases. 	 These elders are from the local area and therefore, they 	know the area very well. When you	say	that the district commissioner will a point four or five peopleas elders, I am imagining a district-like Machakos with	10 divisions.	You mayend up getting some elders who might not even know		There are some peoplein a place like Kibwezi who know nothing about Mbooni Division.

With due respect to hon.Makau, those allegations are very serious against members of the civil Service. Unless he has specific cases which he can bring forward substantively, the hon.

MAKAU: 	Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am saying that because initially, when the Attorney-General was moving this Bill and he is the government legal adviser said that the reason for bringing this Bill was to stop the corruption and fraud that were there previously to be sorted out.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS:	Hear!	Hear!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKAU:	Do I have to be called upon to substantiate what I havesaid when the legal advisor to the Government admitted that there was corruption? Hon. Onyancha is a lawyer and he knows that.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: 	Order, hon. Makau. 	Are you probably suggesting that, maybe, there were some civil servants who were receiving money before they participated in land arbitration?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MAKAU:	No, Mr. Speaker,  I am not saying that.	What I am sayingis that some money was being paid because some civil servants would say that therewas no fuel and such things.	I am further suggesting that we need this Billto specify the remunerations for these elders so that-	The very good districtofficers come and ask for less money and then the people think that they are better than those who had been there previously. So, what I am asking is for the Attorney-General to put a provision for remuneration if the elders are going to do this work.	After all, they are always paid. What is very embarrassingis to keep on talking about elders even during the census.	They always wantto be given something and they are told that because of their wisdom		Becauseof inflation, today nobody is going to do something for free however good he may be. So, in order to avoid corruption and fraud that may come, he should specify what amount of money these elders should be given. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, another thing that the Attorney-General tried to explain here is the question of age factor. 	I do not understand why he should talk of age when it is not talked of in the Bill.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL	(Mr. Muli):	Are you sure?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKAU:	Yes.	The Bill should specify who is an elder because whois an elder depends from one ethnic group to another.</Newspeech>  .   <Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Mull):	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,I have listened to hon. Makau, and he has Lade three points which are derailingthe Bill.	I think the best way is, although I am interrupting him, to respondso that if there are any more points they can be raised as we go along.The first point I wish to respond to is the last one he made.	I donot know whether he has read the definition of elder in the Bill.	If I may readit,  the	Bill says:An "elder" means persons from the community or communities to which the parties by whom the issue is raised belong and who are recognised by custom in the community or communities as being, by virtue. of age, experience or otherwise competent to resolve issue between that party".Perhaps hon. Makau overlooked that.The second point was raised by three hon. Members who spoke beforehon. Makau and, perhaps, in order to get some more bullets, I may wish to explain.the operation of the tribunal.	The tribunal will be constituted from a listof members gazetted for the district.	In the event that there is a dispute atdivisional or locational level it must be somewhere within the district  theappointer and I am avoiding to mention the district commissioner because wemay consider otherwise as we go along will appoint not only one person topreside over throughout the district.	He can appoint, out of the gazetted list,elders with a chairman to sit where it is convenient.	If it is Mbooni,  it islikely that someone nearer there with elders from there and elsewhere will formthe panel and may sit at the divisional headquarters. And there will be, withinthe district, more than one tribunal, which is only one tribunal but sitting</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE:	On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL	(Mr. Muli):	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,I was on a point of information and I had just finished what I was saying.	And,by the way, if you look at Clause 9, it gives room where the rules of operationwill be made.	Some rules deal with financing, procedure and renumberations inorder to make the Bill operational.	thank you, Sir.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. MALEBE:	On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. My point oforder is that the Bill itself, as I said before, is sketchy and does not give the clarification we are row getting from the Attorney-General.	Whatthe Attorney-General is clarifying is		not to be found anywhere in the Bill.In that case, I think the Attorney-General should go  back and look into that aspect properly so that when we come to  debate on the Bill next week, he will have all the necessary amendments to be incorporated into the Bill. The suggestions by the Attorney-General, while he is defining the Bill, should be incorporated in the Bill.	I think we are all agreed,  includingthe Attorney-General,  that there is room for amendments in the Bill.	Ithink,  therefore,  the Attorney-General call give us time	now so that hecan take more notes on the explanations needed at a later stage.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER:	Order.	It is not for the benefit of the Attorney-General, but for hon. Members.	You have to get ready with your amendmentsso that when we move to the Committee Stage you will be able to introduce those amendments.	We are most willing that they are debated and discussedin the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKAU:	Mr. Speaker, Sir, with your ruling,  I now think hon.Members are coming to terms with what a Bill needs to be.	It is broughthere for us to make suggestions and the mover takes them	to amend themBill accordingly. Now, continuing with my debate, I was talking about the elders remunerations. 	Let me touch on an additional area of the tribunal, which is that the committees of the tribunal will be using the traditional law. That is very acceptable.	However, there are some areas where there may not	be any customary law.	This is because of movement of people.	There areplaces like Shimba Hills and even Mombasa. it might he difficult to define customary law. 	What I am suggesting here is that 	in the place of the customary law -</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR-INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING	(Mr. Nassir):Jambo  la nidhamu, Bw.

MEMBER:	Is that a valid point of order?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  SPEAKER:	Yes, I am satisfied that that is a valid point of order.Hon.  Nassir is saying that it is the totality of all the customs of the people that binds them in that area. There are Kikuyus, Kalenjin and so on and they have customs that are of African custom.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MAKAU: 	All right, Mr. Speaker, I agree that there is Kenyan customary law. The other area that the Bill touches on is the question of the appeal tribunals, headed by provincial commissioners. 	There is a difficulty in this case, and it has also been highlighted by hon. Onyancha, who is a lawyer, that when it comes to the appeals, and the customary laws have been applied in the tribunals,  if you have to go to the provincial commissioner, that office will promote a grouping and it will not	assist	in the customary law application.What law are they going to  use?	If you are appealing, you have to use thelaw that was applied, namely, the customary law that was used, for example, in Machakos. If I appeal, the provincial commissioner, who may be a Luhya, or a Luo, may not understand the customary laws of the elders in Machakos. What will now happen?  Mr.  Speaker, Sir.  The Attorney-General  should clarify this point  so that  those who will handling these cases will	know what  law to  apply.	This  is  because  the  Bill  is  silent  here.	We  haveapplied customary  laws  to	rake	decisions  at  that  level.	But  you cansee  that  the  composition  of the Provincial Tribunal does not allow the  use  of customary law. So,  this  should  be  catered  for . The attorney-General  should  delete  the  appeal  at  the  provincial level and leave it at the district level. 	I  Say  this because  at  this level you have  people who  are  conversant with the customary  	laws  of  the  people  who  live  in the  district.	If thechairman  of the  tribunal does  not come  from the	particulardistrict  he  will not understand the  customs  of the  people  ofthat	district.	So,  we  would  like  the  appeals  to be  done  atthe  district		level  so that we  may  cater for customary law.The  other  aspect  that  should be  looked  into by the  Attorney-General	Bills  should be brought here  so that we  may discussthem and  express  our views  on them.	When you look at  thecomposition of the  provincial tribunal you will  find  thatit  includes the Provincial	Commissioner and  other  personswho will  be  appointed by the  Minister.	That  makes  things  even morecomplicated; If these people  who will  assist the Provincial Commissioner will be am appointed by the Minister-  It  does  not  even say who  is going to recommend these people to the Minister.	So,  youcan  see  here  that  there  is  a lot  of conflicts.		At  the  districtlevel,  the  District  Commissioner shall 	be  the  chairman of the tribunal 	and  the  elders  shall be  from that  district, 	But here  we  have the  Provincial Commissioner and  other five members to be  appointed by  the  Minister. That will complicate  the whole  issue. 	The  original aim  of this Bill is to  make use  of elders  so that lawyers who used to  confuse  everybody will no longer confuse our people.  But you can see here that vie have now gone back to square one because  of the appeals at the Provincial level.As	said at the  beginning,  we should pass a Bill in this	House that	will get rid of corruption and fraud in this country. Thatis	why this Bill has been brought here.	There have been many casesof corruption and fraud in this country.	In Machakos some peoplehad taken away land from all old lady and His	Excellency thePresident was very concerned.	I would urge the Attorney-General tolook at this Bill again.	This is the beginning		of somecontroversial Bills whereby we will appoint	some Members ofParliament to look at Bills before they are brought here.	Thishappens  in other Parliaments  all  over the world.	This is becauseat the  beginning I was worried that a Bill brought by the Attorney-	 General- if the Bill is withdrawn	as was being suggested by hon.Malebe,	that will not reflect well on us asrepresentatives  of the people. So, I would like the Attorney-General to look into this matter because he said in the beginning that the other Bill was rushed.rushed. This other Bill should not be  With those few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to support the Bill.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. ANASWA:	Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving methis chance to contribute to this very important Bill.	Looking at the way theBill is drafted, I see a lot of loopholes which we need to look into.	First ofall, when we look at the functions of the Bill, we find that one of them is to take care of trespass. 	We want to know fully what this means so that when members of the tribunals come to deal with the matter, they know exactly what we mean. These tribunals will also try to solve land problems according to customary law.	At the moment, the youth form the biggest percentage of Kenya'spopulation whereas we have fewer and fewer old people.	You may find that theprovincial commissioner who will be the chairman of such a tribunal may not know exactly what customary law provides in respect of land disputes. So, we would like to various customary laws of the many tribes of Kenya to be recorded so that the provincial commissioners chairing tribunals may know what is provided for in respect of land disputes. Even we, hon. Members, coming from various parts and tribes of Kenya, do not know for sure-the customary law relating to land in various places. These laws should be corded in such a manner so that they may used by members of the tribunals in solving land problems. When we think of moving land cases from the district level to the provincial level, we should remember that provincial commissioners are very busy and are not conversant with the customs of various tribes. What I would suggest is that the chairmen of these tribunals should not be administrators such as provincial or district commissioners because these are, indeed, busy people. One of the ordinary members of the tribunals should be appointed chairmen so that they have enough time to devote to solving land disputes. </Newspeech> <Header>ADJOURMENT</Header><Newspeech>MR.

As soon as theconstruction of Nyayo sheds in these five districts is complete, we will embark on the next phase, which will take care of seven districts. During this phase, Bungoma is one of the districts which have been pinpointed to have Jua Kali sheds in areas to be shown to the Ministry by the District Development Committee. 	The amount to be allocated to districts depends basically on the population of Jua Kali artisans, the availability of land and other infrastructure, such as  electricity, roads and water.	It is, therefore, not possible to say preciselyhow much Bungoma will receive.	Since the Ministry uses money from an establishedfund for the construction of these sheds,  it does not consider the us- :11 circles of financial years in putting up these Sheds.</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR. MAKAHNU: 	Mr.  Deputy Speaker, Sir, .while thanking the Assistant Minister for that reply, I would like him to know that we already have a two-acre plot next to the slaughter house in Bungoma and that it is served with electricity, water and very good roads.	In terms of district Population density, Bungoma istop-ranking.	May I know why it should be served after	18 other districts?	Whatcriterion. was used to push Bungoma to cone after 	18 other districts?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. LEAKEY-: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,  it is a fact that since we began putting up Jua Kali sheds, we have completed the exercise quite satisfactorily in seven of the eight provinces in the country, and we are now arriving at a point where we intend to construct such sheds in three districts in Western Province. As for the criterion used to cause Western Province has come at the end and not at the beginning; there is no criterion used.	This is just the way things haveworked out.	We are not neglecting Western Province or any districts there inparticular.	It is my Ministry's intention to have these facilities completedas early as possible in the new year.	Certainly, before the middle of the year,we expect to have, at least, one programme of Jua Kali sheds in Western Province, probably in Bungoma or Busia Districts, both of which have, indeed, allocated land, made commitments to their District Development Committees and are our top priority.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell this House whether his Ministry has come up with a good plan for the 	construction of Jua Kali sheds?	Originally, these sheds used to take care ofthe sun only and that is where the name "Jua Kali" originated.	In many of thesesheds, people's property is not protected against theft.	What security plansdoes the. Ministry have in respect of rain and other things in these sheds?</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR.  LEAKEY:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the funds we have availablehave enjoyed a broad spectrum of interests than the original sheds which consisted merely of a roof. 	We now have a programme that includes support that includes some infrastructure that even districts do not have and some measure of security by way of fencing and,  in some cases, walls. We have not problem with that concept if only the district development committees concerned come forward and support such an idea.	We hope that these committees will do that in future.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER:	Let us move on to Mr. Mureithi's Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI:	On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER:	On the Question we have just done away with?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI:	Yes, Mr. Deputy Spear.er, Sir, and it is a very validpoint.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER:	No, Mrs. Ndetei.	You are overruled.</Newspeech>Question No.	635<Header>Repair of Kiganjo—State Lodge Road</Header> MR. MUREITHI asked the Minister for Public Works what urgent steps the Ministry is taking to repair the tarmac road from Kiganjo to State Lodge which is presently full of potholes and is a danger to the road users. <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS	(Mr. Mibei)	:	Mr. Deputy Speaker,Sir, I beg to reply. The potholes on Kiganjo State Lodge P.oad are currently being repaired by the District Works Officer, Nyeri. 	The Ministry is in the process of procuring bitumen for resealing this road amongst others.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  MUREITHI:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,  about a week ago	7noticed,  as the Minister has said,  that the road is being repaired.However,  the potholes are being sealed with soil and murrum.	Does theMinister consider this	adequate repair of the road in question?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIBEI:	Mr.  Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think that was an urgentmeasure to make the road passable but I will check on it.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MUREITHI:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,  I heard the Ministersaying that he will check on the progress of the maintenance.	He wenton to say that he was in the process of procuring bitumen for resealing the road. Could he consider awarding a tender for the resealing of the road,  not necessarily from Kiganjo to the State Lodge but from Kiganjo to Ngandu?	The whole of that section is in the same condition.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIBEI:	Mr.  Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to invitethe hon.

WAMBUA: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,  I beg to ask  the Minister State, Office of the President the following Question by Private Notice. 	Why did the chief of Masii Location, a Mr. David Nzioki Mbithi, beat Miss Susan Ngina Muoki of Kaki Market on Wednesday 	14th November, 1990; Messrs Paul Voi of Vyulya Village and Kawembe Makau, a National Youth Service officer, of Muusini Market on Friday, 16th November, 1990?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT	(Mr. Keen)	:	Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. I am not aware of anybody having been beaten by a chief on 	14th or 16th of November, this year. 	However,  if the hon. Member has sufficient evidence to that effect, I will be too delighted to investigate and, if it is established to be so,  I will take disciplinary action.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I brought this Question,I had the evidence of the three people who were beaten.	One was a lady who wasslapped twice as the chief was collecting Harambee contributions.	The othergentleman is a senior officer with the National Youth Service, who is training officers at Bura.  He was whipped and made to kneel down for three good hours because he had no money to contribute to the chief.' The third person is a man known as Kawembe Makau who was preparing tea for his ailing mother. When the chief arrived at his house, the man went outside to talk to him but, even without uttering any words, the chief started whipping him.	I have a Police P3form which is proof that the young man was thoroughly beaten.	There are evenblood stains to prove that he was beaten.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER:	What is your question?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, my question is when the chiefis going to be sacked for such acts because we do not want such a chief to be harassing wananchi.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. KEEN:	Mr.  Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have already said that ifI were to be furnished with sufficient evidence to that effect, I will cause the matter to be investigated.	So for it appears that no reporthas teen made to the police of the provincial Administration.	If thehon. Member has any information to  the contrary of what I have stated, I will be just too pleased to cause the matter to be investigated.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER:	Mr. Wambua. I thought you talked about.P3 form.	Can you lay that on the Table of the House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA:	Yes, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have it here andwill lay it on the	Table of the House.</Newspeech>(Mr. Wambua tried to lay the document from behind the Clerks) <Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER:	Order, Mr. Wambua.	You know the StandingOrders of the House,	You cannot do what you are doing.</Newspeech>(Mr. Wambua walked to the Bar, bowed and proceeded to lay the 	document on the Table) <Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: 	On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister admits that he has not investigated the complaints and,  in that case, if we continue to labour on the issue, we shall not get a good reply. Would I be in order,  therefore, to request the Chair to let the Question be deferred until the Minister has a sufficient reply, so that he can reply,  say, on Thursday? He does not have a satisfactory reply now. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR.  KEEN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,  I have not seen the documents that hon. Wambua has laid on the Table and I would want to look at them before I make any further replies. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAEUGE: 	On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. My point of order is that in view of the fact that the Question was by Private Notice, which means that an answer must be provided within 43	hours of theQuestion being submitted, and the Assistant Minister admits that he doesnot have an appropriate answer, would I be in order to request that theQuestion be deferred so that we can have a thorough reply after he hascarried out sufficient investigations? Could we request tact that the  reply be made within, another £8 hours? The allegation made to the effect that a chief beat and whipped wananchi in a marker centre is very sensitive and we cannot leave it just like that.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KEEN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I did come to the House fairly well equipped. As far as my information is concerned, there is no report that has been made either to the police or to the Administration to the effect that the chief committed those acts. I said here that I would be too delighted to have any evidence to the contrary of what I had said and I would be quite willing to cause the matter to be investigated and report back to the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI:  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the past we have had cases of similar serious misdeeds by some chiefs. Such matters have been reported to the authorities. For example, I had one such case which I did report to the Office of the President. However, that particular chief is still loose and continues to use gangs to go and take people's land and allocate it to his friends. I am wondering whether after that information the Assistant Minister sought has been forwarded to his office any appropriate action will be taken. This is not the first time chiefs in Ukrimbani have beaten people. I know of another instance where a woman was beaten until she had to stay at Kenyatta National Hospital for two months and nothing happened to that chief who committed the offence. The case went to court and a nolle proseoui was entered. There was more than enough evidence to the effect that the chief had committed the act. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Anyhow, what is your question, Mrs. Ndetei?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI: Can we be assured here that appropriate action will be taken in this case if the evidence that the Assistant Minister is> asking for is presented? The evidence is there.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. KEEN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, my office will not condone situations like, for example, the beating of innocent; wananchi and so on. Definitely, a case like this one wariants investigations and, as I said before, if it is established beyond reasonable doubt that the chief did actually assault these three people then, of course, appropriate action will be taken by my office.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order, Mrs. Ndetei! Perhaps for the benefit of the Chair, did you say that the practice is rampant in Ukambani ? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR, NDETE1: Yes, Mr. Deputy Speaker. In fact. I can quote three locations, including Mr. wambua's location, where I Know chiefs have thoroughly misbehaved. I have more than enough evidence that I can lay on this Table to prove that. But I will do it at an appropriate time when I bring a question to this House. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKAU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. What evidence does the Assistant Minister need beyond a P.3 form which is certified by a doctor? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SEEN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, here is a very interesting case. I think for the benefit of the House, it is alleged here by the hon. Questioner, Mr. Wambua, that these two people were beaten on 14th and 16th November. This p.3 form here is dated 26th November. 1890. Now, if somebody was beaten up on 14th November," then it is only logical that he reports the matter to the police, : the administration or to the hospital immediately, but not two weeks later. There is something fussy here!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this man had no money for transport when he was beaten and the doctor certified that the man had been beaten. In fact, even the scars are still there up to now. The bakora and kiboko are with the chief? and the matter was reported to the administration in writing. That more evidence does the Assistant Minister require in this case?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEEN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question of somebody having no money does not arise at all. If the complainant was beaten up by the chief on 14th November, the best action for him would have-been to report the matter to the nearest police but not report the matter two weeks later.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Does the date invalidate the p.3 form? I think thE Assistant Minister is misleading the House. The fact of the matter isthat this man took a P.3 form, regardless of the date. so I do not understand why the Assistant Minister is saying that it  is not validate just because it was taken two weeks later. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEEN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not think I am trying to defend the chief for no apparent reason, at all. I said, right in the beginning that in. the event that the matter is established that the chief did actually assault tills gentleman, we shall take a disciplinary action. But what I do not understand in the whole issue is that normally, if somebody has been assaulted, the matter is reported straightaway to the police</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKAU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Can the Assistant Minister tell us what law he is quoting, say, from the time of assault to the tine when one reports to the police for a P.3 form?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEEN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is just a matter of commonsense. Anybody who is assaulted or beaten up in this country, he straightaway goes to a police station to report. Buta P.3 form alone is not sufficient evidence. It may be sufficient evidence in court, but not under normal circumstance. why was the matter not reported to the police at the time of assault?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ARDE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.what part of the law is the Assistant Minister basing his argument on? He has been given all the facts. This country is run by law.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEEN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question here does not arise at all. Normally, when a person has been beaten or assaulted, the matter is reported to the police straightaway. Then the victim takes a P.3 and takes it to a doctor who fills it and takes it back to the police. However, in view of the fact.that I have a P.3 from here, I will cause the matter to be c	thoroughly investigated and report back to this House at alater date.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKAU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order !  Hon. Members, you must appreciate the fact that we are running short of time today, having lost one hour at the beginning of today's sittings So, we shall now move on to Mr. Fonda's Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKAU: On a point of' order, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hot relating to this matter, Mr. Makau, because the Assistant Minister has just said that he will report back to the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MAKAU: It is not regarding this matter, Sir. I am sure you are aware that when we go on long recesses, all the business comes to an end. When will be report back to the House?Is it before we go on recess or after?</Newspeech>f 	<Newspeech>MR.

KYONDA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the	Minister for Health the following Question by Private notice.Since Makueni District Hospital has a serious shortage of clinical officers, what urgent arrangements is the Ministry making to opposite a full complement of this cadre of medical staff to provide the required services to  wananchi of Makueni constituanc</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER TOR HEALTH (Mr.Ogur): Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.I wish to inform the hon. Member that my Ministry has a shortage of clinical officers throughout the country. So it is not possible to post more clinical officers to Makueni District Hospital at the moment. However, clinical officers will be posted to Makueni District Hospital with effect from 1st July, 1991, when the new clinical officers qualify from the Medical Training College.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, despite the fact that I do not have a written reply to this Question, I would like to ask the Assistant Minister, when he says that he does not have enough staff, how does he expect a big hospital like Makueni to be managed by two or three clinical officers?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir? The health services at Makuen District Hospital are going on well, but the hon. Member .wanted us to increase the number of clinical officers at the hospital. How¬ever, my Ministry is unable to do so right now until July, 1991.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is very unfair for the Assistant Minister to tell the House that health services are going on normally at Makueni District Hospital. Can he tell us how the services are going-on? Does he mean the services are going on simply because the sun rises and sets? What evidence does he have to show that services are going on?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the work is going on very well at Makueni District Hospital. We are prepared to send additional clinical officers to Makueni District Hospital by 1st July, 1991 when new clinical officers qualify from Medical Training College. Howerer, I have statistics here to prove that elsewhere within the Districts of Machakos, Meru, Embu, Isiolc, Marsabit and Kitui the health services are going on very well.CNJ.	</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Machakos District has 25 clinicalofficers, Meru District 29, Enbu District  37, Isiolo District 19,  Marsabitshall provide additional clinical officers where we can do so. In the case ofMakueni District, we shall provide soma additional clinical officers in list July?1991 to carry out the work there. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: Arising from the Assistant Minister's reply, is he reallyaware that he is being very unfair to the people of Makueni who have not hada doctor for a long time. At the moment, we have only three clinical officers in this Hospital.In this hospital and he stands up here are says that the work is going on. Could he tell this House why  it is not possible to post additional clinical officers in Makueni District Hospital immediately. By the time these additional clinical officer? he is talking about are posted to this Hospital, thing will be 		. He must do something immediately to arrest the situation.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MP. GGITR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, at the moment, we have eight general clinical officers in Makueni District Hospital, one Orthopaedic clinical officer and one paediatric clinical officer. I am not saying that these are enough, but we can only provide additional clinical officer to this officer by 1st July next year.</Newspeech><Newspeech>ME.

Next Order.</Newspeech><Header> POINTS OF ORDER </Header> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Mibei): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the House will recall that there was a power failure this afternoon in this House, and I wish to inform hon. Members that the failure was due to a lose connection on the cable terminal. The lose nuts burnt out and caused the failure. Thegenerator is now on and I wish to assure the hon. Members that the burned out nuts will be replaced tonight. The power failure was not foreseen.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I rise on a point of order regarding the power failure we have experienced this afternoon. This is the second time power has failed in this House, and it is also the second time that a Minister has stood up and complained of lose nuts and so forth.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are perturbed because in a place like this one has a generator which is supposed to switch on automatically in case of power failure. The generator in this building is not looked after properly. We as the representatives the people in this House, are duty-bound to fulfil the aims and objects for which we are elected to this House. Today we have adjourned this Parliament for one whole hour. I am sure that we have been quickened during Question Time and, therefore, we could not get answers satisfactorily.Now, Sir, we want the Minister concerned to issue a Ministerial Statement explaining why this should continue. As I have said, this is the second time that there has been a power failure in this House, and I do recall that after we complained the first time nobody bothered to take care of the generator. Personally, I am not satisfied with the way the Minister has been handling this issue of power failure. If we have lose nuts at the cable terminal, we have engineers who are capable of looking into the matter. This is an institution whereby we are expected to start business according to schedule'. So, we need a better statement to tell us why these power failures should continue occurring without being handled properly.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Mibei, would you like to say something aboutthat? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Mibei): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, what I can only say is that I know that when there was a power failure hon. Members were idle. However, I assure them that we shall check all the nuts should there be other lose one's. We hope the same thing will not recur.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MIS0I: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I agree with the previous speaker that this is the second time that this House has had a power failure. This is Parliament. Power failure can occur in hospitals when operations are taking place and when standby generators arsupposed to take off immediately. If those generators do not take over the supply of power, then you can expect very tragic situations to occur.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Public Works should ensure that standby generators are functional at all times in institutions where power is essential and indispensable for the working of those institutions. Maintenance of generators must be kept up to date and the generators must be tested frequently to ensure that they work. Therefore, the Minister should ensure that there are programmes for maintenance and testing not only when power fails but even when the generators are functional. If that can be done, we can avoid not only the kind of time we have lost today but also some other situations which can be nasty.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I thought the Minister, to be a more honourable gentleman, would first apologise to the House for that power failure and then expalin the cause.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: This is a very unsettling situation, Mr. Mibei, and it should be! treated with the seriousnes it deserves. I am sure you have heard the sentiments of the hon. Members.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I rise on a point of order on a matter which I consider to be very important. Earlier on in the year, I asked a Question here relating to compensation of land to some people whose land in Makueni was taken for the proposed headquarters of the new Makueni District. These people were supposed to be compensated, and they were told so and also how much they should expect. That happened some two years ago and some of the people have been compensated and have moved to new areas. But there are about five or six people who have not been compensated up to now. 	When I asked this Question earlier in this year, I was told that the people who had not been compensated would be compensated at the start of this financial year. Now, that was supposed to happen in July and November is coming to an end. Some of these people have had their land taken because construction is going on and have had to move. They are living on other people's land; some are lucky that they have relatives around.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, you will agree with me that this is a sad situation where somebody just stays without doing anything. It means no develop¬ment and no nothing. Those people whose land has been taken cannot do anything. As I have said, we are nearing the end of November and we have not heard anything from the Ministry1concerned. Could the Office of the President give an answer to this issue since the promise that these people would be compensated at the beginning of this financial year has not been fulfilled? It is serious.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Well.

NISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the followingMotion: </Newspeech>THAT, this House adopts the Report of the Public Investments Committee on the Accounts of the State Corporations laid on the Table of the House on It  November. 1993.The functions of the .Public Invest sent s Committee are stipulated under Standing Order No. 148. Briefly; the work of this Committee is to examine the working of the public investments; examine Reports, if any, of  Accounts of the public investments: examine Reports, if any, of the Auditor-General(Corporations on the public investments and also to are being if public investments are being managed in accordance with sound business principles and 	commercial practices and procedures. This Committee is not expected to deal with matters of major Government policy or issues which can be handled through appropriate administrative procedures or matters which are covered under specific norms and status of the company. In brief, that  is the role of the Public Investments Committee.	Before I move to the details of the working of this Committee. I would like to point out a few aspects in relation to State Corporations historical perspective. This will put the House in a proper picture as to how various State Corporations have developed since Independence. Before we attained Independence, there were State Corporations established by the colonial white settlers whose functions were centred on the interests of their clients. As soon as we got Independence. it became necessary to transfer the economy of this country to the hands of indigenous people.Since this country lacked manpower, and the infrastructure to take off, those State Corporations which existed at the time had to be reorganised and new ones established in order to ensure that the economy of this country moved smoothly into the hands of indigenous Kenyans. If I can take the House back to 1985 with reference to Sessional Paper No. 10 of 195? on African Socialism and its application to planning, policies and programmes, we can see that it identified areas which Kenya had to give priority. This was in respect to the basis on which Kenyan economy was to be build and be managed by Kenyans. Out of this Sessional Paper, various parastatal bodies were reorganised and a few others were created to accelerate the development of the overall economy for the welfare of Kenyans.Our leaders had the foresight and belief that these public corporations would serve the welfare of Kenyans better by employing move  Kenyans, generate more income; pay dividers  State  which is  a 	holder  provide services to wananchi at minimum  cost  exploit and develop   national resources, complement and supplement, efforts of the Government. private sector and the wananchi. That the reason behind the setting upof those corporations. The same vision still exists today.I may also mention here that the nature, scope 	and objectives of these state corporation way in operation in and argument. Some of themare small, big service oriented and so on. But they are supposed to serve an  identified need in cur national economy.  As all know. Sir, the 		of these State Corporation is in the hands of the Government. Either 100 per cent owned or partially owed. That is where public funds have been going.To date, we have about 160 State Corporations in this country which span across the whole spectrum of our socio-economic life which may be classified in many ways. We have those corporations which are developmental there are those which deal with finances, research and development, banking, agricultural, industrial and commercial, marketing, services and promotion local and export     <Header> QUORUM </Header> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Far. Omido) : On a point of order. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The hon. Member is moving a very important motion but there is no Quorum in the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Ring the	Bell. </Newspeech>(The Division Bell was rung)<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: we have a Quorum now. Proceed Dr. Misoi</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. As I was saying, these corporations are of different kinds; some are agricultural; some are commercial and others are industrial. They provide services to the public. The Government has continued to support these State Corporations by giving them money which in recent times has amounted to	billions of shillings. The public hasbeen very concerned and the leaders have been very concerned about how public funds are being utilised by these State Corporations, The time has come when the Government should stop supporting institutions which have become a liability to this nation. They have become a liability to the taxpayers and this has led to constraints in the economy as a whole0 This also affects our  external financial transactions; they repayment of long term loans and so on. The re¬payment of these external loans has become a problem. The misappro¬priation of funds by these State Corporations has caused this country lots of headaches. I say this because those who are charged with the management of these organizations have not taken their work seriously. It may be through corruption, dishonesty, graft, sheer exploitation of office for personal riches.  The worrying factoris that despite all these malpractices  very few people have been taken to court	and charged. Very few of these people have managed to repay even a small percentage of what they have looted from these State Corporations.Mr. Deputy Speaker. Sir, the management of these Corporation has been indeed shameful except for a few which are doing a good job. The Public Investments Committee was established by this House in order to institute checks and. balances with regard to the performance of our State Corporations on behalf of the public and on behalf of the Government« I therefore urge the House to take this Report very seriously. This is because we cannot continue Tabling Reports in this House Public Investments Committee Reports and Public Accounts Committee Reports  without any visible results. If that were to continue then we would be carrying out an exercise which does not benefit anybody.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are fortunate that the Office of the Auditor-General (Corporations) was established to ensure that that. Office is able to scrutinize more closely the activities of these State Corporations. The	Office of theAuditor-General (Corporations) has been established under the State Corporations Act Cap.466 of the Laws of Kenya, to provide among other things the management and structuring and financial controls and auditing of the accounts of the State Corporations.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I may mention that previously private firms have been contracted to look into the financial matters of the State Corporations. If you look at the prefix of this Report, you will notice that in 1939 the Public Investments Committee had 33 sittings. This is the first Report of the Public Investments Committee and it is only logical that the historic development of our State Corporations has led to the setting up of this Committee.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Six, in 1975, the Public Accounts Committee observed, Committee observed, in its  Report for that year, that every year huge amount of public money are pumped into these State Corporations. That Committee observed that is only product that the public would wish to be informed of how their money is being used. That was said many years ago.	Therefore, in 1979, this House establisheda fully	fledged Public Investments Committee which becameoperational 10 years later; that was in 1989. It would appear that there was some delay in making this Committee functional.	This committee sat down and took evidence from the managersof the State Corporations; the committee noted with deep regret.I must emphasize this that the Accounts and the Annual Reports ofvarious organizations had not been tabled before the House in accordance with the status that established these State Corporationsthe law was there, what was the problem that made the StateCorporations not to comply with the law which was passed in thisHouse? Where was the bottleneck? We noted that with very deep regret. We also noted a few things that some of the Reports which werelaid in the House were	not accompanied by the Certificates andReports thereof by the	Auditor-General (Corporations) . That wasa clear violation of the	Exchequer and Audit Act Cap. 412 of Laws ofKenya. The Although laws are very clear and the heads of the State Corporations send their Reports through the Ministry's and the Permanent Secretaries, and the same end up coming here incomplete. That is mhugeme of duty according to me. This is because those Reports will not be useful and discussed they are incomplete.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we made observations and recommendations on issues in the Auditor-General’s Reports and those will be found under the various headings of the paragraphs of this documents. These comments were reached and arrived at after very careful consideration of the evidence received from the various witnesses and we do hope that they will be taken in that spirt. We will try to be constructive not necessarily destructive; we will try to be helpful but not to pretend that we are not serious. There were times when we were serious; there were times when we had to send some people to go back and prepare themselves. This is because our committee took the mandate of this House very seriously.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the recommendations of the committee should be taken as a genuine concern so that we can improve the economic performance of all public investments. I want to emphasize that it is a challenge to all the. chief executives to improve the performances of their organizations for the benefit of the nation. They have been put there, not only to benefit themselves, but to manage these resources on behalf of the nation.While the Committee was making these recommendations, we noted also with deep concern that the management in some of the State Corporations conducted very very poor economic feasibi1ity studies before investing huge sums of money in untenable projects. That was very disappointing because even with the support of some Ministries, some projects were identified; funds allocated and put in only to be realized in a short time that those projects were not vaiable. The Committee wondered and, I even wondered, myself, why the problem arose so that within a short time after undertaking some studies and assessments we conclude that it is not a good project after investing billions of shillings. Then, there must be a problem and some carelesness somewhere because somebody has not done his job well. Whereas this is in the State Corporations we have worked with the Parent Ministries  I will say something about those ones later on  this practice as the Committee said invariably lead to instances where projects either never took off or the Government had to be called in to bail them out. Again, the Government had to get the meagre public funds put back again because shoddy work had been done. The Committee felt that there must be a definite investment policy which should be formulated under an umbrella of the Government; The Government Investment Division in the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance, should be strengthened with a view to maintaining critical economic review on these projects. This because we cannot identify our needs and then fail to finance those needs with the public funds. (Mr. Deputy Speaker left the chair) The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mureithi) took the chair Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir, the Committee gotreports that investment of surplus funds in some of the corporations the prerogative of the board of directors. In some cases, we found those surplus funds were put in the wrong and unprofitable institutions, and. as we are all aware some of these institutions collapsed. In other cases, funds were put in some institutions with pressure from some members of the boards of directors or some other personalities. That money belongs to the public and the Committee found this unacceptable. with the strengthening of the financial sector the Committee hopes, and believes, that these malpractices will be brought under control.As the Chairman of this Committee, I would like to thank this House for giving me that job. I also appreciate the contribution of the Members in preparing the Report I am now presenting to the House. I would also like to thank other people from the state corporations and Ministries, who came and presented their views to us; the result of their efforts is the Report I am now presenting.We know that there are both internal and external factors which affect our economy. But there are times when our economy has tended to work through creditable work and at such times you wonder whether this country has not done much. while state corporations have been criticised, I must say that there are some which have been well managed and  that all Kenyans of good intensions should always aim at giving the correct picture of how our economy has been performing.So far, we can say we have done very well because for the last27 years we have peace, stability and unity. This has enabled, to even discuss this matter. Even those who have committed a lot of funds to useless projects are still pervading elsewhere. If it were in another country, they would have been hunted, put to jail and even guillotined. The situation where some people expleit our ex economy must he brought to an end. Recently the  world bank officials in this; country said something about state corporations. They said that we although have had a few problems we have succeeded. So, the agents of doom should take note of what other neutral parities are saying about Kenya.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to mention that our leaders have been loving, wise and mature. The late kenyatta did his best and President Moi has, for the last 12 years, taken us many paces ahead and we hope to continue doing that. But I may add that one of the constraining factors in our economic development is the high rate of population growth. It may be necessary for us to put more emphasis in planning our population matters.There are other external issues mentioned by some of the corporations managers during our proceedings as having affected their operations Some of these are prices in the international market for the products we export; foreign exchange earnings scarcity and the ± substantial fluctuation in value of our shillings which has affected our ability to import essential goods. Those are world issues about which we can do nothing. But we were alsotold of internal issues which have affected our economic growth. Sons of these are weather, rainfall and low earnings from our exported products.The last factor used to destabilise this country is whatwe have been discussing for the last one year, namely the political fact. Although this factor is political it is net neutral; it hasdiverted our attention so that instead of promoting economic growth we have had to fight hard against these characters who want to destabilise this country. Although no calculation has been done, we have lost much in terms time and efforts. we thank God that in the last nine months we have withered the storms which were meant to	destroy Kenya. Even this House was attacked bypeople of no status despite that it is the Supreme in this country. That we have withered these storms shows our unity and belief in one Kenya and leadership; in this way, we can meet the aspirations of our people.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in one or two words, I would like to pay gratitude to the statements in which our President and the Vice-Presidents and Minister for Finance have told others in the world that we Kenyans do our things the way we want. They have told them we even did not learn how to fight for Uhuru from outsiders, but we won our Unuru and have come a long way up to where we are now. With our unity we will continue to go a long way in future. This is the vision which our people have used to defend this country. But the biggest weapon against divisive elements is for each leader, public servant and citizen in this country to s eschew discipline, public accountability, responsibility and unity in diversity, but always doing justice to all; if we can do that and respect our institutions this country will move ahead.In short, that is what I intended to explore because those factors have definitely affected our viability, progress and development.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I now want to move into areas which the Committee found to be deficient in car public institutions. We examined the accounts of 15 corporations. we heard evidence from their officers and found that there were several missing links. Touching on all but a few of the corporations, we found that there was inadequate capacity and capability for financial management which led to loss of millions of Kenya shillings belonging to the public. We instructed these corporations to take care of public funds on our behalf.We also found that there were weaknesses in the mechanism of loan recovery and debt collection which also led to outstanding loans and arrears on the part of clients who received this money. There was poor and unprofessional accounting and recordkeeping on the part of some individuals in certain corporations, practices arising out of untrained and unprofessional accounts clerks and accountants. This was sheer carelessness which took a long time to be identified by corporation heads and chief executives, although it was nothing complicated.There was also carelessness bordering on irresponsible commitment of public funds to uneconomic projects. No marketability projections were done, economic viability and production indicators were not properly assessed and there was no indication of the value added tax impact of projects nor assessment of income distribution in various sectors of the country. Savings creation and foreign exchange earning were not well done. These are areas which some state corporations ought to have looked into quite seriously, and yet a few of them never did so.You cannot imagine that there were irregular and financially unsound advances of public funds to directors and management staff disregarding financial regulations and yet these are the managers we have appointed, screened through the system and given them titles such as managing directors, directors, executivechairmen, and so on. These people have beautiful offices, cars and secretaries, but what does the public get from them? They advance public funds to people with no security, and these people no security, until they retire or are kicked out. After that, those who take over say, "I was not there when this happened." We are getting serious, and I hope we will remain serious.we also found some irresponsible channelling of loans and advances by corporations, often without terms and conditions of repayment. how can you advance loans without specifying how that money will be recovered when there are regulations given by the Treasury to govern such matters? What were these people doing? They lacked management skills or maybe they were not supervised. There is a mystery in this. There were also Government loans given without terms and conditions of repayment leading to counterclaims that such funds were not loans, but grants. So, we had a "tug-of-war" between the Ministry and the corporation concerned, with the managing director saying that they were grants while the permanent secretary said they were loans. What language was used to indicate that they were loans? There were no yardsticks, terms and conditions of repayment or written agreements, and, in the end, the Government will write off those loans or resort to equity and say that all is over. The people responsible are executive, experienced and have been promoted to the top. The Committee did not understand these things, but we just listened. We were shocked. The question is whether the same practice will continue, and, although I cannot answer it, it may be answered by somebody else.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we noted that when some corporations were told that they had loans, their directors sat down and said, "We will convert these loan's to grants or equity and write them off" without due regard to Government authority. What kind of control do we have? We have people in the Government, such as the Ministers seated here, who are supposed to oversee all that happens in their Ministries and the corporations under them. There are also Assistant Ministers, who sometimes complain to be under-utilised. Do they not know that they have to check on these corporations? We might complain that our institutions are not running well, but who will run them for us? If Ministerand Assistant Ministers make such a complaint when they are in charge of running these institutions; who is going be if. charge? In The end, the problem goes to the Head of State. However, we have to identify the missing links. Loans were converted to grants without any analysis or certification criterion to determine the conversion of these "Loans to equity or' writing them off. If people misappropriate money and then we write it off, what are we doing? We grant ant a certificate and say, "You have done very well to hijack money from the public." There must be a way of assessing whether public funds have been used well. If they have not, somebody should be held responsible. Why should we make the Government the scapegoat in everything even in the case of mistakes committed by individuals deliberately?!	These things are signs of poor management and unsatisfactorysupervision, sometimes in the case of Ministries themselves, including Ministers and permanent secretaries. Lack of supervision has led to the promotion of complacency and a carefree attitude on the part of corporation heads, who know that they can get away with such mistakes. I only hope that our recent statement that we are going to tighten our "nuts" will give some results. Shortcomings in state corporations cannot be confined to managing directors alone; they run through the whole system of institutions, from the chairman through the manager to the parent Ministry. These are the key levels at which things can be put right and where things can go wrong. What is the role of, for example, the chairmen of state corporations? They chair meetings. Do they understand what is going on or do they just go their, sign cheques, earn sitting allowance and then, at the end of the month, get honoraria. what do they do? Some of them are executive.	while others are not, but they are still the chairmen of the boards-of-directors I do not want to start arguing on the differences of their positions and so on but the calibre of these people should determine the perfomance of the institutions they are in charge of. Are they suitable; are they consistent in what they are supposed to do; are they qualified; what developmental, characteristics have they shown, academically, administratively and profes¬sionally? Some of these officers just go to the parastatal bodies and ruin the business. What we co is direct the questions to the managing directors while some of the people have ways of saying they are not responsible. What is their role? Are they not the eyes of the Government in such areas?Some of the chairmen in the parastatal bodies have overstepped theirresponsibilities so that they think they are the executive directors. Theywant a car, an office, an expensive carpet, a secretary and go to theiroffices every morning, while they only chair board meetings once a month.What is this? We have been told of chairmen who go to the offices on a dailybasis and instruct the managing directors to do away with some senior officersclaiming that they can also do the work. They are on telephone throughoutdoing business at the parastatal bodies, expense. At other times they eveninterfere with the employment of staff in such parastatal bodies, and other business affairs. Such chairmen should be appointed as executive chairmeninstead. In many cases the managing directors are always fearing to beharassed by the chairmen and so they stay out of their way. They even failto carry out their duties because of that fear of victimisation by the chairmen.	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, you find some of them using thepublic vehicles for private businesses. You find them going to attend Harambeefunctions in official vehicles. That is not official business. why can theynot use their personal vehicles for such purposes? The hon. Members in theHouse normally use their personal vehicles when attending Harambee functions,why not these chairmen? They always use the public means so that they can be seen to be influential people; which is also a temotation to go back formore things, not only the car. They can get free fuel, free hotel accommodation in high class establishments and entertainment for other people, who are perhaps net known to the parastatal body the chairman represents. Very many funny things happen and they should be stepped.We must open our eyes, particularly at a time like this when v/e are debating this Report. It must come from the House that we v/ant to have discipline in the country and that we want public officials to work. If we do not work ourselves, what type of hon. Members are we? When I talk about the chairmen, I know these things as I have worked in a parastatal body. There are those custodians of the interests of the State in the name of board of directors. They may be up to 15 in a body. They do not reflect any professionalism. I feel that such a board should be made of individuals who are able to contribute their expertise to the institutions in which they have been appointed. They are not just rubber stamps to go and just sit there for the managing directors to do everything for them.Sir, we need to use proper administrative and professional people in the country to do these jobs. We know the track records of most of our people and, surely, you cannot be somebody unless you are known. So, if you are somebody, and you are appointed, then go ahead and act that somebody. That is why I will not condemn chief executives, although to an extent they have to share the blame. Some of these managing directors are the best we have. They are not there because someone has campaigned for the other, no. They have a job to do and they are serving a business enterprise. So, the person put there must be able to run the business; he is a trustee. This is why we have to analyse what we are doing; otherwise, we are beating about the bush. The mistakes, if not corrected, will continue to recur year after year. What can I say about managing directors? We have to look at the viability, the profitability of the bodies they run. The question is: whatif these people do not have interpersonal communication skills to bring their workers together? They cannot make the right decisions. If they just go to the offices and shut themselves in, no information goes in or our. The public assumes that these managers who occupy influential positions are there because they are able to administer, manage and run an entire institution with professionalism. However, they get shocked to read and note that those people are not doing what they are expected to do.I want to say that any shoddy personnel in a position of high trust is just defeating our expectations. we cannot succeed at all in that situation. If we want to achieve anything, we must use the right personnel. Some of these people who are appointed to high positions do not have any integrity nor do they have any wish to excel. We need people of partriotic stands; people of high integrity. These should be the chief executives and heads of our institutions. We do not want those with negative or exploitative tendencies. That is the yardstick we need to use to appoint these people. At the same time do we have the capacity and ability to screen them? Are we only using narrow interests to appoint these people? These could be short=term and personal interests.(The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mureithi) left the Chair) (The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Xagwina) took the Chair) The question I have to pose again is why out parastatal bodies are outdone by the private sector in perfomances. Even the private sector has businesses being managed by Africans and they are doing very well. They could have attended the same schools with those who are appointed to run parastatal bodies. Why the disparity? Something is lacking.Let us also look at the Ministries in charge of the parastatalbodies. There is also the funding institution, the Treasury, where the money comes from. They also share the blame for the failure of bodies.Some of the failures directly emanate from the corridors of the parent Ministries, like bureaucratic practices in some of the Government depart¬ment. All these problems sometimes are to be seen to be emanating from the parent Ministries. Sir, we were also told of mismanaged farms, for example. Nobody cares whether the money is banked properly or not. Then they use it the way they went. The role of the Ministry here is critical. But there are bureauortatic delays in the Ministry intaking even the remedial action. The Ministries are supposed to be sensitive to the development of the institutions they are attached to. Sometimes there are very poor working relationships between the parent Ministries and the corporations. How can that work? They are supposed to complement each other. In some cases, we came across interferences of the Ministries and yet these corporations are not extensions of the Ministries or Depart¬ments . They are supposed to be productive comparable to the private sector. Everybody is supposed to do his work and we should not pretend. Even the Permanent Secretaries are busy in day to day running of the Ministries. So, how much time do theyhave for the corporations? so we do not need the civil servicetype of management in the state corporations. That is not the type of management we want, and we must differentiate that. Therefore, in appointing these people also, we must be sure that they are not going to carry on that bureaucratic attitude.Sir, what I wanted to say is that the Permanent Secre¬taries, the Ministers and the Assistant Ministers bear the blame for the messes and failures of their corporations. They share the blame. Of course, everybody wants to survive, but how do you survive when everybody else is failing? I think we should wake tip. Otherwise, we shall keep on singing and singing "yes" year in year out. In any case, why should we keep such people on the payroll just to continue misusing public property? is no charitable organisation here or a parasize. I am not a parasite to tax everything and in the end tax wananchi. do Why do I want other people to suffer? This is very serious. we have become emaciated.Sir, I wont to say that nobody, public or otherwise, would invest in an ailing institution which has gone to the dogs.The chances of recovering money from these loss-making institutions when they are sold are very slim. So we must be careful when invest¬ing.Sir, the best way and the best option to safeguard funds is through professional management. If that can be done, every¬body would survive. As to whether they will be sold or not that is a matter for the Government to decide.Sir, having said that in general, I would like to moveto one or two specific corporations and say something about them.First and foremost, I will start with the Agricultural Finance Corporation (A.F.C.) and apologise for the few errors which were detected after the report had been printed. Hon. Members can see that our officers have tried to give an amendment or corrigenda to guide usThe problem here is simply binding errors, and I hope that hon. Members will bear with me when I go through the report. The report on the A.F.C. is on page three of the report. As we all know, Kenya relies on agricultural production for its economy and, therefore, A.F.C. is very important to that effect. It is supposed to offer credit facilities for crop production and livestock development. It is supposed to give loans to farmers to purchase machinery and also land. The impact of the A.F.C. is far-reaching. Indeed, our self-sufficiency in food would depend entirely on this institution. even to create exportable commodities would depend on this institution. Again, Sir, in settling our people, the A.F.C. has been very useful in giving loans to improve the living standards of our people. Also, the A.P.O. has been very useful in creatingwe are able to maintain appropriate employment in the area.The A.F.C. has had a programme called "G.M.R." (Guaranteed Minimum Returns ) since 1942 .However, in I973 the Agricultural Finance Corporation failed and as a result,this country has a very serious food treble. After this a new programmecalled seasonal Credit was established hut again. This programme has not workedwell. All these schemes have failed to work because, the Agricultural FinaneeCorporation gives out loans which it is net able to recover, nor deer, d t makeany effort to fellow up the repayment of these loans from the farmers. This iswhy we still have the same problem. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the cost of these failures isenormous and unless the Government take drastic stepe, we shall continue toexperience a lot of problems in our food production. There is now a world Bank expert attached to the Agricultural Finance Corporation to streamline its operations and we hope that this external assistance will boost the activities of this Corporation. Perhaps at this juncture, I should say that the recommendation about the upgrading of the Agricultural Finance Corporation into Rural Development Bank, should be implemented as soon as possible. We hope that the problems that are delaying this updating will be sorted out in a very short time.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like new to mention a fewpoints which have been raised by the Auditor-General Corporation and on whichthe Committee made some investigations and subsequent recommendations. If youlook at the 1984/85 Report of the Controller end Auditor-General (Corporations}paragraph 1, you would find that the Agricultural Finance Generation  obtained money from Treasury to give to farmers  as loans. However, there is something called agency commission which is given cut, although there does not seem to be any signed agreement between the Ministry concerned and the Corporation. How can a Government institution operate like this. This ministry must be more serious because lack of commitment on part of Government Ministries has caused part of the problem.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this 				is most unsatisfactory and Government must come out and appropriate action to alleviate the situation. If you lock as  			talks aboutirredeemable loans, you will find that loan agreements between the Corporationand the Government axe not being followed, nor are these loans being repaid.In this case, we are talking about irredeemable loans to the tune of over 223 million. There is a clear case of laxity here and although this happened during the 1931/35 financial year, this situation not exist now. We should  be seen to be moving forward: we should not stagnate like this! we should move forward instead of just marking time. The President has said that we are on the run, but It is not wananchi alone who are supposed to be on the run, no! The activities of the Government Ministries, Departments and parastatals should be on the run. The development all progresses particularly should he streamlined and theirimplementation speeded.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the 1985/86 Report of the ControllerAnd Auditor-General (Corporations) still talks about this agency commission whichhas not been signed by anybody and we would like to know what the Ministry wasdoing. we still have the same problem of loan repayment to Government and theAuditor-General says that the position continues to worsen. Consideringthese things, one should not wonder at all why these institutions cannot operateprofitably. The Government should be able to follow these matters and recoverits money so that it car in turn repay this money from wherever it borrowedThis is what ought really to happen. There should be a chain of command betweenthe Treasury, the Ministry and the Agricultural Finance Corporation. If thingsdo not happen in this way, there are bound to be complaints over the years andthis is what has been happening. The same situation still persists in the 1986/87.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, paragraph 1 of 1986/87 is veryinteresting. It  talks about non-compliance to requirements forloan advances. when loans are advances to farmers, there rust ire certain conditionsto be fulfilled with regard to security and so on. If these conditions and requirements are not guaranteed, what other security does the A.F.C. haveunder this scheme. This involved K£172,603. Paragraph 3 again talks about loansto farmers  huge balances outstanding.  This rand of situation requires urgent a solution and I third: the first step is for the A.F.C. officers to go  to the field and talk to these farmers after giving them the loans. They must be able to follow up these loans and even try to find out what exactly these farmers are doing with this money. Unless they do this, we shall continue to have this problem. Farmers on their part must make sure that they make profits out of whatever they do with this money that they are able to repay these loans. So, I am saying that the Agricultural Finance Corporation must go to the grass root and be able to supervise what these farmers are doing. The same situation persits in the 1987/88 according to the Report by the Controller and Auditor-General (Corporations)V5The Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, during this particular financial years, a lot of money was given to the farmers without proper guarantee for these loans. So, the situation seems to be getting poorer and poorer. The reasons that have been given for this situation is unfavourable weather conditions and we find that the Government came in and wrote off these loans. However, in a situation of difficult economic problems, farmers need to be given more incentives to be able to produce mere and more food and be able to get returns. That is the much I can say about the Agricultural Finance Corporation because hon. Members will have time to raise their points.Having done that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say something about the Kenya Ports Authority which is a very important institution that plays a very significant role in national development. It provides linkages and a gateway to international markets. Indeed, it is an inlet not only to Kenya but landlocked countries. So, it is a very important institution and that is why we have to look at how it performs. It is also another centre of transport network.Sir, the new inland container depots which is being organised under Kenya Ports Authority is also good, especially in the hinterland. From recent reports we are told that Kenya Ports Authority is doing quite well, but we will see how that continues. I would like' to thank the British Government for support¬ing Kenya Pors Authority with technical</Newspeech><Header> QUORUM </Header> <Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. As we pointed out earlier on, this is a very important Motion, and I would like to bring to the attention of the Chair that we; have no quorum.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): I agree with you. Ring the Division Bell.</Newspeech>(The Division Bell was rung)	<Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Order, hon. Members.We have a quorum now. Carry on, Dr. Misoi.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the hon. Member wantede the House to listen to me and I will now continue.Before that interruption, I was saying Chat the Kenya Ports Authority is an important institution and we would only urge them to continue improving the services they over to our people by way of handling goods speedily as possibleand minimising whatever malpractices that do exist. I have also thanked the British Government for the technical and financial aid it has given the Kenya Ports Authority. The institution has done very well because of the equipemnt which is being used there.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the financial report of the Kenya Ports Authority is in page 41. If you look at that page, that is the report for 1986. I will not say much about the amalgamation of the Kenya Ports Authority and the Kenay Cargo Handling Services in paragraph one because that was simply, procedural. However, looking at paragraph two, the heading is "Stores Stock".Stores stock worth KShs.175,150,744.00. How can you receive spare parts fromabroad and store the same as goods under transit for a long time? These are capital equipment acquired by the Authority but could not be correctly charged due to lack of price catalogue. Can you imagine that you get capital goods from abroad and yet there are no catalogues or prices? That was an unfortunate short¬sightedness. How do you receive these things? There must be documents. If that is not taken care of, it can be a loophole to call something something else and quote prices wrongly. This cannot be allowed and we pointed out to the Authority that in normal international business all details pertaining to a particular consignment must obviously be supplied with documents. How do you operate even a machine if you do not have those details? How do you assemble it? That was the question.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, paragraph three is another interesting one. It relates to advances, and I did point out that this question of advances is a very dangerous one. The advances were given to members of staff regularly in 1986. The Government funds parastatals and that does not mean that parastatals are charitable institutions to the members of staff; they should not give such advances. Many parastatals have failed to introduce adequate controls to safe-guard against the practices of officers even in the auction of surrendering of advances. When you take an advance you are supposed to surrender it within a given period. Those are the loopholes where institutions can lose money.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, paragraph four relates to petty cash advances. We are dealing with money now and not any goods. The Committee was given the evidence that there were no supporting documents which related to accounting documents for the former Kenya Cargo Handling Services Company. Therefore, without documents you do not know what money you are talking about and who took it. How can documents get lost and money disappear? Money cannot be given out without documents. We were given that report and the Committee noted that all the figures have since been analysed and, somehow, those documents surfaced. We do not know whether they were the real documents or not, but we were given that information. That information was given to the Auditor-General (Corporations) to check and certify. This is handling public money.Sir, paragraph five deals with standing imprests amounting to KShs.8 million by Kenya Cargo Handling Services Company. Can you imagine a sum of KShs.8 million being reflected as outstanding imprests? This man was outstand¬ing with the managing director, the chairman, some members of the board of directors and members of staff. This institution should institute; proper control mechanism for the business they are dealing in. Mismanagement of public funds cannot be allowed. We expect improvement in the of these corporations.                    which, is also highly irregular. How can that be alone? This is weak management structure. Paragraph 9 	under the Kenya Ports Authority 	is about several contracts with Housing of Finance company of Kenya where money was put and earning very low interest. Later the EFCK decided to revise the agreement alone without referring the matter to the kenya Ports Authority. That was serious. This company transferred Kshs.17 million to an account without consulting the management of Kenya Ports Authority. What type of controls are there? These are careless services. Paragraph 10 has various problems such as fraudulent entries, wrong figures and so on.The worst one is paragraph 14 which is about payment of salary for two years to an officer who absconded work. Can you imagine that, Sir?This officer received salary amounting to Kshs.91.719.30.  The Committee deplored the; payment of salary to that officer who had absconded duty for two years. The Committee also deplored the failure of the management to terminate the services of that officer in accordance with the Employment Act.The Committee, therefore, recommended that punitive measures be taken against the officers involved in this irregular payment.Another shaddy deal involves the Likoni housing Scheme where they dealt with somebody is not kr.owr. This is in respect to a Mr. Evans who was selling land to the Kenya Forts  Authority. The Committee was not happy with this matter. The Committee was told that Mr. Eans and Company was overpaid by over Kshs.1 million and yet it was not a registered firm. Unless our managers do a good job, then we are in trouble. This is not a registered company and it cannot, therefore; be traced. This company was paid Kshs.   million. Penalties have also 		other counter claims.  Sir, paragraph 7 is oven more interesting. Here we load about dishonoured cheques amounting over Kshs. 4 million That cannot be allowed to continue. This is 				Paragraph 3 is ovenowing money to the tune of Kshs. 3 million. These authorities should  be minimised because we are dealing regard to the Kenya Railways corporation would lilts to say about Kenya ports Authority..With regard to the Kenya Railways corporation, I would like to say that it has shown signs of improvement since is restructuring with the new executive Chairman. This is  the oldest network transportation which has done a lot in the development of this country. This corporation dates back to 1900s. we have not been able to open up new rail lines since we attained Independence. That is the only comment I would like to make, we expect this Corporation to open rail lines in urban centres where transport problems are acute.I would like to make two comments with regard to the Corporation accounts of 1984 on pages 54 to 59. These issues ought to have been taker, care of under the previous management. In this respect, the management could not know the value of the Corporation's assets after the collapse of the East African Community where an agreement was 		 and assets distributed The Corporation did not have records at that time to determine their assets.I said before that the practice of corporations writing off loans with the authority of the Government is serious. This should not be allowed to happen. During that year, the Kenya Railways corporation wrote off loans amounting to Kshs.175 million. This is in reference to paragraph 2. Why did they convert that loan and interest to equity contributions? The Committee expressed concern that the Corporation 	 wrote off the accumulated deficit instead of transferring the amount to 	. The Committee was concerned	the corporation 	of the parent Ministry and the Treasury. Mr. Temporary  Deputy Speaker, Sir, the next paragraph deals with had and doubtful debts; poor financial and	debtcollection management. As I said earlier on, this a serious disease and we have experts who can treat it. Some of the issues here are repeated in the 1985/86 Report and I do not wish to take too much time on them. But paragraph 12 of the Report if is very interesting. This relates to purchase of materials. Have you heard of a person who pays for goods that are never received? How can you pay for goods which are never received? That is not good business. That was from 1979 to 1985; they paid Kshs.1,863,000/- for goods which were never delivered. Nobody was there to make sure that the goods were delivered. Those are managers we are talking about. Those are the people who are supposed to manage our affairs. They even have a catering unit which is not making any money and food  business is very profitable. Even Asians are closing their shops to open food businesses. why is the Kenya Railways unable to make profits from its catering unit? If they are unable to make money they should employ the services of an expert from the private sector to help them. The only concern I have here is on budgetary controls. There was an over-expenditure which was not approved; of KSh.15 million. That is also with respect to catering. The reason is inadequate budgetary controls. That is the most serious point that I wanted to raise; that financial controls must be tightened in the institu¬tions we are talking about.The other Corporation that I would like to touch on is the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation. the Kenya Posts and  Telecommunications corporation is an. institution with far reaching impact on our social-economic life.  You can think of, the postal services and the impact they have; telecommunication services and how far they can go; radio	control; radio systems and speed post and telephone exchange senatesall over the country; money orders and so on. They have also installs telephone booths all over the country and everybody is using them even hon. Members. This is good service. There is also the STD service; you can make a call without passing through an operator also have the international subscriber system and dialling services which enables you to ring everywhere in this world.The other point relates to the manufacture of telephone exchanges and other equipment which is a new venture in this country. The aim is not only to meet the needs of this country out also to export these items to other countries. Here I am talkingabout the Gil Gil  Project. So, that is  in short, the service        the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation is giving tothe people of this country. We are all benefiting from this service.The Question of whether the services are satisfactory or not mayarise later. But at the moment I am talking about the importance ofthese services. The Corporation is serving industries, market centresurban centres, local and international trade. I say thisbecause communications are important; for pleasure and for business.These services are everywhere in the countryside. People do not haveto migrate to the cities because they have jobs in the rural areas.These services offered by this Corporation also attract otherdevelopment projects to the rural areas. This is one of	the largest corporations that we have in this country. Thereforethe management of tins huge institution is very important; it is evenmore than a department because it is in every market centre in thiscountry. So, the services of this Corporation. Have very farreaching implications to our development and therefore this organisa¬tion must be run properly and effectively. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I must say that there have been a few things here and there about the postals services in this country.  In the 1984 financial report, on page 83 of thisReport You know That is about six years ago. We  are really doinga postmortem hers. Here the AuditorGeneral (Corporations) says that there were too many errors and comissions. why can the Corporation not employ qualified accountants? We were told that these errors of commission and omission occurred, due to management problems that arose at the time of the merger of Kenya.  External Telecommunications and kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation. These errors have hidden losses which you cannot detect.The former Kenextel failed to pay KShs.286 million to the Government; this was supposed to be paid as tax and dividends. We want dividends to be paid to the Government because the Government is the investor. There was also as a problem regarding fixedassets. Documents are delayed. There was this title deed whenthe Kenextel was merged with the K.P.& T.C. All the documents should have been sorted out. They have remained with the lawyers. What are they doing? Is there something hidden? There is also lack of clear instructions regarding loans guaranteed by the Government. You cannot advance loans without clear instructions. I think this is a lot of money. I do not know how much it was. This should not be allowed to continue. The Government must give clear instructions	regarding these loans and the Corporations mustcomply. There are other problems like lack of balancing and cash in transit Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, 2ir, the other Report also 	points raised by the auditor and which committee looked at.One there is the question of creditors, where the s corporation had again not remitted telecommunication taxes of over Shs.300 million and the reasons they gave was cashflow problems. If we want the corporation to pay taxes we must pay for its services maintained to us. I do notknow ? why departments and Ministries do not pay for servicetelephones provided to them by the corporation Even the Minister responsible had to order the debtors to pay the corporations its dues.We might thus  blame the corporation for not paying dividends and taxes to the Government and yet our departments are not paying for the corporation's services. We should know that nonpayment of dues to the corporation will affect the corporation's ability to serve the private sectors, wananchi and farmers.There was also the issue of spare telephone numbers, which are used for testing and which had accumulated a high bill. Either somebody uses too much .while testing the equipment or it is used for private affairs; this is like theft.</Newspeech><Header> ADJOURNMENT </Header> <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr.  Kagwina): Hon.

This facilitywill be ready for opening by 31st March, 1991.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NDZAI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the health centre was completed three years ago and the completion of the maternity wing is being delayed because the room where the clothes after delivery are washed is not ready, and no delivery beds have been sent there. Could the Assistant Minister,therefore, tell the House when the delivery beds will be sent there and who the room where dirty clothes are washed after delivery will be ready?DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not know what iswrong with my hon. colleague. I said that the equipment will be supplied	and the maternity wing will be ready for opening by 31st March. 1991.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in all fairness Kshs.100 , 000 . 00 , is hot much for buying equipment for a health centre. Could Assistant Minister elaborate what kind of equipment is going to be Purchased with the Kshs.100,000.00, because equipping a maternity who in a health centre, is not a small job?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the hon. Questioner had listened to the supplementary question of the hon. Member who asked the principal question, he would have understood that the health centre was in fact, completed sometime back it is only the maternity wing and some other parts which are not yet fully serviceable. So, the money is not for equipping the entire health centre; it is for equipping the maternity wing.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEWA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I beg to defer with the Assistant Minister. I understand exactly what the supplementary question was and I know the equipment is for the maternity wing. I therefore, would be grateful if he could tell us the items which will be purchased with the Kshs.100,000.00. Are they going to purchase baby-cots, beds for the mothers, towels or whatever? He should explain that.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the original Question did not ask us to itemize things that we are going to buy, I am afraid. I do not have the complete list, but the equipments include.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEWA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. That is neither here there. The Question specifically asks the munsting to ensure that the maternity wing of Marafa Health Centre is completed. You cannot just brush it aside. To complete a maternity wing you have to specify what you are going to buy. You cannot just come and tell us here you have Kshs.100,000.00 set aside. What have you set aside that Kshs.100,000.00 for?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, with due respect to myhon . colleague, surely, he should not expect me to come with a list of so many towels, spoons, plates for the mothers and so on.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is theAssistant Minister in order when he is asked to specify what thatKshs . 100 , 000 . 00 is for, he starts to give his funny answers. Ishe therefore, in order not to answer what he has been asked?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, with due respect to my colleague, I do not give funny answers in the House. We give appropriate answers. The Questioner wanted to know when the maternity wing will be completed and I said veryclearly, by the 31st of March, 1990, it will be complete. I think	everybody here understands the phrase by the 31st of March, 1991.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WABUGE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from the answer by the Assistant Minister that the maternity wing would be open¬ed in March next year, has he taken into account the present economic situation prevailing in the country so that we are not told in March next year tint due to economic situation prevailing in the country the maternity wing cannot he opened? Has he now taken the economic situation into consideration?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir. up to this moment, we have taken into consideration all the factors that we know. However, hon. Members will understand that I cannot tell them that we have taken into consideration potential acts of God, or these measures which may arise between now and 1st March, 1991. We believe nothing intervening will disrupt us from that course.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KDZAI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has said that the maternity wing will be completed in March next year and it will cost KISh. 100,000/-. Can he give us the break¬down of that money?

How' can the Assistant Minister say that is a different question while it is a supplementary question on the same matter? What is the breakdown of the KSh.100,000/-?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Dr. Godana, I think it is a valid supplementary question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR.B.A. GODANA: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am much obliged. I think in all fairness, the hon. Questioner wanted to know when we shall get the wing operational, I said that we have commitment to get it operational by 31st March, 1991 I do not have the list of items of crockery, towels, poss, beds and so on right now. But if the hon. Member is interested in thatand not just the date the maternity wing will be operational, he is very much welcome to Afya Headquarters even today and we shall give him all the necessary breakdown.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr.LEWA: Mr.Speaker, Sir, some of the maternity wings that we have seen across the country are not adequately planned. Could the Assistant Minister explain how this maternity wing in Marafa is, and what does it comprise of? Does it have a labour unit, a delivery room and a room for babies after delivery?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir,  with all due respect, I think the Chair will agree with me that this is a totally different question from the original one.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has said that the maternity wing would be opened in March. 1991. This means that the money had already been voted for it by the Government. Can he tell us what are the causes of the delay? Yet women now require services of a maternity wing in the area.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B. A. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, March does not involve any delay because it is still well within the financial year which runs up to 30th June.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WABUGE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am still worried about this maternity wing. If the Assistant Minister has K5h. 100-, 000/- now, why can he not spend it to complete the maternity wing now before prices of commodities go up in March, 1991? what is hold¬ing him?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are in the process of spending all the money necessary to make this maternity wing . operational. However, hon. Members understand that the House has set certain regulations, laws and conditions for expenditure of public funds. We have to comply with certain formalities, say, tendering for equipment and procurement. So, we are going through that process without any waste of time.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

LEwA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, would the Assistant Ministerexplain why such projects were done because I am sure there wereproper surveys and studies done? Why do we have to wait foranother year before, these projects are completed?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. M'MSIKDIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the projects were Subidentified by Tetu Sub D.D.C. several years ago and there was KSh.9-5 million allocated to the projects up to the end of this financial year. Up to now, we have already spent well over KSh. 10.7 million That means we have already overspent whatever allocation we had. So, we are allocating money for the next two years. That is why we are saying that money will become available in 1991/92 financial year. Then we shall be able to complete the projects. But as of now, we have actually over-extended money on those projects.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the Assistant Minister, the estimate is far much below what they have spent and yet the projects have, not been completed. That has come in between the projection and the completion of the projects such that they have overspent and yet the initial plans have not been, achieved?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. M’MKINDIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the actual expenditureon the ground is normally different from the estimate. We areactually saying that we have spent money on the projects and weare still allocating money for the next two financial years.But there are s o many unforeseen things that happen in the meantime, Forinstance, cost overruns and things like that. For example! do notthink eight months ago anybody knew that Saddam Hussein would giveus the kind of problems he is giving us today. Therefore thereare so many unforeseen things that could happen to increase costs, The main problem has been increment in costs.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr.MWAMZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are not interested in the inefficiency of the officials in presenting the proper estimation. what we want to know is what was the actual cost of the projects. We have been told ,that so far this project has cost shs.10.7	million but we would like to know how much more is expected to be spent to complete the projects?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. M'MUKINDIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said earlier that the estimated amount of money to be append on these projects was Shs.9.5 million but as of now,we have, spend Shs.10.,7 million and we expect that during the next two financialyears, we shall need a total of Shs.9 million to actually complete the projects.As of this year, the estimated amount of money which we ought to have spentwas Shs. 9.5 million but we have actually overspent. This is why I am saying that with regard to theseprojects one cannot he 100 per cent sure how much will be spent up to thelast cent. It is not possible therefore for one to say how much altogether the project will have spent when completed, unless one is God and I do not think anyoneof us is claiming to be God. Therefore, we cannot predetermine to the verylast cent what each one of these projects Will consume since there are reviewsdone of the projects as we go along. Changes in cost will, of course, take place asthe projects are implemented.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in these particular projects, could theAssistant Minister tell us what are the specific variations that have made thecosting of the projects to be so high?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. M'MUKINDIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the biggest variation has been in the area of equipment, materials and transportationdue  the constant increase in the cost of equipment, materials and transportationHowever, this increase has been within the allowed range of about 12 per cent,but we could have been able to operate within the budgetary provision had it notbeen for the increase in the price of fuel- and I equipment. However, my Ministrythrough the Power and Lighting Company, has done very well in, Spending all themoney that was allocated to these projects before the end of the financial joar,and I do not know why the hon. Member is complaining. We hope what we shall more money next year for these projects and be able to complete them  MR.

SPEAKER: Still nobody froM the Ministry? Let us go onto Questions by Private Notice.</Newspeech>(Question deferred)<Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. There is a serious issue here in that taxpayers expect services from this House but, here, we can see a whole Minister and his Assistant Ministers, who have absented themselves from the work that has been vested upon them by His Excellency the President. Could we be given an opportunity to debate the Ministry of Public Works so that we can air our views on such absent¬eeism? It is a habit on the part of the Minister and his Assistant Minister to be absent from the House when their Questions are called. I think some of them do not even go to their offices to see what answers are there for them to come ans give to the House. That is why we see some saying they do not have the appropriate replies, others say the replies are inadequate and such answers and even that they are not ready to answer. Can we be given an opportunity to discuss the Ministry? I think this is the cause of lack of quorum everyday in the House because Ministers and Assistant Ministers do not take their responsibilities seriously. We now have so many Questions with no Ministers or Assistant Ministers to answer! Let us have your guidance, Sir, so that we could, possibly, discuss this tendency and, maybe, compel the Ministers and Assistant Ministers to honour the responsibilities they were bestowed by His Excellency the President. They were appointed to work for the public and not just to earn salaries and go wherever they want. That is very unfair to the taxpayers.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. ole Kaparo): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. what the hon. Member has just said is not quite true, that the Minister for Public Works perpetually fails to answer Questions. On the contrary, the Minister for Public Works has aQuestion to answer in the House almost on a daily basis. Those Questions have always been answered. We do not know what could have transpired today. On the question of quorum, the hon. Member is exaggerating the issue. The lack of quorum in the House is no: occasioned by the absence of Ministers and Assistant Ministers.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Yes, it is.</Newspeech><Newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. ole Kaparo): Mr. Speaker, Sir, the quorum of the House is 30 Members and hon. Mwamzandi is not going to convince me at all that the Back bench cannot constitute 30 Members.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. My point of order is on the same point that Ministers and Assistant Ministers ought to be here. I have personally been an Assistant Minister and what I know is that the weekly order papers are despatched in advanced so that Ministers and Assistant Ministers know what is expected of them every day in the House The excuse that Ministers and Assistant Ministers may not be aware of what is happening in the House is not true; they are fully aware. All I can say is that they are ignoring their responsibilities, and this is a serious matter.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Omido): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I just want to reiterate the point made by hon. ole Kaparo. The question of quorum in the House does not only affect the Ministers and Assistant Ministers. Every hon. Member of this House has a responsibility and duty to attend the business of the House. The Ministers and Assistant Ministers have always endeavoured to be present to answer Questions. However, some of the replies we get are unsatisfactory and, in our view, there is no use of just giving a reply for the sake of it. We have to be satisfied that the answer we are giving is correct to satisfy those who raise the Questions.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Hon. ole Kaparo suggested that the Back Benchers are more than the Front Benchers and that is not true. He said, actually, that the Back Benchers are more than 30 and so can make the required quorum; hence suggesting that if all the Front Benchers could walk cue of the House and we are left here with nobody to keep record of what we are saying. Is that in order for the hon. Member to make such a suggestion that a House of only Back Benchers can be left to operate here? What kind of a House would that be? I insist all of us must be in the House and a workable situation where only Back Benchers are in the House will never materialise. Can we have guidance from the Chair?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. ole Kaparo) On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I was just responding to an allega¬tion made by hon. Mwamzandi that the lack of quorum in the House is because of the absence of Ministers and Assistant Ministers. That cannot be true in any sense at all. We all know that the quorum of the House is 30 Members and that number can easily be constituted by 30 Back Benchers. If 30 of them turned up, the issue of lack of quorum would not arise. As to the question of absence of one Minister and his Assistant Ministers to answer Questions in the House this morning, may I point out to the House that this same morning, not less than four Back Benchers were absent to ask their Questions.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

MOMANYI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister of Stare, Office of the President the following Question by Private Notice.Why did the Ministry terminate the service of Mr. Zepnsnia Tengenya, P/No. 215 324, formerly attached to the Police Department, as per Ministry's letter No. SEC/POL. 1/2/40/75 dated 15th .November. 1990?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Keen): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Ministry terminated the services of Mr. Sephania Tengeya P/No. 216 824 on 16th November, 1990 because he was irregularly employed as a clerical officer which contravened the laid down recruitment regulations within the Civil Service.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.H.O MOMANYI: How many people had their services terminated in that particular department?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEEN: Sir. I did not hear the question. Can the hon.Member repeat it?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.H.O. MOMANYI: How many people were dismissed in That particular police department?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEEN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, Mr. Zephania was recruited as a civilian staff which is officially done by the departmental selection hoard under the chairmanship of the administrative officer represendingthe Permanent Secretary, representatives of the Directorate of Personnel Management and the Public Service Commission are also included. The vacancies are advertised in the local newspapers. The last departmental selection board met on 26th June, 1990 Tengenya was recruited by by-passing this procedure by a senior personnel officer who has since been suspended to pave way for investigation.All those who were employed irregularly have had their services terminated and a possible court action is being contemplated against the senior personnel officer Therefore. Mr. Tengenya is not the only one whose services were terminated because about 30 to 100 officers were removed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.KUBO: While appreciating what the Assistant Minister has said in respect to the correct procedure which should be followed when recruiting officers into the Civil Service. I would like to say that Mr.Tengenya is not the only person who has been employed through short-cuts. In view of the fact that Mr. Tengenya had been given a personal number which means it had taken some time before he was confirmed what action is the Assistant minister taking to ensure that those who have been recruited are not victimised because they always assume that they have been employed through the right channel? why should they be victimised when we knew that this province isoperating almost everywhere?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.KEEN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are a lot of irregularitiesIn this country and I Think the time has come when they should be straightened.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr.MAGARA:Mr. Speaker Sir the assistant  minister has said that mr. Taegenya but employed irregular but he was asked to state how many people from this department were given dismissal letters. He has notresponded to that question. Can he rive us the names of the people who wereserved with dismissal letters?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEEN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the House so desires, I Will giveall the names.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Tengenya and his friends thought theywere not contravening any regulations Whatsoever realising the fact thatthis young man ±3 is in need of employment and also realising the fact that the Office of the President is stamping out nepotism  would the Assistant Minister consider reinstating these people and take disciplinary action against that officer who knew for certain that he was contravening certain regulations?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEEN: I am not prepared to consider their cases now. The officer who contravened the regulation has been suspended and court action is being contemplated. Until I know the outcome, I am afraid I am unable to consider the cases of Mr. Tengenya and his friends.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIILU: Mr. Speaker; Sir. what is the Ministry doing to ensure that this personnel officer does net repeat the same mistake?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEEN: I made the position very clear to the effect that the officer concerned has been suspended pending court action, I think that is the best we can do for the time being.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir. earlier on the Assistant Minister stated that are a lot of irregulations going on in the country and is the high time it was stopped. What action is the offices if the president to ensure that these irregulations are put to an end?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.KEEN: MR. Speaker Sir, …………….Member can read me.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. KUBO: On a point of order. Sir. The  Assistant Minister admitted that there are irregularities and he was asked to explained what the Government is doing to make sure that they are put to an and in as far as recruiting civil servants is …..to remove these irregularities. Cases of head Counts in various Ministries ahich took place two or three years age would still continue. Everything possible will be done to correct the situation. I think Kenya’s have the habit of worshipping money than God.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order Sir. I think the assistant Minister should not be left unchallenged with regard to the remark he made the Kenyans worship money Than Gcd. I think he should have said 'some Kenyans'and not 'all Kenyans'. I for example; worship and not money. If he is among those who worship money instead of God. then I sympathise with him. Can he withdraw that? Sir, not all Kenyans worship money. Even you. Sir, I do not think you worship money but God. That is why we always see you going to. worship in the chapel here every Wednesday. Is the Assistant Minister in order to allege that?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEEN: Those who worship money are those who do things irregularly  contrary to the laid down regulations. These who have no respect for society and morality. Those are the people I am referring to.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. SPEAKER: Next Question.</Newspeech><Header>wrong Location for Yatta Toll Station</Header><Newspeech>MR.

Attorney-General and one from the Office of the President, requesting that discussions on two Bills deferred and not be withdrawn. The whole Press got it all wrong and reported all over that the Government had withdrawn two Bills. The correct position is that no Bill was withdrawn by the Government only discussion on the Bills was deferred. Withdrawing Bills and deferring discussion on them are two totally different things.

I on a point of order regarding the heavy cuts in public spending that appears in today's Kenya Times. This is a very big decision by the Government which will affect Kenyans. Considering the way the Office of the Vice-President and ministry of Finance has put it, this House needs clarification as to what has gone wrong with our economy. I do not think the Gulf crisis has tremedousl; affected our domestic economy so much that the Government should decide to cut public spending by 40 per cent. The Office of the Vice President and Ministry of Finance says the Government will not fill all the vacancies in the Ministries, which is contrary to the Government policy of creating employment in the country. This House approved this year’s Budget and the Government says it will cut budgeted expenditure by 15 per cent without the knowledge and Consent of this House As the people’s representatives, I think we entitled to clarification, explanation and, as the people who debated and approved the Budget, we should offer comments on the issue.

BIDU: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to continue supporting this Motion. Last week I was thanking the Mover for his timely Motion.First of all I should congratulate the Ministry of Culture and Social Services for encouraging women groups to be what they are today. Kenyan women as a whole have proved that they are capable of handling their affairs. So, while I support the Motion, feel that the Ministry should assist women, groups acquire plots all over the country.Considering the much NGOs have done for this country Ifeel that they should not be given conditions as where they should implement their own projects. I say so because some areas havepowerful politicians who can influence NGO aid while those without such s politicians will miss NGO assistance. But if the NGO are allowed to work on their own without being asked to go through district commissioners and DDC they will be able to assist the more deserving areas first. Unless we do this the DDCs or powerful politicians can decide to divert NGO projects from high priority areas to low priority areas.That is why you find that many women groups are not strong enough. Nongovernmental organisations have been told to operate through district commissioners and district development committees. It is the wish of women groups to be given as much aid as possible to enable them to initiate many development projects.A woman is always important because all of us came from women. I am happy that our Government considers women to be equal to men, and that we do not discriminate either party against the other. There are some rural projects that are given impact by women groups. In semi—arid rural areas, it is women groups that beg the Ministry to give support to development projects. Sometimes, we have water in these areas, but we may not have pipes to supply it. If women groups there are financed by the Government, I am sure we will ease some of the problems that affect the country as a whole.Not all women groups are rich. In fact, some of them cannot initiate development projects although they would wish to do so. This is because they do not have the necessary money. This is why my hon. friend thought it wise to move this Motion requesting the Government to give such groups support. As you can see, most of us depend on women groups and, whereas some of might beg for money and fail to get it, if a women group goes through the proper channels in asking for assistance, it gets it. In Kinango, for example, we have many women groups but, because of lack of funds, they are dormant and cannot operate effectively. So, I request the Government to consider assisting all women groups, not only in Changamwe but all over Kenya, to enable them to initiate big projects in our constituencies.Mr. Speaker, Sir, you will find that we do not have many problems in big towns as we do in dry rural areas. If the Ministry of Culture and Social Services comes forward and assists women groups in rural areas, I am sure we will make a lot of development without much of a problem. It is my sincere hope that the Minister concerned is not going to oppose this Motion, which is very well constructed. Since the Minister has already amended the Motion, I am sure he is going to accept it totally. My request to him is that he ensures that, now	that we know that non—governmental organisations operate through the district commissioner and the district development committee, these organisations start their development projects where they want to do so without being given conditions: I would request the Government to lift the condition that projects to be started by non-governmental organisations pass through district development committees. Whenever there is need for a development project, non-governmental organisations should be allowed to start it in consultation with the leaders of the particular place concerned.With these few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to support this Motion because the aim of the Motion is very good. We should agree that women groups should be assisted. These groups, which fall under the Ministry of Culture and Social Services, are there to foster development of the Republic. Some of these groups keep poultry while other cultivate some crops, but they have not been much encouraged to survive. I know for certain that some district development committees have helped these groups with money from the Rural Development Fund, but they need to be helped even much more in order to make their labour productive. It is upon the Government to see that, in addition to the Rural Development Fund money that we give these groups, we assist these groups to apply for bank loans. In my area, we have women groups who collect makuti for thatching houses, but these groups get very little money because they have not been assisted to buy vehicles and invite tenders for the purchase of their makuti direct from big hotels. There is always a middleman who exploits these groups. We have not assisted these groups well enough to make them self—reliant in transporting their makuti to the places where they are required. We have not assisted the women groups which keep poultry to nable them to get loans from, say, the Agricultural Development Corporation.This is because they do not have security. We have many women groups which have collapsed because of financial problems.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member for Changamwe wants women groups in Mombasa to be allocated, plots without discrimination. I am sure they have not been discriminated against, and I hope that the Minister responsible will ensure that this desire is affected. There is no point of leaving these women to construct houses on people's land. What happens is that when the women construct houses on somebody's land, that land is mortgaged and if the honour cannot pay the loan he acquires the property of the women group is sold together with that land. This is very unfair. I have an example in my area of a women group which was going to build a house on a school compound because they could not be allocated land. If it is the Government intention that we encourage development through women groups, then we should look into ways and means of assisting these groups entirely; we should not leave them alone.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I remember another women group at Shimoni that built a house to let to the medical staff at Mkwiro Dispensary. But my worry is, if that land does not belong to that women group, there is danger in that they do not have security. The fact that they own the house is not enough security for them to acquire a loan from a bank. As we know, the bank will ask for security and we also know that land is the best security one can offer. You cannot use a building on somebody's land to acquire a loan. It is, therefore, upon the: Minister for Culture and Social Services to liaise with the Minister for Lands, Housing and Physical Planning so chat these women are given land not only in Changamwe Constituency but everywhere in the Republic. We should encourage them so that they can feel that they are benefiting from such projects. The Minister for Culture and Social Services should draw a Cabinet Paper so that this matter is taken seriously.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government is spending a lot of money trying to help women groups because, otherwise, we cannot help them. We have also seenwomen groups being discriminated against when it comes to assisting them with the Rural Development Fund. A district social services officer assist the women group that entertains him more and, thereby, leaving other groups entirely desperate. We do not want to see this sort of discrimination. Why should a particular women group benefit from the Rural Development Fund every year when others are left out? It is because a social services officer is entertained more by that particular group.With those few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KITELE: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to air my views on this Motion.Sir, this is a good Motion, only that it is talking about one particular, constituency Changamwe. I do agree with the Mover of the Motion, and I wish to inform the House that we all face the same problem when it comes to assisting women groups. This being a National Assembly, we are supposed to talk nationally. It is true that a lot of women groups have problems in getting plots. If local authorities could give women groups priority when it comes to land allocation, that would be a very good idea. After all, women groups are doing a lot in the development of this nation; they are a force to reckon with. If they could be allocated plots, even after paying something small, that would be a very good idea.Mr. Speaker, Sir, although some women groups have funds to put up buildings, they cannot do it because they have no plots. In many areas you can¬not get any vacant plots. If the local authorities cannot allocate women plots, then that makes it very impossible for them to forge ahead. I know that it is difficult to get plots in areas like Nairobi, Mombasa and other urban areas, but everything should be done to ensure that priority is given to women groups wherever possible.The other thing I wish to touch on is how Women groups can be helped with funds. It is true that we have some women groups who do not have any moneyand I think the time has come when we: should ensure that women groups are assistedto get some funds. We can assist them with the Rural Development Fund or the Ministry of Culture and Social Services can allocate funds for this purpose. I know it may not be possible to budget for the many women groups in the country because some constituencies have more than even 10 of them. Indeed, they keep on increasing every year. But still the Ministry of Culture and Social Service's can have a programme on how to assist them.	Mr. Speaker, Sir, Changamwe Constituency seems to behaving a pressing need regarding the problems facing women groups and that is the reason why I support this Motion and urge that they be given plots as requested. But I would also like to say that all constituencies in the country are facing	similar problems. I saythis because there are women groups in every constituency in this country. These women groups are very important to this nation. unless you have the backing of these women groups you can hardly be elected to represent people in this House. I support this Motion because women will always tell you the truth; others say "Yes" but sometimes that	"Yes" is not always an honest answer. But when women say"Yes" they really mean it. If they tell you that they will vote foryou, that is exactly what they are	going to do. That is thereason why we, as Members of Parliament, are seriously asking theGovernment, through the Ministry of Culture and Social Services, to assist these women groups. This is because they play a vital role in the development of this country. Therefore ways and means should be found to fund the projects that have been initiated by these women groups.If you go to Kariakor today you will see manywomen there selling those traditional baskets known as kyondo in Kikamba. But these women have problems in marketing their baskets. You will find that some smart fellows go there and buy those kyondos very cheaply and export them to Europe	where they fetch a lot of money. It is therefore time that the Government looked into this, problem. The activities of these women	who make kyondosshould be placed under the Ministry of Technical Hairing and Applied Technology.Mr. Speaker, Sir in my constituency, we have projects that have been, initiated by women groups but thesewomen groups are unable to implement some of the projects due to lack of funds, we have some buildings that are half-built and we have tried to raise money through Harambee to complete these buildings but we have not succeeded. So, I think: the Government should look for ways and means of raising funds to fund these projects because that would be a	wonderful idea. I think these women groupsshould be given soft loans to enable them to implement their projects. I know that this will	help hon. Members because although thisparticular Motion here is talking about women groups in Changamwe, all Members have an interest in women groups all over the country . because there are women groups in every constituency. The Government should formulate a policy that will cover every women group in Kenya., It is indicated on the Order Paper that the Motion has been amended but I do not know how it has been amended.Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are some women groups engaged in poultry keeping. This is a bit expensive because first of all chicken feed is very expensive. Looking after chicks is very expensive because they need electricity and other things. So, these women groups need some help from the Ministry of Culture and Social Services.There are also other women groups with posho mills. The problems here is that they do not make enough profits and as a result of this they do not have money for repairs and other costs of running the posho mills. Therefore these groups should be given some financial assistance by the Ministry. I urge the Ministry to accept this Motion. The Ministry should not kill the Motion. I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER EOR TECHNICAL TRAINING AND APPLIED TECHNOLOGY (Mr. Thuo) : Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to contribute to this Motion. First of all I congratulate the Member for Changamwe, my friend, hon. Kiliku, for bringing this Motion. I thank him because although the Motion talks about women groups in Changamwe Constituency, I think it also gives hon. Members a chance to air their views on the activities of women groups in their constituencies as well, When we talk of Changamwe we can also touch on other areas. But let us accept that the Mover has a problem in his constituency. He wants women groups to be supported by way of allocating plots to them. He says that they should not be discriminated against but I do not know in which way they are being discriminated against I say this because fairness should be seen to be done when plot allocations are being done. Our people should be looked after well because they are all Nyayo people. If there has been some kind of discrimination against women groups in Changamwe, then I think that has not been a fair thing at all. If such a thing is happening anywhere in this country it should be brought to an end because we are supposed to serve our people without discrimination.It has been said that if you educate a man you have educated only one person but that when you educate a women you are educating a nation. In the same vein, I would say that by assisting women we are assisting the nation. This is because women are closer to where our local problems are If woman groups are supported you will find that the money these groups will generate in terms of profits will find its way into our homes« So, you can see that we are not just assisting women; we are in fact assisting ourselves, through women groups.Women are known to be closer to our homes where, local activities take place. Therefore, the need for women croups to be assisted cannot be over-emphasized. I think this is a story that speaks for itself. I have attended DDC meetings in Muranga where some of the money that we get from Rural Development Fund (RDF)  it is a very small amount finds its way to women groups. I would appreciate if in future the Ministry of Culture and Social Services would be given more money by the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance for .assisting women groups throughout the Republic. The question of giving assistance in piece meal will not help the women groups the way we would like them to be assisted.Equally, I would like to say that women are trusted; hardly do they cheat. I would, therefore, urge banks in the country to be a bit flexible towards our women groups. They suffer because they are not constituted as companies and, therefore, when they approach the banks they get a very unfair listening. I think it is for us maybe we can get this assistance from the appropriate Ministry, the Ministry of Culture and Social Services, possibly with the support of the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance to ensure that banks are seen to assisting women groups to undertake viable projects. If they are assisted with proper management they can start assisting their members. That is very important.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I feel that women should be educated by their fellow women. Therefore, Maendeleo ya wanawake has a roleto play here. For example, the organisation should hold seminars where they can go and talk to the women on what is required of them Those seminars should not be ignored even by the local leaders, district commissioners, Members of Parliament, councillors and the like. They should all attend these meetings so that they can hear about these problems from closer quarters.So, when we go to D.D.C. meetings  places for discussing development  then we know how we could assist women groups.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have very many women groups in Kigumo and I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for the good work they have been able to do with meagre resources in terms of money. I know we have conducted some Harambee fund raising meetings for them so .as to make them viable arid profitmaking enterprises.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to say, just like I have done in the past, that I will continue, together with the other leaders in Kigum,to assist all the women groups in the area.Coming to Changamwe and other areas in the Republic, Iwould-like to say that we do not have to over emphasise the roleof women groups. If we do not have money, nothing or no projectwould be expected to go on. We can come up with good suggestionsand ideas, but nothing tangible would come out of them withoutmoney. For instance, women groups are keeping chicken, lookingafter goats, making concrete blocks and so on. They are alsokeeping bees and they can also do co-operative farming and so on.The whole idea boils down to money. It is like starting orsetting up an industry. One might have very brilliant ideas, butwithout money, there is nothing much he can achieve. Therefore,the idea by hon. Kiliku is very good. In fact, I would like womengroups in my constituency to be given a plot in every sub-locationso that they can start small projects of their own. I am sure inthe long run, these small projects will turn out to be viable jua kali projects. So, the question of giving women groups lots is import with those few remarks, Sir. I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>ME. KIRWA: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to contribute to this, very important Motion.First of all, when we talk of plot allocation, in allfairness, any group, be it. a women group or a church organisation,should be given priority over individuals. But the tendency thatwe have, we, as individuals in good positions or in powerfulpositions, have tended to deny the chance to this particular groupand instead give those plots to ourselves. This is unfair becausewhen we give it to a women group it serves a larger communitythan when we give it to an individual, ho natter how viable theproject is. This is the situation that we should look at in allaspects, not only in women groups but in all aspects of our development because there is no development that is goingjust for an individual better than development that is going to caterfor a large group of people.Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we look at many women groups inour country we can say that many of them are politically inspired.What I mean by that is that many of the women groups might have been set up with assistance of the local politicalsome of whom might not be in power at the moment, and these womengroups have had the predicament of having to face some otherpoliticians opposed to the former groups. This is the situationthat we should try to discourage as much as possible in our country.	The women groups, as they are, may have their own political inclinicationjust like any other group in this country, but they have also tobe given a chance to survive. Therefore, political considerationsshould be avoided. I say so because when we look at the entirecountry we realise that in particular areas where there are somehighly placed politicians there is a tendency for a large donationto go to those women groups. This is a big problem because whatwe need is economical appraisal of all the women groups.We should give them donations or assistance according to their ability to expand but not according to their political motivation. This is the situation, if we have to develop as a country, we must very much try to discourage.The other issue, Sir, is that some areas might be fortunate such that every location or sub-location has strong women groups.But when we go to some of the districts in our republic, we findthat some women groups are a± the verge of collapse, or they are there already “dead” and they are just there on record, I urge the Ministry to do a thorough investigation and see whether thewomen groups they have are economically viable or not, and if not they should try to look for a way to assist them. But if it is not possible, to assist them, then the best thing is to trim them down to a number that is manageable. There is no need for us to have so many women groups scattered all over in our country but they are not useful to the people. I am sure these people could have done something else that could have assisted our country. But now in the name of the group, they always have some hope that is like a diminishing shadow. This is a situation we should try to avoid as a country because what is important is what we are going to do at the end of the day for this country.The other issue, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that this group should be given some expert knowledge or advice such that before a project is started, the person responsible at the district level or constituency level should be able to look at the viability of that particular project and advise them on alternative avenues through which they could start better projects. But this personal relationship must be there so that if the channel they are already using is not going to yield much, then they should be given an alternative channel through which they can survive,The other issue, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that we should try as much as possible to encourage auditing of these parti¬cular organisations because auditing is useful in the sense that any money that cones is not going to be tailored to meet theindividual needs of the officials manning them, but it is goingto be channelled to the entire projects. This is what we need in every department or even in any other group because it is the only way we can know whether we are on the right course or not, and if we are not, then what do we do to come to the right courseMr. Speaker, Sir, in many of the woman groups there are social workers people who are supposed to advise them  but some of them are only stationed in divisional headquarters, or their homes. They do not have means of mobility. They do not move from their offices to the, field. So, the Ministry should look for a way of trying to these people so that the officers involved are able to move from one place to another and see what is going on the ground. It is not enough just to get a report at the end of the month to say that so many women groups have done this and that. This is the situation that should be very much encouraged so that these officials can travel,Now, the other issue, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that we have large conglomeration of women groups. ?or instance, we have KANU Women Group under the Ministry of Culture and Social Services and also KANU Maenaelec ya Wanawake. I would urge the Ministry to carry out a study into how all these women groups can be co-ordinate The tendency is that if I run fast enough I get something for my group, but if another politician does not run fast enough, he does not get anything for his group.What we need is a comprehensive policy on how these women groups could he streamlined, lie know that Kanu  Maendeleo ya wanawake is the umbrella of these women groups hut the question is it a stable umbrella? what ought to be done is a comprehensive research to see how these groups could ho streamlined. The Ministry on the other hand should be able to give encouragement to these women groups to nave one coordinating body so that trey can Know what they are doing. I am saying this because what is happening now is that we have so little assistance to these groups and when it is distributed to the various groups, it is not h able to do anything. When we sit at the district development committee meeting, we sometimes give. Shs.5,000/- to one worn en group while we may give Shs 2,000/ or Shs. 1,000/- to another group, hut this is far from being adequate. This money is not enough to buy stationery alone if the group is doing a serious business Therefore, the Ministry os Culture and Social Services should try to bring all the women groups together and once they are together, then something could be done to assist themewith those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>ME. KIILU: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to support this Motion. First of all, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Mover of this Motion because as we all know, women groups in this country have been playing a very important role in development.All these women groups are very loyal to the Government and therefore, the Govern¬ment should give them adequate assistance. What is import.ant for these groups is proper guidance by the leaders concerned so that they can play their role effectively. At the same time, it is important for the Ministry of Culture and Social Services to give enough; support to these women groups throughout the country so that they can feel encouraged to continue with their various activities. For this reason, the Ministry of Culture and Social Services, should have a specific provision through which enough funis should be provided to these women groups Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to this Motion, only women group's in Changamwe are being mentioned and I think it would have been best if the Moverof the Motion, included other women groups throughout In this way.all the women groups in the entire country would feel that this. Houses recognisesthe role that they are playing in our development. In order to encourage theseWomen groups, the Ministry of Culture and Social Services should look for donorsto assist these groups to complete the various projects which they nave alreadystarted. The Ministry should also take up the responsibility of supervisingthese projects so that they are implemented and completed without undue delay.It is although through the Ministry's participation in the activities of thevarious women groups in the country, that we can have efficient and qualifiedofficers to assist these women groups.Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is also important for the Ministry of Culture andSocial Services to assist these women groups in acquiring plots. This could easilyhe done through the district development committees which Would give first priorityto women groups when it comes to allocation of plots. If the district developmentcommittee recommends that a certain women group should be allocated plots,eitherthe Municipal council or the county council concerned, should release the plots in question. In this way, the women groups would feel that they are  well recognised by the district development committees. without such encouragement, these women groups cannot be effective and I am sure that the Government will continue to assist then;. As we all know, women are very loyal to our Government and they do not create problems to anybody and what they really need is assistance and guidance on how to manage their projects. Therefore, if these women groups would receive the proper assistance and guidance, they would continue to generate a lot of development within the country. With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, First of all, I would like to the all the hon. Members who have been able to contribute in support of this Motion. Although there has been a slight amendment, I am glad that it has not changed the original intention of the Motion. I do not want to repeat what I said  earlier on when I was moving this Motion, but I would like to say that the most important thing now is for the Ministry of Culture social services to co-ordinate the marketing of products emanating from these women groups. 		We have, for example, women groups which are making very beautiful ciondosand other handbags. At the moment these women groups are not selling these products direct to the consumers- abroad and it would be best for the Ministrymoment exploiting  Our Women, groups by offering very minimum prices or those goods. You will find that these middlemen sell these ciendos at very high prices In the international market. I appeal to the Ministry to find alink between our women groups and the consumers abroad so that these women groups are able to export these ciondos directly instead of having to sell them through middlemen. I am saying this because it has been discovered that there are certain, people who are out to exploit these women groups, especially, the non-indigenous people of this country. The Ministry should feel concerned about the plight of our women groups by assisting them to get a good market where to sell their products.Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is also important for the Ministry to organise seminars for women groups at the divisional level in order to educate women about project activities. Through these seminars, women would be able to engage in viable projects which would assist their standard of living especially in the rural areas. I am sure that if the Government could come out to assist these women groups, they would be able to realise some amount of profits. I would also called upon country leaders and politicians as well, not to use these women groups as their political or leadership platform. we do not want to see a situation where politicians use these women group as their political platforms where they issue political statementInstead, they should also come, out to assist them in goofaith and spirit. As we all it now, these women groups a indigenous citizens of this country and since the Government supper the policy of indigenization, it should come out in full support of women groups, not only in Changamwe, but in the entire country.The truth of the matter is that we cannot put the economy of this Country into the hands of the indigenous people unless We take control of our development. One Way of doing this is by assisting These women groups.When talking about plots, I am appealing to the Minister, who is listening to me, because soon the Mombasa Municipal Council is going to sub-divide some plots in Chaani and Mikindani. That is why I talked about women groups in Changamwe Constituency. I know, as a Member of Parliament, that We should talk of women groups throughout the country but, that was a signal to the problems that we have in Changamwe Consti¬tuency. We have land scarcity in the constituency and, as such, these women groups must be assisted to get plots. That is why I told the Minister to liaise with the Mombasa Municipal Council to make sure that women groups in Changamwe Constituency are allocated plots in Chaani and Mikindani.Sir, we know there is the Gulf Crisis going on, but that crisis should not be taken as a cover-up not to commit ourselves to the develop¬ment of our economy. We appreciate that there are problems caused by that Gulf Crisis, which we cannot-control. However, we should educate our people on the problems we have so that they can also understand. We should not just make decisions without explaining why they have to be made. I know that the people of this country are peace loving and would like to be educated on how the problems affect the economy of the country, particularly arising from the Gulf Crisis.There was one very pertinent point raised by hon. Kirwa. The Ministry should make sure that the books of accounts of these women groups are accounted for. The money so given by the Government must be accounted for. The women should be cautioned against misuse of public funds or misallocation of the money that will be allocated to them by the Govern¬ment. At the same time, the Ministry should be seen to be helping these women in their concerns. Sometimes, you notice that the local district development committees are not attended by representatives from the relevant Ministries. It must be seen that such representatives are therein the meetings so that then we talk of such, women groups' problems, the relevant Ministry's representatives; respond on behalf of their Ministry at that level.I talked about discrimination because it is unfair to give a given women group a grant this year, another next year and so on when we have so many women groups all over the Republic that are not getting any financial assistance. It would be better for us to have a fair distri¬bution of our resources of the Government. unless that happens, we will have many women groups complaining of not being assisted. I think the Government must keep records of those women groups that have been assisted so that those that have not been assisted can also be assisted. The women groups should also be advised that if they have similar projects, they should not just go ahead and make requests from all quarters for similar projects. They should diversify their projects so that they are not all the same.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am appealing to the Ministry to design a building for a big bakery in Changamwe Constituency to be owned by the women group I have talked about because there is a very big demand for bread in the area. The bakery in Changamwe is owned by non-indigeno us people and I think the Ministry should assist the women group along that line of business. I have been given to understand that women in the area are very good at that baking business and can succeed if so assisted.Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Ministry is less committed about women groups. It should be vocal and be seen to be assisting such groups. This is because there is money but nobody knows how the allocation of the funds is made. A Sessional Paper should be brought to the House detailing how these women groups are going to be assisted. Because of the current unemployment crisis, most of these women are idle but, when they group themselves as such, they become active and participate in the developmentof the economy.Before I finalise, let me emphasize the point that those Indianswho are currently exploiting women by buying ciondos at very minimal prices and selling them to the United States of America, or even in Britain, should be curbed. The Ministry should find a way of assisting the women to export those commodities direct to those markets. I was in Seattle in the United States and found that one kiondo was selling at Ksh.300/-, but the Asians are buying them from the local women at Ksh.40/- and so on. With those few remarks, I beg to move.</Newspeech>(Question put and agreed to) <Header>MOTION</Header>Review of Funding Policies in Secondary Schools	<Newspeech>MR. KUBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move:THAT, in view of the fact that most parents whose children are in secondary schools belong to the low income group and realising that most Boards of Governors in these schools have raised the fees payable in 1991 in the form of various extra payments in addition to the tuition, boarding and examination fees thereby making it difficult for most students to pursue their studies, this House urges the Government to instruct the Boards of Governors to withdraw the system of charging the extra fees and review the policy .regarding the funding of these secondary schools.(Mr. Speaker left the Chair)(The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Wabuge) took the Chair) Sir, in moving this Motion, let me say that in this Motion we are guided by the Kanu Manifesto regarding development of education, 	The Kanu Manifesto, since the attainment of Independence, has beenvery clear on the fact that we have to fight illiteracy in the country.	.	. -So,I will start by saying that in pursuing this objective of eliminating illiteracy, the Government has done, a lot. I am taking this opportunity to congratulate the Government for that. A lot of schools have been built, from the primary level through the high school level up to the university. I would also like to congratulate the public for the assistance throughHarambee fund-raising contributions, and so on.In particular, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, in pursuit of this goal. I take this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency the President because, even as we are here new, he is conducting a Harambee fund-raising meeting in aid of Butere Girls High School. It is a well-known policy in this country that we are very determined to make sure that education is maintained and that everybody gets an opportunity for higher education.I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the boards of governors who have done a lot of gratuitous work in the sense that they are not normally paid anything. I know that they are very determined and work hard. By bringing this Motion, therefore, let me not be misunderstood to mean that I am not appreciating the work that is already going on. My concern has been regarding the people of the low income groups.</Newspeech><Header>QUORUM</Header><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker.

If you take the example of somebody earning less than Kshs. 1:000.00, you Will find that it is not easy for such a ears on to afford paying school feesAs the House will notice, from my Motion, I am not questioning the payment of school fees, boarding fees and examination fees because I know that the Ministry has already made its policy clear on these issues. I also know that the Ministry has given its guidelines as to how much should be charged in these areas. My major concern is with regard to extra payments in the form of Harambees which are normally lumped together as PTA funds.I am sure most hon. Members here are aware of the fact that most schools are charging more on these extras than the other fees that I have talk.; about. This practice has made it impossible for students from poor families to attend school. Even where charitable organisations assist such families, they only opt to meet the fees that I stated before. In that case, parents are normally left with the burden.I have known schools which charge as much as Mshs.3,000.00 per year. I am, therefore, urging the Ministry to issue guidelines to these board of governors. As I said earlier, the spirit of Harambee has helped us achieve our present standards. Harambee means giving voluntarily by the community but when it is stated that every parents must give so much for Harambee, it means that we are running away from this spirit. If it is restricted as parents alone, then it means that we are defeating the purpose ofIf there are extra payments. so be made in order they should not only come from individual families but from the whole commend.I am fully aware of the fact that it has become more expensive to run schools nowadays because of the rising cost of living. I also know that most headmasters do not have other sources of funds hence the only alternative left to them is to charge extra It is high time Ministryrealised that everything has gone up. I am, therefore, urging the Ministry to work out a system whereby the Government can give more grants for running these schools.One thing which surprises everyone of us here is the fact that for almost one year now, board of governors have not received grants from the Ministry.It is very surprising to see that the grants schools used to receive were very little. This is because they were calculated at the rate Shs.3/- per student per day But now even that low rate is not "being provided at all and this has led into a lot of problems. I know that schools have a problem and their employees in the schools are not getting their salaries regularly. But in solving this problem we just do not have to ask parents to cough some more money because by so doing we are denying innocent young Kenyans the chance to get education.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there has s been a tendency by some headmasters to send away from school students from poor families when they do not pay these funds. The Ministry has always said that it does not£ allow individual headmasters to send away students, but I am surprised that those headmasters who have been sending away students have never been reprimanded. So, we have been saying one thing and a ± different thing happening. Earlier this year his Excellency the President provided over amammoth Harambee where a lot money to help poor students was raised and the money is there. In some areas this money has not been distributed. Though some headmasters are fuller aware ±h± that the bursaries for poor students are still being processed they are sending away from school such students. The Ministry must stop this practice.I know that the Ministry will say that it has not been allocated grants by the Treasury because of the Ministry's ceiling Even today the Government has, according to the Kenya Times, said it will out expenditure further. The extra expenditure reductionsshould not affect school grants. If we know that we are dealingwith, riotous, controversial	secondary school students who arenot expected to reason as much as can we should be careful. So,I am appealing to the Ministry to present its case to the Treasury repeatedly and remind them that we need to look after these schools,Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I know we are spending about 33 per cent of our national Budget on Education. Even then I would argue that it is high time there was a distinction between secondary schools and universities. I know that most of the funds allocated to the Ministry are going into the running of universities, I am saying that this is a cad thing, but on the other hand if we only allocate funds to run the universities then how do we run the secondary schools. It is as if we want to build tine first floor before the ground floor. It is these secondary schools students who filter into the universities. So, if we make it impossible for students from poor families to receive secondary school education, it follows that we have denied them the university education. I know very well that Kenyans are very ready to contribute towards education, but there are limits to this. If one comes from the poor income group, he may have the wish to contribute, but he has not means.Another thing regarding funding high schools touches onthe 8-4-4 system of education, while we have accepted this systemit is practical subjects oriented and we know more buildings andother facilities will be required if we are to achieve our goals,SQ, in our planning we should have provisions for those facilities.I am sorry to say that the parents cannot afford to put up all thelaboratories, workshops and all the other facilities at the rate wewant to implement the 8-4-4 system of education. I am thus once againasking the Ministry to request the Treasury to review the issue offunding the 8-4-4 system of education, particularly the provision of equipment for the practical subjects.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir, the same thing applies to text books. while we expect most students to buy their own text books  in fact, this is what is happening in most schools the books are becoming more and more expensive every day. Another tiling that surprises wananchi is that a text book which was designed last year is not being used this year so that every time new books are being recommended by the Kenya Institute of Education and students have to buy books every year. I am requesting to be more consistent so that once a book is designed for a particular course the sys sysllabus should be left to continue instead of confusing the students and the teachers. By continuously introducing new books, particularly those by the KIE, we are not only confusing the public but also making them spend more money, which is scarce. The Ministry must have a consistent policy of making sure that education is affordable. As of now education is becoming one of the most expensive things for our people.If we are still within our Kanu Manifesto, in which we said we would ensure we would provide education to all, at the rate we are moving we will never achieve this goal. In the final analysis we will be saying that education is for the rich and only for those who can afford it. But I know that although that is not the policy of the Government, our implementation policies are tailing us to no conclusion other the one I have mentioned. All I am saying is that we look for ways of helping wananchi to achieve this goal. Let me not be misunderstood: I am not saying that those who can pay be left free. I know there are parents who can afford to pay but who always delay to pay I am not encouraging such irresponsible people of those who can afford. I am only laying that this	is why I raised this Motion those who cannot afford should be assistedMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Motion is of national importance: I know it concerns a matter which is affecting every one of us here in one way or another. I raised it because immediately schools closed a number of parents came to me asking me for assistance in advance. They told me of the various funds they will pay next year and asked me to prepare to pay for them. I know the same request is being made to every one of us. It is with this in mind that we want the genuine poor Kenyans to be assisted so that they can afford education, for their children.I will end by congratulating his Excellency the president for his spirit of Harambee. Even today he is in an Harambee meeting to help a school, We should all emulate him.With those remarks, I ask hon. Kirwa to second the Motion.<Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR.  KIRWA: Thank  you  very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for  giving me  this  opportunity. First  of all. I  would like  to thank  the Moverfor  having moved  this  very  important  Motion. It  is  important  because  it  toucheson  a  very  essential  sector  of our  development. Education  is  important,  andunless  it  keeps  the  tempo  that  it  is  supposed  to  do,  this  country is not going to  perform  as  much  as  we  expect  it  to. The  crux  of  the matter,  as  far as  this Motion  is  concerned,  is  the  burden  that  parents  are  now carrying on  their shoulders. This  is  a serious  burden that the Ministry  of Education ought to lookat  critically. I  say  this  because  many of the schools  that charge building fundall  the  other  extra money  have  not  initiated any  tangible project. There  is  a school  in Trans Nzoia which has been asking for Shs.3,000/= every  year  at  the  rate  of Shs.1,000/= every  term from every parent.  However,  in the  last 10  years,  this  school has not  initiated  a single project in  its compound. So,  one  wonders  whether building fund is going to be used for recurrent expenditure of this  particular  school  or in the payment of subordinate staff. This  is  what the  Ministry  ought  to  look  into  seriously  because unless we control headmasters and  chairmen  of boards-of-governors,  parents are going to be very  despirited. Whether  we  like  it  or not,  not  all  of us  in Kenya are  able  to pay the kind of money  that  is  being asked for  from us  firstly because  of the escalating cost of living  and,  secondly,  because  of  devaluation of the  shilling. Somebody  who was earning Shs.3,000/= 10 years  ago may  be  earning Shs.4,000/= now,  but what he can buy  today  is  not  even a half of what he  could buy 10 years  ago. What  we  are  asking  the  Ministry  to  do  is  not  impossible.  We  are  only asking  it  to have  a consistent programme  such that  if any building fund or other extra money  to be  charged besides  tuition and boarding fees, this  is done consistently  within  the  parameters  of a particular  district or  area. You  will find  that  in  the  same  district,  one  school  charges  Shs.3,000/= and another one, Shs.1,000/= as  building  fund whereas both schools  demand the same facilities. The  guise  involved here  is  that  this  decision was passed by the parents-teachers association,  whereas  some  of  this  association's  members may  only  be  the  officials of the  same  association,  and  the  majority  of the  parents  concerned may not have  been  involved  in the  making of  that decision. These  parents  may  only  have  beeninformed  that  Shs.1,000/= would  be  needed  from  each  of  them  at  the  end of the term,  and  they  may  not have  been  able  to  question  that  decision.  Some  parents-teachers  association  members  may  also  be  some  of us,  politicians  or  some  other people  in  influential  positions. This  is  why  we  are  telling  the  Ministry  to have a  consistent  policy  so  that if  any  building fund  is  to be  charged  parents,  say, in  Rift  Valley  or  Trans  Nzoia,   the  money  is  within  manageable  rates  because, although  we  want  our  schools  to  develop,  we  do  not  want  to  strain parents. Another  issue  that  the  Ministry  should  look  at  is  the  auditing of school  finances.  If you  ask  the  Ministry  in  this  House,  you  will  be  told  that it  has  audited  the  books  of accounts  of a  particular  school  and  found  everything to  be  proper. However,  some  of  the  people  involved,  such  as  the  chairmen or boards-of-governors,  headmasters  and bursars,  are  using  school  money  to  enrich themselves. This  is  a  situation  that  the  Ministry  should  look  into. We  need serious  auditing  of  school  funds  to  be  done. An  issue  that  has  also not been  is  the  standing of bursars,  many  of whom have been  in particular  schools  for  the  last  20  years,  seeing headmasters come  and  go.  These  bursars  are  good at manipulation,  which  ensures  that everything seems  proper  on  record while  a  lot  of  money has  been  siphoned out  of many  schools. The  Ministry  should consider whether bursars  should remain  in position from the time  they  are  appointed  to  the  time  they retire  and  whether  they  are  going to be a part  of the  Civil  Service,  such  that they may be  transferred from  time  to  time just  like  any  other  civil  servants. If  this  issue  is  not  well  looked  into,  a lot  of money  is  going to be  wasted. If  a school  raises  Shs.l million  today  and the  money  is  well utilised, this  will  bring a  lot of development.  You  may  contribute  to  a Harambee  funds drive  in  one  school  today and raise  Shs.70,000/= and Shs.250,000/=  in  another school,  but at  the  end of two months,  you find that  one  school  has made  tremendous progress  whereas  the  other-school  is  still  palling for another Harambee  funds drive, having exhausted the  other money. we  do  not  even  need  to  audit  any  books  of  accounts  to  unearth  such  an  anomaly;  you can  see  it from a practical  sense.  After  having  said  that,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I would now  like  to  thank  His  Excellency  the  President for  the  directive he gave recently that  no  civil  servant,  be  it  the  chief,  the  district  officer,  the  district commissioner  or  any  other  such  person,  is  involved  in  the  collection of Harambee funds. This  is  a  very  good  directive,  and  one  wonders  why  some  of  the  politicians who  have  been  jumping on  the  bandwagon every  now  and  then  have  not  said anything about  this  matter. The  Harambee  Spirit  has  been  abused,  particularly  by  chiefs who  collect  chickens  and  other  things  from  the  people  in  the  name  of  raising Harambee  funds. We  should  support  His  Excellency  the  President  in  this  spirit because  there  is  nothing we  are  going to  do  as  a  country. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT  MINISTER,  OFFICE  OF  THE  PRESIDENT (Mr.  Keen): On  apoint  of  order,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir. The  hon.  Member  seems  tohave  made  a  very  serious  allegation  against  chiefs,  and I  wonder whether he could  substantiate  his  allegations. If not  so,  he  should withdraw his  remark. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  KIRWA: Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am so much obligedto  what  hon.  John  Keen;  whom  I  know  to be  a very  serious man,  has said. If he  hasbeen  very  keen,  he  would  have  noted  that  in  Cherangani Division,  one  chief was taken  to  court  where  he  was  ordered  to  pay  one  parent  Shs.4,000/= because  of having snatched the  parent's  bull. If  that  is  enough  substantiation,  I  should now be  given  a chance  to go  on,  while  hon.  John  Keen may go  on and carry out his  own  investigations. This  is  an  issue  that  we  need to  look  into  seriously  because  our people  do  not  look  at the  Administration  in  terms  of the  entire  machinery.  The 4, person  next  to  them  is  the  one  who  represents  the  President,  and  it  is  not  clear in  their  minds  that  the  chief  does  not have powers  beyond his  location.  The Harambee  Spirit  should  be  encouraged  only  in  terms  of pooling  together  our resources,  and not by means  of having some people  enriching themselves. If  weallow  this  kind of situation  to go  on, it is going to  be  very bad. We  would  liketo urge  the  Ministries  of Education  and Culture  and Social  Services  to  ensure  that  all  Harambee  money,  no  matter  where  it  is  raised,  is  properly  audited because  if  we  do  not  do  so,  we  will  not  be  sure  that the  money  is  spent usefully. We  do  not  want  to  have  a  situation  where  a poor money  donates  Shs.20/= which he has  worked  for  six  months,  denying himself some  kale,  only  to be used by  the chairman  of a  board-of-governors  or  a chief to  fuel  his  car. All  the  money  wecollect  should  be  properly  accounted  for. I  hope  the  Ministry  has  taken  downthis  serious  note. The  Ministry  of  Education  has  not  resolved a  certain point  with regard  to  the  confirmation of headmasters  and  deputy headmasters.  Although  this Motion  does  not address  this  point,  we need to  have  some  consistency  such  that if it  is  stipulated  in the  rules  that a headmaster  is  supposed  to  be  confirmed after  six  months,  unless  there  is  a  serious  reason why  he  should not  be  confirmed, he  is  confirmed. If  the deputy headmaster needs to be confirmed within a certain period,  then we do the same because  it is  important that we give everybody the required support. Somebody does  something when he knows that he is there to stay. But when you become a headmaster of a certain school and after a few months you are transferred, that creates a serious situation and the Ministry ought to look at it.  With those few remarks,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to second  the Motion. </Newspeech>(Question proposed) <Newspeech>MR.  MCHARO: Thank you,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  for givingme  this opportunity to enable me contribute to this very  important Motion. TheMotion has been brought to this House  because of the serious burden the parents of this country  are facting towards financing education for  their children.  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  education is a very expensive commodity  in this country,  particularly when the parents are called upon to pay school  fees and also build schools. The whole  thing has become very expensive. Nevertheless,  we have  to foot the bills as parents and leaders of this country. My view is  that the system of paying secondary school feds is rather haphazard, and there  is need to find a way of streamlining it. At the moment,  what we know is that there is that there is a statutory fee of KShs.450/- for tution and KShs.900/- for boarding. We all know that KShs.450/- is far inadequate tofinance tutition in our secondary school. We also know that KShs.900/- peryear is in no way adequate to accommodate our children in secondary schools. Therefore,  the Ministry of Education must find a way of looking into this issue. The sums I have mentioned were applicable way back in 1981,  and up  to this day it remains the same. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  we know that boards of governors and parents and teachers associations have been given the responsibility of  looking  for  extra  funds  to  supplement tution and  boarding fees.  But  the  problem that has  arisen  and which  is  causing a lot of headache  to parents  in  this country is  that  every  board of governors  and  parents and  teachers  association haphazardly charges  fees  the  way  they  want. This  is why we  feel  that the Mover of thisMotion  has  done  a very  good  job. I  personally  think  that  it  is  not correct forthe  fees  statement a child  is given at  the end of the year to  include an  item like  PTA  or  building fund,  when we  know that  these  things  can fall  on one  item. All  this  money  should  be  paid  by  parents  through  Harambee and  should not appear as  fees  to  be  paid  through  the  child. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  it  sometimes happens  that if a child does  not  bring the money  he is  always  sent home. There  is  a cunning way  ofexpelling  children  who  do  not  pay  that  money. The headmasters  use  this  language,that,   "We  are  permitting you  to go home and  bring  fees"  when  the child has not even  asked  for  permission.  What  we  are  saying  is  that  the Ministry  of Education should  come  up  with  a  clear  fees  structure  that will  operate  throughout  the country. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT  MINISTER  FOR  LOCAL  GOVERNMENT (Mr.  Mbori): On  a point.of  order,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir. I  would  hate  to  interrupt  my  goodfriend when he  is  speaking,  but he has  said  that headmasters  expel  students  from school. Since  no headmaster  is  supposed  to  expel  students  from  school,   is  the hon.  Member  in order to mislead the House? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MCHARO: Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  speaking  throughexperience  because  I  have  seen it myself. Letters  are  given to  school  childrenby  headmasters telling them  that they  have been permitted to go home when they have  not  asked for permission. These  are  things  that are happening and  theyshould  be corrected. Therefore,  the Ministry of Education should come up withan  acceptable fees structure. When  it  comes  to  the  question of PTA  funds,  development  funds  and building funds,  those should be paid by parents through Harambee. Children should not be  involved  in  this.what happens  is  that when you have  a  fees  structure  of KShs.5,000/- or KShs.7,000/- and a child  is  sent home,  the parents  of  the  child  go to  their  Member of Parliament  asking  for  the money,  and the  Members  of  Parliament  do  not  have  it at  all. Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  one way  I  would  like  to suggest of  financing education. I  know  we  have  a  very  heavy  taxation system,  buteducation  is  very  important  and whether we like it or not we will have to payfor  it. Our  children will  continue  passing  examinations  and  being admittedto  secondary  schools. Most  of  the parents'   income per  capita  is  almost  zero and  they  are  required  to  pay  for  their  children's  education. The time has  comewhen we,  as  Kenyans,  must  think  seriously  on  the question  of education  fund  that should  be  paid  by  all  salaried  people,  companies,  corporations  and what-have-you in  the same  way  we are paying the service charge. If we  do  that,  we will  be in  a  position  to  find  money  and  finance the  development of schools,  particularly science  laboratories which are vital  facilities  in  the 8-4-4  education  system. We  will  have  money  to  assist  in  the  construction  of workshops  and  home science rooms  which we do not have  in  the majority of our schools. So,  I  would  like the  Ministry  of Education to  think about this matter  seriously  and bring a Bill for  us  to  debate  here,  indicating how education fund can be paid by everybody in  this  country. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  although we are contributing  a lot  in  financing education through the Harambed system,  we feel  that we still can  do  better. Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  we  feel that a lot ofpeople  in this  country may not  be  contributing adequately towards Harambee. We  should  ensure  that  everybody  in this  country assistsin financing education in this  country. The  creation of aneducationa1  fund will  enable  everybody in this country to contribute  towards  education in this  country. Private  companies  and  other organizations  should also  contribute  towards  education in this country. Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  as has already  been said,  the  funds that have  been collected have not  been audited to the satisfaction of the people  who  contribute  that money. These  fundsmust  be  thoroughly audited. All the  Harambee  funds that  have  beencollected by  every  secondary  school  in this  country must  be  accounted for fully  so  that at  the  end  of  each year, every  school prepares a financial  statement  for presentation to the parents concerned.  This will  convince the  parents that the  money they are  donating, to schools  is being properly utilised. Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I would now like  to  say something the people who are  employed by boards of governors. First of all you will find that  the  fees that  are  supposed to be  paid and the  grants  that  are supposed to  be  given to  schools do notcome  in time  and as a result  those who are  supposed to be paidsalaries  from such funds are never paid on time. So,  you will  findthat  boards  of governors employees are not paid in time. We  areappealing to  the  Ministry of Education to  start paying salaries to boards  of governors'  employees. These  employees  should be  adoptedby the Ministry of Education. Let them be paid salaries like civilservants;  let  the Ministry of Education pay them directly.  The  bursars,  drivers,  accounts clerks and clerical officers employed  by  schools  boards  of governors  should be paid salaries by the Ministry of Education. They should not be left to be paidby  the  schools they work for because  these  schools do not receive the ,grants  from the  Ministry on time."With those  remarks , I beg to  support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.EKIDOR: Ahsante  sana, Bw."

The  policy regarding  the  funding  of secondary  schools  is  clearly  stipulated  in  the Sessional  Paper</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.   EKIDOR:  On  a  point  of order,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker. Is  the  Assistant  Minister  moving an  amendment or  responding  to  the Motion? This  is  because,   in  our  understanding, we  still  have  time  to  make  our contributions  before  the  time  for official  responding comes  about. </Newspeech><Newspeech> THE  TEMPORARY  DEPUTY  SPEAKER (Mr.  Wabuge): I  think Mr.  Amayo is  responding  to  the  Motion  and,  in  the  process,  he  can  propose  any amendment. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT  MINISTER  FOR EDUCATION  (Mr.  Amayo):  Thank  you very  much,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  for  that  guidance. We  are  saying  that  the  policy  regarding funding  of  secondary schools  is  clearly  stipulated  in  the  Sessional  Paper   No.  6  of  1988 where  cost-sharing  between  the  Government, and  parents  is  encouraged. The  spirit  of  this  Motion is  a  good  and  what we  are  saying here  is that  the  concern  indicated  by  the hon.  Members  is  essentially  on  the fees  charged  by  the  boards  of governors  and  the  parents/teachers association  and  the  management  of  the  funds  in  question. We  have  also   noted  the concern  expressed  even  on  a  line  of appointment  of  heads  of  institutions  and  their  deputies.  One  major concern  here  is  that  the  board  of governors  manage  the  schools  on behalf  of  the  Ministry. By  good  coincidence,  Members  of  Parliamentare  members  of these  boards  of governors. We  would  only  request  thatthe  boards of governors  take  into consideration situations existing in  the  environments within which they operate and  that  hon.  Members  should  play  a more  active  role because  the  returns  we get  from  the boards of  governors'  minutes,  unfortunately,  indicate  that most hon.  Members  do not  attend  the  meetings. So,   if  all  members  of  the  boards of governors attended  these  meetings,  some  of  the  things  that are major concerns  in this  House  would  have  been  arrested  right at  the  schools. The  same  goesto  parents/teachers association  funds. So,  we  insist  that  the  fee  structure  has  not  been  amended  since 1978. What we  are  therefore  saying isthat  on  the  parents/teachers  association  funding,  which essentially has been  for  development  and  maintenance,  the Ministry  of Education  is giving out  instructions  to all  secondary  schools  in  the country,  beginning next week,  to  indicate  the  ceiling  that  each  school  can charge  as  parents/teachers association  fund  so  that  anything  extra will  be governed  by  the normal Harambee  done  by  the  local  community. In  this  case,   the  Ministry  is  giving out,  in  a circular  form,  an ?..Z¦ AR, instruction  limiting  the  fund  to not  more  than  Ksh.1,000/-  per  year. Anything more  than Ksh.1,000/- will  need  approval  by  the district development  committee  and,   in  this  case,  that  figure  is  adequate. However,  should there  be  need  to  increase  the  figure,   then  the  additional  funds  required should  be  raised  through  Harambee,  which  should  be  accounted  for.  In  view  of  all  these,   I  wish  to propose  an  amendment  to  the Motion  itself.  I  beg  to  propose  that  the Motion  be  amended  to  read  as follows:-THAT,  in  view  of  the  fact  that most parents  whose children  are  in  secondary  schools  belong  to the  low  income groups</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MWAMZANDI':  On  a point of order,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker. There  is  a  tendency  in  the House  of not following the procedures of the House  properly. Whoever  is  proposing an amendment first of all  informs the  House  what  should  be deleted and what should be  inserted  in  place thereof.  Mr.  Amayo  is  just  reading the amendment without following that rule. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT  MINISTER  FOR  EDUCATION (Mr.  Amayo): I  thank  hon.Mwamzandi  for  that correction. Sir,   let me,   therefore,  propose  the  following amendments. propose  that we  delete  all  the words  appearing after the word  "to"  in the  seventh line to the  end  and  inserting  in place thereof the  following words:-"review  the  system of charging extra fees  by the the  boards of governors  and  parents/teachers associations for development  and  maintenance." With those few remarks,  I beg to move the amendment. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS AND NATONAL HERITAGE (Mr.Nooru): Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the Motion to the control. As the hon. Assistant Minister has stated   the  amendment does not do the  Motion any harm but gives the  system   room   to study the situation and make the necessary changes. The most important  thing is education for  ourpeople.  I  am sure that all hon. Members  are  aware of the fact  that   50 percent of the Budget of this country   goes to the  Ministry of  Education. On  top of that,  every hon.  Member has financial problems with regard to schools in his constituency.  This is the reality and we cannot avoid it. There  is nothing the Government  can do to alleviate these challenges.  We know that  the population of this country is going up and the Government  is doing all  it can to uplift  the  standard of education in this country. The Government does not,  therefore, have breathing space. The  fact still remains that we  still have more problems as times chance  and also because we have now adopted a new system of education. Unless we  are  prepared tosacrifice  ourselves and face the reality of  this  issue,  we shall not be a position to educate  our people. It  is,  therefore,  the duty of every hon.  Member to  tell our people  that   they mast dig deep  into  their Pockets  in crier  to supplement  the Government's efforts  as far as education is concerned.  One  issue  that  should  not  be  made  uniform  throughout  the  republic  is  the  school fees  structure,  a  fact  that  every  hon.  Member  here  should  support,  because  the economic  and  climatic  effects  differ  from  one  district  to  another.  Whereas  a one-kilogramme  packet of sugar  may  cost  Shs.l0/= here  in Nairobi,  there  is another  area  where  it  will  cost  Shs.20/= If we  are  told  to  pay  uniform  fees throughout  the  Republic,  this  will  not work  and  we  should  not  deceive  ourselves here. So,  these  fees  should  be  structured  in  such  a  manner  as  to  give  us  somebreathing  space. If we  let  parents  deliberate  on  this  matter,  and  boards-of-governors  forward  their proposals  to  district  education  boards  for  onward transmission  to  district  development  committees  and  then  to  the  Permanent Secretary, I  think  we  will  streamline  the  system. With  regard  to parents-teachers  association  funds,  I  do  not  see  why these  should  be  made  uniform  because  some  schools  are  developed  whereas  others are  still  young  and  developing. In  the  case  of  schools  that  have  been  in existence  for years  and have  already  had  enough  development,  there  is  no reason why  these  funds  should be paid,  say,  every term or every year. Depending  on  the economic  and the  climatic  conditions  of  a particular  district,  parents  themselves should  decide  on  how  these  funds  should be  paid. The  amendment  that  has  been proposed  by  the  hon. Assistant Minister  is  going to  give  us  enough room  to  think  and make the  right  decisions at the district,  the  provincial  and the  national  levels.  With  these  few remarks,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I  support the  Motion. </Newspeech>(Question  of  the  first  part  of  the  amendment,  that  the  words  to  be  left   out  be  left  out,  proposed) (Question  of  the  first  part  of the  amendment,  that  the words  to  be  left  out  be  left  out,  put  and  agreed  to) (Question  of the  second part  of the  amendment,  that  the  words  to  be  inserted  in place  thereof be  inserted,  proposed) (Question  of the  second  part  of the  amendment,  that  the  words to  be  inserted  in  place  thereof  be  inserted,  put  and  agreed  to) (Question of the  Motion  as  amended proposed)  <Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT  MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr.  Mbori): Thank  you,Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,   for  giving me  this  opportunity  to  contribute to  the  Motion  as  amended. Let  me  begin  by  thanking,  firstly,  the  Mover  of the Motion  and,   secondly,  the  Assistant  Minister  for Education  for having moved  the proposed  amendment  which,   in  my  view,  is  good  enough  to  enable  us  to  examine the  affairs  pertaining  to  education,  particularly  at  secondary  school  level. The  Motion  as  amended  is  very  fair  in  that  it  takes  into  account the  problems that parents  encounter when  their  children are  engaged in  learning processes  in our  secondary  schools. We  should  not  lose  sight  of the  fact  that the  whole world,  especially the  Third World,  is  changing very rapidly.  This  applies  to  educational  affairs, which  are  changing quickly,  particularly  in Kenya where we have  engaged a new gear  of  education,  that  is  the 8-4-4  system  of education. It  goes  without  saying  that  that  8-4-4  education  system  is  indeed  an  expensive affair which  calls  upon  parents  to  spend a  lot of money. I  believe  that  the Mover  of  the  Motion  realises  that  of  necessity  education has to be paid for. It  is  well  known  that  the  Ministry  of Education has  fixed  fees  for  tuition, boarding  and  examination. But  there  are other  extra charges  which  and supposdd to  be  catered  for  by  both  PTAs  and  boards  of governors. Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  we  do  realise  that  education  has to  be  paid  for,  particularly  the  tuition  part  of  it. We  also  know  that  we haveto  buy  books  and  stationery. I  know  that  the  list  of requirements  in  the 8-4-4education  is  very  long  and  I  may  not  be able  to recall  all  the  items. Thiscalls  for  extra  charges  as  far  as  education  is  concerned. I  do  agree with  theMover  of  the  Motion  that  the  vast majority  of  the parents  have  low  income;  some of  them  do  not have  income  at  all.  I  am  talking  about  those  parents  in  the rural areas  whose  only  means  of  livelihood  is  land,  meaning  that  they  are  usually  called upon  to  meet  expenses  they  can hardly  afford. So,  I  believe  that  the  PTAs  and boards  of governors  play  a very  important  role  because they understand  their respective  areas. They  know  the  capabilities  of  the parents  in  their  areas. That  is  why  the Ministry of Education has said that both PTAs and boards of governors  should  be  reviewing fees  structures  from  time to  time,  depending on a number  of  factors. Those  factors  include  farming and  business. I  think  it is  only  fair  that PTAs  and boards of governors  should continue reviewing these charges  which relate  to the required expenditure  in education. We  understand the  situation because  some of the school requirements are not made locally and have  to be  imported,  hence making them even more expensive. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  that does not mean  that our  leaders, mainly  PTAs  and boards of governors should lose sight of the fact that most parents are  poor and unable to pay fees. School  fees  alone  cannot maintain  studentsin  school  because  the 8-4-4  system of education has becomes  very  expensive. It may  even  be  necessary  for  the Ministry  of  Education  to  subsidise education more, when  you  take  into account  the  fact  that  most parents  are  unable  to maintain their  children  at various  levels  of education. So, the Ministry  has  done well to  show  that  both  PTAs  and  boards  of governors  should  be  encouraged. Mr.Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,   the   Motion  is  urging  the Ministry   itself  to  look into the capability   of   parents   at   various levels   and   at different times; taking into account the   factthat   the   Third   World   is   fast   changing  world  with  complex  economic roblems   which  are   causing  us   to   behave  the   way  we   do  due   to circumstances   beyond   our   control. So, I   believe   that   the   Mover   ofthis   Motion  will   see sense  in accepting this   amendment whichis   very   fair;   taking,  into consideration the welfare   of  theparents. With  those   few  remarks,  I  beg  to   second   the   amendment.</Newspeech> (Question  of  the   first   part   of  the   amendment,   that   the words   to   be   left   out   be  left   out   proposed) (Question  of  the   first  part   of  the   amendment,   that  the words   to   be  left   out  be   left   out,   put   and  agreed  to) (Question   of  the   second  part of  the   amendment  that  the words   to  be   inserted  place   thereof  be   inserted, proposed) (Question   of  the   second  part   of the  amendment,   that  the words   to  be inserted   in place  thereof  be   inserted, putand agreed   to)(Question  of  the  Motion  as  amended  Proposed)  <Header> ADJOURNMENT</Header>  <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr.Wabuge>: Hon.

At the  moment  a  locationis  supposed  to  have  one  chief  and  one  sub-chief. Can  he  tellus  out  of  the  two  the  one  who  is  supposed  to  be  appointed first?At  the  moment  one  location  has  a  chief  and  a  sub-chief  withouttheir  functions  being  defined  Properly. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.   ONYANCHA: Mr.   Speaker,   Sir  as  it  stands  now,   asub-location  is  at  the  same  time  a  location  in  this  area. We,therefore,  do  accept  that,   as  soon  as  it  is  possible  taking into  account  all  the  circumstances  including  finances,   the locations  need  to  he  sub-divided  into  at  least  two  sub-locations and  these  recommendations  have  already  been  forwarded. We  have indicated  that  as  soon  as  we  receive  them,   after  considering  also the  requirements  of  other  areas  in  the  Republic,  we  shall  act. As  it  stands,   the  location  serves  as  well  as  a  sub-location  and the  chief  takes  care  of  the  whole  location. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

The  abnormally  with  Kaplamai  Location  is  thatthere  is  only  one chief  and  no  assistant  chief. If  the  AssistantMinister  is  talking  of  sub-divisions  before  we  get  an  assistant chief,   what  criteria  was  used  in  getting  assistant  chiefs  for  the other  four  locations  before  they  were  sub-divided  into  sub-locations    <Newspeech>MR.

So,   really,  when  we  say that  we  will  appoint  an  assistant  chief  when  the  location  is sub-divided,  what  we  have  in  mind  is  that  when  the  location is  sub-divided  into  two  sub-locations,   for  example,   the  chief will  be  in  charge  of  the  whole  area  and  we  will  have  to  appoint to  assistant  chiefs  for  both  of  the  sub-locations. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.WABUGE: Mr.Speaker,  Sir,  in view of  the fact  thatthis  anomaly is  apparent  throughout Trans  Nzoia District where you find the  same problem in Kwanza,  Saboti,  Cherangany and elsewhere,  and in view of the fact  that the  district developmentcommittee has recommended that more locations should be createdand more chiefs  and  assistant  chiefs appointed  in order to  hansten development  in the area, would the Assistant Minister now undertake to  liaise with the  provincial Commissioner to find  out when this  recommendation is  going to  be  implemented?   The Assistant Minister  says that he has not received the recommendation and at the  same time he  says  that funds  are not  available, to  implement the recommendation. Could we know from him which  is which now. Is  it  the funds that  they do not have  or  is it because they have no  received the recommendation from the district  development  committee. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.ONYANCHA:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I believe  I was  quite clear in what  I  said.  I  said that when we  receive this recommendation from the district  development  committee,  we  shall consider this request along with  others such recommendations from the various Parts  of the  Republic.  I do not  think I can be more  clearer than that  at the moment. </Newspeech><Newspeech>KIRWA:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, I think the Assistant Ministershould be fair to the  People  of Cherangany. When he  says he  hasnot  received the  relevant recommendation from the  office of theProvincial Commissioner, could he  tell us what  is difficult  inasking for that  information. If the Assistant Minister needs  anyassistance from me as  the Member of  the district development  Committee,  I am ready to  give  it  to him.  I  am  sayingthis because  it  does not  take  seven months to  send information fromNakuru to  Nairobi. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

However,  I  am glad to  inform the hon.  questioner that the sale  of  cattle and other stock at Ahero Market  is now taking Place. </Newspeech> MR.MIRUWA-OWUOR: Mr.Speaker, Sir, while the hon.Assistant  Minister for his answer,  could he tel1 this House whether the  outbreak of this disease was gazette and notifiedto the  Public. </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR.  NANG'OLE:   Mr.  Speaker,  sir, the purpose of the quarantine was to ensure that the diseased cattle were sprayed to stop the spread of the disease.   To confirm that, there were 3,018 heads of cattle which were vaccinated in that area.   If hon. Miruka-Owuor did not know that,  I am glad to have given him that information. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  MIRUKA-OWUOR:   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the reason why I want to find out what is meant by "the area" is that while, Ahero market was closed, some other markets in the neighbourhood,  as near as two kilometres, were selling cattle which were even being driven through Ahero market.   That raises the question whether the closure of the market was done in good faith or whether there was an intention of frustrating and harassing the wananchi  there. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.NANG'OLE:   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, we are not aware of that in the Ministry but,  the fact remains that Nyando Division was quarantined on 5th July, 1990 and the same was  lifted after the vaccination exercise was done on 9th November, 1990. The quarantine covered the whole of Nyando Division in Kisumu District. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MIRUKA-OWUOR:   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I have pointed out that while the Ahero market was closed, the neighbouring markets were selling cattle and that such cattle were all  the time being driven through Ahero.   It appears as if the closure of Ahero market was not in good faith but was intended to harass the wananchi  in Ahero.   Could the Assistant Minister assure the House that that type of action will  not be repeated? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  NANG'OLE:   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I have already told the hon. Member that we were not aware of that claim.   However, the fact remains that we did impose a quarantine on 5th July, this year and it was lifted on 9th November, 1990 in Nyando Division of Kisumu District. The hon.  Member alleges that some markets were still  operating while Ahero market was closed down.   We are not aware of that. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  SPEAKER:   Let us go on to Mr.Lotim's Question. </Newspeech>  Question No. 639<Header> Number of  1990 Ministry's Workers from Kapenguria</Header>  MR.  LOTIM asked the Minister for Agriculture how many people were employed by the Ministry From Kapenguria Constituency between 1st -and 14th November, 1990 and what their duty assignments are.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr.Ngaruro): Mr.Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to reply. I  am not aware of any employment of recruitment of personnel between 1st and 14th November, 1990 in Kapenguria Constituency or anywhere within the West Pokot District. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  LOTIM:  Mr.  Speaker, Sir, despite the fact that the fact that the Assistant Minister has replied to my Question, he had not given me copies of the written reply.   Let me also ask him how many people were recruited from January, 1990 to November, 1990 in the Ministry from Kapenguria. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  NGARURO:   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, the Question put by the hon. Member was very specific and I gave a very specific answer, too.  If the hon.  Member wants me to give him any other information, as he seeks in his supplementary question, he would better put that kind of question to the House. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  LOTIM:   Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister tell us the names of those who were employed?   Can he lay those names on the Table of the House? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I   said that this Questionwas very specific and  I,  in turn,  gave a very specific answer. If thehon.  Member requires any further information,  I am willing to give it as and when he seeks for that kind of information. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  LOTIM:   Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  I know that on or around  7th of this month the personnel officer in Kapenguria sent about 13 names and he sent them by speed post from Nakuru to the Ministry's headquarters. Can the Assistant Minister confirm or deny that fact? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  NGARURO:   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  surely,  I have said repeatedly that this was a very specific Question and I have given a specific answer. Should the hon.  Member require any further information,  I am willing to give it as and when such a question is put to the House. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  LOTIM:   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I know that the Assistant Minister is deliberately refusing to give an appropriate answer because the recruit-ment was done irregularly.   There was no advertisement for the recruitment and that is why he is trying to cover-up his field officers.   Can we be told who those people are who were recruited? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  NGARURO:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, the Question sought to know how many people were employed by the Ministry from Kapenguria Constituency between 1st and 14th November, 1990 and what their duty assignments were. I  have replied that I  am not aware of any recruitment of personnel  between = those two dates and I still  stand by that answer. </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR: WABUGE:   On a point of order, Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.   The hon. Member has raised a Question here and the Assistant Minister has replied that he is not aware of the claim, which means that when the Assistant Minister received the Question,  it went through the normal machinery toverify the claim by the hon. Member.   In order to help the hon. Member, would I be in order to ask that the hon. Member, if he has names of such people he alleges were recruited, to lay them on the Table of the House? If he does not have them here,  he can do that next week. Among these two, we do not know who   is telling the truth. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  EKIDOR:   Mr.  Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister find out the 13 people who were sent by speedpost from Nakuru to Kapenguria from his Ministry?   The hon. Member has claimed that there were 13 people sent by speedpost from Nakuru to the headquarters.   Can he find out who they are and return back to the House with that information? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGARURO:  Mr.  Speaker, Sir,  I am not aware that people can  be sent by speedpost. I have always thought that speedpost deals withmail. If the hon.  Member has any information concerning some people whowere sent by speedpost, then we have not received them as yet. </Newspeech>(laughter) <Newspeech>MR.  LOTIM:   Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the people were not sent by speedpost but their names were.   Can the Assistant Minister be kind enough to tell the House how many people have been recruited from the beginning of the year up to now in the Ministry of Agriculture?  That is part of this Question and he should not try to evade. </Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR.  NGARURO:   Mr.  Speaker, Sir,  I am not trying to evade answering the Question at all.   The Question gave the dates between 1st to 14th November, this year.   However,  I am willing to give that additional information,  as and when it is requested through this House.  We have nothing to hide in the Ministry. </Newspeech> Question No. 621<Header> Sub-Division of Land LR or Parcel No.S/Maragoli/Lugovo/435</Header>  <Newspeech>MR.

NDIRANGU:   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  can the Assistant Minister assure the people of Nyaribo and Kiganjo that that promise will  be implemented soon?   This is because half of the population in those areas I  have mentioned are unemployed because of the new high rates of royalties being paid to the Forestry Department. </Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR.

What  is the  estimated cost of doing this road because  in someplaces,  it has been reduced to a mere cattle  track?   Vehicles can hardly move on this road and it needs opening up  a new. What other future plans due to have for the road?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MAIYANI: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I have stated  that the Ministrydoes not have any financial provisions for this road because the small sectionthat was murramed some time ago was financed by CIDA Only 3.7 kilometreswere done at that time.Presently,  we do not have any funds   to do 28 kilometres. Therefore,  we would like to request the district to recommend the entirelength of the road so that we can send this request to the Treasury because without thisbeing done,  we cannot get funds. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  KIPKORIR: On a point of order,  Sir. The Assistant Ministerhas said that a section of this road has  been murramed. Since  this roadis classified,  why is the Ministry not taking seaction to see to it that it avails funds to do this particular road? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MAIYANI: As I have already stated,  the district concerned should   recommend the entire road to the  Ministry so that it can go to the Treasury to look for funds. Without this procedure being fulfilled, we  cannotget the money. <Newspeech>MR.LEWA: Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  out of the 31 kilometres that makethis road,  the Assistant Minister has told the House that  only 3.7kilometreswas done through the CIDA grants. I believe that this job was not supervised. Can he  tell  the  House how much money was spent in   3.7 kilometres   because I believe that if the road has been experted  properly,  atleast 12 kilometres could have been done. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR .MAYANI:   SPeaker,  Sir.  that is a differentQuestion altogether and I would appreciate if the hon.

S/MARAGOLI/LUGOVO/1522,  S/MARAGOLI/LUGOVO/1523, S/MARAGOLI/LUGOVO  1524 and S/MARAGOLI/LUGOV0/1525.

Box  25018,   Nairobi, terminate  the  services  of Mr.   Isaack  Salesa  Hokole,  while  he  was  on  sick  off granted  by  a medical  practitioner? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT  MINISTER FOR  LABOUR  (Mr.  D.M.

However,  Mr.  Gilani,  of Gilani  Butchery,  who happens  to be  a resident  of these  flats,  was  responsible for  paying Mr.  Hokole  on  behalf of the  residents  of Dipco Flats. Mr.  Hokole, who had worked there  for  one  year,  absented himself from work on 3rd  October, 1590  for 12  days,  and produced  a medical  chit  showing that he had been granted sick  leave  for  those days. He  was  allowed to resume  duty. On  17th October,  1990,  Mr.  Hokole  did  not report  for  duty,  but he appeared  on 25th October, 1990,  saying  that he  was  still  feeling sick. He  wasasked  to  produce  a medical  report to prove his-case  as  a condition to resumeduties,  but  he  failed  to  do  so. This  resulted  in  his  eventual  dismissal. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  JAIDESSA: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  arising from  that  unsatisfactoryreply  and  considering  that  the  Assistant Minister has  entirely relied  on his field  officers,  who normally  collude  with employers,  could he,  for the  interest of this  mwananchi whose  services were  terminated when he was  sick,  note  that  when  we  consulted  this  Asina  man  of Kenyan  origin,  he  was  very  arrogant?  Could the  Assistant  Minister  also  go  back  to  his  office  and  do  his  homework  and probably  call  Kr.  Holoke  to  his  officer  to  find out  the  real  cause  of his dismissal  with  a  view  to  having  this  man  given  his  terminal  benefits? Why  has his  former  employer  not  remitted  any  N.S.S.F.  contributions  on behalf of all  his employees? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  D.M. AMIN: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  further  information  of the  hon.Member,  we  have  carried  out  further  investigations. According  to  the  EmploymentAct,  chapter  226  of  the  Laws  of  Kenya,  absenting  oneself from his  place  of work without  permission  amounts  to  gross  misconduct  and may  lead  to  summary  dismissal. However,  during our  investigations,  the Labour Officer,  Nairobi,  has  managed to recover  the  following  dues:-  (1) 16  days  work  -  Shs.512/= to Shs.360/=  of which Mr.  Holoke had  takenan  advance  of  Shs.360/=;(2) 4  days'   leave  for  two  months  -  Shs.128/=;(3) 12  days'  ex-gratia  for  one  years'  work  -  Shs.384/=;(4) one  month's  pay  in  lieu  of notice  -  Shs. 960/=The  total  amount  is  Shs. 1,624/=The  payment  of  items  3  and  4  is  subject  to  production  of  a  medicalchit  from  a medical  officer  covering the  period between  17th October, 1990  and25th October, 1990,  which Mr.  Hokole  could not  account  for  them  after  beingrequested  to  do  so  by  his  former  employer. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  JALDESSA: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,   I  appreciate  the  fact  that  theAssistant Minister  is  attempting all  he  can to  answer  the  Question,  but  theproblem  is  that  normally  when  such  Questions  come  up,  his  Ministry  relies  on  one-sided  information. I  am  sure  the  Assistant Minister  hat;  never  interviewed  theyoung man concerned.  If he  had  done  this,  he  would  probably  got  a more  reasonableanswer  than  this  one. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  D.M.

N.C.P.B.'s  Emali  and  Kibwezi  Depots</Header>   <Newspeech>MR.  KYONDA: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  beg  to  ask  the  Minister  for  Suppliesand Marketing  the  following Question by  Private  Notice. Why  does the management of the  National Cereals and  Produce  Board (N.C.P.B.)  in  Emali  and  Kibwezi  pay'a uniform rate  of Shs.10/=  per  bag  irrespective of  the  distance  covered by  transporters? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING  (Mr.  ole  Kaparo): Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,   I  beg to  reply. In  1981,  the  N.C.P.B.  established over  300  primary  marketing centres throughout  the  country  to  facilitate  easy  delivery  of maize by  farmers  to the Board's  depots. Transportation  of maize  from these  centres  to the  depots was undertaken  by  private  transporters  for and on behalf of the Board  at a rate  that varied with time,  reaching 20  cents  per  bag per kilometre  in 1987. During that year,  it was  decided that farmers  should be  encouraged to  deliver  their maize  direct to the Board depots.  As  no producer  was  more  than 50  kilometres  away  from  the  nearest  depot,  the  Board  decided that a fixed amount of Shs.10/= per  bag,  based on the rate payable  to private transporters,  should be  paid  to  all  farmers  who  deliver maize  for  sale  to the nearest depot. This payment  was  intended to be  an encouragement as well as a form of token assitance towards  meeting farmers'  transport expenses. Following the  producer prices  review gazetted under Legal  Notice No.  277  of  13th  July,1990,  the  Board revised the rate payable upwards  from Shs.10/= to  Shs.15/=  per bag delivered to the  depots. The  new rates  were  effective  from1st July, 1990.In  case  there  is  an area where  there  is  a depot or a primary marketing centre  which  is  more  than  50  kilometres  away  from  producers,  the  matter may be looked  into by  the  Board and the Ministry by way of reviewing transport rates  if details  are  given to us. Such  cases  will  be  treated on their own merit. </Newspeech>    <Newspeech>MR.  KYONDA: Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  while  thanking the Assistant Minister  for his lengthy and rather elaborate answer, I amsurprised to  hear the Assistant Minister say that no farmer in this country takes his  maize  to  a  depot that is more than 50 kilometresaway. What  the Assistant  Minister has told us  is not  applicableto  my  area.  The  other thing   is  that not all farmer have  lorries.Some  have  to  hire  lorries from other people. Why  should  this  chargebe  a flat  rate? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR.Ole KAPARO: Mr.Speaker, Sir, as I said earlier on, this payment which the N.C.P.B. makes to the farmers is not a refund of the expenses incurred by the farmers nor is it a right to the farmer. I say this because strictly speaking, the maize belongs to the farmer until he has delivered it to the Board which buys it. What the Board has done is to encourage the farmers to transport on their own, that maize which is already theirs to the Board and the Board by way of token compensation gives this figure of KShs.15/- per bag. As I have already stated in most cases the farmers will find a buying centre 50kilometres of  their growing area. I have  also  said  that  if there  is any  farmer in the  hon.  Kyonda’s  constituency who  is  more  than 50  kilometres away  from the  nearest depot,  we  are  quite prepared to receive representations from the  hon.  Member and  we  are  also  prepared to review the  amount  payable. But  as  I  have  said this  amount  of KShs.-15/- per bag is  a token assistance ;  it  is not an obligation of the  Board to pay. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  WABUGE:  Mr.  Speaker,  Si:L.;  I  think the  Assistant Minister will agree with me that this KShs.20/- per bag was intended to  induce  the farmer to produce  more  food for this country. But inhis reply the Assistant Minister has told us that the  maizebelongs to  the   farmer  until  it  is  delivered  to  the  National  Cereals  and Produce  A Board.  Do  I  understand,  from him,  that  from now and onwards,   it  will  be  up  to  the  farmer  to wait  until anybody who wants to   collect  the  maize  and  comes  with  a lorry  and  sells the  maize to that  person? Does  the Assistant Minister  mean  that  nowa  farmer  can  sell  his  maize  to  anybody? Is  that  what  he  is  tryingto  imply? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.Ole  KAPARO: Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,   I  am not  saying  anythinglike  that. All   that  I  have  said,   and  I  have  said  it  clearly,is  that   the  Ministry has   established  well  over 300 buying centresaround  the  country.  I  have  also  said  that  the  Ministry  encourages farmers  to  grow  maize.  We   also   encourage  them  to  transport  thatmaize  themselves  to  the  buying centres. That  is  why we  arepaying  them  this  token  assistance  of  KShs.15/-  per  bag. Previouslywhat  used  to  happen  is  that  the  Board  used  to  pay  private transporters  an  equivalent  amount  to  transport  the  maize  from the farmers  to  the  depot.We   see  no  reason  why  the  producers  should  notshare  in  that  business.  If  you  grow  maize  and  in  addition  toselling  the  maize  you  can  also  get  that  money  from the  Board  for transporting  the  maize  to  the  depot. I  think  the   farmers  areQuite  happy  with  that  arrangement. We   are  not  discouraging  them, Onthe   contrary  we  want   every  farmer  to  put   a  lot   of  efforts  in  theproduction  of    food. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.   KYONDA: Mr.Speaker,   Sir,   the  idea  of  encouraging  thefarmers  to  grow  more  maize  is  good. But  the   mod-e  of  payment   appliedby  the  Board  discourages  the  farmers  who are more  than  50  kilometres away  from the depot. Why  should  the   farmer  who isonly five kilometres  away from the depot be paid the  samsamount  as  the   farmer  who  is  50  kilometres  away  from  the   depot? How  does  the  Assistant  Minister  explain this?  All these  farmers  are  citizens  of this  country. In my  constituencythere  are  farmers  who  live 150  kilometres  away  from thedepot. What  are  they  expected to do now? How do we  go  about  that? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.Ole KAPARO: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, I have  already  explainedhow  I  intend  to  go  about  that. I have  told  the  hon.  Member that  ifany  of his  constituents  live  more  than  50  kilometres  away the  hon. Member is  quite welcome  to  give  us  the  details  and we will  look  into the  matter. But  as  for those who live within the radius  of 50 kilometres. I think we  must  be  reasonable.  This  is  because we will not,  as  a Ministry,  be  expected to  establish a maize buying centre  at  every  farmer's doorstep. There must  be  some  kind of rational planning and distribution policy. I  say  this because 50  kilometres  is  as  of now a reasonable  distance. We  are paying KShs.15/- per  bag for you to  transport  the maize  to the  buying centre  and  that,  surely,  is good money. We  allow privateenterprise  to  function as usual. The private transporters arequite  happy with the price  of KShs.15/- per  bag. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  KYONDA: Mr. Speaker,  Sir, think the  AssistantMinister does not know the  implications  of that regulation. What happens  is that the  farmer who cannot transport his maize  at that rate  to the  depot  sells it to these unscrupulous businessmen who pay less than the  stipulated price. The  Board  is not helping the  farmers;  it  is  creating a vicious circle for the farmers.The Board  is not helping those farmers who live more than 50  kilometres  away from the depot and they are many. What  is  the Ministry going to  do  to help these farmers? </Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR.  ole  KAPARO: I  Speaker;  Sir,  as  I  have already  statedthe  KShs.15/- which we pay to the  farmer upon delivery is a tokenassistance which we  give  to the  farmer, This  token  assistance  givenby the Board  to the  farmers  should be appreciated  by the  farmers. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.SPEAKER:  Next  Orders! </Newspeech>MINISTERIAL STATEMENT<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr.Kibaki): On a point  of order,Mr.Speaker,  Sir. I did promise  to  make  a short MinisterialStatement  and  I would  like  to   make  it now. I would like  to  take  this  opportunity to clarify a  few matters raised in this House  and also in some  sections  of the Press regarding KEMRON.  The hon.Members know   what KEMRON  is.This  is a low does  alpha interferon taken sub-lingually,  namely under the tongue  and not swallowed  for the  treatment  ofAids and Hiv infections  and has  been proved to be  effective  for these patients. This  drug was developed by Kenya Medical ResearchInstitute jointly collaborating with Amarillo  Cell  Culture Company of Texas,  United  States  of America and  Hayashibara Biochemicals Laboratories  of Japan. Therefore  the  ownership  of the  drug is quite  clear. Among KEMRI’s  other contributions  in the  development of KEMRON is the  singularly  accredited demonstration of the  drug efficacy  and  safety in the  sub-lingua11y administered  lowdose  interferon in the  treatment  of  as  for first  time  in the  world. On the  question  of  availability,  I would  like  to  assure the on   Members that this drug would be very much available at asmall  cost. The arrangement  is underway  for  some  availabilityco-ordinated  by KEMRI to  the  provincial hospitals and some  other institutions  approved  by the  Ministerial Protocol  Committee. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We cannot hear the minister properly.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH(Mr. Kibaki): Mr. Speaker, sir, the problem is with the microphone. It is not my own making, But I would like to be heard properly.I was saying, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that on the question of availability, I would like  to  assure the hon. Members that  the drug would very much be available  at  a small  cost.	The  arrangement is  underway for availability co-ordinated by Kemri to all the  provincial hospitals  and  some 	other institutions  approved by the Ministerial Protocol Committee. It  should be noted that due  to  its  sensitive  nature, remains  a restricted  drug. 	The  drug will  still undergo hospital based  clinical trials  in multi disciplinary and multicentre approach for some information and dose regiment to be  studied by senior physician! and  doctors.	We  wish all these  people  Golds  speed  in the work they are  doing.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just  want  to emphasise  again that because  the  drug is  still  a research drugs and it  is  true  of all research drugs that we  do  not want	any hon. Member to preach Prematurely that a drug to cure AIDS  is  available  in Kenya.	It is not yet,  but  it may become  available.  in the near future.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  WABUGE:	On a Point  of  order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I  just  want  a small clarification on  this  statement  by theMinister, especially the last part where he has said that the drug is still under research and, therefore, we should not go out preaching it  or publicizing it. Now. I do not know this  is contradicting the statement  by His the president when he was  launching the  drug. It was internationally from that kenya had  discovered the  cure  or drug for AIDS.  We  are  proud  of  our achievements.	We  have  to  say what, we have achieved in  this  country. So, does  the minister now tell  us  that the  drug  is  still under research and, therefore we should  not preach it to our people and yet to has been by his Excellency  the  president?	In fact, even  at  one time  we  read in  the  newspapers that this drug belonged to Americans or Japanese but not Kenyans. So, can  he clarify the position here?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH(Mr. Kibaki): Mr. Speaker, Sir, there  are  two  separate  issues  here. first,  when  the  drug was launched,   it was  agreed  that  it was  announced. I think what was announced is not what the hon. member is  saying now: That the drug will become  available through designated hospitals under specific  doctors. 	That  is  exactly what  happens with a research drug  of  any kind, and  that  is  exactly what  I have  said  with respect to Kenron. So,   there  is no  contradiction between the  statement made at the  launching  and  the  statement I am making now.	It isQuite clear that  the  doctors must  still have their	own trials and  then they will  make  it  freely  available  to  the  Public.  Even in  the manner of taking it,  it also has  to be under supervision. I  am sure  if you give  these  people  the  tablet,  they will  just swallow it  and it will  not  be  effective.	The  tablet  has  to  be taken under  the  tongue.	You  sit in front  of  the  doctor until the  tablet  dissolves in your mouth slowly.	But  if you swallow it, the acid and other things in the stomach will neutralize the drug, or you do not get the full benefit of the drug.And as to the question of collaboration between the Amarillo Cell culture company of texas and the Japanese, I have just that the collaboration has been there right from the beginning. But it  is  true  about  the  contribution by 	kami who have trial and development what  is now being applied to for a specific disease  that we are  talking about.  So,  in matters  scientific,  we  do not want to get intovague  language.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WABUGE: On appoint of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I  do not  intend to quarrel with the minister, but when he says that we  should not go out  to  publicise  the  drug.  I  get worried. Honestly,  the  drag should be  treatai in the same manner like Penicilin  or  any  other  anti biotic  drag that you cannot go  and buy from the  counter. 	You have  to  have  a prescription from a doctor. So,  why can we not publicise  the  drug  so  that  anybody who has AIDS  disease  can go  and buy the  drug with   prescription  from a doctor?   What  is  the  delay for?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH(Mr. Kibaki): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can appreciate the hon. Member for kitale who is in a hurry, and we all want to be in a hurry. But this is a serious matter!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WABUGE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Wabuge, the minister is reacting to your point of order!</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH(MR. Kioaki) : Mr. Speaker, Sir just to use his own words, “It is not like any other anti-biotic”. It is not even an anti-Biotic: It is a new drug which is still at  the  stage  of research. 	It  is not  that  ore  is  being  stopped from saying anything about  the  drug,  but  say it for what  it is. Do  not  call it what  it  is not .  What we  are  saying is  that when the  drug is  applied by doctors who  have  themselves been coached, the  results  have  been positive  and affective.	That  has  been  proven. That is why we  are saying that it will not be  for any odd doctor that you go to to prescribe the drug yet, It will only be through specific centres and via doctors who have been introduced to the 	application or the method  of application will then the  results so, that it can be helpful for us to collect information  on	the drug. That	is Being co-ordinated with  everybody,  including World Health Organisation(WHO).	But  thatis  not  to  belittle  what we have done.	It is purely to  say thatmatters that are scientific shall be handled in a scientific manner.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.LEWA: On a point of information, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think the minister should refer to chapter 244 of the pharmacists and Poisonous Act,  but not to mislead the House by telling people that they  should not go about publicising the drug. 	Under chapter 244  of the Laws of Kenya we do not go about publicising a drug of this nature.	It  is only available,  as he has said,  through those  channels.	Therefore,  the question of hon. members or anybody else publicizing the  drug does not arise,</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT MINISTER  FOR  SUPPLIES AND  MARKETING (Mr.  ole  Kaparo):On  a  point of order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.

SPEAKER:	Next  Order.</Newspeech>BILL <Header>  Second  Reading  </Header><Header>  The  Coast  Development Authority  Bill </Header><Newspeech>THE  MINISTER  FOR  REGIONAL  DEVELOPMENT 	(Mr.  Midika): 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, I  beg  to  move  that the Coast Development Authority  Bill  be  now read  a Second Time. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,   the  Coast Development Authority  is  an Authority  which is  not  very  different  from  all  the others we have in the country. 	The  main  object of  the  Authority  will  be to provide co-ordination of development  in  the Coast Province. The Coast  Development Authority  will  have  its  operations  in the Southern half of Garissa District,  the  six districts of the Coast Province,  namely,  Taveta, Kilifi,  Tana River,  Mombasa,  Kwale  and Lamu. These  are  the  economic  zones  upon which  the  new Authority  is  supposed  to function. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the Coast Development Authority will,  among other things,  undertake to develop  and be in charge of development oriented activities such  as  agriculture,  mineral resources,  fisheries,  construction of water works, flood  control, hydro-electric power generation,  irrigation,  livestock aid domestic 	consumption of water. 	The new Authority  will also promote and support the". industrial  development  in  the  area  using  locally  available materials  such  as cotton,   sunflower  and  others,  and  eventually  use  this as an agro-based  industry the  Coast Province  where such  industry  does  not exist. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,   specifically,  the Authority will mainly  look  into the  tourist  industry  which  is  very  lucrative  at  the Coast Province.	In  thisconnection,  we  regard  this  as  the coastal  belt.	We  intend  to have manufacturingindustries  which  will  be based  on  agricultural  products,  fisheries,  mineral resources  and  others,  all  of  which  are  completely  unexploitated  at  the  coast. 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  some of the areas  where the Authority will  assist in  development  promotion will  also  include  coffee,  mangoes,  pineapples  and  others, which  are  mainly  cash crops,   including  organisation  of co-operatives  and  marketing strategies  for  such  products. The  Authority  will  also  explore  the  possibility of growing rubber  in a bid  to  stem  down  the  current  foreign exchange drain  to the  tune  of K£200  million which  is  normally  spent  in  importing 10,000  tons  of raw  materials  for rubber  industries. Experiments  were made  in Mombasa and  it has  been  found  possible for  us  to  establish  a rubber  industry  there  if we  grow the  raw  material  locally. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,   the Authority  will  have an additional  importance in  providing job. opportunities  at the Coast Province. 	Like  in  any  other  authority, we  intend to establish the Coast Development Authority  in such a way  that everybody at  the  coast will  feel  its  effect. The Authority  will  also  be affording  ecological and  environmental  benefit in the  region by  providing an additional biomass cover for  the  area. The  fishery  industry has hitherto remained underdeveloped for a host of reasons  at  the coast. 	The  Coast  Development Authority  will,  therefore,  develop a  strategy for accelerating the  development of fisheris and marina industry board as  a resource  and a source of protein food in the country and a source of foreign exchange  earning. The  livestock  industry  comprises  beef cattle,  goats,  sheep and  poultry.  The  development of this sector can be enhanced by provision of . 	adequate  water,  establishment of dips,  regular use of artificial insemination services,  control  of  livestock  diseases,  especially East Coast Fever and by improved  marketing  and  provision  of lasting and permanent  infrastructure at the Coast  Province. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,   the  new  Authority will be expected to develop a strategy  to  improve on  the items  I have mentioned. 	Commercially,   the  mineral potential  will,   if  exploited  properly,  benefit  the people of the  coast as  it is  well  known  that  the drilling and exploitation which is  done at the Coast Province  has  mainly  been based  around Taveta area alone. The Coast region  is  endowed with a variety of minerals,  which  include: gypsum,  gemstones,  limestoned,  led and manganese.	The  economic  potential  ofthese minerals  still  remain  largely under-exploited.	The  new  Authority  is,therefore,  expected to  lead  in ascertaining th2 economic  viability  of these minerals  for  the  benefit  of  this  country. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  water resources  are equally  largely under-exploited for  both  agricultural  and domestic  consumption. 	The  Authority  will,  therefore, develop  a  strategy  to  enhance  the  maximum  usage  of  this resource  for  development of agriculture  and  domestic  consumption. Sir,  the  Coast area has  mainly  been used  for  the purposes  of promoting the  tourist  industry 	but,  without proper  infrastructure,  the  industry  has  had stiff competition  from  our  neighbours,  thereby  making  it  difficult  especially when we  run  short  of water  in  the region. The Authority will  look into  all these  aspects  so that the  PeopleAt the coast will be engaged in both gainful and commercial activities that  will enhance  their  lives  and  chances.	They will  not necessarily depend  on tom-ism which is  mainly run by non-indigenous people  at  the  Coast. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, my Ministry will ensure  that,  like  all other	authorities;  the  authority works. We  will need a lot money and  committed not half hearted  people to  establish this Authority. Coast people have, historically been blamed for not working hard but,  personally,  I  think Coast  people  are very hard working.	The  establishment  of this  authority will  prove  their critics  wrong.	If  they were  not  hard working people  then the tourist  industry,  which is booming at  the  Coast,  would not be  there, because  it does not work by itself  it  is  the  people  there who  do the  job. Therefore,  the  establishment  of this   Authority will  prove beyond  all  doubts  that we  are  committed to  the  welfare  of everybody in Kenya.	This  Bill has  been, read by most  of  the  bon.   Members  andI  am sure  hon.  Members  are eager  to  contribute  to  it. However, since  hon.  Nyagah had expressed a wish to  second this Bill and I, therefore,  proposed that be  allowed, to  do  that,  if he  is  still  around.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Nyagah): Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  I rise to support this very important  Bill: It is  a Bill that is based on great  economic  common sense. Like  the Tana and Athi Rivers  Development  Authority the lake basin development Authority and  the  other  one  named Uaso Nyiro  River,  it will not be very far from river and oceans water. It helps a lot  to have a development  authority that  can co-operate with the grassroot planning and development of the dismissed. Therefore, the Bill before  the  House which  proposes  to  cover  the whole  of the  Coast  is very timely. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I would like  to  say  the  Coast people Will benefit  agriculturally because  of  a variety of crops that  can be  grown in that  area;  the  livestock that  can be  kept in that  area.	Also  improvement  of either horticultural,  livestock or agricultural products will be	great. As  the Minister has  put,	the mineral  Pontential in  that  area is great.

MCHARO:   Thank you very much, Mr.  Speaker,  sir.  for the opportunity to enable me to contribute on this very important Bill, particularly important to those of us from the Coast Province,  and Kenya in general.   This is a Bill  that has been awaited for a very long time.   We have the lake Basin Development Authority and the other authorities like th Uaso Nyiro and the Tana and Athi  Development Authorities. It is now the turn of the coast Province to have an authority of this kind to assist in the development of the Coast Province. 	The Coast Province is rich antifull  of natural  resources.  But most of these natural  resources have not been developed at all.  We believe that an authority like this will  go a long way to assist in the development  of this area.   There are many areas that we need to take into consideration. One of those areas which we,  in the Coast Province, weould like to be taken seriously is the area of land.   People in the Coast Province do not have title deeds for their pieces of land; they do not, in fact, legally own the land. This is one area that we would like the Coast Development Authority, when it is developed to liaise with the Ministry of Lands and Housing to ensure that the Coast people have their land properly adjudicated and the process be speeded up to ensure that they have title deeds.   This will  be necessary if we are going to realise the benefits of this Authority. 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, we are appealing for the speeding up of the adjudication processes so that our people can have those title deeds. At the same time, the Minister should settle our people in a speedy manner so that they can have such title deeds to secure bank loans to enable them to develop in areas like agriculture and so on.   Along with that we feel  that the Authority should be given powers,  like the others, to effect various training programmes and the development of manpower so that we have -suffi-ciently trained manpower in the provinces to handle the development of this Authority.   This entails the development of the various training institutions in the various provinces so that we can develop manpower to strengthen our agricultural  sector, our fisheries, tourism,  livestock and other important economic areas. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are the important areas we know of that are,  as yet, unexploited. In Taita Taveta District, we have the question	of tourism which has pressed down the people.	In this District, more than50 per cent of our land is composed of national  parks.   Kwale   has a large national  park and Kilifi  likewise.   The development of tourism is vital  in this area.   After all, tourism is the leafing foreign exchange earner in the country.   Therefore, tourism must be seen to be benefitting the people of this area totally. In this reqard,  I  am making a special  appeal  so that  funds are allocated for the fencing of the national  parks with electric fences to keep off the wild animals,  like the elephant which   we value so much,  away from the people. I  am saying these because elephants are very destructive to our crops.   When they are kept away, that will  give the farmers in that area breathing space and they will  till  their land without any unnecessary destruction from the wild animals. In this area maize and other crops are normally destroyed by those wild animals. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, water resources have been mentioned.   There is a lot of water in those areas and we need more of that water to be properly managed so that we can even have irrigation schemes.   We have plenty of water in Jipe, Taita Taveta and so on emanating from Mount Kilimanjaro.   However, most of the water is wasted as it flows to the Indian Ocean.	It is very important that giant water irrigation programmes are initiated.	I believe that the Coast Development Authoritywill  go a long way to look into this problem so that water can be piped from the areas  I mentioned to the fertile lowlands of Taita Taveta and Kwale,  and even to Kilifi. Some.of the water will  also be used to supply the national parks we are talking about.   When the irrigation is complete, we will possibly have the development of cotton production.   Our cotton mills in this country need a lot of cotton which,  as far as  I know, we do not have in sufficient supply.   This is, therefore,  one area that the Coast Development Authority could look into; carry out a lot of irrigation schemes to grow a lot of cotton and a lot of other crops to assist in the development of the cotton industry,  and others which will  fall  under thisAuthority. 	On  the Question of coconuts, I would like  to say that if this crop	were managed properly,  it will ton this country a lot  of Foreign exchange. This also applies	to	agriculturalproduce such as mangoes, pineapples,  vegetables and so on.	We should not always to talking about coffee; we should diverse and promote the cultivation of	other  crops so that when the  Prices of coffee and tea go down in the world 	market,  we can substitute them with horticultural produce in as far earning foreign exchange is concerned.. My final Point is on transport and communication. We  hope  that when this Authority becomes operational,the question of road would be locked into very seriously. We cannot develop without good roads and a goodcommunication system.	This  is one which we hope is going to be looked ino.The other  point is that this Authority does not necessary have to have  its headquarters in Mombasa which is apparently the headcuarters of Coast Province.	We can have it far away from  iombasa so that it can assistinthe development of another town.	Towns like  Hariakani,  Samburu, Kwale,Taita-Taveta, Kilifi and so on should be considered. 	We need  to develop a centre or a town there. 	We should also   have another big town outside Hombasa. With those remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MWAMZANDI:  Thank you,  Sir, for giving me this opportunity to support this Bill.	First  of all,  I would like to say that we are very unfortunate in that we are aisoussing this Bill very late.	We  also note that the Government is thinking of shelving those parastatal that do not take any profit. I do not know where we shall land but I hope this Authority will be  left  alone to assist wananchi is that area for some time. It  is true  that we	have  been wating for this bill. For Example, we  are Producing mangoes and coconuts which only benefit a few points the export them to the middles East or Europe. We have pricancy of the ", - : which  oil  is extracted which the East African Industries   need very much. The  problem we have  is lack of proper marketing for this crop. For example, one  coconut was	for Khs. 7,000 in the last two months  and  today it  is selling at Kshs.3,00. The reason behind this price fall  is that  these are high powered people who import  palm oil from Sri  Lanka and elsewhere  at  to expense of the  Coast people.	This is very unfair indcea  and I hope that thisAuthority	when  it becomes moperational	will market  this  crop so  that itcan generate income to the Peoole of that area.Some People upcountry have been thinking that this conntry doesmnot grow mangoes and coconuts.	They have been saying that Peopin  at theCoast  sit under and coconut trees waiting for the fruits to fall for  them to eat. This trees are planted   at the Coast and if they are not taken care of,  they will not yield any fruits. This  is  the language-used by the upcountry people  to deErade the  Coast people  as being lazy.	They are not lazy at all.	The problem is that they have not been given the opportunity to exploit their	abilities.There  is also a lot of fish at the Coast. We have been  fishingonly at the  sea shore.	We need trawlers in order  to exploit deep-sea fishingfor the benefit of this country.	We Used to have Fishermen Loan Boards whichhave  since been scrapped and fishermen at the Coast are now not assisted. it we can see in Nyanza along Lake Victoria  , every possible Government 	 is extended to the  fishermen around that area. 	Why can  the  same Government loans not be extended to the people of Coast Province?  This is very unfair. The Minister in charge of this Ministry should cater for all parts  of this country.	If I am made a Minister today,  I will	take  care  of the whole count:and not  only my own area. Most .  Ministers   take every	deveopment near theirhomes.   I know that they are politicians but they should think rather taking mostof the national cake to their own villages. The Minister responsible for  this Authority happen from Nyanza Province  I think around Kisurzu or Nyanio.  He  is one 	Minister who can   criticize his people for being lazy.  This Minister has been open by telling his people to unite and forget jealousies and so on. We would like critical to be extended to the wananchi. We know that luos are good people but they go to kisumu and hide their children right down the village, They fear they right be bewitched. The Minister has told them the	truth and I think hon.	Mahjha agrees with me on this.(Mr. speaker left the chair)(The Temporary  Deputy Speaker(Mr. suva) took the chair) The  Minister  responsible  for this  Bill  comes  from  there,  and he  should find a way  of  sharing out  the  national  cake  equitably.	This  is  why  I  say  that  theFishermen's  Loan  Board  is  no  longer  in Coast province.Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,   I  wold  also  like  to  touch on marine  parks,  some  of which  are  too  big  for the  ordinary  man  to  enjoy  freedom of movement.	I  must  congratulate  the  former Minister responsible  for  fisheries	I  think  this  was  hon.  Ogutu.	My  area  of  Shi,Floni  was  all  taken  away  as  a marinenational  park  and  my people  stopped  from any more  fishing there.	They  were  leftto  feed  on  shells  collected  on  the  seashore.	I  must  thank  the  Government  forhaving  decided  to  reduce  this marine  national  park  later,  which would otherwise been  dangerous  to  my  people.  The  danger was  that  there  were  certain people seated  in offices  making  decisions  on behalf of other people although the  former had never been to  the  area concerned. 	Why  did  they  not  take  trouble  to go  there and  see  what  was  happening? 	If they  had  done  so,  they would have  asked themselves, "When  we  take  all  this  part of the  sea,  where  are  local  people going to fish?" 	However,  marine  parks  rae good  in  that  the  fish  breed  there  and eventually  reach  the  people  in remote  areas,  but the  People near  these  parks have  no  access  to  these  parks  because  whenever they  are  seen there  they  are  always arrested.	So,  something  should be  done  to  ensure  that  in  creating marine  nationalparks,  consideration  is  given  to  the  local people.	I  understand  that  such parksare  being  formed  in  Mombasa. 	There  are  some  people  in Momi,asa who have no  other job  except  fishing  in  the  sea.	This  sea was  made  by  God  free  of charge  andpeople  can  catch  fish  there  free  of charge.	If we  create  marine  parks  in the  seawhere  Europeans  can watch  fish without  taking  into  consideration the welfare of our  people,  this  is  dangerous. I  accept  that  the  Coast Development  Authority will  take  care  of our produce  in  the  Coast,  but  I  am sure 	will  need  a  competent managing  director, However,  we  should forget the  idea of appointing people  to head parastatal bodies just because  they  come  from certain people's  areas  because this is unfair. One day  I  complained about the Chairman of Kenya Cash Company  Ltd. I  said that. it  would be  better  to  make  a  Maasai  the  Chairman  of  Kenya Meat  Commission because  he  knows  what  cattle  are,  but when you make  him  the Chairman of Kenya Cashewnuts  Company  Ltd.,  this  is  unfair.	We  have  politicians  who  are  no  longerhere  but  can  work  very  well  for  the  Republic.	We  have  hon.  Chokwe  and  otherswho  can  be  appointed  the  Chairman  of Kenya Cashewnuts  Company  Ltd.	Let  us  berealistic.	If we  make  a Maasai  Chairman  of Kenya  Meat  Commission  and  a Mkambachairman  Of  traditional  dances.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MAKAU: 	On  a  point  of order,   Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir. The  speaker  on  the  Floor  claims  that  the  Chairman  of Kenya Meat Commission should be  a Maasai  and  the  Chairman  of Kenya Cashewnuts  Company  Ltd.,  Mr.  Chokwe. Is  this  not propagating tribalism?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MWAMZANDI: 	Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaekr,  Sir,  it  is  my opinion that whoever  is more  competent  in  certain  aspects  than  others  should  be  given the  chairmanship  of  these  aspects. 	This  is  why  I  said  that  if a 	Mkamba  is  made chairman  of  traditional  dances,  this  would be  good. Turning to  the  Bill,  I  have  no  quarrel  with  it,  and the  only observation  I  want  to  make  is  that  Coast  Province  consists  of Mombasa,   Lamu, Kilifi,  Tana  River,  Kwale  and  Taita-Taveta</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  KIILU: 	On  a  point  of order,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir. Is  the  hon.  Member  in order  to  say  that  a 	Mkamba  should  be  appointed chairman of traditional  dancers  when we  do not have  such a  parastatal  body?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY  SPEAKER 	(Mr.  Tuva): 	He  is  quite  in  order. You may  carry on,  Mr.  Mwamzandi.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MWAMZANDI: 	Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I  do  not  knew  why this  is  so,  but  this  is  my opinion. As  I  was  saying,  Coast Province  also  includes  a half of Garissa District. 	I  want  to  suggest  that  tue  Minister  bring anamendment to  clause 	4 	(h) which  says:-"eight  other  members  appointed by  the  Minister, in  consultation with  the  President,  six of whom  shall appointed  from  the  area affected by  the  operations  of the  Authority “  The  amendment  should  leave  out  all  the  words  from  the  word  "six"  up  tc  the  end of  the  clause  and  insert  in  place  thereof  the  words  "seven  of whom  shall  be appointed  from the  area  concerned. I  say  this  because  there  is  a  tendency this  country  of  appointing people  from  other  areas  to  run  things  in  other  areas. These  should  be  local  people. Of  the  Permanent  Secretaries  to be  members  of the  Authority,  two have  been  left  out,  that  is   the  the  Permanet  Secretaries  to  the  Ministries  of Livestock  Development 	we  have  a  lot  of  livestock  in  that  area and Tourism and Wildlife. 	Whenever  we  have  plans  relating to  tourism,  the  Permanent  Secretary to  the  Ministry  of Tourism  and  Wildlife  should not be  informed of this  by  a third party;  instead,  he  himself should  be  among  the  planners  involved. Besides  that,  I  have  no  quarrel  with  the  Bill,  which has  been  awaited for  a  long time  now. With  these  few remarks,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,   I  support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MAHIHU:	Thank  you,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,   forgiving  a  chance  to comment on  this  very  important  Bill.	I  would  like  to  talkabout  the  composition  of the  membership  of the  Authority.	In  supporting hon.Mwamzandi's  comments  as  to who  should be members  of this  Authority,  I  would  like to  say  that  at  the  moment,  five  Permanent  Secretaries  and  the  Provincial Commissioner,  Coast Pi-ovince  are  already  included as members. We  should  consider other  parastatal  bodies,  because  this  Authority.  too,  is going to be  another  such body. Of  late  I have been very  concerned  about  the  performance  of parastatal 	bodies.	When you  look  at the  Report  of the  Public  Investments  Committee  that  iscurrently  under  discussion,  yoti land  that  it  relates  to parastatal bodies.	Everysuch  body  has  a huge number  of  Permanent  Secretaries.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if you look that the amount of money that is being misused in these parastatals you will wonder what has happened to the existence of the executive arm of the government or the well known and very good civil service that Kenya has had since independence. I totally support the governmentThis morning I read a report in the Kenya times indicating that the office of the vice president and ministry of finance has issued a circular showing that the government has made cuts in public spending by aout 40 per cent. While some people might think this is rather punitive and while this may be seen as a measure to restrict development, it is also good to make restrictions regarding the holders of A.I.E.S. I say this because state corporations hold a lot of money and if that money is going to be used the way we have seen during the deliberations of the public Investments committee, then the vice-president and minister for finance must find out how these parastatals are using their money.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the coast province could be the seviour of Kenya. It is a large province. Whole coastal stretch of land can be used to settle thousands of people. The aim of establishing the Tana and Athi rivers development authority was to settle more than 100,000 families. If the permanent secretaries and the civil service in general would get into serious planning now the problem we are having here in with and others who are building kiosks all over the place because they have no place to setle, would be solved. I remember their in the 1970s a lot of people from mathare were settled down at the jears. Mr. Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is therefore  important that the  Civil  Service  must  now address  itself to  the  problems Kenyans  are  facing In  the  towns.	I hope the kanu chairman, Nairobi branch, is listening to what I am saying. The problems we are having in Nairobi  and  other urban areas  could  be resolved  if the permanent secretaries and the planners that we have in this country went  back to  their  boards, to  plan	we  can settle  the  thousands of Kenyans  who  are now landless  and who are now  squatting all   over the  place  because  they have  no land.	I agree	that  when thesepeople  are  evicted  from a particular place,  they must be  given analternative  place  where  they  can  go and  settle.	We  have  a placewhere  they can  settle. If the  Coast Development  Authority  andthe  other Authorities  are  going to use  the  money allocated  to  them for  settlement  creation we will no longer have  the  political  problems we  are  having today.   We should be settling these people  and  giving them a permanent home.  Any type  of crop you can thinkof can be 	grown in the Tana River Basin.   You can grow the  best cotton in Kenya in Tana River. You can grow rice,  coconuts, Pineapples,  cashewnuts  and  so  on down at  the  Coast. 	So,  it is very important  that we  give this Authority all the  support that  it needs because  it  can absorb all  the  squatters  at the  Coast;  if there was a definite programme of  settlement  in the  Tana River Basin. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  the Term River Basin starts  from Rianduruma and stretches  all theway to Lama.	Irrigation schemes  could be  started  in this  areawhich has very good  soil.  We must also make  sure that this soil  is not  washed  into  the  sea.	Small  scale  farmers  in the Mwea riceScheme  are  earning their living from growing rice. If we are to that then the question of city commission with hawkers would not be there. This is because would be  told  "Look here,  you have  to  shift from this  place and  we  are  going to give and  if you do not go then that  is  your  own problem.	But  let us not move  them before  we found an alternative place for them. With good an alternative  place  can be  found for these people.Mr. Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,	as  we  debate thecreation of the	Coast	Development  Authority,  we  also toaddress	the  issue  of water problems.   The tourist industryat  the  Coast  Can expand  tremendously.	I  say  this  because  theCoastal Region's potential has not been tapped  enough in as far as  tourism is concerned. It  is very important  that  if we  expandthe  tourist industry we  create  more  jobs.' If we create morejobs,  our  school leavers,  university  graduates will have  so-re place to  go  and work.   But you will  find that  any good programme like this one  we  are  debating here  depends  on the implementation ofother Projects  like water projects;	We  have  said  time  and  againthat  the water supply  from Sabaki  is not	adequate.	We	needto lay  another water pipeline 	from Mzima Springs  to Mombasa so that the  tourist  industry  can expand.   The  Provision of adeauatewater there will enable Kenyans to  start  small  irrigation projects. 	Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Sneaker,  Sir,  water  catchment  from the KYuIu Hills  is also a very important  scheme  for development  at uhe Coast.	If we  settle  people  down there we  must  consider the provisionof water as well. This now reminds  of  of Lake  Turkana which isnow drying up because  the River Ormo which starts  from Ethiopia empties its waters in Lake Turkana  has been diverted. 	it  is very important  that  the  flow  of water  into Lake Turkana is protected.  I understand that  there have been efforts by neighbouring countries to divert  the. water which used	to  flow  into lake turkana for their use.	Sudan and Ethiopia are very good neighbours to us. If we	do not  take steps  the  Lake Turkana will dry up and that will be the  end  of fishing in LaZe Turkana and there will  be no hope for our people  in Turkana District."  So,  I am drawing the attention of oirr  planners  to  the Problem of Lake turkana which is drying up. Action should be taken to ensure that there are no deliberate efforts to kill this lake Touching more specifically on the  Coast Province, 	Mr. Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  there  is no reason. why we  should not have  small  industries to process coconut.	We  now importing palm oilinto this country. If you look at the climate of this area;  all the way from Vanga you will find that the  area is  suitable for coconut growing.	If we were to development the  Coast Development Authority, the  Minister for Regional Development	should  tpke  it upon himself I know that he  is a serious minded person. But he must ensure  that  the  fishing industry at the Coast does not remain in the hands  of	the rich. Sir, the fishermen who  are  supposed to  help themselvesare  now being hampered by the  establishment of the national parks in the seas.  We  were  promised by the minister in change of  fisheries that when the Bill will be passed	that was some time  last year that the  fishermen at the Coast would not be harassed.But now we  know the  truth.	If you  try to go	into  the  sea,  even tourists,  have  to  pay  some  fees.	Must  we  charge  them?	I am sure the  charging of  the fee must be co-ordinated  so  that what is being done  by  one  ministry does not  destroy another ministry. So,  Sir,  coming back to the establishment  of the Authority the  membership and the  civil  servants who  attend the parastatal meetings,  I would like  to  say that Permanent Secretaries  are  very, very busy people. Therefore,  they have  alternate  officers to go and  attend  those meetings. I am particularly where  officers  go and attend  meetings  but  they never  speak. They  just  go  there and sit  still.	Wazee  or   elders  continue  with deliberations  and  the officials just keep quiet.	At  the  end  of the  deliberations the money might even be  divertad  to  some  other area  and  the  Government officer sitting in that board  does  nothing about that. Now,   if that  is  going to  be  the  practice  then the membership  of the  parastatals  by the  Permanent  Secretaries  must be reviewed. I 	wouldhave  thought  that they  are  there to represent  the  Accounting Officers  who  are  supposed to  be  accountable  to Parliament.  But what  do we  find?   We  find money being used  or moved from place  to place,and  at the  end  of the  day being written off.	If we are going  to protect  the  country,  the  Treasury must  take  its  full responsibility.	I  am very pleased  that  they have  even done  so today.	In  today's pater,  there  is	40 per cent  tax for  some  State Coporations.	They have to surrender so much money. I agree with that proposal. If they cannot look after the money,  the  person who is holding iton behalf  of the  Government must hold  it  and release it only tothose  Accounting	Officers	who  are  responsible,  or to  those  StateCorporations  that  are  asing the money properly.Sir, I am sure that every hon. Member has a copy of the public investments committee report. You will see that in every state corporation that we have gone through its reports or accounts, there are ills and one wonders whetherit  is  a Government body  or not One wonders  also whether there  is  law in the way they use money. What  has  happened  to  the  Treasury regulations?   People  get  advances or imprests, but when they come  back they  do not  surrender  the imprests. To make  matters worse,  they even take  new imprests until  the  imprests become  a matter  of a loan. 	Sir,  it  is very  important  and now that the Treasury has taken a drastic  action,  the  House  must  support  the Vice-President and Minister for Finance  to control finances  of this country. To  take  control measures  is  the beginning  of introduction  of discipline  in financial matters. Discipline  must  be  introduced in the  rurnin:c of the  affairs  of Government  so that we must  take only what we  can. So,  those  State  Corporations  that  have  used the money not  in  accordance with the  Treasury regulations  should not  be  allowed to  write  it  off but  should be  called upon to replace it. Sir,  the  House  has  been promised many times that thoseGaternment  officers  who  misuse  Government funds Punitive measures would be  taken against  them. Now,   if you went  through the publicinvestments Committe  Report and checked on every state corporation, you might  take  a few of them to prison for misuse  of Public funds. I  am not  suggesting that we must take  them to prison without unit but  I  am suggesting that we must take  this natter more seriously.  If We  establish a State  Corrnration like  the  Coast Development Authority,there  has  to be  money to  implement. However,  Bills  are passed  here but  they  are  never implemented  simply because there are  no  funds. I hope that the minister has enough money in the budget to implement the bill.  Sir,  I  also  agree  with the  previous  speaker that the Authority should not necessarily be established in Mombasa. Lamu could be a very good site for its headquarters. I am sure the more remote an area is the most important it is to take an authority like this one there to give people in those areas some hope that the government does recognise them. That is very important. We should not only take the authority to places like Mombasa, Kisumu and other developed areas, but also to remote ares of the country.Sir,  a lot  of land at  the  Coast has not been demarcated. Demarcation and  giving people  title-deeds  is  part  of development of  any region. If tile  ownership of land has not  been established, it  would be very  difficult to  encourage wananchi t o develop their land. Take  Lamu,  for example. A lot  of land there  is  State  land. So,  it  would  be  necessary to declare it adjudication area so that Wananchi 	can have  confidence in what they are  developing. I have been virtually in every village  at the Coast. Therefore,  when I say that Coast  could save  this country's problems,  I mean exactly that. For instance, From Malindi to Tana River and from Nalindi to lamu, all that area is arable land. So, it is for the authority or the ministry concerned to declare the area a settlement area, and the problems my friend, Dr. Mungai, has in Nairobi and other areas will not be there. These people will be given some hope in life.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE  MINISTER  FOR  ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL  RESOURCES 	(Dr.  Mungai): 	On a point  of order,  Mr. Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir. 	Could  the  formr Coast Provincial  Commissionec  show  that  thd people in Tana River or  Lamu district will not  object  if we  send  squatters  there  from  upcountry,  say,  from Rift Valley Province,  Nyeri,  Muranga,  Kiambu districts  or Nairobi  area. We haves many  landless  people  in  those  areas  and we would be  very happy  to start the programme if  everybody  will  be happy  with  it. Secondly,  Sir,  why  did  hon.  Mahihu not invite  us  to sent squatters to  the  Coast Province  when  he was  the provincial  commissioner?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  TEMPRARY  DEPUTY  SPEAKER	(Mr.  Tuva):	Dr.  Mugai,  if I  may  makd aruling  on  that  one,  it  is not  a point of order. You had  better  wait  for yourtime  to  speak  to come  and  then raise your points.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MAHIHU: 	Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  respond  to my hon.  friend  by  saying that  leaders  should  take responsibility. 	When  I  was  thd Coast  Provincial  Commissioner,  you may  wish  to  know,   I  settled  people  at  the Kenyatta Settlement Scheme.  It was  under  the direction of the provincial  commissioner. I  had  squatters  from Mathare  Valley,  Vanga,  Moshi,  Kisii  and  every other  place you can mention  in Kenya.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MAKAU: 	On  a point of order,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir. I  heard  the  former  Coast Provincial  Commissioner  say  that  he  had  squatters  frorh Moshi  settled  in  the coast and  I was wondering whether Moshi  is not  in Tanzania.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  TEMPORARY  DEPUTY SPEAKER	(Mr.  Tuva):	Order,  hon.  Members.	I  wishto  remind hon.  Members  that  a point of order  is  supposed  to point out a breachof  the  Standing Orders  of the House and not  to raise arguments.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MAHIHU:	Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,   I  am  saying  that wesettled  Kenyans from all  those places.	There  was  a titre when Kenyans  were  kickedout  from Moshi  and Tanga and we had to settle them together with other people from  areas  like Mathare Valley who  did not have ihrid. If the leaders explain  	.	-	to  the  wananchi  that  settlement  schemes  belong  to.the  Government,  then there question  of people  coming from  a  certain locality will  not arise. A  landless person  does  not mind  where he comes  from;  he knows his problem and  if you can settle  him wherever you  can  find  a settlement scheme he will not mind. What I  am  saying  her &is  that  the proposed Coast Development Authority  should  take the  question  of settlement  as  one of  its  objectives.	Once  a  settlement  area has  been  declared,  then  settlers  can be  invited  from all over the country.	I am  saying  this  because  if you  ask people  in  Nydri District whether they want people  to  come  from  Mombasa and  settle  in  that district,  the answe will be no. But  if  the settlement belongs  to  the Government,  then  the people will  be settled on  Government  land.	So,   there should  be no  consideration  as  to  where a  landless person  comes  from.	The consideration  should be who  is  landless.	Where  he may come  from should  not be  a matter  of major debate. Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  very  important  that land dealer cation,  especially  at  the  Coast  Province,  should  be  given  special  priority. If  it  becomes  necessary  to declare  a  special  scheme  for  those  people  of Mombasa to  have  the  land demarcated,  that  should be done  so  that they  can settle down permanently.	That should  be  the answer.Lastly,  Sir,  I  want  to  talk  about food.	The  major objective of  theCoast  Development Authority  and  all other authorities  in the countryshould be to  produce enough  food  for Kehyans  to eat. 	Food  is  a major  item  in  our  development  and any  project which can produce sufficient food should be give.n the biomes priority. Production of food also goes  with marketing. So,  when  people produce  food</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT  MINISTER,  OFFICE  OF  THE  VICE-PRESIDENT  AND  MINISTRY  OF FINANCE	(Mr.  Keah):	On  a point  of order,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  speaker,  Sir.I  have  been listening very attentively  to hon.  Mahihu  speaking about  the  CoastDevelopment Authority and emphasising the  settlement of people  from  all  overKenya in  the  Coast Province.	I   wonder whether  this  is  the primary  objective .   .  of  the  proposed Authority.	I  would  like  the hon.  Minister for REgional  Development  to clearly  point out here and now whether,  in  fact,  the Coast Development Authority  is  intended  primarily  for  settlement of people from all  over Kenya at  the  coast.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  MINISTER FOR  REGIONAL  DEVELOPMENT 	(Mr.  Midika): 	Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  whereas  I respect the former Coast Provincial. Commissioner for  being  a  father-in-law of some  Jaluos,  I  want  to  assure him  that what he  is saying  is  a bit misleading. My  intention  is not  to  settle people  at  the Coast Province but,  rather,  to  create an  authority  that will enhance the lives  of the people  already  settled  in  the area.	We will not accept people moving from Kisumu, Alego,  Masailand.	 I will  develop  Masais  where  they  are;  I  will  develop Jaluos with  the  Lake  Basin Development Authority and the North-Eastern people will  be developed  with  Uaso  Nyiro North DdvelopMent Authority. I  will  also  develop  the Masais  at Kajiado.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MAHIHU: 	Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I  think  I  am  entitled to  my  views  because  if we are going  to develop  Kenya we must develop  it as one nation.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  MINISTER  FOR  REGIONAL  DEVELOPMENT	(Mr.  Midika)	: On  a  point  oforder,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir. As  much  as  I  would  not  liket  tointerrupt  the  fomer provincial  commissioner,  I  wish  to  inform him  that we are developing Kenya and the development  is based in  such a way that the facets of development should not be twisted to mean something else. What we are saying here  is  that  the Coast Development Authority will  develop  the people of the area now.	No people will  be imported  to go and be developed  at the Coast Province.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MAHIHU:	Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have no quarrel withwhat the hon.  Minister wants to.do.	If he wante tc do piece-meal dvelopment,I  have  no  quarrel with  that.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE  MINISTER  FOR  REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT	(Mr.  Midika):	On  a  point  oforder,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir.	May  I  kindly  ask you</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER	(Mr.  Tuve):	Is  it  a genuine  point oforder?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  MINISTER  FOR  REGIONAL  DEVELOPMENT	(Mr.  Midika):	Well,   I  am  ona point  of  information,  Sir.	May  I	through   your  Chair  inform  the  formerprovincial  commissioner,  sincerely  and wholeheartedly,  that there  is  nothingpiece-meal  about  the  Coast Development Authority.	Nor  is  there  anything piece-meal  in  the  development  of  any  other  authority.	The only  piece-meal  that  I  canremember  is  when  the  former provincial  commissioner used to settle peole "piece-meally".</Newspeech>(Laughter) <Newspeech>MR.  MALEBE:	On  a  point  of  information,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,Sir.	If  the Minister understands  the meaning of Section 8(d),  it says,  in part:-"To  co-ordinate  the various  studies  of  scheme  within the  area such  that  human  resources  are  utilised  to the  best  advantagel". Now,  I  am sure  that  this  is where hon.  Mahihu is bringing  in the area of settlement  schemes  so  that you can utilise the human resources,  in other words,  settle the  people within  the Coast  area.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  MINISTER  FOR  REGIONAL  DEVELOPMENT	(Mr.  Midika):	On  a point  oforder,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir.	We  should  not  allow  ourselves  tobe  misled.	I  am  sure  that hon.  Malebe,  who  is  a mine  engineer And theCoast area has  a  lot  of minerals and we will  need mine  engineers. There out we  will  not need-mine  engineers to settle  there;  they can go and help develop the  people  but not to  settle there.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  TEMPORARY DEPUTY  SPEAKER 	(Mr.  Tuva): 	Order.  hon.

I  am  sure  the  Ministerhas  heard  all  that 	I  had to  say  and that he  needs  time  to  digest it.	I  am   concluding  by  saying  that  human resources,   be  it  in.the  Coast   or  elsewhere,   needs  to  be   settled.With  those  few remarks, I support  the  Bill.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT	MINISTER,   OFFICE  OF  THE  VICE-PRESIDENTAND MINISTRY  OF  FINANCE!:	Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.   TemporaryDeputy  Speaker,   Sir,   for  the  giving the m  opportunity to  support the 	Bill. In  supporting  this  Bill,  I  would  like  in  the  outset  to congratulate   the  Minister  for  Regional  Development  for  bringing  this Bill  to   the   House   at  this  time. The  introduction  of  this  Bill  in the  House   is, in fact,   long  overdue  and  that  is  why  I  am  applauding its  introduction  in  the   House. Much  as  I respect  the  Previous  speaker's  opinions  and Points  raised  I  would  like  to  say  that  we  must  have  balanced development  in  all  the   Provinces,   districts,   divisions,   locations and   sub-locations;   we  must  not  have  chewed  up development  where certain  areas  have  in  the past  received  preferential  treatment  to the   detriment	other  areas,   coast being  one   of  them.	If  theCoat  has,   therefore,   not  received  its  fair, shrae   of  the   developmentcake,   now  it  is  its- time.  I will not  allow myself  to  be  drawn intoan  argument  that  the  Coast  Development  Authority will be there to   settle   people   from  all  over  Kenya. How  can  you  settle  from  all  Kenya  when right  now we  have   sauatters  with  tHwhom we  have hadproblems.I  thank his  Exellency the  President  for  coming to  therescue   of  the  Coast  people  by  ordering  that,  they  be  given  titledeeds  for  wherever  they have  been  living  for  generations  andgenerations.	With  all  due  respect  due  the  tenure  of  the  former  Coast Provincial commissioner (pc) you would never find ketane, charo or Ndama being settled in Nyeri, Uasin Gishu or any other place in the coast. Despite his efforts when he was the coast pc. I am afraid to say the coast was as much neglected as it is now. In saying this I am not disgarding the development of the hotel industry and the bridge under construction in the coast. I am particularly talking about solving the land issue for the coast people. I would have wished to hear the former coast PC talk about the landless at the coast and how he dealt with the problem.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am opposed to some of the remarks made by my food friends, hon. Mahihu, in so far as settling the landless of Kenya in the coast is concerned. In principle, first and foremost the coast people must get the first share; thereafter, and oly then, can others also be given a share , if there is anything left. Since our birth rate is fairly high I would venture to suggest that there is really no land available for anybody else other the coast people.Let me now turn to the Bill. This Bill is well drewn and I congratulate the ministry and Attorney-General for that. But I would like to say that we look at this Bill as the salvation of the coast people in long run. I look at this Bill as one raising a ray of hope for systemitised development at the coast for the coast people. Thus I would like to see this Bill contain enough responsibility within it to enable the authority plan and execute the development aspect of the coast. The Bill must in fact be tailor-made to the needs of the coast as opposed to drawing from the other development authorities in existence. Since we have the " benefit  of the  hindsind  of the  previous	Bills, this  oneshould be  an improvement  upon those  other Bills. Mr.  Ternporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I would like  to  add here  that  the  Coast  is certainly pontentially rich. 	While we  want  the Coast  Development Authority to  benefit  all the  Kenyans,  I would like it  to be  known  that this Authority should aim at benefiting first  and foremost  the  people  indigenous  to  the  Coast.	In  saying	thisI am not  being tribalistic  at  all;  I  am merely putting emphasis where  it  should be  put.In this Bill must be entrenched the coffee, tea and the pyrethrum of  the Coast.	Nowhere, in the  kenyan  statutes will youfind at the moment, to  the  best  Of my knowledge and belief,  will youfind entrenched the  development of the  coconut  and  cashewrat industries. 	As a result, the  development these  two major cash crops  has  been haphazard. Look at  the  way the  coconut  and cashewnut trees have  been  planted very haPhazardly,  indeed. This haphard nature  shows  that there  has  been no  proper  planning.	Compare  and constrast  that with coffee,  tea  and pyrethrum.  I am delighted to know that  mangoes  and pinneapples  and horticultural  products  are covered somewhere  m in the  Horticultural Crops Development Authority. This Bill talks about agriculture, tourism,  fishing and industries  at  the  Coast,  but I  am resuesting the hon. Minister to introduce  an  amendment  to  it to  ensure  that  the development of the coconut  and  cashewnut crops into  this	In this way when  established this   Authority will certainly see to it that, among other crops,  itis  specifically recuired to look into the development and marketing of the coconut and cashewnut crops.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, having said that, I would like at this juncture to turn to the question of copra industry. At the moment, the copra prices have fallen from shs. 6/30 to about shs. 3/50 per kilo. It a recent district development committee meeting at kilifi, a representative of one of the millers clearly stated that the price of copra has fallen dowd because the millers have no incentive to process the copra simply because there is no market in Kenya for coconut oil. As a result, the coconut oil tank belong to the millers are now full and the millers have no room to keep the extra coconut oil ther produce. Consequently, the price of copra had to fall down in order to curtail production. Mr. Temporary Deputy speaker,Sir, I have never heard such a ridiculous statement and I would like the minister for commerce to investigate into these allegations. I do not have the facts and that is why I am saying that I would like the minister to investigate into these allegations. There is a further allegation that there is a lot of coconut oil being imported into the country at the detriment of the coconut. Oil produced at the coast. We are now being faced with a lot of question in our constituencies as to what is happening to the price of copra.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when the coast development Authority comes into being, we shall be saved from this situation. That is why I started bt saying that I see into this Bill, salvation in the development efforts of the coast province. Having said that, I would as like the Bill, clause by clause and so doing make a couple of suggestions. Whereas. Whereas I appreciate that this Bill has been very well drafted in that it covers as much as possible, the various development efforts at  the coast province, I could like  Emphasise certain aspects of this Bill, I would like to see certain aspects of the Bill being highlighted. For example, If you look at clause 2 of the Bill, you will notice that it appear to contain some measure of conflict in terms of the area covered by the coast development Authority. The ares covered by this authority seems to also be covered by the Tana River development Authority. I do not see any problem arising out of this, but what I would like to hear from the Minister, an assurance that there is not going to be any sort of conflict between the two authorities.The next clause, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, is Clause No.4. In this Clause, I feel that perhaps the permanent secretary of livestock development would be involved here. I am saying this because the northern coastal are quite a lot with livestock. Also, We could have under this clause the permanent secretary of Environment and Netural Resources, in view of the fact that there is a lot of potential for minerals at the coast and also the permanent secretary of the Ministry of tourism and wildlife due to the richness of tourism at the coast. There three other permanent secretary could be included in the panel of the board. Furthermore, I would also like to suggest that perhaps the Non-officials members ought to also be increased from eight to twelve in order to maintain the balance of the official members of the board and the non-official members of the board. To add on to that, I sincerely hope and be taken into consideration in terms of who is who in the board.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other which I would  like to touch on is clause No.8. Under this clause, I would merely like to suggest extreciment. If you know at part (c) of this clause, the minister take about  and  exploitation of natural resources and I would suggest that the coconut  and cashewnut 	industries	should be included. If the Minister would permit me, I would like to specifically include under this clause,  the development and marketing of the coconut and cashewnuts as well as other cash crops.  Under the sane clause  same clause subclause (m)  the minister says: "to  Plan and liaise with the relevant authorities as necessary in the  exploration and development  “Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,  after the world, “necessary" on the  second line,  I would like the word,"Execute " to be inserted so that the subclause now reads:-"to  plan and liaise with the relevant authorities as necessary and execute the exploration “ What  I want here is the addition of the word,  "execute" because this would then give more emphasis to the authority and gives it more responsibility.	Therefore,  I would	like the Authority to beexecuting development.	I would also like to  add to more subclause under clause 8 so that there is a sub clause(n) and subclause (o). Sub-clause8(n) would ready: :to initiate training programmes and development of manpower in order to achieve this goal”.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, sub-clause8 (o), would read:- "to liaise with the relevant 	Ministry and speed up the process of adjudication and  settlement  of the people in their accepted area and the construction of roads communication facilities and provider of primary health care for the effective implementation of the functions of the Authority “.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I started off by saying that this Authority should first address itself to the needs of the 	coast, people and one of the biggest issues at the coast is the settlement of the landless. We know that the settlement of the  The landless is under the ministry of Lands and Housing, and therefore, there must be some kind of liaison between the Authority and the Ministry in speeding up land adjudication and settlement processor. This must be a primary responsibility of the Authority to make sure that the coast landless people are aettled first. First of all, you have to remove the beam that is in your eye before you can remove the beam in another persons eye. This is the principle that should be followed.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other clause that I would Like to touch on now is perhaps clause 12 which talks about the accounts and the audit of the authority’s books. I totally agree with the Minister regarding the accountability aspect of the Authority to the Funds provided. The coast Development Authority will be receiving funds from the budgets as well as from other sources. Therefore, it is imperative that proper books of accounts are maintained and that these accounts are audited from time to time and that audites reports are produced in this house. Earlier on I had seen the Auditor-General ( corporational) here, but I think he has just left. However, I would like to emphasise on the need to ensure that as a young authority coming up at this time and age, should not lag behind in its accounts.  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir, we would like the Authority to be having its books of accounts closed at year-end and within   three months those accounts are audited so that in about six months we have a set of audited accounts.  I cannot over-emphasize this need. I would, at the same time,  like to stress that it is imperative that the Authority has strict budgetary control  procedures. It must budget for its activities; ensure that money is spent in accordance-with the approved budget. I  expect that the Authority will  be given adequate authority to ensure that it can solicit for funds from wherever it can,  of course, through the parent Ministry. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I think  I have made a fair share of my contribution to this Bill  but,  once again,  I would like to reiterate the principle objective of this Bill. When it comes into force, it will  be a savious to the people of the Coast Province and its people. It will  be a saviour of the coconut industry; the cashewnut industry and a provider of employment and will  also uplift the standards   of living of the people from-the Coast Province. With those few remarks,  I  support the Bill.</Newspeech> (The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr.  Mahihu)  took the Chair) <Newspeech>MR.  MAKAU:   Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to make a few comments with regard to this important Bill.   The idea of setting up development authorities is for them to mobilise resources for development. It is very clearly sta:.ed in the Bill  that that is what is aimed at in setting up the Coast Development Authority. However, there has been a tendency for development authorities to  spend the grants they have been given by the Government on administrative costs,  even to the extent of 70 per cent. I would like to urge those who will  be responsible for the Coast Development Authority to make sure that more is spent on development rather than administrative costs like offices, or even having more employees than are needed. I would like those who will be resoonsible for this Authority to look into what has been done by the other authorities like Tarda, Kerio Valley Development Authority and so-on in order to know how to operate. Having said that,  Sir,  I would quickly like to say that the fishing industry is an area that this new Authority should address itself to. I would like to suggest that because of the economic growth that has come into being, as a result of the extension of the 200 nautical  miles of sea for exploitation for fishing, the Minister should encourage joint ventures with countries that have experience in that field, like Japan and South Korea for us to profitably exploit the fishing industry and earn ourselves foreign exchange.   Those in the Authority should,negotiate and work out such joint ventures so that we can market our fishing catch in other foreign countrs for the benefit of the country. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker: sir, I also believe that the newAuthority can harness Lake Jipe and whatever is there for production of hydro-electric power so that the area does not entirely depend on power from other areas.   I believe that can be done.   The Authority has been set up in an area where tourism thrives very well.   What I would like to suggest here is that the Authority interests itself in the provision of tourism services. As everybody is aware,  tourism is earning this country a lot of foreign exchange earnings;  in fact, to the tune of Ksh.8 billion, with a focus for Ksh.l0 billion next year.   There is need, and a crucial one, too, for the	minster of Tourism and Wildlife who coincidentally from the Coast Province 	to explore possibilities of starting an  institution at the Coast to train tourist-related trades,   At the moment we have the Utalii  College but the bulk of the services are at the Coast Province.   We should,  therefore,  have a constituent college at the Coast Province to teach more tourist-related subjects because,  in fact, the students would be able to get practical  examples.   That is where the action is.  The Authority should even have the leverage to go out and look for funds to set up such a training institution. There is the question of environmental poluttion which is a very important area for the new Authority to address itself to.   We depend on tourism heavily and the Coast area can be destroyed overnight if this pollution aspect is not checked.   The beautiful  beaches that tourists come to see and relax about can be destroyed by those merchants of death who are always out to dump toxic waste in our Coastal  areas. It also did happen the other day in Lake Victoria and I thank Mr.  Dalmas Onyango for having acted on the culprits who had dumped some toxic waste into the lake.	It is very bad for somebody to do that and a lot of marine and land animals are killed.	I would like to urge those who will  be responsible for the Cbast Development Authority to emphasize on the need to avoid pollution. Everybody is aware that the leakage that took place at Kipevu destroyed a lot of plants and marine animals in that area. This is an issue that this Authority,  therefore,  should very seriously address itself to. Let me also touch on what has been stated in the Bill, that the financing of the Coast Development Authority will  be from the Government and funds to be borrowed from donor countries and from other sources. It is very clear, when you read today's newspapers, particularly the circular  from the Permanent Secretary in the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance, that the situation is not very good,  and it may become worse.  We note that funds will  not be available in the Government.   So,  the second option spelt out in the Bill, to look for funds from donor countries should be utilised for the operation of the Bill.   That is actually why these development authorities are set up,-not to look for finances from the Government,  but to be able to marshal  resources from outside the country. Sir, the Tana and Athi  River Development Authority, the Kerio Valley Development Authority were able to shop around in foreign countries and   secure funding for the major developments they are carrying out.  This new Authority has a lot of areas in which  it can shop around for finances. I mentioned the setting up of constituent college of the Utalii College in the Coast Province to serve the tourism industry there. I also talked about the need for prevention cf environmental  pollution.   These are main areas- of operation for which anyone shopping, for example, to the United Nations   Environmental Programme would get such assistance because the environmental  protection is a current need everywhere in the world. If those in the Authority have good proposals,  such financing would be readily available. Sir,  that is why I  am stressing on the other source of borrowing, namely from donor agencies.   We are aware that those   who would like to give us foreign aid are having problems.   Everybody in this country knows that there is a great conspiracy by the Western nations as far as foreign aid is concerned.   Kenya is a very lucky country because of its stability, foresight and guidance of His Excellency the President.   We also have competent civil  servants, especially in the Ministry of Finance who have improved on the management of our finances and also because we have set our objectives right in the Sessional  Paper No. 1 of 1986. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  at this juncture,  I would like to congratulate the Vice-President and Minister for Finance as well as the Minister for Planning and Economic Development for the successful   Paris meeting they had the otber day where Kenya secured Ksh.23 billion from donors.   That is what one would actually term a successful  venture because Kenya is known to have prudent management of its resources and finances and Sessional  Paper No. 1 of 1986 is a very good document to go by when shopping around for sucn donor funds.  If you look at hat happened, it is very clear that that was the ectact amount that had been promised previously. We did not get additional funds but they managed to get some. No should that the end of the cold war made Africa  we are no needed. This should be very clear to everybody. These people that used to provide us with foreign aid were because we were not needed. We were only needed when they warned bases. The fact that commission has collespect, We are not needed. Now there is flight of foreign aid funds to eastern Europe and even Russia because western democracies have to make sure that these countries exist. In order for them to maintain the Eastern European countries that were  once  comaanist and to make  sure that Russia continues with its system of government,  the western world needs to invest 	2.7 trillion dollars. They have already set up reconstruction banks for those countries. When you look at it,  Sir, you can see that they do not have  funds to give to Africancountries. This is the great conspiracy against Africa that I have referred to. That is why western countries have conspired among themselves and said "We  cannot  afford to give  any money to Africa. 	Africa is  irrelevant;  we do not need. it. We do not need a base in   Mombasa   because there is no threat of communism.	We do not need a	base  anywhere."   That  is why they	come up with this  conspiracy and excuses by telling African	countries "You should do this and that  in order for you to get foreign aid. You should introduces Pluralism."   That why I am calling it a conspiracy.We  are very lucky in Kenya because we  had set a	string foundation We  also have prodent management of the finances in this country. Similarly, we have managed our policics well and that is why we have survived. That is why we those countries which are managing fallen. These are the countries which have taken instrument as the western world hence they have as stop talking about majority and minority tribes. We  should know that thiscountry has been saved by  the fact	that stability has reigned sincethe  time of the	founding father of this nation up so now under the intership of prosident for.We know that	the weatern countries are coming up with excuses in as far as foreign aid is concerned.	That  is why they ware us to have an opposing party in order to case instability in this country. What wny we are  emphasizing the fact that change should come from within 'the country. Kenyans should come up with changes themselves, not from cutside.  I  am happy to note  that the Office of the Vice-president and ministry of Finance have taken measures to make sure that we conserve the little  that we have.	It  is very, important for African countries to unite and trade among themselves.	This is because we are not going to trade with Europe.	Those, of us who have read about the international market,	know that nothing is going to be there in 1922; preferential trentment is not going to be there. There is that conspiracy against Africa.	We should, therefore, make  sure  that we reduce our dependency on foreign aid.We are lucky because Kenya does not depend much on foreign aid s far as its budget is concerned; it is only about 24per cent. We should reduce this dependency to about. 5 per cent. Those countries which depended on foreign aid to the level of 50 per cent, when they were given instructions by the weatern world, they followed them. we have succeeded in this respect because our planning has been excellent. I know that we have been having financial problems here and there but they came as a result of the gulf crics. We should not depend much on foreign aid because the situation is not going to improve.I would like to call upon all Kenyans in position as forget about the od duty free imported Mercedes Benses. The measures that have been set up should go even whether because we are as the situation, Leaders should go round and explain to the wananchi what those measures are all about.It is the Gulf Crisis that has caused all these problems.Africa is suffering because fuel prices are going un and that is why we have found ourselves in this award situation. When you the situation, you will wonder because we are supporting Saudi Arabia andKuwait and giving moral support to the western world. We want to say thatwe are with them.	That is fine and Kenya is committed in this direction.We are happy that the Minister for  Foreign Affairs and 	InternationalCooperation has made it very clear to the EZC ambassadors that	are withthem     The United States of America went round telling everybody in the western world that they should finance that crisis. 	They 	gave billions of dollars to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in order to finance the American who are there. But what about Africa?  That is why I talked about a conspiracy. They should sent emergency funds to Africa. What are we setting by supporting the western world?  They should send emergency funds to African countries like Kenya which is committed in supporting them so that we do not suffer due to the Crisis in the Gulf. Why are we supporting Kuwait and A Saudi Arabia? What are we getting out of that apart from the suffering that we are getting? The Americans even went to Japan and Germany to ask them to support their soldiers in the Gulf. As a result of this, Japan sent its soldiers to Gulf contrary to their Constitution.  	This is why I say that there is a great conspiracy against African states. Wekeep on telling overseas countries in the United Nations,  "We are with you", but what do we get from this?	Saudi Arabi, and Kuwait have invested many dollars inthe western world.	They should set up an emergency fund to assist those of uswho have made a sacrifice so that when we talk about the problems that we are facing as a result of the Gulf crisis, may see that we are being helped. I stress this point because Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, with due respect, have no democracy. They are just talking about becoming democratic and Americans have acknowledged that these countries have a problem, but they are not doing so because these countries are democratic. These countries are monarchies, and they will have a problem after the Gulf crisis is solved because their people have tasted democracy. Here we are in the east African region. We have had Rwanda invadedby refugees.	How do refugees go out in tens of thousands with heavy artilleryand invade a sovereign state of Rwanda? 	As we sit here, we do not know what a neighbour may be planning out of jealousy and envy.

Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipa nafasi hii niongee machache kuhusu Mswada huu. Kwanza kabisa, ningetaka kuishukuru Serikali kwa kufikiria kuibuni halmasnauri  ya maendeleo yaPwani. Pia, ningependa kuishukuru Wizara ya Maendeleo ya Mikoa, inayoendeshwa na Waziri Sw. Onyango Midika, kwa kufikiria kubuni h,aimashauri hii kwa wakati kama huu unaofaa sana.  Mswada huu ni mmoja wenye manufaa makubwa nasi tunaouzungumzia tunakubaliana na jinsi ulivyo mzuri na kwa uangalifu uliotumika kuutayarisha. Tunaona pia kuwa umefikiria sehemu zotc zinazohusika katika eneo linalotarajiwa kuwa chini ya halmashauri mpya. Sehemu ambazo zimetajwa ni sehemu ambazo zina rasilmali iliyo nyingi na inayofanya kuwe na niaya kuundwa kwa halmashauri kama hii. Mambo ya uundaji wa halmashauri hii yamezungumzwa kwa muda mrefu, ingawa hapo awali mawazo yalikuwa ya kuunda halmashauri ya kushughulikia kilimo cha minazi peke yake. Tunashukuru sasa hivi kwamba halmashauri kama hii itaundwa na kuwa kutokana na Serikali kuona umuhimu wake, badala ya kufikiria tu ukuzaji wa minazi, sasa halmashauri hii itazifikia sehemu nyingine nyingi ambako minazi haikuzwi lakini kuna manufaa mengine kwa wananchi yanayowaza kuyainua maendeleo yao. 	Ningependa kuzungumza kuhusu jinsi Wabunge wenzangu wameyatoa maoni yao katika Mswada huu.	Hasa ningependa kugusia vifungu fulani ambavyo hao Wabunge wenzangu wamevitaja kama vinavyofaa kurekebishwa kidogo. Mhe. Keah, kwa mfano, amejitokeza na kuvitaja vifungu fulani, na ningependa kuongeza kwamba tumeviangalia vifungu hivyo kama Wabunge, na tukapendekeza kwamba Waziri ajaribu kufanya marekebisho. Hii ni hasa kama uwakilishi wa wanachama kutoka sita hadi saba; kuhusu maeneo yanayohusika; kuhusu uwakilishi wa wale ambao si wanachama wa mkao huo, na kadhalika. Haya yote tumeyaona yakiwa ya muhimu na tungemtaka Waziri ayachunguze ili kuona kwamba ameingiza marekebisho tunayopendekeza. Tunakubaliana kwamba Makatibu wa Kudumu waongezwe, kama ilivyotajwa, kama vile Makatibu wa Kudumu katika Wizara zifuatazo. 	Wizara ya Utalii na Wanyama wa Porini, Wizara ya Mazingara na Mali ya Asili, Wizara ya Mifugo na kadhalika. Tulipousoma Mswada huu tuliona kwamba Katiba wa Kudumu katika Wizara ya Afya ametajwa, lakini hata baada ya kuusoma Mswada wotc, hatukuona ni katika jambo gani Katibu waKudumu huyo atakavyoingia katika halmashauri hii. Tlatuonijinsi atakavyo kuwa akifanya shughuli zozote katika halmashauri, ila tu pengine katika hali ya afyaya watu,  ikiwa eneo hilo lote litakuwa likirikiriwa.  Kwa hivyo, Bw.

Hizo zote 	ni Nyanja muhimu sana.Naibu Spika wa muda, ningependa Kusema Kwamba ili Coast Development Authority iweze nf 1aziwe kuwe na ya kufanya utafiti. Hii ni kwa sababli utafiti ni sehemi mole. ambayo ni lazima iwekwe mbele kiwa memlaka hii itaweza kufaulu. Hili ni kaa sababu mambo haya yote ambayo yametajuwa yanshitaji utafiti wa hali ya juu. Ninasema hivyo kwa kukikosekam  kiungo hicho cha hail ya utafiti basi kazi itazoroteka.Nikiendelea kucnea juu ya utafiti ningependa kugusia juuya mti ambao unajulikana eisi sate hapa nao ni mti wa mnazi.

Naibu Spika wa muda, mambo haya yote ambayo uyametajwa japa kunusu pesa Tunajua kwamne Mamlake hii itahitaji kiasi kikubwa sana cha pesa. Tumatiaini kwamba wizara itakuwa na mipango mallum kuhusu usinamizi wa pesa.

Wabunge ambao wametoa maoni  yao kusema kwamba singependelea Halmashauri ya Maendeleo ya Mkoa wa Pwani yangeuzwa na kuwa ya kutafutia watu makao. Nafikiri tungekuwa zaidi na msimam, wa kusema kwamba makao yapatikane, na Wizara ya mhe. Midika, ikishirikiana na Wizara ya Ardhi, Nyumba na Mipango ya Miji zishirikiane kutafutia watu makao. Itakuwa ni vigumu sana kusema kwamba tutachukua watu kutoka mahali kwingine na kuwapatia makao katika Mkoa wa Pwani iii waweze kuldta maendeleo. Ninajua kwamba Halmashauri inayopendekezwa haiwdzi kudndelea bila watu, lakini tayari kuna watu katika Mkoa wa Pwani ambao wanahitaji usaidizi wa mafunzo na mambo mengine kama hayo. Ikiwa kutakuwa na nafasi, basi tutawakaribisha watu kutoka sehemu nyingine nchini na ikiwa kutakuwa kumejaa basi tutasema hakuna nafasi. Kwa hivyo, ile kazi maalumu ya Halmashauri hii itakuwa ni kuinua hali ya maisha ya watu ambao tayari wako katika Mkoa wa Pwani.            Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, tulipokuwa tukivangalia Mswada huu, tuliona kwamba kuna jambo moja lililokuwa limdachwa nje, yaani ufunzi wa watu au manpower development, na tukafikiria kwamba hilo ni jambo ambalo lingepatiwa nafasi katika Halmashauri hii.  "Ufunzi wa watu ni muhimu sana kwa sababu Halmashauri hii itaweza kutumia watu walio na ujuzi iii kuwa na maendeleo. Kwa hivyo, katika mabadiliko ambayo tumependekdza kwa Waziri, tumeonelea kwamba jambo hilo liwekwe hapo kwa sababu litaiwezesha Wizara kutafuta pesa za kuelimisha watu ndipo iweze kupata maendeleo makubwa zaidi. Hatungetaka Halmashauri hii ididimie na kuanguka kwa sababu ya kukosa watu walio na ujuzi wa mambo mbali mbali. Kama vile mhe. Makau alivyosema, yafaa kuwe na mafunzo ya mambo ya utalii na mambo mengine katika Halmashauri hii.	Mawazo hayo ni mazuri sana na nina hakika kwamba yanafikiriwa na Wizara inayohusika. Hata ningeonelea tuwe na shule.au kituo kineine weza kufundisha watu kazi ya hotdli.   Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, mambo yabarabara na simu yametajwa hapa, na tunaishukuru sana Serikali kwa sababu inaonekana ilikuwa imefikiria kimbele kwamba kutakuja kuwa na Halmashauri hii siku moja na ikajeuga daraja ya Nyali na lile lingine la Mtwapa.	Kwa wakati huu daraja la Kilifi limeunganishwa na mahali kwingine na lile lingine linaendelea kujzmgwa upande wa Garse:n.	Pia, kituo cha ndege kimejengwa na mambo mengine mengi yamefanywa.	Kwa hivyo,  tayari mambo fulani fulani yamekwishakutiliwa mkazo na Serikali.	Lililoko sasa na kuendeleakutia mkazo zile sehemu ambazo hazijafunguliwa iii nazo zipata nafasi ya kuweza kuenda kasi zaidi. Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ninaungaka kabisa kikamilifu na Wahe. Wabunge  wenzangu kuishukuru sana Serikali kwa kuleta Mswada huu wakati huu	ambao ni mzuri sana.	Ninafikiri kwamba ifikapo mwaka wa 1991 tutakuwa tumeanza mambo haya kikamilifu katika Mkoa wa Pwani na kuweza kuinua hali ya maisha ya watu wetu. 	Pia, watu wetu watakuwa na nguvu kujijenga kiuchumi na tutakuwa na mafanikio mengi na makubwa. Kwa hayo machache, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, naunga mkono.</Newspeech>    <Newspeech> MR. TUVA:	Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary DeputySpeaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to theBill. First of all we are very much pleased;  This is because,in fact, we were not asking for a Bill to creates a development authority we 	 were asking for a RmIr coconut authority, or a board,  that would ensure that the farmer was remunerated Properly, research was carried out for good husbandry so that the Farmer would get an income almost equivalent, if not the same as to that of farmers elsewhere in the country. I would like to know the area of operation of the authority. Earlier we were told by the ministry that there would he no conflict in the area of this Coast Development Authority and the TARDA, But as an example, in 1981 the Ministry that was responsible for fisheries went to ask for assistance from the world Bank to imProve the lot of the fisherman; at the same the Ministry of Cooperative Development, that was also helping the same fisherman, went to ask for identical assistance from the Nordic countries, and there was a clash. The World Bank was giving a loan while the Nordic countries were giving a grant; but the two Ministries did not coordinate their planning; the clash then and we lost the grant. My argument is that there should be a clear ddfinition of the area of operation of the TARDA and the Coast Development uthority. Anyway, it is very encouraging to see that the Coast Development Authority has been included in this years estimates and so there will be some money to start it off. I would like to add to what hon. Keah said earlier, namely the inclusion of the relevant like that of the Ministry of 	 Reclelmation and Development of Arid, SemiArid and Wastelards in themanagement board of this authority. This is because crops can do well 	in good parts of Tana River, Lamu and the Taru Desert because of scanty rainfall.</Newspeech> <Header>ADJOURNMENT </Header><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mahihu): 	Hon, Members,it is time for interruption of the business of the House.

That will include Machakos District.</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.	Last week but one the same Assistant Minister said that they had received the chassis and that the tippers were in the process of being assembled. Today he is telling this House that the tippers have not been received from overseas.  Is hi in order to speak the way he wants?</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MAIYANI:	Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have just said, the tippersare arriving in phases and some are already in our workshops here. I am notsaying anything:different from what I said last week. Those which have arrivedare having their b6dies assembled and will be delivered as soon as they are ready.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech> MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant minister has said that the road vas repaired and graded only last month. He was misled because. no repair has been done. The road was only graded. Why does he use the word "repair"? What has been "repaired"?</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, when a road has been “done”,  graded and gravelled, I would consider that to be "repair". That is why I used the word "repair". I have also stated that there is a small section which is to be “done” as soon as ger the graders.</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MWALIZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the road is either repaired  and grade or the road is only graded. This road has only been graded and no repair has been carried out on it. "Repair" means makng culverts and so on. Will he agree with me that there has been no repair carried out on this road?</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MAIUANI: Speaker, Sir, well, if we may differ in the language,"grading" means "repairing" a road as well.</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. WAMZAEDI: Mr. Speaker,Sir, why did the Assistant Minister then use the two words, "repair" and "grade"? why did he not ju st use one word?  The road has not been "repaired".</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir,  the road has been "graded".</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KUBO: On a point of order, Mr.Speaker, Sir. Hon. Mwamzandi wants the road repaired and the Assistant Minister is just talking about grading a road. Repair is more complicate than grading. So, can he guarantee that he is going to repair the road, putting culverts and so on?</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MAIYANT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we are going to do gravelling of the road, surely, we shall see to the problem of culverts, if there are any, necause they have not been pointed.But there ware any culverts reauired, it is our duty to put thembecause the idea is to take the road good for our people.</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR.

KUBO, on behalf of Mr. Ndzai, asked the Yni is ter for Lands and Housing in view of the fact that the Ministry does not have enough surveyors to demarcate all agriOultural land, if wananchi could be allowed to employ on	surveyors to do this work. <Newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER J'OR LANDS AND HOUSING (Mt. Bomett): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. It is true that the Ministry of Lands and Housing does not have enough surveyors to demarcate all agricultural land. However, I would like to state that the administration of the Land Adjudication Act (Cap.284) and Land Consolidation Act ( Cap.283)is entirely a Government affair and it would be irregular to introduce the services of private surveyors. The law providesfor adequate protection for the parties who may be aggrieved bythe land adjuducation, consolidation or surveying procass.  However , private, surveyors can be hired to survey other agricultural land not undergoing adjudication or consolidationprocess under the Survey Act (Cap. 299) which provides for the replacement of private surveyors in consultation with the Director of Surveys.</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure hiring private surveyors is very expensive. What plans does the Ministry have say, to import surveyors from outside the country or train more surveyors locally?</Newspeech>  <Newspeech> MR. BOMETT:	Mr, Speaker, Sir, at this time and juncture, the Government has no plans whatsoever to import surveyors. outside the countuy since we have four,universities offering surveying as a course. We have enough talents and we are training then fast.</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KUBO:	Mr. Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the replyfrom the Assistant Einister,and in view of the fact that adjudication process is delayed due to lack of surveyors, can the Ministry consider giving this work to private surveyors on contract so that they will be working as Government agents?</Newspeech>  <Newspeech> MR. BOMETT:	Mr. Speaker, Sir, land adjudication is aprocess which has been going on for quite a considerable timesince we attained our Indendence. It is aufte an important work thatis being carried out by the Government. In fact, we know thatthe people of Kenya value land very much and, indeed, all laws and Acts that have been passed in this House are for protectionof the rights of individuals. Therefore, for that reason, wecannot invite private surveyors to do this work because even the 	Act does not allow it. Again, in all the districts where land adjudicationhas been carried out, people are satisfied and we intend to carry	out the exercise throughout the country.</Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR. KUBO: Mr. Speaker,Sir, the point that I am tryingto raise here is that while I apprediate that private surveyors should not be involved in the actual adjudication work, but could carry out the general survey work in the area,would the Ministry consider usingprivate surveyors to accelerate the survey process so that wananchi in this area could eventually be given title deeds.</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. BOMETT: Mr.Speaker, Sir, our experience in dealing with fand matters is such that even survey work itself, which may appear to be something quite easy, could bring a lot of problems resulting into disputes and quarrels, and we reject any move that could bring k about this kind of situatian.</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. SPEAKER: Can we now move on to Questions by Private Notice.</Newspeech>QUESTIONS BY PRIVATE NOTICE <Header>Wrong Location for YattaToll Station<Header><Newspeech> MR. KIILU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Public Works, the following Question by Private Notice:What factors prompted the Ministry to construct the Yatta Toll Station so close to the Ruiru Toll Station.</Newspeech><Newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Maiyani): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. Several factors were considered When establishing a toll station at Yatta and some of these factors are:One, Ruiru. Toll station is located on a different international trunk road linking Nairobi and Moyale, while Yatta toll station is on the ThikaGarissa Road linking kenya and Somalia and this road will soon be handling transit traffic. Two, traffic flow between Thika and Yatta has grown repidly following the bitumenization of the road with the conseauent damage to the road pavement., Theroad, therefore, as construction continues,  requires regular maintenance and hence the need to have a toll station at a point which is viable depending on the traffic flow. This point is at the proposed toll station site <Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KIILU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have already indicatedin my Question, the Yatta toll station is very close to the Ruiru toll station and at the moment, people travelling to and from Masinga are, being forced to pay twice. Therefore, would the Ministry consider the pligat of these people and at least allow them to be paying only once by showing a receipt from the first toll station they go throngh.</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MAIYANI:  Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the moment 	I cannot a positive answer to that supplementary question. We are still at an early stage and therefore, we need to study the position further with a view to finding out whether any changes could be made with regard to the positioning of these 	toll stations. Nevertheless, the hon. Member should agree with me that it is necessary to raise money for the maintenance of this very  important road, namely from. Thika through Garissa to the Somalia border. This is going to be a very busy road according to the report we have regarding the volume of traffic going towards that direction.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.	KIRWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we appreciate the intention of the Ministry in studying the situation further as. the Assistant Minister says, would it not be best to shift the new toll station further away from Masinga so that people to and from Na Masinga are not forced to pay twice for toll charges.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. 	MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, with all due respect, I think I have already answer that question when I said that the situation is still being studied to find out the most appropriate position for that toll station.	We have done this before when weshifted the toll station along the Nakuru  Road and we also shifted the one on Naiobi/Mombasa Road many these. So, there is 	   absolutely no problem in changing this  particular toll station if found necessary.	However, the most imortant things to raise the necessary income for the regular mainzanance of 	this  road.</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KIILU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I agree with the Assistant  minister  is he aware that when it rams, people travelling from Masinga are forced to go through three toll stations? This is becauS4 pait of this road becomes impassable foiding them to travel thronell the district headquarters.Could the Assistant Minister  promise in this House that after studying this situation, he will undertake to consider the plight of the people from Masinga who are being victimised at the moment.</Newspeech><Newspeech> Mr.Speaker, Sir, there is no intention on part of my Minister to victimise anybody and asI have just indicated, we are studying the situation and we hope to be able to rectify the position if found necessary to do so.</Newspeech>  	<Newspeech> MR.

GALGALLO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Regional Development, the following Question by Private Notice:Since there has been crop failure at aura Irrigation Scheme due to lack of water, could the Minister consider waiving all the charges of water, fertilizer and aerial spraying In respect of the affected farmers in Bura Settlement Project?</Newspeech><Newspeech> THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. I do agree with the hon. Member entirely and I would like to assure hi m and the. House that everthing humanly 	Possible is being done to establish how many people have been affected and now much is involved so that we may come up with a decision to waive 	a these charges to farmers.</Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR. KIRWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the way this Question is framed, one gets the impression that these people may not be having any food to eat. What consideration is the Ministry giving to the plight of these people to ensure that they do not suffer from starvation?</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MIDIKA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, that, question is rather hypothetical. How ever, I would like to assure the hon. Member that the people in Bura Settlement Scheme do not have this kind of problem at all.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech> MR. GALGALLO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I appreciate the reply by the Minister with regard to the question of waiving these charges from farmers I  would the Minsister agree with me that since most  of these people, rely on cotton growing and now that this crop has failed, they have nothing to eat?  They have no other way toget income and their children are not even going to school due to lack of school fee6. Apart from is waiving these charges, would the Ministry also consider taking care of these farmers including their children by extending hirmnnitarian services such as relief food until such time as they will 	grow cotton once again.</Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR. MIDIKA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, life is not like that.	Just becausepeople are in a problem this does not necessarily, mean that they cannot think ofalternatives on their own, but when we realize that there is a big problem, we	will not sit back and watch people. suffering. However it should not be exaggerated,that because these people are entirely dependent on cotton, that is the end of the 	road. This is just like the people of Miwani being dependent on sugarcane. A certain Indian run away with their money, but they are still living today.</Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR. GALGALLO:  On a point of order, Mr. Speaekr, Sir. It seems as if,the farmers in Bura come from all parts,of Kenya, including some from,his own  Muhoroni Constituency. Some of the local people in Bura keep some cattle, but the others who come from Nyanza, Western Central and other provinces have nothing else to depend on for their livelihood other than their small plots in which they grow cotton. 	Since this crop has failed due to negligence on the part of the project management, these people have no alternative source of income. 	Could the Minister extend the amenity I have requested for to ensure that these farmers children go to school and their families have enough food to see them into the next season when they can grow more cotton?</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MIDIKA:	Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will ensure that my Ministry assists these farmers as much as we can within the means we have.	This, however, will only be added assistance to what they are living on now.	We have not heard that the people in that area have died of starvation nor that their children are  not going to school.	The hon. Member knows that these people used not to eat cotton; cotton was sold and it took long for the farmers to be paid.	As we know, cotton payments are a problem, but I will now do my very best to assist these people.</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KUBO:  Mr. Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the Minister's concern for the people of Tana River, it looks as if the problem at hand is even bigger than the Minister seems to realise. These wananchi only depend on an irrigation scheme, which is operated by means of water pumps. In view of thefact that these pumps break down fromtime to time, 	thereby interrupting water supply, what assurance can the Minister give the people there that there will be  stand by pumps to keep the flow of water continuous? The problem we have has	come about as a result of the normal pumps broke downand there were no spareparts. Could the Minister ensue that future there is a continous, flow of	‘f"water so thatthepeople in the area do not suffer again as they are now?</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MIDIKA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me thank the hon. Member forTaveta for his suggestionand assure him that we will do exactly what he hassuggested.</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. GALGALLO:.Mr. Speaker, Sir, since this crop failure has kept on recurring since	1984, could the Minister assure us that this project is not	being manipulated by greedy individuals who wantour cotton to die so that they  may import cheaper cotton from outside the country for our textil industry? The cotton grown in Bura is the best in the world, but we have been experiencing frequent water pump breakdowns for a long time now. Is this not a manipulation of big businessmen outside the country with a view to making this project fail?</Newspeech>   <Newspeech> MR. MIDIKA: 	Mr.Speaker, Sir, the river fromwhich this irrigation project benefits changes course from time to time, as the hon. Member is aware. This is what causes the problem of flooding and breakdown of machinery. Whether the technical people involved went and talked to the river source, I do not know, but I will make sure that nobody exploits our people.	However, it would be wrongto stand up here and give promises that we cannot fulfil.	I intend to visit the place in question myself to see for myself what is happening there so that when we take action wewill do so knowing that this is going to be a permanent solution. If there are other problems involved, the hon. Member should keep us posted and liaise closely with us.	As I said before, however, we will not let the good Kenyans in that area suffer.	We will never do that.</Newspeech>POINT OF ORDER<Newspeech> MR. KIRWA:	Ona pointof order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

KUBO: 	Thank you forlettingme continue, Mr. Speaker. I am glad the hon. Minister has now taken his Front bench seat. I was saying that I am supporting the Bill.  However, let me add that this is the first time the Minister is focusing his Ministry's attention to the Coast Province and some parts of Garissa. The problems of the Coast Province is that many people have been taking it for granted that the Coast people are lazy.  That tendency has come about because the ones making those allegations have not taken into account the conditions prevailing at the Coast Province. Sir, it is normally very hot and very humid at the Coast Province and, therefore, there is a tendency of people assuming that because of that climate the Coast people do not want to work hard. At the same time, the type of products we get from the Coast are different from those found in other areas.  The cashcrops there are cashewnuts, coconuts, sisal, cotton as well as mangoes and such other fruits.  Let me assure the people of this country that the Coast people are not as lazy as it is assumed.  The problem is that most people do not understand the products of the Coast. You cannot just go and pick cashevmuts from the trees because they may not be ripe; when they are ripe, they fall down.  Similarly, when coconuts are ripe, they naturally fall down through gravitational: pull,  Therefore, the farmer in such a case has to be patient enough to wait for the crop to mature and fall down. If thaose trees were not planted in the first place they would not be there.   Sir, our major concern is the quality of the trees.	 seen that there has been a lot of research in almost all the other crops and trees that grow in other ateas. There has never been any consisteni research on the coconut plant.  You wi11 therefore	find that this country	is still importing a lot of coconut oil. All we are asking is that when		this Authorityis set up, those responsible should carry out more research	into the growing of coconut	a lot of research has been done in the Far East on coconut and results showed that the coconut grownin Kenya have very low oil content.  Even up to now we are importing coconut oil. So, there is a lot of potential for increasing coconut production at the Coast, and we shall not be needing any additional importation. We have been reading about problems in the cashewnut industry on and off. The prroblem is that the typeof cashewnut being planted at the Coast have very low productivity per tree. I believe that if more research was done, there would be more productivity per tree because most of the trees are very old and produce so little.  Most farmers have either abandoned their cashewnut trees or have cut them down in preference for other trees. This is the right opportunity in which we are going to utilise our resources to make sure that the Coast people also benefit from the research programmes in the country. Sir, another problem is regarding the marketing, particularly of fruits.  You take oranges for example, or the pineapples and mangoes and find that right now, as this season has started, if any of us goes to the Coast Province, he will be surprised to find the amount of fruits that are rotting, because the mangoes harvesting period have just started. You only one factory which is known as Tropical Fruits Processorsat Mtwapa and the conditions are such that the farmer has to transport the crop to the factory. The cost os transport is so expensive that in the long run the farmer gets almost nothing. If you have to transport all your productsto the factory, you find yourself earning very meagre income.  At the same time, the prices  of the fruits at the factory are so low that they cannot give any inducement to the farmer. So, you find that while the Coast people are working very hard, at the same time, the markeing of their fruits is not up-to-date. 					Mr. Speaker, Sir, even in Taita Taveta, we grow a lot of bananas amd at times we grow a lot pf tomatpes. However, this are very highly perishable good and the cost of transportation is very high. I am particularly taking into account that we do not have proper roads. So, when taking marketing into account, the new Authority should work together with the Ministry in charge of roads to ensure that they are maintained. For example, the road from Taverta to Mwatate has not been tarmacked and, tacking into account that fruits are very sensitive to humid weather, if they are not packaged properly and if they are transported on rough roads, the farmers will tend to have damaged crops. When fruits are bruised, they do not appeal to the eye and, in fact, they not more quickly. So, we cannot talk of developing the area without looking at the transportation system. Another area which should be brought to the attention of the Minister is the sisal industry.  Almost half of the sisal produced in this country comes from the Coast Province.  The major sisal estates are in the Coast Province.  Although these sisal estates have occupied a lot of land and a lot of people in the Coast Province are missing land because of the same estates, you will find that no research has been done on sisal for a very long time.  There used to be a research centre for sisal at Ruiru at one time, but it is not there anymore.  So, you will find that it is onlythesisalwhich has been grown over and over the years that is in the market. For example, you will notice thatwe have only three varieties of sial i  of sisal which are being grown in Kenya while we know that in other countries there are many other varieties of sisal which can even mature faster and, alsó, 		produce more income.  So, I am cailing upon the Ministry to look into the idea of working together with the kinistry of Agriculture so that the disal industry can be assisted in the country.  Other than the estates that are large scale, we would also want to promote the griming of sisal by smallscale farmeis. We know that most parts of the Coast Province are arid and semi-arid. If we can help the farmer to identify sisal as one of the crops that can give him some income; we shall have done a lot of good for the country. One of the problems facing the sisal industry is the idea of removing the fibre from the pulp, decortication.  That is a very complicated exercise that is normally done by big machines known as decorticators. I believe we could have smaller machines which could be used by the machines, instead of using the manual labour which is currently used to extract the fibre. I think this is an area that we could generate more income from, particularly in the Coast Province, for the small mwananchi and; hence, benefit from the proposed Authority. Another area is the one that was touched on by hon. Galgallo a few minutes ago.  You will find, for example, that the Ministry planned to have irrigation schemes which are pum-poperated.  I do not know why it should have been planneed in that manner. In planning, I believe, we have a lot of water resources from high altitudes and natural gravity could be used from the highlands to the lowlands and achieve much more.  However, we have now invested a lot of money in the Burra Irrigation Scheme and on and off the pumpsare out of order and, sometimes, it takes a long time to get the required spare parts. Sometimes it is hot even easy to get some of the  Spare parts as some of the engines are obsolete so that there are newspapers 		even in thecountriei where they otiginated from. I would appeal to the Minister toen sure that when they are  	planning for irrigation programmes they should use as muchas possibtenatural gravity so that me can avoid some of the current problems.	We have been talking about development but without land we cannot develop what leads me to say so is that most areas of the	Coast Province are not occupied by the wananchi.  They are either squatters or the land is under the charge of national parks. In areas like Taveta, 	75 per cent of my constituency does not belong to wananchi; it is under the Tsavo National Park. Mr. Speaker, Sir, another portion, about  10 per cent of  the land is owned by sisal estates. So, you can see that we are left with only. about 15 per cent of the ttotal area. If  we are talking about development and we have utilized fully the area that remains, what are we going to do?  What I am saying is that the land In the Coast Province can be better planned by this Authority if we reconsider our land policies.  I do not see any reason as to why we should leave all the land to the National Parks. I say this because eyen if there was to be an head count of the animals in theTsavo National Park you would find that thay are too few; the area is so vast that they cannot manage to use it all. It is almost impossible to develop roads in this vast National Park. So, I would like to take this opportunity to inform the Minister that when this Authorityis formed, one of the first things that they should do is to study or review our land policies; to see at least how we can use, the land to the maximum benefits. 	.Mr. Speaker, Sir, those who have travelled to Mombasa know about the famous Tsavo River. This river is always flowing; it has a lot of water but this water is never utilised for irrigation. So, the Ministry should look into this matter. We can even establish an Irrigation scheme in that area; to use the waters of Tsavo River through gravity. Also those who have travelled to Mombasa must have the demonstration that has been done by the Prisons farm at Manyani. The Prisons farm at Manyani has demonstrated thata lot of cropscan be grown in that arid area. Since there is a lot of water in that area I am appealing to the Ministry to look into the possibility of acquiring some Of the land within the Teavo National Park and converting it into a settlement scheme. This is  because the	people of that area are landless 	Mr. Speaker, Sir, the land allocated to theTalta-Taveta people is so sma11 that you will be surprised to find that every family in Taita-Taveta District owns, less than an acre of land. This is oneof the areas that are densely populated in this country is because we are Utiiising only about 10 percent of the land. It would appearasifwer 	have a lot of land in Taita-Taveta District while in fact thewananchi are way allowed to live on only 10 per cent of the total area of the District. The people are reallycongested on this 10 per cent of the whole District. So,I would appeal to the Minister to look seriously into this problem.Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the sisal estates there wereestablished in the 1920s and 1930s when it was considered thatsisal estates required a lot of land. I would appeal to the Ministerto look into the possibility of acquiring some of the sisal estates land  particularly those sisal estates which are not being 	utilised  so that the Ministry can plan it better, establish irrigation schemes and settle wananchi there. I say this because we have a lot of land which is lying idle. But since thetitle deeds were given to the sisal estate owners or their predecessors in the 1920s and 1930s, the land is still lying idle and nobody is allowed to utilise it; whoever tries to go Into that land is termed a tresspasser.  We therefore hope that the ministry will help us in this regard. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point regards tile development  of education. This may not appear to be relevant to this Ministry as of now but if within  the Planning system we can cater for the development of schools What is happening right now is that 	 ...  Since most of those areas arc arid and Semi-arid areas and the 	 wanarnhi in those areas have Iow incomes when it comes to the development of physical facilities like schools and so on, the wananchi cannot afford and as areset of they are	left behind in terms of development.  So  when it comes to planning I am sure that 	the Ministry is going to take into a account the fact that although they are supposed to have limitationsins what they can do, these areas should be provided with  facilities 	schools, dispensaries and health centres.

KIRWA:  Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute in support or this Bill on Coast Development Authority.Sir, we have many authorities in the country and I thank the Government for the effort it is making to form as many autho¬rities as possible. The issue that, nag many of us is not to do with the formation of these authorities, but the major problem is with management of finances of all the parastatals and organ Association are in qui country. This is an issue that every Kenyan ought to address himself to because it is not going to be useful for us to be forming organisations are just going to be employment bureaus or  they are just going to assist, people in terms of employment while they are not giving tangible benefits to our people.         It is important for Kenyans to know that these authorities are not intended for political purposes or to please the population but they are intended to form viable projects whose collective responsibility is to develop our country. These are the issues, the cardinal points that all Kenyans ought to address themselves to.           Management of finances, Sir, as it has been witnessed in the Public Investments Committee Report that was tabled on 7th of this month is an issue that whenever we are. passing a Bill to legalise the formation of any authority, we need to remind our civil servants that this country will not stand at the rate we are squandering money. This is an issue that we must say. and, as representatives of the people, we must it without any fear. The danger is that Kenyas posterity is Agoing to be against us. They will ask us: "Who were there, in 1990 as Members of Paris, amen when millions of shillings went down the drain". This is an issues that all Kenyans should speak without fear.Sir, much has been said about" planning of these authort.  I would like to reiterate what has been said by previous speakers about planning of these authorities'. I would urge the Ministry not to be so much in a rush. Even if it means taking four or five years to plan the ground work for the. Coast Development Authority, let us do that, so that when it gets off the ground, it gets off with a sure step. Many of- the projects that are now in the country are not faillng because  of lack of finances, but due to lack of foresight.	Sir, foresight is a very essential ingredient in management, and national development requires high level management  I have no doubts that the calibre of the civil servants that we have are trained in various fields of discipline. They have also the expertee or knowledge, and they have the will to do things. Now, the question is: "They have we gone wrong?"I would also like to question our politicians. As much, as we would like to assist our people with immediate projects, it is good for us to be patient. for instance, if a project is to be started in Cherangany that is my constituency and it is going to take three years, and it is going to assist 1,000 people I would rather give that project a priority whether I will be in Parliament or not. What is important is not what we are going to achieve; it is not the immediate results, We should not look at elections as an issue. We should look at how Kenya is going to be in ten years, whether I will be in Parliament or not. What is important at the moment is what we are doing for our country.The issue of planning, Sir, is quite involving. Some of the projects like dams always have had a tow of problems of siltation which could have been avoided. In fact we have so, many water engineers who could look at the catchment of rivers.They can look at the upstream of rivers and decide what type of treatment is going to be given to the rivers so the does not carry allot of silt. This is an issue that we ought toaddress ourselves to. This also goes a long-way to show that priority of projects should not be determined by foreigners.This us who know, what we need in Kenya today, 2nd what is not the then we can solicit for funds, either internally or externally.Also as far a planning is concerned, Sir, there are some of the crops which are, marginal in the sense that their supply is not comensurate d with the demand in the country. These are the crops that we need to tap their potential. So example, cotton. We know that we import about 30 per cent of cotton today, and we are likely to import about 50 percent of lint that we use in our country. This is simply because we do not tap the entire, potential of cotton growing in the country. This is an opportunity for the Ministry of Regional Development to see the areas that are suitable for cotton production, and if there isneed for supplementary irrigation then they should, do that and make sure that instead of importing cotton, we have enough for both export and domestic consumption. These are some of the areas that I would like the Ministry to look at.      The other issue, Sir, is about the development of the infrastructure. Ministries or Authorities, at times, make a mistake of going for specific projects which do not reflect the overall development of the area. I think we should be the infrastructure; things like roads, electricity and so on so that some of these things will make the area open up to other areas when we have a small project it will serve the entire area. This is what I would urge the Authority to look into.The other issue, Sir, is about abandoned projects in some areas. The Kerio Valley Development. Authority had started. some projects in some areas and in the raid air some  of those projects were left to stagnate. They then moved to another section and started some  projects. Then you wonder. Kenya must be rich if a project can be started and left half-way, and yet, we are still, able to run.      These are some of the issues that, we need to look into Why do not complete, two projects instead of starting ten at the same time? There are we rushing to? Why are we rushing to nowhere?Sir, once have said that, I would like to. look at the parastatals or organisations in terms of the people who run them. Somebody may be a very good D.C., Member of Parliament, civil servant and so on, and once you are not serving in that other capacity, it does not mean that you can translate into any other' capacity. Therefore, I urge the Government to look at the people appointed to some of those organisations. I might be a very good Member of Parliament, but it does not mean that I can equally make a very good managing director of a company. This is the issue that the Government should look at very seriously because the tendency of some of the politicians or civil servants is that once they are in a position, they use it as a springboard to another section or area of advancement.So, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if we do not address ourselves to  this issue seriously, we are going to	ours elves in problems. I am saying this because there are, certain officers in charge of these projects, who instead of utilizing their office time to implement these, projects, are busy doing their own things.This is a very, serious issue and unless something is done about it, then the job. we are doing is not going to be very" good.Sir. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we know. that a majority of people in Kenya are very enterprising and they like doing business However, if somebody is employed by the Government, and then decides to own a business, he should make, sure that that business does not conflict With the job which he has been employed to do. So, if today I am appointed the Managing Director of the Coast Develop¬ment Authority or any other authority for that matter, I should not be involved in the tendering business in the area of jurisdiction of that particular authority. Likewise, my wife or any other close relative of mine should not be involved in tendering for the supply of anything in the same organization. This is a policy that the Government needs to am look into consistently. Unless this is done, there is going to be a great deal of conflicts of interests in these organizations whereby people as in charge of running these organization may use them to benefit- themselves. So, we have to address ourselves to this issue, otherwise, it is going to be very dangerous to the various authorities that we have in this country.Therefore, we should come out with one policy; namely, you either do your job for which you are paid, or resign continue with your private business. This is the way we should operate In order to ensure total commitment to our work for which we are paid by the Government.	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, the other point which I would like, to raise is about patriotism. From the contribution ofhon. Members on this subject, one can clearly see that we are leading somewhere. However, many Kenyans still" Relieve that unless one assists somebody from one's own home area, one would not be regarded as a person worth of his salt. This is a very serious" disease that we need to eradicate from our midst. If happen to be the most senior person in an organization, the belief amongst our people is that I should try as much as possible to employ the people from my community or specifically from my village.Sometimes people may do this sort of thing due to a feeling of insecurity in their organizations. If as a Managing Director I feel there are certain things that I have done wrong, I would like to bring in somebody, either a friend or a close relative, to work with me so that he does not disclose my misdoings. In so doing, I expect this person to cover any loophole that is likely to arise in that particular organization.       The other issue, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, is the belief that unless I assist the people from my home area, I will not be recognized as having done anything for Kenya. This is a disease that seriously needs to be eradicated. If as a Managing Director I am able to be patriotic enough and employ ten people without considering their background, at the end of my service, I would have served Kenya in the right way. These parastatals were not established to enrich cert in individuals but to enrich the whole country.    With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.. KINYANJUI: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, ga for giving this opportunity to contribute to this very important Bill. The coast region as we all know it, is an area with a great potential in many resources. Hon. Members who have spoken about the various crops that are "currently being grown" at the coast. I would like, however, to concentrate  on another area.namely, the area of pot entiallty of the coastal area. Before I do soy I would first of all like to say something to about the appointment of the various persons who will be running this very important authority. We cannot over emphasize the important of appointing the right calibre of people to man this Authority. In this regard, we need efficient, competent, resourceful and people who, generally will, not let us down in, any way as has been the case in other- parastatals. I think the Minister is capable of appointing the right calibre of people who will render efficient services to the country at large.	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the area to be covered by this particular Authority, has vast tracts of undeveloped land which is now waiting for development. I hope the new authority will look for ways and means of developing this area. I have in mind the possibility of growing cassava for export. In some countries, preference is given to animal feed which has not been chemically treated. Here we have an area which we now regard as dry land where we could grow cassava for export in large quantities. There is a ready, market abroad for .cassava to be used for animal feed in America, Canada and many other countries. In this connection, I would suggest that the Minister should send a team of experts to Thai land which is now exporting this commodity abroad. Research has already been carried out in some areas at the coast and it has been found that the kind of cassava that I have in mind would be very very well. With this in mind, I sincerely hope that, the new Authority will consider this idea seriously.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Coast Province is famous for fishing but fishing at the coast has never been well organized except when we had certain Germans coming to the coast with their fishing and after catching the fish, they, would  it to their own country. The time has now come when our own peoplefishing as a full-time job in which they would export fish to earn us more of the much needed foreign exchange, another area which should be examined "carefully, is the area of clove farming. Cloves could be grown at the coast in large quantity and I hope that the new Authority will give a serious thought to clove farming in the entire coastal area. While still on the subject" of fishing, there is a possibility' of establishing a fishing industry at the coast. We could have a fish mill at Nalindi, Mombosa and another one near the kenya tanzania border. In this way, we could be able to process fish for export as well as for our domestic consumption. Studies have already been carried out in this area and I hope that the new Authority will consider to establish fish mills along the coast.These are only a few ideas, and we hope that the new Authority", which I suggested earlier should be resourceful, will consider many other ways of developing the area under its jurisdiction. In doing this, the Authority will give thought to how water will be provided in the drier areas of the Coast for the purposes of irrigation.We have two great rivers that flow, the Coast and drain in the Indian Ocean, that is, Tana and Athi Rivers. The waters of these rivers could be hanessed for use in irrigation I do not think that the Idian Ocean would be short of enough water if we harnessed as much water as possible from these rivers for irrigation of the coastal area. Recently, some hon. Members of this House went to the Goast. When we were in Lamu Manda Island was in sight. This is a beautiful island, but very little can be done there because there is no water. I hope that the new Authority will seriously think of developing islands like this, of which there are many all along the Coast, because they would be useful in tourism if only they had water. I am sure my colleagues from the Coast will appreciate what I am saying.   One hospital has taken about 10 years to construct. This hospital is near Lamu. The reason for this is inadequacy of water. I do not think that there is an adequate water supply even in Lamu itself. So, it is a big challenge to the new Authority to consider all these ideas and try to do even better than the other existing authorities. Whoever is appointed on the new Authority as Chairman, Chief Executive and senior officers should make it their first job to visit the Lake Development Authority and see what this Authority has done. They will know what mistakes have been committed and thus ensure that they start working in the right direction. I am sure that the Minister is capable of directing that these useful suggestions we are making be followed. With these few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>MR. LEWA: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving he an opportunity to contribute to this very important Bill. A lot has been saidabout how important this Bill is. Those of us who come from the Coast have for quite some time been waiting for this Bill to be moved in this House. A lot has been said about the potential that exists in the area in question, particularly in agriculture. A lot could be done to alleviate unemployment if serious thought is given to the establishment of agro—based industries, particularly, the processing of cassava. It is, indeed, a shame that as we now speak here, a lot of cassava is going to waste. As you know, cassava is planted in between maize plants. So, whenever people are preparing the land for maize planting, some of this cassava which has not found a market, is normally uprooted and destroyed because there are no industries to process it, except one factory in the whole of Coast Province. Thisfactoryi"s in Mazera, but it pays"pea—nuts for "cassava. If I am not mistaken, the owner of the factory sometimes pays as little as Shs.l/= per kilogramme of raw cassava.        Let me go on and talk about the establishment of several copra- processing industries even at the village level to supply coconut oil. Coconut palms are abudant in Kilifi, some parts of Kilifi and Kwale. Therefore, there is a lot of potential for the extraction of coconut oil for the benefit of cosmetic and confectionery industries.         I also want to emphasise what my friends have said about the huge potential for tourism development in the Coast, particularly in Bahari Constituency, which I represent. Bahari has a big strip of about 60 kilometres wide, if not more, whose potential for tourism has not been tapped. I say this because for any entrepreneur to invest in tourism and hotel development, he would require adequate water, roads, telephones, and so on. We, therefore, expect that the new Authority will address itself to technical and economic studies in respect of tourist roads, which will go a long way towards opening up an area that is now nothing but bushy. "I say this bearing in mind the Mombasa—Malindi -Road, which passes through Kilifi, is about lO or 12 kilometres away from the shoreline of the Indian Ocean. Surely, 12 kilometres is quite some distance and whoever wants to establish an hotel near the sea must remember that most of   the tourists who come here like to njoy not only the sun, but also being near the Indian Ocean.I would like to go further, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker; Sir, and say that an Authority like the one we are talking about could assist in the development of infrastructure for the benefit of export promotion zones which we expect to have in Mombasa, Nairobi and elsewhere. If I may elaborate, I see no reason why an Authority of this nature would not set aside areas for the establishent, of infrastructure to attract tourists. Some 12 or 13 years ago, there was a move to do something like this in Diani, but I do not know what happened to that project. It is through such projects that we could expand and develop our tourist facilities, particularly in those areas that have not been opened up in the coastal region," such as Kilifi, Tana River, Lamu, and so on.With regard to the mineral resources that the Ministry concerned talks about, such as gypsum, limestone, and so on, you will find that these have been the monopoly of only a few people. Even then, these few people are not doing a good job.	A factory requires a lot of gypsum  and limestone and the Coast Development Authority-could also assist institutions like the Ki1ifi District Co-Operative Union and other primary societies and, maybe even fund them so that they could also participate in the exploration of such minerals that are not so difficult to mine.Mr: Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me touch on an area that was mentioned by one of my colleagues, which is training of manpower resources. It is my sincere hope that the Coast Development Authority will address itself fully to the issue of continuous education on the manpower development for the people hailing the Coast Province who can also participate fully in all these projects that we expect the Authority will introduce. I am saying so because, as we know, the Coast Province, for hundreds of years, has been the gateway to Kenya. It was not until the attainment of Independence that some of the areas in the Coast Province saw the establishment of any secondary schools. Therefore, "there is stilla lot to be done in assisting in the establishment,and enhancement of the existing training institutions. I have in mind things like the Coast Institute of Technology in Voi and one would even go further and say that the biggest industry as far as tourism is concerned is along the Coast. One wonders why it has not been deemed fit to have a constituent college of the Utalii College at the Coast. In this way the hoteliers would sent their staff, during the off-seasons, to train and also have daily courses. I know that normally some of the trainers have to travel all the way from the Utalii College to go and hold seminars in Mombasa hotels and that could be expensive to the-Utalii College.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, with the establishment of a college of the Utalii College at the Coast, that would particularly help if such an institution would address itself fully to vocational training, for necessarily for the management cadre but for the junior staff who do things like plumping, fire fighting, maintenance of hotel establishments, electrical installations, maintenance of cold storages and so forth. Even the waiters and cooks could have ip-service training and sometimes they need refresher courses. There are some who after completing their '0' Level education need basic training for their success in the industry. All I am trying to emphasize here is that the "Authority "shoula also address itself to the training of manpower to ensure that those who are in the Coastal region are adequately trained to serve in the various job opportunities that will be created after the enactment of the Bill and the setting up of the Coast Development Authority.I want to spend a minute or two on the cashewnuts as a crop with a potential that has not been fully tapped. The Ministry of Agriculture has tried to encourage farmers to grow cashewnuts but my belief is that a lot more could be done by way of offering seedlings and also ensuring that insecticides do not mess with the crops, particularly during flowering. I am saying so because we know what happened recently with the Kenya Cashewnuts Factory at Kilifi. The factory was established in 1975 and until it was established, Kilifi was more or less like a small village. When the factory was set up activities started to multiply and life standards were raised. Of course, we heard that it had to be closed recently for various reasons but the factory has never processed the full capacity it was intended for.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the full capacity of the factory was intended to be 16,000 tonnes per annum and there is no year that the factory processed more than 9,000 tonnes. There is, therefore,potential for this factory if only farmers were encouraged to practice better crop husbandry and get an assurance that payments will be forthcoming after they have delivered their produce to the factory. Of course, prompt payment is an incentive to the fanner. The other day, of course I asked a Question on how much money had been set aside for this season and I was told that it was about Ksh.30 million. A small arithmetic will tell you that even if the crop is not very good this season, and we are able to harvest close to 9,000 tonnes of cashewnuts, and each tonne costing Ksh.7,000/-, you are already talking of Ksh;63 million worth of produce. Therefore. I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Ministry of Supplies and Marketing to very seriously think of having money ready for the purchase of the raw cashewnuts. In the past we have had very serious situations whereby, for various reasons, the raw cashewnuts have been exported outside the country. As I have also said in another forum, exporting raw nut out of this country is, in fact, exporting jobs which we need here to cater for the huge number of our people who continue to be  unemployed.	Sir, the potential that exists in the sea has been talked about by various hon. Members. I wanted to add that even the sea weed could be used as fertiliser, as we have read from research papers. Therefore, there is great potential. It is only the question of establishing a serious Autho¬rity headed by people who value their jobs and who will take time to study and not rush into implementing programmes. Should any project be rushed, it will obviously fail and that will discourage the Government from providing any funds and any would-be donors who would be willing to assist the Autho¬rity would, likewise, be discouraged if people did not take their jobs seriouslyMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, .1 note here also that the area of health is one of the functions that the Authority will address itself to, I need not say it here "but it is common knowledge that the mortality, rate in the Coast and particu¬larly in Kwale and Kilifi Districts is one of the highest in Kenya. The rate is 160:1,000. That is a very high mortality rate. We are very grateful for the research that is being carried-out by the Kenya Medical Research Institute. But one would expect that this Authority, in conjunction with KKMRI and other organizations like the African Medical Research Foundation, would go further and find out what are the real causes of such a high mortality rate. I say this while the mortality rate in other parts of Kenya is about 80:1,000 you will find that the mortality rate at the Coast is 160:1,000. I can go on and talk about the water problem that has been addressed by very many speakers. We cannot wait for the day when the famous second Mzima Springs water pipeline will be inaugurated. What we are talking about here is the backbone of everything; health care, tourism and food production. Without water we cannot achieve much.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am happy to have been given the opportunity to speak and with those few remarks, I beg to support the Bill.</Newspeech>The Temporary Deputy Speaker(Mr. Kagwima) left the ChairThe "Temporary Deputy Speaker(Mr. Mureithi) took the Chair<Newspeech>MR. MALEBS: Thank you very, much, Mr. Temporary DeputySpeaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to. contribute on this Bill. This Bill has come at the right time. This is because all regions, of this country should be designated- into development authorities.</Newspeech>I say this because the Development Authorities are regional authorities whose functions are to develop those particular regions which have lagged behind in terms of development for a very, very long time. So, the idea of establishing various Development Authorities in this country is very, very good. These Authorities should become operational at the same time so that each area of this country will benefit from the taxpayers money.Mr." Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the Memorandum of"Objects and Reasons, the Attorney-General states that the CoastDevelopment Authority will initially require public funds. I am sure that if the management of this Authority uses these funds properly it will take a very short time for the Authority to be self-reliant in terms of finances. We hope that all the Authorities that we have in this country will become self-reliant in terms of finances. Most of these Authorities Were established about five to ten years ago and it is very surprising that We have read in the newspapers that these Authorities are lazy and that they are doing nothing. For example we have the Lake Basin DevelopmentAuthority which was established a long time ago but up to this day they have not shown what they have done. The Authority has not been able to finance its own activities.' The Authority has now been expanded to cover districts like Trans-Nzoia and ITandi. Likewise the Coast Development Authority seems to encompass a large area: the whole of the Coast CProvince. I am sure the Management of this Authority will be able to oversee that vast area of the Beast Province. I say this because the area that is going to be covered by this Authority  YThoever was designing it just took the boundaries of the Province as the external boundaries of this Authority. But you will find- that somebody overlooked of the Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority. I say this Authority takes care of all the catchment areas when aredrained by Taria and Athi rivers. The Authority even covers some, parts of Taita-Taveta. District as well as parts of Garissa District and also parts of Tana River District. You will find that the boundaries of the Coast Development. Authority do overlap, with the boundaries of Tana and Athi Rivers Development, Authority. So, I am sure that the Minister and I am happy to see him here will come up with an amendment at the Committee Stage to define more clearly the area that is going to be covered by the Coast Development Authority. The Minister must define these areas in a mors detailed, manner also taking into consideration the areas covered by the Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority." I saythis because there will be </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I do not want to enter into an argument with my good friend. But I would like to inform him that a development area, as we explained in the case of the Lake Basin Development Authority just the other day, does not necessarily go according to the district or provincial boundaries; we are developing Kenya and not the districts or provinces.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Thank you. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was not referring to the areas covered by the Lake Basin Development Authority. I am talking about the area that is going to be covered by the Coast Development Authority. Clause Two of the Bill says:-"Development area includes that part of the Coast Province within Lamu, Kilifi, Mombasa, Tana River District, Kwale District and Taita-Taveta District.So, if wego by the boundaries of these districts you will find that the boundaries of the Coast Development. Authority will overlap with those of the Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority. There will be conflict. I say this because I know that the T.A.R.D.A has projects in Taita-Taveta District, Tana-River District and even in Garissa District. Here I am referring to the Tana Delta Irrigation Scheme which is in Garissa District. The T.A.R.D.A. also covers the Southern part of Garissa District."Therefore, the Minister should come up with some sort of amendment so that once this Authority starts operating its does not conflict with the other one which is already in existence.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER F0R REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): On a point of order, Sir. As I said "before, I do not want to cut short the hon. Member who is on the Floor but I would like to inform him that the Authority will have its own map as opposed to the administrative boundaries. Just like the Lake Basin Development Authority overlaps the Kerio Valley Development Authority. We will have a man showing how far and how short we will go in terms of the area of development. I hope that if my brother who is a miner want to do mining "beyond that boundary, we will give him a map.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I hope that the Authority will have wise management which will draw that map properly. For example, if Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority have a project at the delta near Malindi Because I heard previous speakers saying that they want membership of this Authority to "be representative of each district. For example, if a member of the Board of this Authority has to come from Tana River, he i3 not going to take care of the small portion of Tana River which will "be curved "by the Coast Development Authority. I hope that this will not bring conflict among the 3oard Members themselves if they will be drawn from each district within the Coast Province. It seems that there will be a lot of inconsistence as to who should do this or that and as a result, projects will be messed up and delayed.   We know that we have some managing directors heading certain parastatal bodies who may not be qualified,  we know that" many parasstatals are failing because of being headed "by incompetent managing directors. I hope that the Minister will do all he can in order to appoint a competent managing director to head this Authority. He should have vast experience and relevance qualifications. He should also be a> man of good standing so that he can be able to control the finances of the Authority. There oust be a written provision somewhere indicative that trie managing director will be appointed through a panel of interviews and. a minimum of three candidates passed on to the Minister for further selection of a qualified person. If the managing director is appointed anyhow, we shall not achieve our goals in as far as development is concerned and we shall keep on coming here with the Public Investments Committee Report showings how chief, executive have mismanaged parastatal finance's.     According to part 2 of this Bill, this Authority is defined " as a corporate-body- which is supposed to run. its affairs independently: it can sue and it can be sued as well. It is also supposed to make profits. Know why  most of these parastatal keep on failing. The reason is that they are given public funds and nobody takes into consideration whether profits are generated or not out of those funds. Since this Authority is supposed to be automous, it is expected to sake profits and declare dividends to the Government which is the sole shareholder. I hope that the appointment of the managing director will be done in such a way that", the Authority will not face the same" problems as other parastatals today.        He know that each Permanent Secretary will be representing the interests of his Ministry in this particular Authority and I do not think that we really need so many of them to sit in the Board.      The Board of the Authority should do research and proper co-ordination so that the interests of all Ministries are taken care of. We should have more non-official members in the Board and they should not necessarily cose from Coast Province. This is because I gathered from the Coast Province Members "ho have spoken that they want to have the lion's' share of this membership, then is one members from each district.   We have seen it from experience that if you make a parastatal too localized, the members will not be able to correct themselves. Impartial..members from outside the location of the Authority to take care of other interests. These members will he in a position to work impartially within the Board. If all members are drawn from the Coast Province, the Board might not be able to make resolutions, cecause each member will want his district to be considered first. As a result, there will be a tug of war. If we do this we might "repeat the failures of the Lake Basin Development Authority which is localized so much that it is unable to develop.I would like to urge the Minister to address himself to the question of membership so that we have independent members sitting on the Board of this Authority. I was very surprised toI was very surprised to hear hon. Nassir opposing the family planning policy, of the country in his contribution yesterday. When we are spending so much money to reduce the population of Kenya, hon. Has sir comes here and says that we should produce more.(laughter)That is why I said that if all members of the Board are drawn from the local area, the resolutions might also be localized and we shall end up with decisions like the ones made by hon. Nassir yesterday. I know that we could "be having members within the Board who would like to force in issues here and there. That is why we should have independent members to assist them. This is because if one can be so powerful to, say, even bar delegates from attending a Kanu meeting, then I am one can also bar some resolutions passed by the Board.(laughter)This is something which we should consider cautiously and I am sure the "Minister will also note this, so that when he brings his ammendments he will be able to increase the members of the Board from outside.Mr: Speaker, Sir. coming to the functions of the Authority, we know that these functions are over helming in that they do not have restrictions: This is because a developing country must have a hell of things to do. As we all know Rome was not built in one day. So, all things which are supposed to be done? for the human" race at the Coast, cannot be done in one day. But, there are particular ones which need to be done first. For example, we say water is life. The Authority should concentrate on providing water in the Coast. That is the area which will be under the jurisdiction of this Authority.We have a lot of water in Mzima Springs which people seem to underrate. This one is a natural geological phenomenal where the undergroung water from Mzima Springs is enough to supply water to, say, 100 pipelines in Coast Province. Some fellows, due to their own misgivings say that, if two or three pipelines are connected to Mzima Springs, one day God will come and divert the course of the spring elsewhere leaving Mombasa without water. Talking as a geologist, we do not expect a volcanic eruption tomorrow to disrupt the Mzima Springs because they have been there for many many years. I am sure God will not be so unkind to come and disrupt the flow of the Mzima Springs. We should use the Mzima Springs as much as possible. We should have some piplines going to Taita-Taveta, Tsavo Zast National park for the animals and to the Coast.We have the Water Pipeline Conservations and Pipeline Board whose functions are to establish, these pipelines. so that water reaches everybody in the country. In this particular case, the Board should assist the Coast Development-Authority because there is a lot of water in the Mzima Springs. All the volcanic features like Chyulu Hills and. Mount Kilimanjaro should be used in providing water at the coast so that there is no shortage of water at coast at all. Since we need to promote tourism at the coast, there must be water in all hotels there. At the same time there must be water in all shops in Mombasa and other towns through which these pipelines will pass.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coast Province has a lot of ranges. We can produce a lot of meat for export for this country For example, we have got Galana Ranch, which is owned by a white man until very recently when the Agricultural Development Corporation (ADC) purchased it. That was a very wise idea because we can get a lot of meat for export from Galana Ranch and group and private ranches in Taita-Taveta District. There are a lot of resources at the coast that can earn this country a lot of foreign exchange.Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me now turn to the Exclusive Economic Zone, which consists of the continental shelfs and areas of shore in the ocean. That is a gold mine for Kenya.he 200 miles inshore is our gold mine area. If we utilise this area properly we will be able to earn a lot of foreign exchange and improve our balance of payments."	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we also have oil in this area. Unfortunately all the companies which have come to Kenya to do oil exploration have concentrated in places like Marsabit, Isiolo and Turkana. Although the geological climate inshore is very good very few companies have gone there. It is for the Ministry of Energy to offer attractive incentives to potential oil exploration companies so that they can move inshore and explore oil there also. There must be a reason for the concentration of companies in places around Marsabit: probably they take back to their countries 90 per cent of their investments from northern Zenya where they come they come to explore oil.It is even taking too long for any oil to be discovers in fact, in the long run we are likely to be taken for a ride. This is because oil exploration in this country started way back in 1964 and up to today it is going on. It is time the Ministries of Energy and Regional Development came up with a propper policy which would enable them to know whether we are  having genuine oil exploration or not. We sight continue exploring for oil for very many years before we can say that we have positive oil deposits. I am sure we have oil deposits in Northern Kenya but we might continue -looking for it without any success.We define management as a "judicious use of means to achieve an end'. If we manage our oil exploration we shall discover oil; similarly, if we manage our development authorities we shall also achieve the objectives "for which we formed then. So, boththe parent Ministries and the development authorities should practice proper management.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the inshore mining aspect is very important "because most of our minerals are deposited in the sea through erosion and siltation in rivers. In fact, you will be surprised that this country has occupancies of uranium and iron one which are very useful bur military purposes. So, if this Authority address itself to issues properly we will be able to develop this country as fast as possible. As for acquisition of land within this Authority it might be useful to incorporate the relevant aspects of the over 21 land laws in this Bill so that it is easier to develop land within the authority with minimal problems. Further the Commissioner of Mines is the custom of the mining laws. So, if the Mining Act is not incorporated in this Bill, definitely a there will be a lot of interference by the Commissioner of Mines so that it might be very difficult for the Authority to promote mining within its area of operation.I know that the Kerio Valley Development Authority has already put an embargo on the licensing for mining; so, even if you discovered something in its operational area you a licence and go to mine it. This is why I feel that that the Mining Act should be amended so that it becomes combatible with the Acts establishing these development authorities.Again if we want to manufacture more cement, then we have a lot of raw materials for cement. In fact, the Coast has enough limestone that can be used for cement manufacture. I would even have expected the glass work industries, to have beenmanufacturing bottles and glass comes from Kwale, Sokoke and Garissa. So, instead of transporting all this raw material from the Coast" to Nairobi a glass industry should have been established in Mombasa in order to reduce costs. This would in turn have reduced the cost of beer  the cost of beer includes the cost of the bottle.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the establishment of this particular authority will involve formulation of environmental policy in the Coast; the industrial and economic policies; cultural and medical and recreation systems for tourists. We should also -not forget about the" social -military system too because the - coastline is ± attractive to military activities. So, we must strengthen ourselves militarily because we have very nice areas along the 2 Coast, which could be developed in ports. I am sure the authority will facilitate the construction, of our second port in Lamu. In short, the Coast is very pontetial for development and I am sure we could start many development projects along it.I know that a country like Korea does not have iron ore but they have a big ship building industry. That country imports all iron sheets for making ships. So, if I am sure we could, do likewise; we can import iron sheets and be able to initiate a small-scale ship building industry instead of having these canoes which keep on capsizing in the high seas. The marketing of the ships is there. All what we need is an order from one Onasis in Greek and then we make a lot of foreign exchange. So, it will be the work of the Coast Development Authority to think of all the infrastructure required for starting a ship building industry. While doing all that study, they will also be able to identify market for the ships. That way, we will continue to propsper in our industrialisation.     The other issue I want to raise here is that we have very nice fish at our coast line. That being the case, we should build a very nice fishing policy whereby we can be able to tag a small fish in order to know how far our fish goe. Our fish do not go far into the sea because ours is a warm water zone and they like it. So, if research is to be done on our fish, we should be able to tag our fish so that we know their movements, know those which are: eaten by others and at what rate. I am sure that that policy would enhance our fishing industry.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I want to say that the establishment of this authority is a very wise idea on the part of our Govern-ment because we need to develop all corners of this country. In fact, I would like to restate what I said earlier on, that the boundaries of our development authorities should be done in such a way that each and every Kenya benefits from them. I would even propose that we establish a Central Development Authority. I kow that we have the Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority (TARDA) but we should be able to establish one for Central Province and enable those-people living there-to develop theaselves. Apparently, TARDA has reached the climax of its development. We have a lot of hydro-electric dams along Tana River and they have done nothing on agricultural development. Therefore, we should reviewthe TARDA Act in such away that the name is changed since the authorities have no pattern of formation. If we say that the Coast Development Authority will serve-all the districts of the Coast Province, then there will be no pattern of where boundaries are.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am saying so because Meru District which falls unden the. TARDA, has, no. Bingle project from that authority. So, Meru people, and particularly Igembe Constituents, do not know that TARDA exists. Some of us have never even seen where Tana River is. It is only the knowledgeable fellows who know that TARDA comprises the catchment area. In other words the small tributaries turning over and flowing into the rivers constitute, the bounda¬ries of the authority. All what I know is that Igembe Constituency is within TARDA area and that Meru District also falls under the' catchment area but there is no TARDA project in the district. So, it seems as if TARDA has. reached its development climax or they have missed projects. I know that TARDA was given a boost by the hydor electric dams, just the same way the Kerio-electric Develop¬ment Authority was boosted by the Turkwel Gorge.What is happening now, Sir, is that all the authorities are focusing their attention on power generation. As I recall, most of the money budgeted for the Ministry of Regional Development to be used by these? authorities has been diverted to the Ministry of Energy. You find that even mining falls under the Ministry of Energy. That way, I do not know where the demarcations of the two Ministries are. We know that the Ministry of Engergy is supposed to give us power or some energy of some wort, but when it comes to the actual development of where the energy comes from the ownership of the dams belong to the Ministry of Regional Development. We have other, parastatals such as the Kenya Power and Lighting Company whose work has been left purely to market that power. Today we are talking about rural electrification programme and the Kenya Power and Lighting Company has been given that responsibility. If they do not have enough dam construction personnel, definitely we will never achieve our goal, even itby the year 2000. I think we have become a little bit shortsighted. We have now said that the Kenya Power and Lighting Company should be in charge of all matters relating to power, from dam construction, transmission lines, marketing and distribution, under the umbrella of the Ministry of Energy. If we have to depend on the monopoly of the Kenya Power and Lighting Company, definitely the generation and distribution of power will have to be decelerated.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, budgets for power supply were given for each division in Kenya but, today, with the budget cuts which were announced by the Vice-President and the Minister for Finance yesterday, it looks as if the hope the wananchi had about getting electricity power through the rural electrification programme has been lost. It is now our responsibility to explain to the wananchi what has happened to the millions of shillings allocated for power distribution in the country. With what happened yesterday, I am sure that we are going to remain in darkness. I know we are in an economic crisis, but we should do our budgeting properly. As we have always said before, the officers of the Office of the Vice-President and Minister for Finance' should come up with a workable budget to complete 12 months. Instead of that, what has now happened is that we have just gone through about eight months of the financial year and our annual budget has been slashed by 40 percent. Definitely, slashing of the budget by 40 percent means increased cost to the consumer, who is the mwananchi. It now means that the mwananchi is going to feel the pinch of the economic problems caused by the Guld crisis.Therefore, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we should learn a lesson from what has happened and come up with a workable budget. If we present a budget and tell wananchi that we have the money to do certain things and in the middle of the year we slash it, it is like giving somebody a plate of food and telling him that he should not eat the whole thing. So, I think the Ministry of Planning and National Development should come up with a proper policy to develop thisThe expectation by wananchi is high. Therefore, we must raise the morale of wananchi by giving then some goods. That is why I say that even when we come to the Budget he Ministry of Regional Development should sit together with the Ministry of Energy and decide who is going to do what projects. It should be known which Ministry is redundant and then its functions can be given to another Ministry. I am sure unless we do that, then hon. Midika might be seen, as if her is doing, nothing in his Ministry Yet he has the whole Ministry of Regional Development and when it comes to budget ting, his budget is only K£2 million which is peanut; But if we were to give autonomy to the Authority, then every project in that particular area should be left to that Authority. However, since the natural resources do not know the boundaries of the Authority, then this is where we should know which project has to be done outside the jurisdiction of the Authority. So, such a project should be entrusted to another independent Ministry or Authority because it would be trespassing the boundary of the Authority.Sir, while I congratulate the Minister for cringing this Bill on the Coast Development Authority, I also inform the Minister that we have already established the Ewaso Ngiro North and South Development Authorities. Unfortunately, the SwasoNo no North Development Authority has not yet started working. At the same time, the Ewaso Ng'iro North would to expected to cover a small portion of my Igembe Constituency in Meru. We require directors for thisAuthority to be selected from Meru District, at least one or two. This is because the majority of the area covered by the Authority is in Meru District and the other portion is in Isiolo Distric.  Laikipia, Garissa and Wajir. However, we require the large number of the members of the board to cone from Meru District.But I wonder if the Minister can confirm whether we have any member in that Authority from Meru District? So, this is why</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): On a point of order. Sir, It is not my wish to interfere with contributions by my friend who is a semi-geologist, but I want to assure him that we are talking about Coast Development Authority. If he lias any complaints or anything he wants to know about the Swaso' Ng'iro North Development Authority, he is most we come in our offices. I can also assure him of a good cup of tea and miraa (laughter)</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Thank you, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: On a point of order, Sir. Is the hon. Member for Igembe not promoting tribalism, by saying that the purpose of setting up national development authorities is to promote tribal sentiments and affiliations? Is that in order?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: No. Sir. It is net in my discussion. All that I am saying is that these are regional development authorities top I am a top most nationalist So, if the hon. Member for Eldoret South does not know that, he should know that I am speaking for the whole country. That is why I am tragressing from Coast to Ewaso Ng'iro North and South Development Authorities. So, the Bill, must be amended to reflect the majority members of the Authority to come from the respective areas. This is nationalism. We are talking for the development of this country, and I am sure President Moi is tirelessly trying to develop this country and we, as leaders, must see that and be aloe to assist him. In fact, Sir, we do not just talk for nothing. We must fellow the nyayo of the President and help him. I am sure in Meru we say, "One finger cannot kill a louse". So, we cannot leave the President to work: for this country alone. We must all work,together with him for the success ofSo, Sir, all these ideas are meant to assist ourPresident. These are the ideas that our President. has portrayed tous and we must promote then. That is why you find that this House has to come and on like this nationalistically. I an sure if the Land "Disputes Tribunal Bill cones up again, the Attorney-General must cone up with the proper .

Lakini ukweli ni kwamba sisi ni watu kama watu wa kutoka sehemu nyingine. Hakuna tofauti yoyote baina ya watu wa pwani na wale wa Kisumu, Garissa, Nairobi au Kikiyuni. Sisi sote ni sawasawa. Ukiangalia katika historia ya nchi hii, utaona kwamba sisi watu wa pvani tulikuwa ndio wa kwanza kupigana na mbeberu aliyekuwa akiitwa Mreno. waliofanya kazi hii ya maana sana ni wale babu zetu na walipigana na Llreno . na kumwondoa kadaa katika sehenruya pwani. Eiva hivyo, si kweli kwamba sisi watu wa pvani tunaketi tu na kungojea nazi kuanguka. c	Huu ni msemo uli.yoanzish.wa na wale Tfazungu wa zamani.	Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ninayo furaha kubwa kwa sababuleo Serikali yetu umefikiria kuanzisha halmashauri mpya itakayo- shughulika maendeleo ya sehemu ya pwani. Heko kubwa inakwenda kwa litukufu Rais kwa sababu ni baada ya ile safari yake ya pwani ambapo aliamua kuanzisha halmashauri hiiimpya. Kwa wakati huu, jirani zetu, nchi za Tanzania na Zanzibar, wanakuza karafuu na aina mbili za karafuu hii, zinahitajika sana katika soko za nje. Ninatumaini kwamba halmashauri hii itajaribu iwezavyo kuanzisha ukuzaji wa karafuu za kuuza nje ili tuweze kupata pesa za kigeni. Katika upande wa mazao, kuna koroshD, pambav hazi na maembe, ambazo zinakuzwa katika sehemu ya pwani. Lakini ukuzaji wa mazao haya haujp kaml1ishwa. Ukiangalla ukuzaji wa korosho kwa mfano, utaona kwamba ulianrishwa nprnn mwaka wa 1972. na ukiangalia kile kiwanda cha korosho, ufcaona kwamba hakifanyi kasi, Mimi nilikuwa mkurugezi katika kiwanda hiki na nilitoka mohi hii kvenca kutafuta pesa za kuendesha kiwanda hiki. Lakini kwas sababu ya uzembe wa watu fulini badala ya kujaribu kaunda kiwanda hikli ambachokingewapatia watu karibu 2,000 kazi, waliansa kuchukua korosho zlie na Kuwauzia Wahihdi. Hivyo ni kdsetna kwamba kile kiwanda cha korosho kule pwani kil i sima.Fia na kulikuwa " a hakuna njia yoyote nyingine ya ioikifufua. Finatumaini kwamba halmashauri hii italipinga jambo la kuwauzia Wahindi korosho kwa sababu jambo hili litatuangamia. Hama vxle Washwahili wanavyosema hii itakuwa ni a kujenga kwa msvenzako, wakati kwako kunaboromoksBw. Waibu Spika wa Muda, tulipoijundua kwamba kiwanda hiki kilifungwa na kwamba nafasi za kazi zilisokusudiwa kupatikana hazikuweza kupatikana, walianza kuyarig' oa  mikorosho yao kwa sababu wahakuweza kupata pahali pa kunza korosho zao. Vile vile, hakusveza kusilipa zile pesa walizopatiwa kama mikopo mpaka juzi ambapo-Mtukufu-Eais alipotuokoa kwa Imvalipia-ile-deni. Mmea wa pili muhimu katika sehemu hii ya pwani.Euu ni mmea wa zamani za kale katika mkoa wa Pwani na ndio mmea unaoirusaidia sana kara vile watu wa bar a wanavyo saidiwa na kahawa na majani chai na kadhalika. Ingawa hivyo, mnea huu hauja-fikiriwa sana kwa njia Inayofakikana. Mhazi unatoa mafuta yanayo tumiwa lava kutengeneza perfumes, sabuni na kadhalika. Lakini kwa bahati mbaya, utaona Serikali yetu imairuhusu campuni ya East African Industries kuagiza mafuta kama hayo kutoka Manila. Hivyo ni kusema kwamba mafuta ya kutoka nje yakiingia hapa, yale mafuta yetu hapa nchini, yanapunguaiwa bei na watu wa pvani, wanaachwa bila njia yoyote ya kuzisaidia. Ninatumaini kwamba halmashauri hii mpya italikomesha jambo hili kabisa.Nilisoma leo katika magazeti kwamba is idadi ya miti inayotumiwa kutengeneza karatasi, imepunguka. Iisemekana kwamba mahitaji ya nchi kwa upande wa utengenezaji wa .karatasi ni kama tani 2,000 ya karatasi hii katika kila mwesi.gumeambiwa kwamba idadi ya karatasi inayotengenezewa kule "Webuys ni kama tani 1,500. kwa hivyo wanaohusika waiiketi na kvoit isha  kwamba kiasi za karatasi inachohitajika ni lazima kiagizwe kutokang'ambo. Ingawa hivyo, tungetaka kutoa onyo kubwa hapa. Ha1nzualdr watuwengine wafikirie-kuleta kiasi zaidi kwa sababu jambo hili litaharibu beirya karatasi hapa nchini. Wile vile, katika ukuzaji wa manazi, ningetaka, kusema kwamba. ile mbegu ya mnazi inatumiwa kwa kutoa mafuta iitwayo coconut milk, Yale mafuta yanahitajika sana katika nchiya Amerika, Can ana na Uingereza lakini hata kwa sasa, jambo hili halijafikiriwa. Leo katika dunia nsima, ni nchi ya Phillipines peke yake ambayo inaweza kuuza mafuta hii ya nazi katika nchi za ng'ambo. kwa hivyo ninatuniaj ni kwamba halmashauri hii itaweza kuanzisha biashara ya kuuza mafuta hayo katika nchi sa ng'ambo.Sisi tu marafiki sana na nchi, ya Phi Hi pines, na pengine tukiwaomba, wanawezarkutupatia sirihii ili tuweze kuuza maziwa haya ya nazi katika nchi za ng'ambo.Katika Pwani, tuna ufuo mkubwa sana ambao une jaa samaki. Tulipitisha sheria hapa ya kusema kwamba tunaweza kwenda hadi mail 200 kule baharini na frufeMia kuvua samaki. Ingawa hivyo, mpaka wa leo, watu wetu hawajaweza kuitumia nafasi hij kwa sababu wan a ma shun, ndogo-ndogo. Hatujaweza kupata meli kubwa-kubwa za kuwasaidia watu wetu katika biashara ya uvuvi. ilingetaka kumchukuru VTaziri kwa ile taarifa yake ya hivi majuzi kwamba, mashua za wavuvi halarnu zikionekana katika Ziwa Victoria, zitachomwa na moto. Kill ni jambo nzuri sana kwa sababu hi zi mashua zinapoingia mahali popote majini, zinaharibu nyumba sote za 22a samakina kuwauwa samaki wote wadogo na mwishowe tutakuwa kama wale watu wa Mozambique ambapo leo ukimtafuta samaki mmoja tu, huwezi kumpata. Hii ni kwa sainnc sababu wageni waliingia kule baliarini na kuvua samaki wote. Katika sehemu ya Lanu, ningetaka kumfahamisha Waziri kwamba mashua hizi kubwa sinakuja mpaka mlangoni na kuwavua samaldjasmza wakubwa na wadogo na kuharibu mayai ya. samaki, na hitd. karibu, watu wetu hawatapata samaki na itavvaeidi kwendampaka bahari kubwa ingawa havwana vyomba vya kuvulia samaki.Kwa hivyo, ningeioraba "halaashauri hii, isije ikatoa leseni zozote kwa raashua kubwa, katika traditional fishing areas.Ikiwa vvangetaka. kuvua saaaki, wenye mashua hizi kubwa wangekwehdanoele ya zile maili 200 ambapo kuna wihbi anbayo zinavreza kukabilnayo. Hilipowasinania wale wenye nashvia moja ya hazi kubwa na kuwauliza watoe leseni aanjjao, walitoa leseni" isiyohusu uvuvi. He leseni ilikuwa iaeandikwa "Hesearch" kicnanisha kivaaba" ile mashua kazi yake ni kufanya uchunguzi.Tuliona kwamba walikuwa wakivua samaki na kuwauza kule.Mombasa. Kwa hivyo, ni wadanganyifu na wezi. Ni kazi ya Director of Fisheries kuona kwamba utafiti unafanywa "na trawlers nje, wala sio katika visiwa ambapo. zitakuwa zikituharibia nyumba.Mpaka sasa, Kenya haijaweza kustawisha ufugaji wa samaki. Nimesoma gazeti leo nikaona kwamba Waziri amesema kuwa ufugaji huu utaendelea katika Ziwa Victoria, na hili ni jambo la kutia.moyo sana, lakini watu wetu hawajaanza kufuga-samaki=au aqua-culture-upande Ukitembelea Thailand, India-au- South—East Asia utaona kwamba watu wa huko hupata pesa nyingi sana kutokana na ufugaji wa prawns ambao unafanywa kwa kimo kikubwa sana. Lakini ukijaribu kukopa mikopo kutoka kwa. benki ze tu kwa. minajill ya kustawisha ufugaji wa. prawns, maofisa wa benki hizi hawatakuelewa, bali watakwambia, "Tunasikitika. Lakini tutakupa mkopo ikiwa utafuga ng'ombe, mbuzi au kuku." Watu hawa hawana habari kwamba. mahali kwingi ulimwenguni, watu hufuga samaki pia Kwa hivyo, ninatumaini kwamba Mamlaka haya yatatoa pendekezo kwa benki zetu ikizihimiza titupe mikopo ili tustawishe ufugaji wa prawns kama vile ilivyo katika South-East Asia.Kati ya yale yote tunayosema kuhusu Mkoa wa Pwani, mambo mawili ni muhimu sana. Kwanza, ni amani. Mpaka sasa, hatuna amani kule kwetu. Kwa hivyo, maendeleo yote tunayozungumza juu yake hapa hayatakuwa na maana yo yote ikiwa amani haipo, hasa katika Wilaya za Lamu na Tana River. Kila mwezi majambazi wa shifta huua watu wawili au watatu katika Lamu. Ukiangalia katika gazeti la Daily Nation leo, utaona kwamba polisi mmoja na raia mmoja wameuawa huko. Ukiangalia magazeti ya mwezi uliopita, utaona kwamba Mzungu moja na askari wawili wa polisi wameuawa. Mwezi uliotangulia, askari watatu na raia mmoja waliuawa. Kuua.wa kwa watu kumekuwa mtindo wa kila siku kule kwetu. Nimesema hapa kwamba ingefaa mabas ya kuwabeba watalii yawe yakisindikizwa na rnagari ya kijeshi kutoka Mombasa mpaka Lamu, kupitia Tana River, lakini hakuna ye yote anayesikia. Kwa hivyo, majambazi wa shifta wanajua-kwamba hakuna cho chote cha kuwapinga, na ndipo huwaua watu wetu kila siku. Jambo la pili,. Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ni hari za kumilki archi.Huwezi kufanya maendeleo yo yote ikiwa huna hati ya kumilki ardhi ambayo unaweza kupeleka benki ili upewe mkopo. Huu ni mwaka wa 27 tangu tunyakue Uhuru, lakini kati ya watu wa Lamu, Hakuna hata mmoja ambaye ana hati ya kumilki ardhi. Matokeo yake ni umaskini: Tunasikia.tu kwamba kuna Agricultural Development Corporation,	Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation na benki za biashara, lakini ukiyatembelea meishirika haya ukitaka mkopo, unaulizwa utoe hati ya kumilki ardhi, ambayo huna. Serikali yetu ndiyo inayofaa kutupa hati hizi. Niliingia Bungeni hili mar a ya kwan za mwaka-wa 1964T lakani Tnpaka leo bado "ninaimba", "Watu wangu ni maiskini. Watu wangu ni maskini na wanahitaj'i hati za kumilki ardhi." Mamlaka haya ya Maendeleo ya Pwani yatafanya kazi namna gani ikiwa watu~wangu huko hawana hatTi za' kumilki ardhi-waila security nyingine" yo yote. Ni wajibu wa Mamlaka haya kuungamana na Wizara zinazohusika ili tuweze  kupewa hati za kumilki ardhi na kuwa kama wenzetu mahali pengine nchini. tumechoka kuona mtu anayeishi katika shamba lake akipewa barua na mtu mwingine kutoka Nairobi akidai kiuwa shamba lile ni lake. Tumeishi huko kwa miaka 4,000 kabla ya kuja kwa Yesu Kristu. Leo, ndipo unamwona mtu kutoka bara akija na kusema eti shamba fulani ni lake. Ukimwuliza amepewa shamba hilo na nani', anakujibu kuwa amelipewa na Waziri. Hili ni jambo lililo serious sana.     La mwisho, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ni kwamba waheshimiwa Wabunge kadha wsuneongea hapa kuhusu upatikanaji wa kazi. Wengine wao wanauliza, "Ni kwa nini tuwe na wawakilishi wengi?", lakini sisi hatusemi hivyo, belli tunataka tu tuwe na wawakilishi katika Mamlaka haya. Uwakilishaji huu unafaa kuwa wenye mchanginyiko maalum. Hatusemi wawakilishi hawa wote wawe watu wa Pwani. 	Ukiangalia Wizara hii ya Mipango ya Mikoa, utaona kwamba ina mambo hatari.      Waza.ri mwenyewe ni Mjaluo, Katibu wa Kudumu ni Mjaluo, Director wa Fisheries pia ni Mjaluo. Hii ni hatari. </Newspeech>    <Newspeech>HON."MEMBERS: Ai! Sema tena ! Hii ni aibu!</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR.
