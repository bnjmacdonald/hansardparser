MAKHANU on behalf of Dr. Wameyo. asked theVice-President and Minister for Finance why theMinistry stopped pension payments forMr. Lawrence Eshibuko.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The pension payments for Mr. Lawrence Eshibuko APN/EC No. 22342 was erroneously stopped in January, 1989. The error has since been rectified and Mr. Eshibuko	received a sum of shs.7,876.50 in form of arrears at theend of March, 1990. I believe that a cheque was prepared and the money sent to his bank account in Mumias.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for that reply, could he confirm that subsequently there will be no stoppages of pension payments in future?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEAH: Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir, the answer to that is in the affirmative. I would also like to point out that it is human to err. The mistake here was due to a human clerical error which was brought about by a confusion between No. 22342 and 23242 whose pension was to be stopped. But unfortunately, the clerk switched over the two numbers and thus this unfortunate error. This is a genuine error for which we are very sorry. I would like, however, to add that every effort will be made within the usual constraints to ensure that the error is not repeated. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, assuming that this error was caused by negligence, could the Assistant Minister inform the House whether the</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU (ctd.):officer responsible for that error was punished?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEAH: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, a human error is a human error. The responsible officer has certainly been cautioned for that error because it has created untold hardships. With all due respect, I would like the hon. Member to examine himself and see whether he has never made an error in his life. But I would like to repeat that the officer was cautioned for that error in the normal manner.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Has he apologised!MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!</Newspeech>(laughter)<Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from that reply by the Assistant Minister it means that the owner of No. 23242 continued to receive his pension erroneously, how is that money going to be recovered from him?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEAH: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that has been taken care of in an internal accounting procedure within the Ministry.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the Assistant Minister is evading replying to my question by simply saying that it has been taken care of internally in the Ministry. That was money that was erroneously paid to somebody and has to be recovered. We want him to inform us what he has done towards recovering that money. We are not interested in the procedures that he has taken internally in the Ministry. Could be inform the House how he is going to recover that money?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEAH: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not sure whether\hon. Mwamzandi wants me to bring to the House all the books of accounts. On the other hand if that is his wish, then I will bring all the ledgers and cash books I will do so. But I would like to assure this House that the necessary action has been taken Ministerially.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, since Mr. Eshibuko has been denied his money for over a year, could the Assistant Minister consider paying</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA (ctd.): his money with interest?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEAH: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is a new dimension. Wehave not paid him any interest because we do not have such provisions for payinginterests on arrears of this nature. We even do not have the machinery, authorityor the funds for this, particular aspect. I am sorry but at this juncture it is not possible to pay him his money with interest much as I appreciate the concernof the hon. Member.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Next Question.</Newspeech>Question No. 133<Header> Measures to Combat New ffelaria Virus </Header> <Newspeech>MR. MATE asked the Minister for Health what steps he is taking to combat the new kind of malaria virus that has been detected in Siakago and Gachoka Divisions, and which has been found to be resistant to the	malaria drugs.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Dr. B.A. Godana): Mr. DeputySpeaker, Sir, I beg to reply.I wish to inform the hon. Member that there is no new kind of malariavirus that has been detected in Siakago and Gachoka Divisions.Malaria in the two divisions like elsewhere in the country and theworld continues to be caused by mosquito transmitted protozoa called Plasmodium, Chloroquine is the drug of choice for treating malaria. For cases which are	.resistant to chloroquine, second line treatment drugs include Fansidar, metakelfin,quinine and so on which are all available in Embu Provincial Drug Store.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (DR. 3.A. GODANA) CTD:In Siakago and Gachoka Divisions, there is currently an ongoing intensive mosquito control programme ana health education campaigns which were necessitated by a malariometric (malaria extent) survey done in 1983. One-day workshops for chiefs, sub-chiefs, church leaders, Kanu-Maendeleo ya lianawake, community leaders, extension workers and public health technicians are being organized. So far, the workshops have been organized in the following places:-1.	Karaumu in-. Siakago Division on 26.3.902.	Kirie in Siakago Division on 28.3.903.	Karaba in Gacnoka Division on 30.3.90On the other hand, public barazas are held within the divisions during which wananchi are informed about the measures to adopt, such as, bush clearing and draining of stagnant water in order to control adult mosquitoes and reduce mosquito breeding. Importance of seeking medical treatment irm when ill with malaria is also stressed during the barazas. Such barazas have been heldIn Nguthi, Kamarandi and Riandu. Sub-locations among others.Larviciding, that is, spraying of stagnant water, has been done inpools, ponds and swamps where drainage is not practicable. Schools have alsobeen given health education and residual spraying of dormitories has been done.Head teachers have also been advised on residual spraying at intervals and on the theirimprovement of their schools drainage systems.All health  workers in rural health facilities have been toldto be on the look out and adequately treat all malaria cases and promptly referthe very ill ones, including those who do not respond to treatment.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Assistant Minister for that reply. The problem we have is that when clinical officers and the  rest of the staff in all health facilities in these divisions detect malaria in patients, they always go for the first line of treatment, that is, chloroquine, which does not cure malaria in the lower area of Embu. Can the Assistant Minister direct thosedispensaries and hospitals in the lower area of Embu to use tne second line of treatment perhaps, quinine?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wonder if the hon. Member is talking as a professional doctor to tell the Ministry of Healththat it should adopt the second, line of treatment. At the moment, we do not</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. MATE: On a point of order, Mr. Leputy Speaker, Sir. I am not talking as a professional doctor but as a man who has done consultation and received the correct advice.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: Now I understand that the hon. Member is talking as a layman who has done consultations. At the moment, we do not think there is any justification for us to jump to the second line of treatment. In fact, the hon. Member should understand that putting patients unnecessarily on the second line of treatment on the first day of treatment, may actually speed and enhance their resistance to that line too. It is, therefore, not safe and we will-always start with the first line of treatment. As I said in my main reply, if it turns out that a particular patient is not responsive, then we are always sure he will respond to the second line of treatment.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LENA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the measures the Ministry is taking.to curb this dreadful disease which has been a menace for many years, particularly in setting up of malaria committees from the localtional level and so on, it is clear that the Assistant Minister has admittedthe fact that where resistant strains are diagonized, then Metakelfin and quinine are the next line of treatment Would the Assistant Minister inform this House how much quinine is available in Gachoka Division because the information I have is that quinine hasbeen out of stock for auite sometime and there has been a oroblem where resistantcases have oeen a discovered ?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wonder where the hon. Member got that information from. As of 3rd April, 1990, there were 6,365 vials of quinine at the Eabu drug store.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEWA: It is possible there could be that much stock of quinine in Siakago Division and they must be very lucky but my information is that  ana I wouldlike this to be taken very seriously  there is a shortage of quinine sulphate and it is possible that the Ministry is not distributing it equally in the endemic areas of</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. LEWA (ctd):	3	malaria. Can the Assistant Minister assure this House that he ensure that there is quinine injection in all the areas that malaria is endemic at the moment?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: Yes, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATS: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I remember we had a leaders meeting in Siakago and Gachoka Divisions and we had medical representatives who confirmed that malaria virus had become very resistant to chloroauine ana so on. This is why I am asking whether the Assistant Minister could direct his staff to be treating my people with quinine only.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. GODANA: Sir, we cannot do that and the hon. Member must under¬stand this. I said that, we have several lines of treatment. It does happen that sometimes individual aaxr patients do not respond to the first line of  treatment and that is only when we resort to the second line of treatment. It is not proper that we start all patients on the second line of treatment when, in  fact, they could respond to the first line of treatment. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Next Question. </Newspeech>Question No. 115<Header> Establishment of Veterinary Scouts in Garsen </Header> MR. KIRWA on behalf of Mr. wakole asked the Minister for Livestock Development how many  veterinary scouts in Garsen Division were either retired or transferred in 1988 and 1989.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Chesire): Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Only one veterinary scout was transferred from Garsen Division between1988 and 1989. No veterinary scout retired or died during this period.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Next Question.</Newspeech>Question No. 110<Header> PAYMENT OF N.S.S.F. DUES TO MR. SALIM </Header> MR. MWAMZANDI asked the Minister for Labour when Mr. Mohamed Salim, N.S.S.F. No. 358 969 212, of. P.O. Box -73, Msambweni, will be paid his benefits.<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Do we have anybody here from the Ministry of Labour?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sorry I did not hear when the Question was asked.I beg to reply as follows: The claimant worked for the Ministry from 1950.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Okondo. Did hon. Mwamzandi put his Question?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZADI: Yes, I did It is the one the Minister is replying to.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: You can proceed, Mr. Okondo.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): Mr. Demty Speaker, Sir, the claimant worked for the Ministry of Agriculture from 1950 to 1988. We all know that the Fund sitrita started operating in 1966. So we have received his contributions to the Fund from 1966 to 1973 only. No contributions have been received from the Ministry of Agriculture for the other 10 years and we are following up the matter so that the claimant can be paid in alumpsum. If he wishes to be paid the other lot, we can arrange accordingly.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: On a point of order,. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Minister replying to the Question? It seems he is answering a different Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): Sir, I am answeringQuestion No. 110 which as was asked by the Member for Msambweni, hon. Mwamzandi.The Question reads as follows:-"When will Mr. Mohamed Salim, N.S.S.F. No. 358 969 212 of P.O. Box 73, Msambweni, be paid his benefits."I have said that according to the records I have, the claimant had .worked for the Ministry of Agriculture and we have receive his N.S.S.F.for the period covering ? contributions 1966 to 1978 for which we  are prepared to pay. I alsosaid that we have not received his contribution for the remaining 10 yearsand that we have been following up this matter so that he can be paid in a lumpsum.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (CTD):If there is a different Question then, perhaps, the hon. Member canbring it up. we will then look at the records and find an answer forit. However, for  this Question I have given what we have in ourrecords. Possibly hon. Bidu, who also knows the man, has more	information which he can pass to us to enable us to proceed accordingly</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister'sreply is not  different from the replies he has been giving forsimilar Questions. If Mr. Mohammed's contributions and those ofthe Ministry have always been sent to the NSSF, will the Ministerinform the House where the contributions for those 10 years have gone? for the 10 years</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.OKONDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the contributions have not gone anywhere because they could not have grown any legs and gone on a safari. I have just said that we have-asked the Ministry to send us the particulars and details relating to this contributor. As soon as we receive those particulars and details, we will arrange to pay Mr. Mohamed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.G. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it would not be fair to leave this old man unpaid just because the Ministry of Agriculture has not sent his contributions to the NSSF. Could the Minister ask the NSSF to pay the old man and then it asks for reimbursement from the Ministry of Agriculture?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we do not just arrange to pay: we must have the records. If we just arrange to pay we will end up paying out all the money without keeping proper records, which will be very wrong.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIILU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Minister tell the House how long the process he is talking about will take this man is paid without delay?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it will take as soon as is possible. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, will theMinister agree that there has been cases of contributions being  to the Fund not being reflected in their respective accounts becameof accounting problems that the Fund had?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MS. OKONDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that  is reallya different Question. I was asked whether Mr. Mohamed has been paand I have said that he has not been paid. I have also said thatwe have his records up to 1978 and that we will arrange to pay HIMthe money for that period if he wants it. However, we are workingtowards paying him all the money in a lumpsum.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Deputy Speaker.Sir, the Ministry is toblame, and not the employee, for failure to pay him. Can the Ministry therefore, arrange to pay him for the 10 years or which he has recorwhile he awaits, the unavailable records for the other 10 years to be traced ?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sure hon. Maleis a very well informed person who can do some arithmetic; from 1966to 1978 was not 10 years. But if he wants to cut the period to 10 years, we will agree with him, although I am.sure. that same he geologists he can easilyascertain they are 12 years. I have said that we are prepared topay Mr. Mohamed for those 12 years if he agrees, Butusually people want to be paid their whole amount. This is why weusually wait for records so that we can pay the whole amount together.</Newspeech>iQuestion No. 99<Header> Repair of Government Quarters at Kinango </Header> MR. BIDU asked the Minister for Public works what urgent steps he is taking to repair the leaking roofs of the Government Staff Quarters at Kinango, particularly the District Officer's staff house.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Maiyani.)Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the answer to this Question is not ready, but I may receive it any minute now.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI:  On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker,   Sir. . Is it In order Ministers to come here and excuse themselves on the ground that the answer is not ready when they have had almost14 days to prepare their answers?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Mang'oli, I thought the AssistantMinister said that he expects to receive his answer any momentfrom now. So we will skip this Question for the time being.</Newspeech>Question No. 130<Header> CONSTRUCTION OF BUMP ON MERU-MAUA ROAD </Header> MR. MALEBE asked the Minister for Public Works weather in view of the recent horror accidents along Meru-Maua Road, the Ministry could construct bumps along, the section of the road as it approaches Maua, Maili Tatu,  Eangeta and Muthara Markets.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WOHES (Mr. Maiyani): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.On the baisis of an earlier study done by the Road Safety Unit along Meru-Maua, Road, arrangements are in hand to construct rumble strips and speed control bumps at Muthara market, as well as at Kianjai, next August as part of the national programme on road safety improvement. However, in the case of Maua, Maili. Tatu and Eangeta markets, further investigations are being conducted to determine appropriate remedial, measures needed to curb home accidents at the respective areas.</Newspeech>i<Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Six, I thank the Assistan Minister for that good answer However, I wonder how long further investigations are going to take while fatal accidents are occuring everyday at approaches to Maua, Maili Tatu and Eangeta markets. Last Thursday there were two fatal accidents at the approach to Maua Market. Last year we had eight deaths at the approach to Maili Tatu. Can the Assistant Minister say specifically</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MB.MALE3E (CTD) :when he will construct these bumps. This is because the local people think that the appropriate measure is the construction of bumps or rumble strips on the approaches to Maua, Maili Tatu and Kangeta markets. What study has the Ministry done which has not produced a solution to this problem?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAI YANI: Mr. Deputy. Speaker, Sir, I share the hon. Member's concern because human life is precious. However, it must also be appreciated that we have the same problems in the whole country and our technical personnel are all over in the field. In fact, I have supplementary information to this Question. Preliminary data available, from the police indicate that Maua, Maili Tatu and Kangeta sock markets approaches appear dangerous, as I have already indicated. A detailed study to ascertain the nature and type of remedial, measures is being undertaken by the Road Safety again and it is expected to take three weeks from now. Subsequent to the study appropriate remedial measures will definitely be  taken.The previous study tocr covered approximately 2,000 kilometresof road network along main roads of clas A and class k C. Theobjective of the study was to identify the make of inventory ofdangerous road locations and outline the appropriate.measures necessaryto improve safety in the concerned locations. As I have alreadyIndicated, I hope the hon. Member will be hapny to know that within three weeks we will do something in this particular area.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Whereas we appreciate the studies that are being carried out as stated by the Assistant Minister, I would like to know when studies are made to determine whether a certain road is going to be dangerous, it will have black spots and sharp corners or whether it will serve a high-density populated area. Is it before such a road is constructed or afterwards? I believe that such studies should be done before the road is constructed so that the constructor take preventive measures on the dangerous sections. Was there some omission when this road was being constructed, such that it left wananchi exposed to danger?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, unless and until a road is constructed, we would not know whether there would be accidents on it or not. However, as soon as we start seeing accidents on it, we take immediate action, as we are now doing.I appreciate the suggestion from the hon. Member that the Ministry should start the population situation where a road is being constructed, but, as I have already said, before there is aroad, it is not very easy to know what would happen once there is a road.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, with due respect to the hon. Assistant Minister, if, as the hon. Questioner has said, so many deaths have occurred on this road, and this fact is known and documented, when you to tohospital and diseases</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is your question, Mr. Kyonda? MR. KYONDA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, after seeing that a certain section of the road is dangerous and so many deaths are occuring there, how long does it take the Ministry to carry out studies on the situation and come up with preventive measures? Why is action not taken immediately? The construction of bumps or rubble strips does not take long. Why should the Ministry take so long to carry out such studies while people keep on dying?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have already said that we have taken remedial measures now that we have realised that this particular  section of the road is dangerous. We would not otherwise know the situation</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI (CTD.):Beforehand. we have now learnt that this place is dangerous, and we are constructing rubble strips there to ensure that the area is going to, be all right within the next three weeks.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir: I think the Assistant Minister is misleading this House by saying that his Ministry would not know the situation in advance. The hon. Member tells us that very many deaths occurred in this area last year. How long does it take the Ministry to know this? It already knows the situation since the road was constructed in 1975.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are not told that there are so many accidents on this road every year. We are only talking from the experience we have had within the last two years, and this is why we have decided to take remedial measures, which are going to be completed within the next three weeks from now.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it really in order for the Assistant Minister to come and tell us that a survey will be started in three weeks from now when he is answering this Question? Why was this not done two weeks ago when, this Question was submitted? I think the Assistant Minister is misleading the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not accept that I am misleading the House because within the last two weeks, we have been investigating the situation and confirmed that what the hon. member has said is true. This is  why we are now taking remedial.measures. How would we know the situation that is likely to arise in advance?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG’OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. It appears that the Ministry does not know dangerous spots on roads because I know many spots where human lives have been claimed by this kind of situation.  Since the Ministry does not know these dangerous spots, would the Ministry</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Mang'oli! Are you convinced that you are on a point of order?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the Assistant Minister has said that action is now being taken on this particular dangerous spot, would he agree to take measures on other similar spots as well?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wonder whether the hon. Member followed my explanation when I gave supplementary information. I have already said that we have been investigating an area covering 2,000 kilometres, and this distance does not refer only to that particular place. We are always doing this because we are very much concerned about the safety of the lives of our wananchi all over the country, and, as soon as we identify a problem place, we take remedial measures to protect wananchi.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has not clarified the type of studeis that are being carried on in respect of that road. Is the Ministry studying the laying of bumps or the rate of death occurring there? What sort of studies is he telling this House about? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, after roads are constructed, which is very desirable, the next thing is to study the population density of the area and the amount of traffic to be served, and then come to a conclusion as to what protective measures we should take to ensure the safety of wananchi.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, although the answer given by the Assistant Minister is not completely satisfactory, could he state how much money he has set aside for the construction of rubble strips or bumps in this area within the next three weeks that he has mentioned?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the amount of money involved here is immaterial; what is needed are bumps or rubble strips. Whether this work will cost Shs.l/= or Shs.5/= is immaterial. All we want is the safety of our people.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order in not being serious about this Question. If the problem he has is lack of revenue, he should state this fact here, because the question of studies being carried out is just a glaring excuse.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will not say "yes" to this</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI (CTD.):suggestion as the hon. Member demands, but what is important is effectivenessof rubble strips and bumps, which we are building and will be completed withinthe next two weeks. That is all the hon. Member wants.</Newspeech>Question No. 140<Header> Adjustment of Mr. Ngumbao's Salary </Header> MR. NDZAI asked the Minister for Public Works why the salary of Mr. Jefwa Ngumbao, P/No. 459818, has not been adjusted as.per letters, ref. Nos. ST. 459818/66, dated 7th July, 1988, and 459818/73, dated 17th March, 1989.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Maiyani): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, here I come again, and I beg to reply.	The salary of Mr. Jefwa Ngumbao  at first I thought this name wasNgumbu, but it is actually Ngumbao  is already adjusted from Job Group "A" to Job Group "B" with effect from 1st March, 1990, and backdated to 24th January, 1989, that is one full year of very good salary. The resultant arrears were included in Mr. Mbumbao's salary for March, 1990. So, as I am speaking here now, he has already received these arrears.</Newspeech>		<Newspeech>MR. NDZAI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistnat Minister, for that reply, can he tell the House why it took two years to adjust Mr. Ngumbau's salary?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as they say in English, it is better late than never. Further information I have indicates that the District Commissioner's office, Hola, had issued as Pay Change Advice (PCA) for Mr. Ngumbao's promotion with effect from 4th June, 1987, without the authority of the District Advisory Committee. Subsequently, however, the District Advisory Committee invali¬dated that PCA but considered and recommended Mr. Ngumbao's promotion from Subordinate II, Job Group "A" to Subordinate I, Job Group "B” with effect from</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for the hon. Minister and other hon. Members to be on their feet discussing their private affairs when the hon. Assistant Minister is giving his reply? Why can the Minister not just move where the hon. Members, are so that they can discuss their affairs quietly? If that trend continues, then we are all going to be stand¬ing here and discussing our affairs as committees. Can the Minister and the hon. Members involved apologise to this House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: Who are they?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am referring to hon. Nyagah, hon. Mahihu, hon. Bidu, hon. Mate and hon. Wambua. Can they apologise for what they have been doing in order to keep the dignity of this House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Yes, indeed, I think it is important to take note of what hon. Mang'oli is saying because hon. Nyagah's posture was particularly interesting. I am sure that the hon. Members concerned have taken note of that point of order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. Nyagah): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. What posture was I in that caused so much interest?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY. SPEAKER: I am afraid but the Chair has already made a ruling. Can you proceed, hon. Maiyani?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. As I was explaining, Mr. Ngumbao was promoted to Job Group "B" with effect from 24th January, 1989, at a salary of KShs.1,190/- per month. Communication has been made MR. EKIDOR: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for a sick Assistant Minister to come and answer Questions in the House? The Assistant Minister is sick. Is he in order to come and answer Questions here? He is sick in the eye.</Newspeech> (Laughter)<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon. Members. Hon. Maiyani, proceed with what you were saying.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I do not need to respond to that point of order. However, as I was saying, Mr. Ngumbao was</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Hon. Ndzai asked a very simple question,, and I do not know whether the Assistant Minister is in order just to mumble without giving us the exact answer to the supplementary question. Why is he reading through the information that he should have read earlier on?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: He is sick! He is sick! </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I said, it is better late than never. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. If the Assistant Minister continues to think that what he is doing is the right way of answering questions, then I think we need your guidance. He has to be serious and stop telling us that it is better late than never. The question posed by hon. Ndzai was why it took two years to adjust Mr. Ngumbao's salary. If this man died before the salary adjustment, he would have died at the lower grade. This is a serious matter and the Assistant Minister should not just stand up and tell us "better late than never". That is not an answer, and we want the Assistant Minister to take our questions seriously. Why did it take two years to adjust this man's salary?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wonder whether the hon. Member actually followed what I said. Apart saying that it is better late than never, I did explain why there was a delay in adjusting Mr. Ngumbao's salary. It is all written here and I am just about to finish reading it.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mr. Ngumbao was irregularly promoted and the matter taken to the authority responsible for promotions. Graciously, that author¬ity approved the promotion and then the process of payment of arrears started. As I have already stated, Mr. Ngumbao's arrears have already been paid to him. If the promotion had been done by the proper body, there would not have been any delay in adjusting the salary.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the allegation by the Assistant Minister that Mr. Ngumbao was irregularly promoted is very serious. What is the irregularity involved in the promotion of this man? Je, alihongana ama alifanyaje? Can the Assistant Minister elaborate the reason why this promotion was not proper?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I repeat reading the informat that I have? </Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: No, no, no! </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon. Members. Mr. Maiyani, will you kindly note that the effect of the authority you referred to on what ypu termed as an irregular promotion was curative on that irregularity and, therefore, it would be wise for you not to refer to the irregular promotion?Let us move on, unless someone has something else to raise on thisQuestion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAHIHU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I feel that hon. Mang'oli's challenge against my standing here was not justified because I had not moved away from my seat. Was it in order for him to challenge my standing here?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: We are well past that stage, Mr Mahihu, and we should now proceed. Mr. wambua’s Question. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NDZAI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy speaker, Sir, which. Both of these letters are from the Ministry.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Sould the Assistant  Minister clarify the position. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NAIYANI:  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have stated that there were two promotionso First, there was a promotion by an unauthorized body and secondly, by the authorized body. I am not aware of the letters the hon. Member is referring to, but I would request him to lay them on the Table of the House so that I can take a look at them and then investigate to find out the correct position.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: very  well, do exactly that because I think this would be to the benefit of the hon. Member. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.I. MOHAMED: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, would the Assistant Minister tell us the unauthorized body which promoted this person within his Ministry?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mro Deputy Speaker, Sir, according to the informationavailable to me, the District Commissioner's office at Hola issued a Pay-Change Advice (P.C.A.) for Mr. Ngumbao's promotion with effect from 4.6.87 without authority  and I think this is the letter that the hon. Member was referring to. He did this without the authority of the District Advisory Committee and I am saying</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NDZAI: But the letter was signed!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MAIYANI: Yes, I know it was signed but without authority. This is what I am talking about.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Very well  We must proceed now.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Sir. Are we going to allow the Assistant Minister to get away with this? He has beer, talking about irregular promotion but we would like to know from him when this promotion was regularized.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Have you been in this House, Mro Kiliku?</Newspeech>(laughter)<Newspeech>DR. MISOI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The assistantMinister has been very vague in his answers to the House. He has been talkingabout irregular promotion by the District Commissinor, but this House knowsvery well that the District Commissioner is  authorized to recommend thepromotion of an officer. What the District Advisozy Committee should havedone was to validate the recommendation qy the district commissioner and backdate the salary to June, 1987.  That is what ought to have been done and the Assistant Ministershould now tell us why this was not done.Mr. Ndzai laid the documents on the Table</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Would you like to respond to that, Mr. Maiyani?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, perhaps I should be allowed timeto look at the documents that have just been laid on the Table by hon. Mdzai.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Okay, the Assistant Minister is going to study  the documents that have just been laid on the Table to enable him come upwith a more explicit answer. Can we now move to Mr. Wambua's Question.</Newspeech>Question No.72<Header> Finalisation of H.C.C.C. No.211 of 1980. </Header> MR. WAMBUA asked the Attorney-General what is delaying the finalisation of H.C.C.C. No.211 of 1980, Nairobi, involving Miss. Margaret Mwikali Muasya.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINESTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT.(Mr. Ogle): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Attorney-General, I beg to reply.H.C.C.C. No.211 of 1980 is a traffic accident case whereby MargaretMwikali Senge is the plaintfiff ana the defendants are Mohammed MahanoudJabane and Mohammed Bashir. It should be noted that while this Question refersto the plaintiff as Margaret Mwikali Muasya, the current court records indicatethat the Plaintiff is Margaret Mwikali Senge.Mr.  Deputy Speaker, Sir, the court records indicate that on 26th April,1989, by consent of the advocates of the parties, the hearing dates of thiscase had been set for 30th and 31st October, 1989. It is THE normal procedure</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Ogle) (Ctd.): of the court for hearing dates to be confirmed during the subsequent call- over. The advocates for the parties were absent during the call-over and the hearing dates therefore, were not confirmed. It is now upon the advocates in volved in this case to move to the court by way of taking new hearing dates.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the reply by the Assistant Minister is most unsatisfactory. This case started way back in 1980 when Miss Margaret Mwikali was injured in a road accident. He is new tailing this House that the hearing dates for the case have not been fixed after ten years! For the information of this House, the mother of this lady travels all the way from Mwala to Nairobi to follow up this case thereby spending a. lot of moneyo For the last ten years, she has spent over Shs.6,000/- in trying to follow up the case. How comes that the hearing dates of this case have have not been fixed by the advocates ten years up to now? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGLE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have already said here that it is the normal procedure for hearing dates to be confirmed dining subsequent call-overs. I have also said that the advocates of the parties involved were absent during the period of call-over and therefore, the hearing dates were not confimed. It is therefore, the reponsibility of the advocates involved to move to court by way of taking up new hearing dates.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are dealing with a case of an innocent mwananchi who was a victim of a road accident ten years ago. The Assistant Minister is now telling us that the hearing dates of the case were not fixed because the advocates of the parties involved wers absent in court. Could we be told that is the role of the Attorney-General in matters of this kind which affect the lives of our people? what is the Attorney- General doing to make sure that this particular lady is compensated? I as asking this because these advocates may be taking their client for a ride. Surely, the Attorney-General rrust have a role in this matter !</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGLE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is entirely the responsibility of the advocates appearing for the client to take this matter seriously.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, SIR, the Attorney-General IS the custodian of the law in this country and we are asking him to assist wananchi involved in such cases and this is why this particular Question has been brought here. We know that the advocates are there, but the Question has been brought to this House purely to ask for the assistance of the Attorney- General in this matter because he is the man who is in charge of the law in this country. So, what is he going to make sure that this case of this unfortunate lady is heard. We do not want to be told about advocatesI If the Assistant Minister does not know the facts relating to this particular case, he had better say so.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGLE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Question here is seeking to know what has delayed the finalisation of the case and nothing is being said about seeking assistance from the Attorney-General. The answer I have hear is giving the cause of the delay in respect of this particular case and I have already stated it very clearly here.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the Assistant Minister was given the mandate by the Attorney-General to come here and answer this Question, he must have prepared himself fully to respond to the supplementary questions. If he is not conversant with the facts in respect of this Question, he should not attempt to reply to it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. M'Mukindia): On a point of order,Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, is the hon. Member really in order to suggest that  hon. Ogle is not competent to answer this Question? Can be substantiate that?</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Members are allowed by the Standing Orders to ask supplementary questions.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: But hon. Ogle has just pointed out that it is the prime responsibility of the advocates for the plaintiff, in this case Miss Maxgaret Mwikali Muasya, to move the court in order to get new dates set for the hearing of this case. I think  hon. Ogle has done that	 splendidly well.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAHG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.' While we accept the advice from the Chair Before I come to my point of order proper, I would like to state here that Miss Mwikali Muasya, the plaintiff in this case, is seeking assistance from the	Attorney-GeneralThat is the reason why thisQuestion has been brought to the House by hon? Wambua. The plaintiff cannot obtain a hearing from her advocate.Perhaps the money has been paid to the advocate.! The insurance company might have paid this money to the advocate i1 That is my suspicion. So, the	Attorney-General is being asked to assist the plaintiff by making sure that a date is fixed for the hearing of this case.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: If I understood it well, the competence of hon. Ogle in answering that Question was being criticised by hon. Kiliku. I wonder whether hon. Kiliku is satisfied that hon. Ogle the capacity to answer that Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Apologise to hon. Ogletf MR. KILIKU : Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, with due respect to hon. Ogle, I was just suggesting that if Ministers or Assistant Ministers are replying Questions on behalf of their colleagues, they should make sure that they are conversant with the issues beingraised in those Questions  They should be prepared to respond to thesupplementary questions that may arise after the main replies are given.</Newspeech> (The Minister for Public Works. (Mr. Mibei) entered the Chamber)<Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: The Attorney-General has comef - MR. KILIKU: On a point, of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for hon. Bidu to mislead the House by saying "The Attorney-General has- come" when he knows very well that hon. Mibei is the Minister for Public Works? He was only acting as the Attorney-General when the Attorney-General was out of the country</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Kilikyu I thought that came from hon.

Arising from the apparent confusion here and in the light of Gazette Notice No.5321, transferring the powers of the Attorney-General to the Minister for Public Works,  hon. Mibei, could we be told exactly who the current Attorney-General is? This is because this Gazette Notice has not be rescinded?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order ! One thing after the other?  If I remember correctly, the Attorney-General, was here the whole of last week 	very busy trying to answerHon. Members' Questions.' Hon..' Justice Mathew Guy Muli is the Attorney-General He seconded one of the very important Bills before the House. So, I  am sure that hon..  Makhanu should be properly guided in this regard. I do not know whether hon. Makhanu  has read all the current issues of the Kenya Gazetted I think we should leave it at that.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: I have read all issues of the Kenya Gazette - from 23rd November todate. I have read all of them and none of them has contradicted this Gazette Notice here.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: The Attorney-General will now take notie of what you are saying.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KAMUYU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Siri Yester¬day a similar Question was asked in this House by. hon. Kabibi Kinyanjui and</Newspeech>	<Newspeech> AN HON. MEMBER: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker,Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAMUYU: I am on a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir I  tend to believe that since yesterday and even this morning, the office of the Attorney-General is trying to evade, responsibility. The  Attorney-General's office is not willing to come out andassist a poor mwananchi who, presumably, has fallen into the hands of an unscrupulous lawyer.  What is the	 Attorney-Generalintending to do to assist this innocent mwananchi from hon.Wambua's Constituency? What steps is the Attorney-GeneraL's office taking to safeguard the interests of this lady who, presumably, has fallen into the hands of some unscrupulous lawyers? I ask this because the Attorney-General.'s office appears to be doing absolutely nothing about this case?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGLE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Wambua, in his Question, wants to know what is delaying the finalisation of this particular case? There is no indication here that the hon. Wambua ever went to seek the assistance of the Attorney-General's office regarding the plight of this accident victim.</Newspeech>(Several hon. Members stood up on points of order)<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon. Members! One at a time! You all know that we can only have one point of order at a time!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WABUGE: On a point of order, Mr.  Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Yes, Mr. Wabuge.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. WABUGE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in view of the fact that we are not getting.the proper answer and in view of the fact that this lady must be suffering and in view of the fact there was a day when the hearing of the case was going to take place and the advocates failed to turn up, this, indicates that even if another hearing date is fixed the lawyers will still not turn up. That being so, and in view of the fact that this Question has now been asked in this House  which means there something hidden somewhere  would the Attorney-General undertake to	find out what has happened to thelawyers in order to assist this lady?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I will allow hon. Ogle to respondto that supplementary question on behalf of the Attorney-General</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGLE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this accident took place on 29th August, 1978, in Nairobi, along Kirinyaga Road. The accident involved vehicle registration Number KQU 933 and the plaintiff who was the pedestrian. The vehicle belonged to Mohamed Mahamoud Jebane and it was being driven by Mohamed Bashlr. The plaintiff in this Case seeks for damages arising thereon. The Advocate for the plaintiff is Kivuitu Advocates and the advocates for the defendant are Salim Danji Advocates and the seconddefendant is represented by Murtaza Jaffer Advocates. I think my primary responsibility in answering this Question was to convey to the House the answer as given by the office of the Attorney-General. The answer dealt with the cause of the delay in the finalisation of this matter. I will, however, at this stage undertake to convey to the Attorney-General the concern of the hon. Members in respect of this matter.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant-Minister has finally agreed that his prime duty was to convey the answer as supplied by the Attorney-General's office. Hon. Kiliku has asked whether the Assistant Minister was competent enough to respond to supplementary questions and the Assistant Minister has just agreed that he is unable to answer supplementary questions.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGLE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am more than competent to answer this Question!?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Hon. Ogle has told us that the delay is as a result of the failure by the advocates to go to courts Secondly, he admits that he is unable to help Miss Margaret Mwikali Muasya in this particular Case because he himself is not the Attorney-General. He has promised to convey our sentiments to the Attorney-General.  How  is this House going to be convinced that the conveyance of the message will solve this problem? Will that make the advocates go to court to help resolve this matter?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGLE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the issue of explaining what caused the delay in the finalisation of this case and the issue of assisting the accident victim in this Case are two different things altogether? That is why I have promised to take up this matter with the Attorney-General?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>DR. MISOI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. This House is not satisfied by with the answers given by the Attorney- General on that Question relating to court cases. The Attorney- General blames the advocates, The advocates are members of the Law Society of Kenya, and they should be guided by a code of conduct, and therefore, since this House is not satisfied, we would be willing to know who those advocates arej who are exploiting the wananchi and colluding with the insurance firms. If the Attorney- General is not here to answer questions, then those people whoreply on his behalf, they should have all the facts to be able to answer all  the supplementary I questions. I am as not sure whether the message from the Assistant Minister who is answering on his behalf will reach the Attorney-General in the same manner. The Attorney-General should personall give us a proper answer .</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! For the time being that mattershould be closed.(Mr. Mbori stood up)Order, Mr. Mbori The Assistant Minister who is replying on behalf of the Attorney-General will no doubt convey the sentiments of the House, and possibly the Attorney-General might decide to take up the matter himself,  Later on in this House. Therefore, let us not waste any more time over that Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: If your point of order is in relation to the same Question, you are certainly out of order, Mr. Malebe. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: I would like to make a clarification, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Malebe. I think I would</Newspeech> plead with hon. Malebe to take the ruling of the  Chair fairly seriously. I will now call upon hon. Bidu to ask hisQuestion No.99  for the second time.Question No. 99<Header>  Repair of Government Quarters at Kinango </Header> MR. BIDU asked the Minister for Public Works what urgent steps he is taking to repair the leaking roofs of the Government staff quarters at. Kinango particularly the District Officer's staff houses.<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Mibei) : Mr. Deputy.Speaker, Sir, just before I reply to that Question, I would like to apologise for coming in late.Sir, I now beg to reply. My Ministry is planning to patch up the leaking spots on the roofs of the Government staffquarters at Kinango, as temporary measure. The patching up exercise shall commence at the beginning of May a this year. Thatwork is expected to last for two weeks. The budget for the permanent renovations will be included in the next Financial Year’s developmentprogrammes  1990/91.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, some those houses have been in very bad conditions for quite a long time, how come that the Minister is now telling the  House that he is going to do temporary renovations. What has delayed the work if antifying all the defaults found in these in that area? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIBEI: Sir, the leaking roofs had not been reported to my Ministry, and therefore, we were not aware that they were leaking. Investigations done by my Ministry have reve revealedthat three houses with flat roofs are leaking, and the estimated cost of repairing them  is Kshs.110,000/-.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Arising from that reply by the  Minister,can he tell us what his Ministry is going to do with Government houses which are in a bad state ? If. you look at the Governmenthouses in Nairobi, you will see that most of them are in very bad conditions. .When will his Ministry Mat renovate all the Government houses whichHave got leaking roofs. Even if you go to Bungoma District, andsee the Government houses., you just wonder whether thedistrict commissioner and his officers live  in such houses. These is  total negligence on the part of the Ministry of Public Works?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: What is your supplementary question?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG’OLI : when will the Minister carry out a general exercise of repairing all Government houses?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIBEI: I think that is general question. The best  thing is for hon. Mang’oli to raise a specific Question on that matter so that I can know how to deal with it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Sir, the Minister has told us that the leaking roofs of those Government houses had not been reported to his Ministry previously. Could the Minister inform this House whether he has got officers at the district level whose responsibilities  is to monitor and make reports to the Ministry on the repairs that are needed on all Government, houses.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIBEI: We have officers at the district level who are charged with that responsibility, but some of our houses are under Government institutions, and it is the responsibility of the person residing in a particular house to report any roof leakages or any other damages, so that repairs can be done. Therefore, if the person who is living in such a house does not report, then there is nothing that we can do. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. BIDU: While appreciating the answer given by theMinister, does he now agree with me that there is some inefficiency in his Ministry with regard to the system of reporting the repairs needed in Government houses?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIBEI: In this particular case, I am not aware of any reports which were made about those leaking roofs previously, therefore, I will not blame my officers for any delays of getting that information.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let us now move on to Questions by Private Notice.</Newspeech><Header> QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE</Header> <Newspeech>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, with your permission, could I have that Question deferred, until the Attorney-General is available so that he can answer it himself. Sir, I am saying so because yesterday, we had a similar Question in this House which was not satisfactorily answered. Again this morning we had a Question which was not satisfactorily answered. This Question by Private Notice is an important.one because it concerns a poor person who cannot recover his money from a financial institution.Sir, I need your guidance on that issue.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. P.K. Kinyanjui, my guidance is that y ou kindly put your Question by Private  Notice.Fate of Master Kamauys 30,000/- Deposit</Newspeech>	-<Newspeech>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Attorney-General the following Question by Private Notice:What is the fate of Kshs.30,000/- deposited with Alliance Building Society by Master Patrick Kamau (minor), account No. 01-13-00034, on 1st April, 1986? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PLANNING.AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Ogle): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Attorney-General I beg to reply.I cannot tell the fate of the said Kshs.30,000/- deposited on 1st April, 1989 with Alliance Building Society by Master Patrick Kamau as my office is not responsible for the day to day management of  building societies. I confirm that the society is not yet under receivership, and all enquiries relating to deposits  with the society should be referred to the head office of that building society.		I am however, aware that the building society has liquid by  and may not, at-the moment, be able to pay its depositors. The depositors may, therefore, wish to obtain judgement against the building society if it fails to pay them upon reasonable notice having been given to the building society.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: I would like to thank the Assistant Minister for giving that reply, but I would like to correct him a bit  that deposit was made in 1986, and not 1989 as he had said in the reply.Sir, without going into details, here we have a case of poor boy who needs that money for his  education, but he cannot get it, and that is why I brought that Question to the Attorney- General. Could the Attorney-General, therefore, tell the Housethe specific law that protects deposits of that nature?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Before Mr. Ogle proceeds to answer that supplementary-question, the Chair would like to seek some minor clarification. Since this account is held by a minor, who would be the account’s owner in this case, Mr. Kabibi Kinyanjui?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this money was paid to this account after the death of this boy's father.It was agreed by the family membes that the money should be kept in the name of the boy so that it may not be misused. But right now, it is needed, for the boy's education.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR..OGLE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can I have the supple¬mentary question repeated?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I requested the Assistant Minister to tell the House what specific: law protect deposits of this nature.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.Is it in order for the hon. Member to refer to Mr. Ogle as anAssistant Minister when he is now answering as the Attorney-General</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I am sure we know to whom the questions are directed. This is Parliamentary usage of language.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGLE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not in a position to advise the House on matters of law. My duty here was specific¬ally to, answer questions pertaining to this particular Question and aslo in respect of this particular Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir. If hon. Ogle agrees that he is incompetent in matters of law, why should he come to answer questions pertaining to law?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGLE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Question here, in my view, does not specifically deal with matters of law. The Question was only asking what happened to this money. That is a definite Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in his reply, the Attorney-General stated that this society is illiquid and, therefore, he knows that this money will never be</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

We shall not have points of'order  upon points of order Will hon. Members, please, note that ?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I stand on a point of-order with regards to a note in the Kenya- Times this morning. On page four, the Kenya Times shows three pictures, includingmine, on issues concerning Parliament. Under my picture, the following wordsare written in quotation marks "not our. concern". These words being within quotation marks do indicate clearly that I did utter those words in the House in connection with Question. No. 30 which I answered when hon. Kimemia asked it.I have perused through my answer as recorded by HANSARD yesterday, and I have not been able to find or I cannot find anywhere in this reply where I used the words "not our concern" as quoted by the Kenya Times .The Kenya Times is a literally newpaper. It is managed and edited by educated people, learned people, and who understand the meaningand purpose of quotation marks. The Kenya Times should not treat quotation marks as decorations or as some sort of playthings. Quotation marks mean that the words within the quote were actually pronounced or uttered by the speaker or by the person quoted. But in this case, Sir, those words were not uttered by me. So, I would like the Kenya Times to explain to me in which context, and where in the HANSAED this House I uttered those words.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we cannot allow these kind of mis¬leading situations and fallacies to be printed because in that way then the fallacies will circulate and mislead. They masquarade as truth when they are not.The Kenya Times is a Kanu Party newspaper. It is supposed to be straightforward, truthful and honest. It is also supposed to portray the affairs of this House, the Government, the Party and national issues fairly and squarely without bias, malice or distortion. Unfortunately in this case there is a distortion because I did not utter these words. So the Kenya Times should explain why they chose to distort what I said to their own terms. This is a very serious matter which I would have to take up in different circumstances. So my request to the Chair is that the Kenya Times be requested, as I am doing now, to correct it because I did not utter these Words and therefore they should not have put them in quotation marks in connection with me.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. M'Mkindia): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I rise on a point of order to bring to the attention of the House a report that appears in all the daily newspapers onMonday, 16th April, 1990. I would like to specifically like to base my point of order on the report by the Standard. The report is headed "DO: Angaine a ‘King' and national leader". This report is attributed to the District Officerof Timau and I would like to quote briefly from it as follows:-"The Timau District Officer, mr. Ocholi Oyugi, said at the weekend that a Minister in the Office of the President, Mr. Jackson Angaine, was not only the "king" of Meru but also a national leader."I have no problem with him being a national leader. After that the report goesto quote the actual words that the District Officer said. Let me quote as follows:-"Ninataka tukusanye pesa za kutosha hapa kwetu Timau ili wale Wabunge wengine wenye siasa za pesa nane wakose la kusema."Two points arise from what the District Officer is quoted as having said. Oneis the issue of the Constitution framework of this country. In other words,do we or do we not have kingdoms in Kenya? The Constitution of this countryis very clear on that issue. Ours is a single Party Republic or in other wordsour Constitution is republican. So traditionally, because a lot of Kenyans havebeen misguided in the past about this issue, Meru was ruled by Nehan nchcke and not by any single person whether a king, queen or chief. Such a thing has never happened and we have never recognised chieftainship, monarchy or any other form of a single person ruling over Meru. So traditionally such a thing never arose.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this country has been a Republic since Independence and the issue of a monarchy does not exist. Ours is a republican Constitution. So when an administrator who ought to know better what the administrative units are goes on to call one person a 'king' of a whole district, one must query the sanity of that administrator. More important and damaging is the fact that this District Officer appoints himself the representative of 2 million people who live in Meru and besides that he thinks only one person matters in the whole of Meru and sill the other hon. Members are "Wabunge wa siasa ya pesa nane". We must question the credentials be they political or otherwise, of  the District Officer of Timau, Mr. Ocholi Oyugi bttue to speak on behalf of the seven constituencies from Meru that were not represented in that Hararabee meeting. Was he appointed, or selected to do that? What credentials does he have?Finally, on 8th February, 1990, Meru District was honoured to reeive His Excellency the president who addressed a mammoth rally at Moi Kinothi Stadium. In his usual wisdom, the President advised us on how the affairs of Meru should be conducted. Among other things, he assured us that loyalty ought to be directed to him and not through any other route. Secondly, he advisedall Meru leaders that there should not be any interference by one Member of Parliamentin other hon. Members' constituencies. Thirdly, he told us that all hon. Members of Meru as in other parts of the country, ought to respect one another be they old, of middle age or very young. On that day, the maze that has been exhibited for years that there was something like a 'king of Meru' ended. Since then there has been peace and tranquility until last weekend when this District Officer “threw a spanner into the works”. So we must ask ourselves; is the District notOfficer not supposed to be the representative of His Excellency the President atthe divisional level;  is he not therefore supposed to reflect the policies that 	this Government stands for that His Excellency the President himself  promulgated at Moi Kinothi Stadium only two months ago?  How could the District Officer contradict everything that His Excellency the President said there by saying that there is a kingdom in Meru and the other hon. Members do not matter because there are petty politicians or "Wabunge wa siasa ya pesa nane". Who is he? Did he consult with the President to see whether things have changed or not? Is he suggesting that our loyalty should be directed elsewhere other than to the Head of State as we were told at the stadium? Is he as an administrator safeguarding the unity and stability of this country when he publicly casts doubt on the integrity of a unitary state and republican Constitution by suggesting that there are kingdoms in this country?So, when somebody outside this House, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, queries or casts doubts on the integrity of hon. Members, should this House not censor that person? So since the District Officer, as reported in the newspapers, called the seven hon. Members from Meru petty politicians or "Wabunge wa siasa ya pesa nane", could this august House </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, Mr. M'Mkindia! I am just wondering whether you have not really made your point and that you are just labouring on the same.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. M'Mkindia): Thank you, very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will end there by requesting that the Chair advises us on what can be done to protect us from such kind of attacks. This is because such attacks do not only affect the hon. Members from Meru but even those from other parts of this country.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. K'OMBUDO: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Two weeks ago, I raised a case of emergency with regard to floods in Zfyakach and Kano. Since then, the situation has grown from bad to worse. In fact, as I speak, my people have died and are continuing to die of floods.Sir, as.you might have read in today's Kenya Times, Mr. Pius Ombeo died in Miriu River which is now running ferociously and bursting its banks into Lake Victoria, Mr. Chrispine Ochieng Oour was also found floating yesterday in Awach River which runs from Kericho District. Awach River burst its banks and the DEOOLE OF the area are now at risk. Mr. Obur was one of the victims of the flooded Awach River.Last Saturday, I attended the funeral of Mrs. Manyala who also passed away as a result of floods. Mrs. Manyala attempted to go and weed in her garden but was unfortunately swept away by floods and was never found until after three days downstream in River Asao. This river flows from Kisii through Kericho. This is not due to the ac malice of the people of Kisii or Kericho; they do not send this water to us, but it is an act of God.This thing is not .limited to Hyakach alone. For example, in Maseno, Mr. Adede Odero Ogola died yesterday in Awach River. People are also dying in Ifyando. At Nyakach in Sango Rota, hundreds of homes are under water and cannot be seen. Cows, sheep, goats and chicken are under water right now.I raised this matter here two weeks ago. I have a telegram here from Nyatike informing me that River Kuja is finishing people. Since I raised this matter two weeks ago, ted no Minister either from the Ministry of Water Development or the Office of the President, has so far dared to do anything let alone to respond in Parliament. They are keeping-quiet and yet people are continuing to die. Where did the collective responsibility go even if the Minister for Water Development is not here?(applause)Somebody has to do d something now and urgently. One of the main causes of these floods is the silting of the rivers. Last week 1 said that the Finnish</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. K'OMBUDO (ctd):	Government donated to the Kenya Government a machine for desilting rivers. This machine is at the moment being used to desilt ponds in Kakamega District. I am not saying that the people of Kakamega District do not desserve this but there is no emergency there at the moment. Kakamega is on a higher ground and there is no emergency there now. The emergency is in Nyatike, Nyakach,. Kano and Busia.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AS HON. MEMBER: And Karachuonyo.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. K'OMBUDO: Our neighbours in Nyakwere at Karachuonyo are also dying. Why can action not be taken to rescue the people? The biggest resource for the development of this country is the people. Why are my words falling on deaf ears? Is the Front Bench here or not? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. K'Ombudo, I am positive those strong remarks and sentiments have been noted and I do not believe that they are falling on deaf ears. We, hope that something will be done. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I rise to say something about Embobut and Mon Locations in ay constituency where the peace of the wananchi has been threatened several times. People are fighting and murdering each other and the situation is now very serious. We have administration policemen who are responsible for maintaining peace and order in Eabobut Locationand others in Tirop Forest Station. Surprisingly, all these administration policemen have been transferred without replacement.I am, therefore, requesting the Minister of State, Office of the President, in charge of security to make a statement of why they transferred these policemen without any replacement. The people are now fighting each other to death. </Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Why are they fighting.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR: The Minister should make a statement in this House. The President is always preaching that, we must maintain peace in this country. The wananchi should move freely because we are a democractic country. Those people who threaten the peace should be put in custody. For example, somebodydied in Endul Sub-location, Endo Location and the murder has not been arrested up to. why is this so?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

KILIKU: Ahsante sana,.  Bw.;. Naibu Spika. Nilikuwa na dakika k 10 za kuongea wakati ulipokwisha. Ingawa niliishukuru Serikali kwa kujenga soko kubwa kwa gharama ya Shs.40 million kule KLsauni, imekuiva vigumu kwa wafanyabiashara ndogo ndogo, has a akir.a mania, kwenda Kisauni, kununua bidhaa na kuzileta Changamwe. Mwishoni mwa wiki jana niliwatembelea  H na. rnama kadha wa kadha, hasa wale wanaouza viazi na nyanya, ambao waliniambia wanapata gharma kubwa kusafirisha gunia moja ya nyanya kutoka KLsauni hadi Changamwe." Nauli ya mtu ni Shs.15/- na gharama ya kusafirisha gunaia moja ni Shs.23/-." Hii ni gharama ya jumla ya Shs.43 ambazo mtu hawezi kuzipata baada ya kuziuza nyanya hizo. Inamlazimu mtu anm anunue gunia nyingi za nyanya ndipo apate faidaJ Lakini iwapo hizo gunia hazitauzwa zote katika siku moja, basi nyanya zitaoza.: Nia ya Serikali ilikuvra ni kusaidia watu wote, lakini kwa bahati mbaya watu wa Changamwe hawafaidiki kikamilifu kwa sababu ya gharama  kubwa ya usafirishaji kutoka k Kisauni hadi Changamwe.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Bw. Naibu Spika, ninaishukuru Serikali kwa sababu ilitujengea masoko mawili kule" Chaani na soko moja kule Mikindani. Lakini soko moja kule Chaani halitumiki mpaka leo. Kwa hivyo, ninamwomba 2 v7aziri afanye npango madhubuti ill sokoiile -lifuhguliwe na kufanywa la kuuza kwa jumla. Hii itawasaidia wafanyabiasharandogo ndogo wanaopata gharama kubwa leva kusafirisha bidhaa zao kutoka kutoka Kisauni.. Soko hili likiwa Changamwe litazifaidi sehemu za Magongo, Miritini, Jonrvu, Mikindani, Changamsre yenyewe, Chaani na hat a sehemu za Mazer as and Mwamndudu zilizo katika eneo la mhe Bldu. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Bwv Naibu Spika,  ninawaomba watu wanaopanga miradi wawe wakitambua kwamba miradi inajengwa ill kuwasaidia watu. Hakuna haja ya kuujenga nrradl mahali hx. ambapo hautatumika ki kauri, lifu kwa sababu mradi kama huo utakuwa ni hasara kwa Serikali kama vile ambavyo Soko la Kisauni limekuwa. Tunajua kuwa soko kubwa hujengwa katikati zmva mji: mahali, ambapo unaweza kusafirisha vitu kwa urahisi, ambapo watu wengi hukutana. Sujengwa kwa soko kubwa kule Kisauni kulileta shida kubwa.; Ukienda Kisauni ni lazima ulipie na kupitia katika Daraja la Nyali," na- hali malipo ya daraja hiyo yaliongezwa.- Watu waliopanga kulijenga soko hili huko Kisauni hawafikiria vile soko hilo litakavyowafaidi watu. \7akati huu watu wa Likoni, Mombasa Mjini na Changamwe wote wanala.1 amika juu ya soko hilo Kama soko hili lingejengwa katikati singelasimika kuileta Hoja hii kwa sababu watu wote hukutana hapo na kununua vitu kwa urahisi.: Ewa mfano,- kwa vile soko la. Wakulima hapa Nairobi liko katikati watu kx kutoka Eorogocho, Buru Bunxf au Pangani wanakuja katika soko hilo na kununua vitu kwa urahisi. Sijui ilikuwaje Serikali ikatumia Shs.40 million kujenga soko kubwa viungani mwa mji ambako kuna watu wachache na ambalo halitumiki kikanilifu.Huu ni moja wapo ya mipango mi bay a ambayo inayoi-diioofisha Serikali  kifedha. Hii ni mipango inayotumia pesa za ummabila ya faida ya kutosha. Watu kama hawa ambao wanataka kuiangusha Serikali kifedha ndio wapinzani wa maongozi ya Nyayo.. Hakuna kitu kibaya kuliko kutumia pesa za umma vibaya.: Jambo hili linaweza kuleta msukasuko wa kisiasa: watu wajriJcosa.Jaijdjaudu kiuchumi, hawawezi kuendesha mam'bo yao ya kisiasa vizuri.:Kwa hivyo, inafaa wapanga nrLradi wahakikishe kwamba pesa za s Serikali zitatumika tu mahal.j, ambapo zitawafaidi watu.  Jambo hili halikufikiriwa katika ujenzi. wa soko hili la Kisauni. Ninashukuru ffaziri Msaidizi, inhe. Mboriambaye aliitembelea Changamwe Ninamwomba msamaha kwa sababu, ingawa ningalitaka kuwa naye iiuko haikuwezekana kwa sababu nilikuwa katika mkutano wa Public Investment Committee hapa katika Majengo ya Sunge.'- Waziri Msaidizi alijionea mwenyewe vile watu wanavyoteseka. Akiwa lengo lake ni kufikiria na kusaidia maslahi ya wengine kulingana na wito wa Nyayo, kama lilivyo lengo langu, basi namwona Waziri Msaidizi aikubali Ho ja hii atakaposimama kuijibu..(Mr. Deputy Speaker left the Chair)(The Temporary Deputy Speaker ( Mr, Wabuge) took the Chair)Huo ndio mtindo wa Nyayo, yaani kuyajali maslahi ya watu wengine. Tusipowajali hawa wenye biashara ndogo ndogo, hatutakuwa tukiwajali kikamilifu wale ambao walituchagua.Mtindo wa kuvunja vioski unawaangamiza watu kiuchumi. Kupata kazi siku hizi ni shida kubwa. Kama mtu angekuwa na pesa za kutosha hangependelea kuanzisha biashara ya kioski, bali hufanya hivi kwa kuwa hajiwezi. Kama angekuwa anajiweza, angeendesha biashara yake katika duka kubwa, lakini, kwa sababu ya uhaba wa pesa na raslimali, utamwona mtu huyu akianzisha biashara ya kioski, na ukimvunjia kioski yake-leo, kesho anakwenda kuianzisha tena. Sasa hivi tuko katika uchumi wa kifedha, na ni lazima tutumie pesa. Watu hawa wenye vioski wana watoto wanaowasomesha, na watoto hawa ndio watakaokuja kuchukua kazi tulizo nazo leo. Tutake tusitake, watoto hawa ndio watakaokuja nyuma yetu nasi, wazazi wao, tusipowafanyia vizuri leo, watakuja kutuuliza, "Ni kwa nini mlipitisha jambo hili mlipokuwa katika Bungei na hali halikuwafaidi watu wetu?" Hii ndiyo sababu tunafaa kujihadhari tunapoyapitisha mambo hapa ili tuyapitishe yale tu ambayo yanawasaidia watu kusudi tusije tukaulizwa maswali mengi na vizazi vijavyo. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kama taifa lingine lo lote linaloendelea, tunadaiwa madeni, na tunaweza kuyalipa madeni haya bila wasiwasi ikiwa watu wetu hawatakuwa na shida, lakini wakiwa na shida, hatuwezi kuyalipa kikamilifu kwa sababu pesa zitakuwa zikitumiwa kuwalisha watu wetu, kununulia dawa, na kadhalika. Watu wetu wakishirikishwa kikamilifu katika uchumi, hiki kitakuwa chanzo kizuri cha kuiendesha nchi yetu. Wakati Waziri atakapokuwa akijibu Hoja hii, hata kama ni leo, anafaa kuongea lugha yenye lengo la kuwasaidia watu.Mtu akienda kubeba nyanya kule Kisauni, atazilipia Sh.28/= kwa kila gunia, nayo nauli yake mwenyewe itakuwa Sh.l5/=, jumla yake ni Sh.43/=. Ikiwa mtu huyu akiuza nyanya hizi atapata faida ya Sh.30/=, atakuwa amepata hasara yana akitaka kununua magunia mengi ya nyanya ili apate faida kubwa, halafu nyanya hizi zisinunuliwe zote, zile zitakazobaki zitaoza. Kwa hivyo, watu wetu wataona kwamba hata ingawa wamejengewa soko, hawapati faida yo yote kutokana nalo. Jambo hili litakuwa kama lile la kiwanda cha molasses kilichojengwa kwa pesanyingi, lakini kikakosa kuendelea kufanya kazi. Kul-ikuwa pia na mradi wakuanzisha kiwanda cha kutengeneza mbolea ulioitwa Ken-Ren kule Chaani, Changamwe,uliotumia pesa nyingi lakini ukakosa kutumika hadi leo. Ni kwa nini watuwanazichezea pesa za Serikali ovyo tu? Kati ya watu wanaofutwa kazi, wale ambaowametumia pesa vibaya wanafaa kuangaliwa sana kwa sababu hawa ndio wanaoutatizampango wa kuongeza kazi nchini. Hawa ndio wanaoifanya nchi hii kuwa na shida yakuyalipa madeni yake kwa sababu wanatumia pesa za tunma vibaya.Sasa, ninamwomba Waziri aangalie ni faida gani soko hili linaletakwa sababu lengo lake lilikuwa kuwashirikisha watu ili waweze kujiendesha vizurikiuchumi. Ikiwa mtu maskini anapata hasara ya Sh.l3/= kila siku, hata akiendakukopa pesa katika benki, hawezi kukopeshwa akiishaonyesha vile biashara. yakeilivyo. Ninamwomba Waziri akubaliane nami na waheshimiwa Wabunge wengine leokwamba matatizo yaliyotuleta katika Bunge hili ni kuwasemea watu wasiojiweza,ambao ndio wengi zaidi kuliko wale wanaojiweza katika nchi hii. Tukifanya hivi,watu hawa watajua kwamba Serikali inafanya kazi kikamilifu.Hatuwezi kuilaumu Serikali kwa jumla, kwa sababu maofisa wachachewa Serikali wakikosa, huwezi kusema eti Serikali yote imekosa. Kinachofaa nikuwapiga darubini wale maofisa wachache wanaowakosea wananchi na kuwachukuliahatua za nidhamu, lakini haifai kuilaumu Serikali yote kwa jumla. Serikali yetuimetusaidia sana, na hata imejenga soko kule Chaani. Sasa hivi kuna masokomawili kule. Kuna soko moja kule Mikindani ambalo halitumiki kikamilifu. Badalaya kungoja kwa muda mrefu, ingekuwa bora Waziri Msaidizi aamuru soko mojawapo ya hayaliwe la kuuza kwa jumla ili watu waanze biashara hii kule. Kwa kufanya hivi, MsaidiziWaziri/atakuwa akituokoa, nasi tutazidi kumwombea baraka ili watu wake wa Kasipul-Kabondo wajue kwamba mhe. Mbori ni mtu wa Nyayo anayewapenda wananchi.Kwa haya machache, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, naomba kuwasilisha Hoja. Kwa hisani yako, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ninamwomba jirani yangu, mhe. Bidu, ambaye atafaidika sana Hoja hii ikipitishwa, aiafiki Hoja hii.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwanza, ningependa kumshukuru mhe. Kiliku kwa kuileta Hoja hii hapa wakati unaofaa. Pili, ningependa kuishukuruSerikali kwa kutujengea soko moja kubwa sana kule Kisauni. Tunatoa snukrani kubwa kwa Serikali kwa jambo hili, lakini ningependa kuiomba Wizara ya Serikali za Wilaya kuhakikisha kwamba, inapoyapanga mambo ya kujenga masoko, imekufikiria raahali kule lwenye matatizo kama vile idadi kubwa ya watu, watu wenye hamu kubwa ya kuanzisha biashara tofauti tofauti ili wayamudu maisha yao.Tukiliangalia soko lile-lililojengwa kule Kisauni, tutaona kwamba ni kubwa, la kisasa na lenye manufaa, lakini tutaona pia kwamba Mji wa Mombasa ni mkubwa na una watu wengi, magari mengi, na kadhalika. Mji huu una vivuko viwili ambavyo huwezi kuvipita bila kulipa ushuru. Sasa, tufikirie hasara ile inayopatikana. Mtu anabeba bidhaa zake kutoka Changamwe, Mazeras au Kinango na kukodisha gari la kumbebea bidhaa hizo hadi Kisauni. Bali na pesa anazolipia uchukuzi wa bidhaa hizi, mtu huyu anahitajiwa kulipa kivuko katika Daraja la Nyali. Anapofika pale sokoni, anatakikana kumlipa mwenye kizisusha bidhaa zake. Akiishalipa gharama hii yote, mtu huyu atapata faida gani kutokana na bidhaa hizi?Hii ndiyo sababu ninamshukuru mhe. Kiliku kwa sababu ameona kwamba ni haki kujengwe soko la uuzaji wa jumla pale Changamwe. Soko hili litatusadia sana. Kila siku, tunapiga kelele tukisema kwamba hakuna kazi, lakini Serikali imefanya juhudi ikaunda Wizara ya kuviangalia viwanda vya Jua Kali, na tunaishukuru sana'. Lau soko ili litakubaliwa liwekwe biashara ya uuzaji wa jumla pale Changamwe, litasaidia sana, kwa sababu watu hawatakuwa wakipata hasara kutokana na gharama ya usafirishaji. Watu watakuwa wakienda sokono pale raara kwa mara na kuuza vitu vyao na kupata pesa bila shida kubwa. Hii ni.njia moja ya kuusaidia mpango wa kuongeza kazi katika Kenya.Mbali na Changamwe, ningependa tuangalie upande kama vile Kwale, hasa kule Kinango ambako ninatoka. Kwale ni wilaya kubwa sana na, mbali na hasara nyingine ambayo tunapata kule Kwale, tunahitaji pia kuvuka vivuko viwili ili kufika katika soko hilo lililoko Kisauni.Kunacho .kivuko cha Likoni, lakini hapo ni lazima:ulipe pesa bali na zile unazolipia aiizigo yako. Ufikapo Nyali, pia ni lazima ulipe pesa kuvuka: Kwa vile ninajua kwamba Wilaya ya Kwale imeleta rnaombi kwamba Kombani kujengwe soko kubwa, Wizara inapaswa kufikiria sana juu ya jambo hili mhe. Kiliku aaeleta kwa-sababu litarahisi- sha usafirishaji wa bidhaa kutoka Shimba Hills-. Ninasema hivyo kwa sababu Wilaya ya Kwale inatoa machungwa mengi. Pia, katika Wilaya ya Kwale kunatoka .-n an an as i na ndizi kwa wingi. Hii ndiyo sababu ninasema kwamba Tarafa ya Changaniwe inastahili kuwa na soko kubwa. Pia, Wilaya ya Kwale inastahili kuwa na soko kubwa. Wakati umeTika ambapo pia sisi tunalazimika kuisaidia Serikali yetu tukufu kimawazo na kufikiria vile tunavyoweza kuondoa ukosefu wa kazi. Tukijenga masoko ya aina hii, Wakenya watakuwa wamepunguziwa mzigo wa kutafuta kazi. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ni kwa sababu gani ninasema kwamba masoko yajengwe katika sehemu za mashambani? Ni kwa sababu katika miji hakuna mazao yanayo  kuzwa huko. Chakula kinakuzwa katika sehemu za mashambani, na tunataka kuwasaidia wakulima ili waweze kusafirisha bidhaa zao  kwa urahisi. Tukifanya hivyo, wakulima watapata faida inayostahili kupatikana na mfanyab iashara yoyote. Ijapokuwa kwa wakati huu tumeundiwa viwanda vya jua kali aaibavyo vinawasaidia wananchi kujiajiri kazi, lakini hiyo haitoshi kwa sababu ukosefu wa kazi uaiezidi. Je, tutafanya nini   kuuondoa ukosefu wa kazi uliotukabili?Ninamshukuru Mtukufu Rais kwa kuteua tume itakayofikiria njia ya kuongeza nafasi za kazi, lakini pamoja na hayo tunapaswa kusaidiana na tume hiyo kwa kufikiria jinsi tunavyoweza kupanuka kiuchumi na kibiashara. Tukifanya hivyo, tutaweza kuji saidia sisi wenyewe. Hatupaswi kuuliza Serikali imetufanyia nini; yafaa tuulize ni kitu gani ambacho tumeifanyia Serikali yetu. Mipango ya uendeshaji wa biashara ni kitu mojawapo ya kuisaidia Serikali yetu. Tukijenga masoko katika sehemu za mashambani, wakulima watatia bidii na kulima zaidi, hasa kwa wakati huu ambapo mvua inayesha sawasawa. Badala ya kuwa tukipeleka bidhaa zetu za kilimo ng'ambo, tunaweza kuwawezesha watu wa ng'ambo kuja hapa kununua bidhaa zetu na kuzipeleka huko makwao. Kwa hivyo, ni ombi langu kwamba Waziri atakaposimama hapa ataiungamkono Hoja hii. Waziri mwenyewe ni rafiki yanguv na tuna furaha kwamba Mawaziri   wote ni marafiki zetu na wanaelewa tunase.ua nini. Hakuna haja ya Waziri kusimaaa hapa na kusema kwamba anataka kuifanyia Hoja hii mabadiliko; tunataka ipite mara aioja vile ilivyo. Tukiipitisha Hoja hii vile ilivyo, tutakuwa tumewawezesha wana¬nchi kupata kazi na mapato kwa njia rahisi. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kumekuwa na desturi ya serikali za wilaya kuvunj vioski vya wananchi ovyo ovyo. Sisi'leo tuko katika Bunge na tunashukuru kwamba tunapata marupurupu, lakini yafaa tuwafikirie wale wananchi ambao hawana mahali pa kujipatia riziki. Tunajua kwamba'. mtu akiiba ni mhalifu. Sasa, ikiwa badala ya kuiba mtu ameweka kiosk yake na anapata senti mbili unusu, hiyo ni afadhali kuliko yule mtu anayeiba. Kwa hivyo, ninaiomba Wizara ya Serikali za Wilaya ihakiki she kwamba viosk ambavyo watu hutegemea kuwasomesha watoto wao na kujipatia chakula viachwe. Kiosk ni namna nyingine ya biashara ya viwanda vya jua kali. Ninasema hivyo kwa sababu askari wa.manispaa hubomoa viosk ovyo ovyo bila kufikiria kwamba yule mama anayeendesha kiosk ana watoto na pengine amefiwa na bwana na hana mahali pengine pa kutoa riziki na karo ya shule. Je, kiosk ya mama kama huyo kikibomolewa atajipatia riziki kwa njia gani? Ni haki kuona kwamba tunayafikiria maslahi ya watu wengine. Kufikiria maslahi ya wengine si kwa njia nyingine bali ni kuambatana na kuhakikisha kwamba shida ndogo ndogo zinazomkabili mwananchi zimeondolewa ili aendelee mbele.na maisha ya siku hizi. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, katika Mji wa Mombasa wananchi husumbiliwa sana. Kuna haja gani kumsumbua mwananchi anayeuza vifagio kaiido ya barabara kusu- mbuliwa kwa kushikwa? Kuna haja gani kumsumbua mtu ambaye anauza tumbaku kando kando ya barabara? Wakati umefika a-nbapo ni lazima tuwahurumie hawa ndugu zetu ambao hawana nainna. Pia, wakati umefika ambapo tunastahili kuzihurumia jamii ambazo hazijiwezi. Watu wanaoendesha biashara ya kuuza vitu vidogo vidogo kama vile nazi na korosho wanafaa kuachwa huru kufanya hivyo. Ni masikitiko makubwa kuona mama aliyetoka Kinango hadi Mombasa mjini na vifagio vyake 10 akishikwa kwa sababu hana leserii ya kuuza vifagio vyake mjini. Tunajua kwamba tulipata Uhuru ili tuji saidie kwa kufanya kazi. Ninaomba kwamba wale wanaohusika na mambo ya kuwasumbua wananchi wanaoendesha biashara zao ndogo ndogo waambiwe kwamba jambo hilo halifai.Kwa hayo machache, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, naiunga Hoja hii mkono tena kwa diati kabisa. </Newspeech>(Question proposed)<Newspeech>MR. P.J. MASINDE: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this very important Motion, tabled by the hon. Member for Changamwe.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the most important issue here which does not only affect Changamwe but a lot of other areas within the country is the selection of the position where to place a market or a trading centre. It is an expensive affair to build a market or a trading centre. Even if the original intention is not to build a trading centre but a market, eventually a trading dentre or even a town develops as a result of a market. Therefore, it is important that the Ministry of Local Government, through county councils,does thorough plan¬ning before it sets up markets that they think will serve the people effectively.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when it coses to putting upa market place in an area, I think the point to be considered should be theother population in the area and the availability of infrastructures and other facilitiesrelevant to this kind of development. It would be pointless in putting upa market in a place where there are hardly ary people or in a place whereour people have to travel for long distances to get to the market.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Mbori): On a pointorder, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I hate to interrupt my hon. colleagueon the Floor, but I think what he is saying regarding the putting up of marketsand market centres, should not be left unchallenged.  He is giving the wrongimpression to the House that it is the Minister who locates the sites of thesemarkets. The hon. Member knows very well that it is the responsibility of therespective district development committee to recommend suitable places suchwhere such markets should be put up.  The hon. Member himself is a member of the District Development Committee and I do not know why he is giving the wrong INPRESSION to the House. Is he really in order to do that?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.S. MASINDE: Mr. Temporary Deputy  Speaker, Sir, if the hon. Assistant Minister cared to listen properly, he would, have heard what I said. After all, the Ministry is supposed to advise the countiy council concerned, and he should hh therefore not generalise the position.  I know that the district development committees work hand in hand with the local councils, but when it comes to putting up these markets, this involves everybody, including the Ministry of Local Government, Whatever the position is, when it comes to putting up these markets, due consideration should be made regarding the distance between one market and the other, the means of transport available ana the infrastructures in the area. At the moment, we have quite a number of open air markets ir. trading centres all over the country. I think there ought to be proper buildings in these places to store merchandise. This would help the customers as well as the traders in the area to keep their goods after the market hourso If possible, some of these markets should be provided with cold storage facilities so that perishable goods like tomatoes, fruits and vegetables are preserved. This would avoid losses to traders because at the moment, most of  these produce lot in the markets there by causing a great loss to traders. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I also suggest that men tirese markets are being put upy they should be provided with enough storage facilities to keep the produce that remains at the end of the day unsold. If these facilities are provided, businessmen would be able to leave their merchandise in the market place without having to carry it home and bring it to the market the following day as is the case at the moment. This would minimise loss to the businessmen because they would not have to transport their merchandise to and from the market o we know that when you take anything to the market, you have to pay market fee at the gate, ana therefore, if our people were provided with storage facilities to keep their produce at the end of the aa day, they would not be forced to pay the market fee the following day. If one has to pay the market fee every time one brings in his rnerchandise, this  would be too expensive and a trader would finally end up with a loss. We should look for ways and means of assisting our people to be able to make maximum profit, so that they can in turn be able to employ a few more people. This would assist Government to minimise the unemployment problem in the country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to the Minister for Local Government to look for ways and means of putting up a market at Mambale Trading Centre. At the moment, there is no enclosed market in mambale and the people around this area are suffering a lot because they are forced to carry  their goods to and from the market. I would also like to take this opportunity to appeal to the Minister for Supplies  and Marketing to see that a store for the National Cereals Board is put up at Nambale so that the wananchi within the area are able to buy food WITHOUT having to travel for long distances to Bungoma which is over 40 miles away. We also have another store for the National Cereals Board at YalaIn Nyanza Province which is ever 50 miles way. Ther  also such a store atMalaba which is on the other side of the border.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I feel that all these factorsshould be taken into consideration when markets are being established throughoutthe country. So, while supporting very strongly this Motion that has been broughtto this House by the hon. Member for Changamwe, I would like to say that it shouldnot apply to Chan gain we alone, but to various other areas in the country. This would assist wananchi in the country and spare them from unnecessary hardships involving lack of proper transport and other infrastructures. With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: Thank you very much, Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, for givingme this opportunity to contribute to this Motion. I must from the outset thank the Mover of the Motion for thinking about the plight of the people in Changamwe.We all know that the coastal area is endowed with a beautiful climatewhich is ideal for growing a lot of  fruits which are sold all over the country. InIn this area, farmers produce mangoes, oranges, bananas, pineapples, coconuts and many others and these fruits are very useful to this country. Unfortunately, most of these fruits are perishable and therefore, once they are picked, they must be taken to the market and sold immediately. So, for this market to be established at Changamwe, it is a very timely move in the sense that it is going to assist the farmers in Changamwe to sell their fuits there and make a profit. We also know that some of the produce like cabbages are very difficult to transport because they are bulky and therefore, farmers transporting them to the market have to pay a lot of transport charges. So, the nearer the market is to the people, the better for them. Therefore, by  suggesting that we set up a market at Changacwe, is a very timely move which ought to be considered very seriously by this House. Therefore, I urge the Minister to consider this Motion most seriously.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, to take these fruits ana vetable to the market, one has to travel often to and from the market and this kind of travel¬ling is has to some extent contributed to some of the accidents on the roads. These items are transported from one point to another and in the course ofthis transportation, accidents are bound to occur. So, by having this market built at Changamwe, we would be reducing the amount of travelling thereby minimi the possibility of having accidents on our roads. Normally, people who engage in buying and selling fruits and vegetables are generally poor people, and they rely heavily on public transport. If they are going to transport their goods so far, this is going to take up all their money throughout their activities. So, the Ministry should think about these common people in Changarwe by accepting this Motion.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, the law of supply and demand at times states that you can create a market for the demand depending on the circumstances.So, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think it is quite justifiable for us at this particular moment to say that the people of Changamwe deserve this market But some people may be inclined to think that it is not viable to build a wholesale market in Changamwe. However, what I would like to assure the hon. Members is the fact that once this market is established, many people are going to be attracted to it to go and do business there and the country is going to benefit a great deal from the that business.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if hon. Members can recall, a few weeks ago it was said, in this House, that Coast Province farmers have had to sell their mangoes at thro-away prices just because ready buyers are not available? The construction , of a wholesale market in Changamwe is one way of ensuring that our people will no longer be exploited by foreigners who go to the Coast to buy these things at throw-away prices. The construction of such a market will also be in line with the District Focus for Rural Development Strategy? Here I am talking about decentralization of development planning. So, by constructing a market in	Changamwe,we are, in a different way, trying to solve, the problem of congestion in Mombasa Town.? This is also one way of ensuring that the people of Changamwe	have a market for their producedWith those few remarks, I support the Motion.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Mbori) : Ahsante sana, Bw.. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipatia nafasi hii ili nami nitoe gnni ya Wizara yangu kuhusu Hoja hii. Hata hivyo, kabla sijaendelea zaidij ningependa kulifahamisha Bunge hili kwamba nadhamiria kuifanyia mabadiliko madogo Hoja hii!? Kwa hivyo, napende- keza maneno yote katika msitari wa mwisho, baada ya neno "Serikali" yaondolewe na badala yake maneno yafuatayo yaingizwe: “ifikirie baada ya nroango wa sasa wa ujenzi wa masoko ya jumla, ikiwezekana Changamwe ifikiriwe pesa na ardhi zikipatikana." </Newspeech><Newspeech>BW.  Naibu Spika wa Muda, itakumbukwa kwamba hivi majuzi Serikali yetu ilikamilisha ujenzi wa soko , kubwa sanala jumla kule Kisauni J Mhei? Kiliku mwenyewe anafahamu kwamba ujenzi wa hilo soko uliigharimu Serikali pesa nyingi sana Teyemwenyewe amesema kwamba soko hilo liliigharimu Serikali. kiasi chaKShs.40 milioni, lakini ukweli ni kwamba ujenzi wa soko hilouliigharimu Serikali yetu kiasi cha zaidi ya        KShs.100 milioni.Kama vile mhe. Kiliku anavyofahamu, soko la jumla liki jengwa, Serikalihuwa ina mpango wa kuisaidia wilaya nzima? Hata hivyo soko hilo laKisauni litautumikia Mkoa wote wa Pwanii? TJkienda kwenye soko hiloutawakuta watu kutoka Mkoa wa Mashariki na wengine kutoka kuleUmasaini wakiuza bidhaa zao pale." Ikiwa watu wa kutoka mbali wanawezakupata nafasi ya .  kofanyia biashara ndani ya soko hilohii inaonyesha wazi wazi kwamba watu wa Changamwe wanaweza kuyauzamazao yao kwa jumla kwenye soko hilo?</Newspeech><Newspeech>Bw.

Masoko hayoyalijengwa kwa gharama ya KShs.709,766.00. Vile vile tunalo sokoTingine pale Mikindani ambalo lilijengwa mnamo mwezi Novemba mwakawa wa 1985 kwa gharama. ya zaidi ya KShs. 500,000.00. Haya masoko yoteyamo katika Mawakilisho ya Changamwe. Hiyo ni sehemu inayowakilishwahapa Bungeni na xnhe. Kiliku.: Mhe,  Kiliku anafahamu kwamba masoko hayahayatumiwi kikamilifu.

Ikiwa Serikali itapata pesa za kutosha wakati ujao tut a jenga masoko mengine.

Kiliku anafahamu kwamba tuna shughuli nyingi ambazo tunaendesha hivi sasa kule Changamwe. Tuna mpango wa kujenga soko la bidhaa free of tax  kule Changamwe na tutahitaji kiasi cha ekari. 1,000 ndipo tuweze kuanza ujenzi huo. Lakini utaona kwamba mpaka sasa tumewahi kupata ekari 200 peke yake.; Kuenda tusijenge soko la jumla kule Changamwe wakati ujao kutokana na ukosefu wa ardhi. Kwa hivyo, ningependa kusema kwamba pesa na ardhi zikipati¬kana, Wizara yetu haitawatupa nje watu wa Changamwe kwa sababu watu vra Changamwe ni wafuasi halisi wa Nyayo.' Kwa ' vile wao ni watu wa Nyayo, tutawajengea soko la jumla, pesa na ardhi zitakapopatikana.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, raimi sitaki kuipinga Hojahiyo lakini nenebadulesha kidogo. Sitaki mhe. Mwenzangu afikirie kwamba sisi tuna ugomwa na watu wanaofanya biashara ndogo ndogo. Watu wenye kufanya biashara ndogo ndogo wanafanya kazi ya haki, kwa sababu wanatumia jasho izao na fikira zao, na wanasaidia kwa kupunguza ukosefu wa kazi. Kwa hivyo wakati tutakapo jenga soko la  jumla..huko. Changamwp. wakati pesa zitakapopati kana, tutakuwa tumefanya jambo zuri. Kwa hivyo, ningependa	kumuuliza mhe. Kiliku aiunge Wizara ya Serikali za Wilaya iakono ili tuweze kujenga masoko ya a jumla katika sehemu mbali mbali, ili watu wote katika Kenya nzima waweze kufaidika. Kwa sasa ningependa kuwahimiza wafanyabiashara kutoka Changamwe wajitahidi u na wayatumie hayo masoko ambayo nilitaja hapo mbeleni. Vile vile watu wanaopakana na soko la jumla ia Kisauni wanapaswa kwenda huko kumza  bidhaa zao kwa jumla.Hoja yenyewe haikuwa na nia mbaya, mbali ilikuwa na nia ya kuisifu Serikali, kwa sababu Hoja inaanza kwa kusema kwamba  huku tukiipongeza Serikali kwa kuisaidia Manispaa ya Mombasa kujenga soko kubwa huko Kisauni  Mheshimiwa Kiliku hakusahau kwamba Serikali ilitumxa pesa nyingi kwa kuajenga solw hilo. Pesa zaidi ya Kish.100  milioni zilitumika na hizo ni pesanyingi sana. Kwa hivyo, wahe. Wabunge kutoka Mombasa ni lazimawawahimize wananchi. wa Mombasa kuitumia hilo soko la jumla la Kisauni,na masoko mengine ya rejaireja kikamili fu, kwa sababu tungependa soko la Kisauni lilijengwa huko kulingana  na inapendekezo yaliy otolewa na kamati ya maendeleo wilayani. Mipango ya maendeleo katika wilaya huanza katika tarafa, halafu yanapelekwa kwa kamati ya maendeleo wilayani ambayo inayffongozwa na mwenyekiti ambaye ni mkuu wa wilaya na halafu hul.etwa kwa wizara 	wakata Mpango. hujfro wa kujenga sokola Kisauni ulipopitishwa, tulipewaimsaadai'wa .kulijenga  na Benki la Ulimwengu.

Yeye na wahe wabunge wenzake ambao ni wanachama wa kamati ya maendeleo wilayani Mombasa,wanganpendekeza soko hilo lijengwe mahali pengine. Wizara ya Serikali za Wilaya inatekeleza mipango ya maendeleo kulingana na mapendekezo yanayotolewa na kamati ya maendeleo wilayani, kwa sababu sisi zote tunaupenda mpango wa kuzifanya wilaya chanzo cha maendeleo mashambani.	Bila kupoteza wakati wa Bunge hilu,  ningependa wahe.

Naibu Spika wa Muda, nasimamakuunga mkono mabaduluko ambayo yourepondicazwa kwa   Hoja hii ni ya rauhimu sana kwa vile inahusu kuwajengeawananchi mahali wanapoweza kwrenda kwa urahisi. Pia ningependakuchukua nafasi hii kuipongeza Wizarya ya Serikali za Wilaya kwa kuziwezesha Serikali za wilaya kupata  mikopo kutokaKenya Local Government Loan Authority ambayo inatumiwa kwa ujenzi wa masoko. Ujenzi wa masoko unajulikana kama capital project, na Serikali za Mitaa haziwezi kujenga masoko kutokanana mapato yao, kwa vile ujenzi huwo hughamemue pesa nyingi. Kwakawaida, Serikali za Mluda hukopa pesa kutoka kwa Kenya GovernmentLoan Authority, na wanaanza kujenga masoko, vighnjuo na vituVingine.	       Kwa sasa najua kwamba Serikali za wilaya zinapata pesa nyingi kutokana na. services charge ua kwa hivyo,  hawaha sababu ya kutowapatia: wananchi huduma nzuri. Kwa sasa wanapata mapato bora kutokanas na services charge. Kwa hivyo, nillazima kila konseli, na manisipaa zihakikishe kwamba pesa wanazopata kutokana na services charge wanazitumia kwa kuwahudumia wananchi. Hilo ndilo lilikuwa lengo la Serikali ilipoikubali serikali za wlaya kuwa zinatoza watu services charge. Kuna sehemu nyingi za nchi yetu zinazohitaji masoko, na kwa hivy ni lazima zijengwe.Ningependa kumpongeza Waziri Msaidizi wa Wizara ya SerikaliWilaya kwa kapenedtaza marekebisho kwaHoja hiyo ambayo yatawezesha Serikali kupata nafasi ya kutafuta pesaya. kujenga soko hilo na hata kutafuta ardhi ya kujengea soko hilo.Bila ardhi, au pesa huwezi kujenga soko. Natumaini kwamba wahe.Wabunge wa Yiti vya Nyuma hawana mabishans kwa sababu Hoja hiyo imebaduushwa ili kuiwezesha Serikali kutafuta pesa na ardhi, ili Miinisipaa ya Mombasa iweze kuwajengea wananchi soko icacibu na mahali wanapoishi. Vile vile ni lazima Serikali za walya zinginezo zijikaze ili ziweze kuwajengea masoko mahali yanapohitajika.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ujenzi wa masoko ni jambo la muhimu sana kwa sababu, masoko yanasaidia uchumi wa nchi hii. Wakulima wanafaidika kwa sababu wanaweza kupeleka mazao kx yao huko sokoni na kuyauza. Vile vile, kama soko linajengwa linasaidia sana kwa .kupunguza ukosefu wa kazi.  Kama soko fulani h linajengwa ni lazima W Serikali za mitaa ziwaajiri watu wa kujenga soko hilo na pia kufanya kazi zinginezo Pia watu wanaokuja kuuza bidhaa hapo sokoni vile vile wanapata kazi, na bila shaka watasaidia kwa kustawisha uchumi wa nchi hii.Kwa hivyo, ni juu. ya Serikali za Mitaa kuhakikisha kwamba zimetoa huduma zamuhimu ambazo zinahitajika, kama vile kujenga masoko, machinjoni na mambo mengine, na pia kuwasaidia wananchi kwa kuwajengea shule.za nasari. Hivyo wananchi wataona kwamba kiasi kidogo cha pesa ambacho wanatoa kama services charge, yaani malipo ya huduma, kimerudishwa kwa wananchi kwa njia ya kuwatolea huduma wananchi wote kwa jumla. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Bw.

Ingefaa Serikali pia ifikirie sehemu nyingine nchini. Nina hakika kwamba mhe. Kiliku hawezi kuyapinga marekebisho hayo kwa sababu hata huko Butare tunahitaji soko. Kwa mfano, huko Khwisero tunahitaji soko. Tena, katika kila aakao ya chifu huko Butere tunahitaji soko la kuuzia mboga na kadhalika. Ukija katika upande wa Butere, kitu ambacho akina mama wanategemea kwa upande wa biashara ni mboga nabidha a nyingine. Kwa hivyo, ikiwezekana, ingefaa Serikali za Mitaazititie Ltie maanani jambo hili la ujenzi wa masoko ambayo yana nafasiya kutosba.

Kiliku anahitaji pongezi kwa sababu anayaangalia sana maslahi ya watu wake. Ni wajibu wetu kuyaangalia maslahi ya wananchi wetu kwa sababu wao ndio wanaouendeleza uchumi wa nchi hii kwa kuendeleza kilimo katika sehemu. za mashambani.

Wakulima kama hawa wanahitaji kufikiriwa kwa kujengewa soko kama hilimhe. Kiliku anataka Lijengwe huko Changamwe. Soko kama hilie tawasaidia sana.  watu wa Changamwe kwa sababu ghazama  teei ya usafirishaji kwa matatu nabas ni ghali sana.Huwa inwaagharimu wakulima pesa nyingi sana kusafirisha magunia yao ya vyakulambali mbali kutoka mashambani mwao hadi mijini.wafikapo huko sokoni      hawawakulima hukuta kuwa wanatakiwa na manispaa za huko watoe kodi fulani. Baadaya kuviuza vyakula vyao  hawa wakulima huwa hawana budi kurudi nyumbani. Kwahivyo, utaona kuwa baada ya haya yote wakulima kama hawa huwa hauzapata faida kubwa.Hii ina maana kuwa uamefatya kazi ya bure kwani hii itakuwa ni kazi ambayo hainafaida yoyote. Kwa hivyo, ningependa kuiomba Wizara ya Serikali za Wilaya ihakikishekuwa pesa zitakapopatikana soko tnli timeiengwa  mara moja. Nafikiri wakati umefikaambapo mambo kama haya yanafaa kiungaliwa lata was aidia hata vijana wa kutoka Wilaya ya TaitaTaveta kuvipeleka vyakula vyao/kuviuza huko.

Kuna sehemu nyingi katika nchi hii kama vile kule Molo, Mau Narokna Tomoyeta (!) ambako huwa na mvua kila wakati.

Kwa vile nsuli ya basi na matatuimeenda juu, wananchi hawawesi kusafirisha bidhaa sao mpaka Molo Elburgor.au ITakuru mjini. Wakati Wizara inafanya mipango yake, ingefaa ifikirie juu yasehemu ambazo zina avua ya kutosha ili. ysc ijenge masoko kuleKwa vile ioona ukosefu wa kazi, wananchi wanawesa kufanya biashara ndogo ndogo ya kusafirisha mboga 	Kisunu., Kakamega, Nakuru na kadhalika-na kuvauzia watu huko.

Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipa nafasi ili niiunge mkono Hoja hii muhimu saidi na ambayo imefanyiwa marekebisho na Wizara inayohusika   Masoko ni muhimu sana kwa Wakenya, na hasa wale ambao wanaishi katika sehemu za mashambani. Wakati huu tunajua|jrananchi wanaendelea na kazi ya kutunza mxax mime a ya chalcula. katika mashamba, lakini ikiwa hakuna masoko watakuwa na shida ya kuuza mazao yao.' Huku nikiunga mkono kujengwa kwa soko huko Changamwe pesa zitapopatikana, ninai.om.ba Wizara kukumbuka kwamba wilaya zote zinahitaji masoko, hasa wilaya yetu ya Siaya ambako hatuna  soko lolote la kudumu, angalau katika tarafa moja. Wi. ziri:Msaidizi, mhe Mbori, ambaye tunajua amefanya kazimc nzuri katika Wizara yake, na tunamwomba atusaidie katika mipango ya a maendeleo ya miji.Vile vile tungependa masoko sasa yajengwe ya kisasa. HiiNi kwa sababu tunaka masoko haya yawe yakitumika kama supermarketsza watu wetu huko mashambani . Ikiwa masbko haya. yatakuwa ha nafasiya., kutoSha,  ahi ma. Na-maji -alri na  mama na.  aki na baba wanaofanya kazikatika sehemu hizo watapata huduma sawa na watu vy  jokaa katika miji hapa nchi.ni</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, wakati umefika wa kuhakikisha kwamba mambo ya afya yanafikiriwa wakati masoko makubwa yanapojengwa. Tunataka masoko haya yawe na vyoo na kliniki vinavyohudumiwa na maofisa wa afya wenye ujuzi ufaao ili watu wanaofanya biashara huko. wakipatikana na ugonjwa wasiwe wakipelekwa mbali, bali waweze kutibiwa humo humo katika masoko haya. Ikiwa madaktari fulani wanataka kufungua kliniki zao humo, jambo hili linafaa kufanywa rahisi.Jambo la pili, ni kwamba tumeona kwamba akina mama wengi wanaokwenda kuuza vyakula na mboga sokoni huwa wamewafungia watoto wachanga mgongoni. Lakini sasa ni mwaka wa 1990 na tunaelekea mwaka wa 2000, na ninafikiri kwamba Wizara inaweza kutusaidia kwa kuwa na pre-unit schools katika masoko haya. Shule hizi ni kama nursery schools, lakini ziko chini ya nursery schools. Ukiwa na mtoto mchanga unaweza kumwacha mtoto huyo katika pre unit school akatunzwa na walirau  ambao wana mafunzo ya ya kusomesha katika shule za nursery. Mama anapotoka nyumbani asubuhi kwenda sokono, bwana yake huwa amekwenda kazi na watoto wakubwa wakaenda shule. Mama huyu akiwa na watoto wawili wachanga, anaweza kwenda nao sokoni na kumwacha mmoja katika pre unit school na mwingine katika nursery school, ambapo watachungwa vizuri mpaka atakapowachukua jioni kuwarudisha nyumbani. Haya ndiyo maendeleo ambayo yatawafanya akina mama kujua kwamba kweli dunia imebadilika huku tukielekea mwaka wa 2000.Ulinzi zaidi unahitajiwa katika masoko haya makubwa kwa kuwa watu napoingia humo watakuwa wakijua kwamba wao wenyewe pamoja na mali wako salama. Kwa hivyo, tunaiomba Wizara ihakikishe kuwa inapojenga masoko haya, imejenga vyumba vidogo vya walinzi pale mlangoni. Mmojawapo wa walinzi hawa atakuwa akilinda upande wa ndani wa soko, na mwingine upande wa nje.Jambo la mwisho, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ni kwamba hatutaki masoko haya yawe yakiuza chakula peke yake, bali tunataka yawe yakiuza bidhaa tofauti tofauti, hata nguo za wanaume na za wanawake, vyakula vilivyopikwa, na kadhalika. Kwa njia hii, hata wananchi wa mashambani wataweza kuwa na supermarkets zao.Kwa haya machache, naiunga Hoja hii mkono kama ilivyobadilishwa"na Serikali. Ahsante.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Mr. Twarith, you have only about five minutes to speak.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. TWARITH:  Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ninaunga Hoja hii mkono kwa kuwa ni ya maana sana. Mwasilishi wa Hoja hii, mhe. Kiliku, ametoa Hoja ya maana sana kwa sababu anayajali maslahi ya wananchi, hasa akina mama ambao raara nyingi ndio huwa na kazi nyingi ya kuwalea watoto wachanga na kusafirisha bidhaa hapa na pale. Waziri wetu wa Serikali za Wilaya anafaa kuiunga Hoja mkono kikamilifu na kutafuta pesa chungu nzima za kujengea soko hili la Changamwe.Mhe. Mbunge mwenyewe amesema kwamba akina mama wa Changamwe hupata shida sana, nasi, viongozi tulio hapa,tumechaguliwa na wazee, akina mama na vijana. Kwa hivyo, mhe. Kiliku ametoa Hoja ya maana sana ili wananchi hawa waweze kufaidika. Ninapendekeza kwamba Waziri atafute pesa za kujengea soko hili ili wananchi wa Changamwe wawiwe wakitembea mbali kule karibu na Mombasa.Nina hakika kwamba Waziri wa Serikali za Wilaya anaelewa umuhimu wa kila mahali hapa nchini kuwa na mradi kama vile mhe. Kiliku anavyoomba. Kuna haja ya kila tarafa kuwa na soko lake hata kama itakuwa ndogo.Kwa hayo machache, </Newspeech><Newspeech> Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, naiunga Hoja-hii mkono. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Hon. Members, it is now time for the Mover to reply. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa muda. Nataka kwanza niichukue nafasi hii kuwashukuru Wahe. Wabunge wenzangu ambao wametoa maoni yao kuhusu Hoja hii, na pia. wale ambao wangetaka kutoa maoni yao lakini hawakuweza kufanya hivyo kwa vile wakati haukuruhusu. Nataka pia kumshukuru Waziri Msaidizi wa Wizara ya Serikali za Wilaya kwa vile alivyoeleza wazi wazi kabisa kuhusu mipango ya Serikali. Nataka kumhakikishia Waziri wa Serikali za Wilaya na Mawaziri Wasaidizi wake kwamba sikupuuza kukutana nao wakati walipotembelea sehemu ya Changamwe; nilikuwa hapa nikihuduria mikutano ya Public Investment Committee, na sikujulishwa mapema kwamba walikuwa wakifanya ziara upande huo. Ikiwa Waziri atatembelea mawakilisho ya mhe. Mbunge mwengine yeyote katika siku za usoni, si vibaya kumjulisha mhe. Mbunge huyo mapema ili kusudi aweze kumlaki. Ingawa hivyo, nataka kuichukua nafasi hii kuwa  alika Waziri na Mawaziri Wasaidizi katika Wizara yake kuja Changamwe tena na wakati huo watatukuta huko tumewangojea.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, vile Bi. Grace alivyozungumza, ameeleza wazi kabisa kwamba si lazima masoko yawe ya kuuza chakula peke yake; pia, kuna haja ya masoko kuwa na vifaa vingine.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BARNG’ETUNY: Jambo la nidhamu, Bw.. Naibu Spika wa Muda. Ni haki kwa mhe. Kiliku kumwita mhe. Bi. Grace Ogot Bi. Grace bila kusema kwamba yeye ni mheshimiwa?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, naomba radhi. Ningemwita mhe. Bi. Grace. Yeye ni Mbunge ambaye anaheshimika.Nilikuwa nikisema kwamba ni vizuri masoko, bali na kuuza chakula, yawe na bidhaa nyingine na vifaa kama vile vya kuhudumia watu kiafya na kadhalika. Nilileta Hoja hii hapa kwa sababu nimeona vile watu wanavyoteseka, si katika sehemu ya Changamwe pcke yake lakini katika sehemu nyingine nyingi nchini. Nataka kuchukua nafasi hii kusisitiza vile Waziri Msaidizi alivyosema, kwamba kila mahali palipo karibu na watu wengi pana haja ya kuwa na soko. Hayo ndiyo maendeleo. Tumeona miradi mingi kama vile Ken-Ren na Kisumu Molasses ikivunjika na huku Serikali kupoteza pesa nyingi sana. Ikiwa soko litajengwa mahali ambapo hakuna watu wengi, Serikali itakuwa ikipoteza pesa nyingi sana. Kwa hivyo, ni lazima masoko yawe yakijengwa mahali ambako kuna watu kwa sababu kama si hivyo, basi Serikali itakuwa inaharibu pesa za umma.</Newspeech>W<Newspeech>Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda,: naichukua nafasi hii kuwapongeza akina mama wa Kenya kwa vile walivyojishirikisha kikamilivu katika ukuzaji wa uchumi. Hakuna tena akina mama wanaokaa nyumbani kungomea baba watoto watafute mali. Akina mama wametuunga mkono nami pia nawaunga mkono, na njia moja ya kuwashirikisha akina mama katika ukuzaji wa uchumi ni kuwajengea masoko karibu na mahali wanapoishi. Pia, naichukua nafasi hii kuipongeza Serikali kwa sababu wakati akina mama wanapo- omba leseni za kufanyia biashara hawabaguliwi hata kidogo. Hiyo ni njia nzuri ya kuonyesha kwamba Serikali ya Nyayo inawatambua akina mama na umuhimu wa kuwa¬shirikisha katika mambo ya maendeleo.Ikiwa wao ni wataalamu wa mipango, ni kwa nini hawawezi kifikiria taabu ya hawa akina mama. Kuna haja kubwa ya kujenga soko hili katika changemwe ili watu wote kwa junloe waeze kusaidiwe. Tungetaka solo hili lijengwa pahali ambapo kuna watu wengi. Kwa wakati huu, watu wenatoka Likoni au Kinango na kwemda mpaka changanwe na kbla ya kufika changamwe, ni lazima wapiti Nayali. Eiyo ni safari ndefu na huwezi kupata mkokoteni wa kukusaidia kubeba  minigo. Hivyo ni kusema kwamba ni lazima utunie gari na jambo hili linasababisha hasara lubwa sana kwa. Wafanyabisashara. Kwa gurria moja ya mzigo, unalipishwa Shs.45/- kutoka changamwe mpaka Likoni. Hii ni kwa sababu mfanyabiashara analipa  Shs.15/- kama-nauli ya kusafiria, na mzigo wake unalipishwa Shs.30/-  kwa kawidani lazima mfanyabiashara aweze kununua magunia mengi ili kuwesa kupatafaida. tfakati mwingine ikiwa ni nyanya ambazo amenunua  zinawesa kuharibikakwa sababu haziwezi kununuliwa kwa wakati moja. Kwa hivyo, nyingi za nyanyahizo zinaoza na hiyo inakuwa fex shida juu ya shida.Kwa hivyo, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ni lazima Serikali ifikirie njia yakupata pesa ili kuweza kujenga soko hili. Kwa wakati huu, kuna soko tatu katikaChangamwe ambazo zinauza vitu vya reja reja na ningetaka kumwomba vfaziri afikiriekuifanya moja ya soko hizo kuwa la kuuza vitu kwa njia ya jumla. Kwa wakatihuu, lile soko la Chaani limefungva na pengine badala ya  wizara kutumiapesa zaidi kwa ujenzi wa solo mpya,ingefikiria kuituraia soko hili kama sokola kuuza vitu vya jumlao Sisi kama yfabunge tuna wajibu wa kuisaidia Serikalikatika mipango ya maendeleo and hii ndiyo sababu tunatoa maoni yetu hapa Bungeni.Kama tunavyofaharau, sisi Wabunge tu wanachama wa Kamati cha Maendeleo jfilayani(D.D.Cs)	na tumekuwa tukisema kwamba ni lazima sisi rabungewanachamatuwe katika  		li strict Tender Board. Ajabu ni kwamba kazi ya kandarasi inatolewa kwa watu bila Mbunge wa sehemu hiyo kujua. Hi lasima mhe. Mbunge anayehusika awe aki fail ami shwa kuhusu mipango ya District Tender Board. Kwa hayo machache, naomba kupendekeza. (Question put and agreed to)(Question of the Motion as amended put and agreed to)Resolved accordinglyTHAT, huku tukiipongeza Serikali la-fa kuisaidia Maui spaa ya Mombasa kujenga soko kubwa ka hukD Kisauni, na ikifahamika kuwa Changamwe ni mbali mno na soko hilo, na kwa hivyo wafanyabiashara wadogo, hasa akina mama kutoka Changamwe wanateseka mno kwa kusafirisha bidhaa zao kutoka soko hilo hadi Changamwe, Bunge hili laiomba. Serikali ifikirie baada ya Mpango wa sasa wa ujenzi wa masoko ya jumla, ikiwezekana Changamwe ifikiriwe kwanza, pesa na ardhi zikipatnana.</Newspeech><Header> ADJOURNMENT </Header> <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Hon.

The Government is in the process of taking legal action against the previous contractor for breach of contract.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

SKIDOR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the Minister tell this House why action was not taken against this contractor until the Question was asked in this House? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I said in my previous suppleme¬ntary answer, before legal action is taken, the Government must first establish whether the work that this contractor had done equalled the amount of money he had been paid. If the Government were to go to court after every breach of contract, then it might lose a lot of cases. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NDZAI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the Minister tell us how much this contractor had been paid before he abandoned the work?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Deputy Speaker,Sir, according to the Government specialist on contract works provided by the Ministry of Public Works, the amount of money that was paid was about 50 per cent which was equivalent to the work done and, perhaps, slightly over. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. J.N. MUNGAI: This is a sensitive question which the Minister has answered almost satisfactorily. I say so because it takes long to determine how much a contractor should be paid for the work he has done. It also takes quite some time for legal action to be taken. Can the Minister tell the House how long it took to determine the cost of the work done and the time it took for legal action to be taken. Three years is along time and we should be told exactly what is happening.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not know where my hon.	friend got the idea of three years. The information I have is very differentfrom that. The specialists from the Ministry of Works who have to establishthe actual percentage of the works done, are net very many. So, it would takea few months before they move from one job to another. In this particular case,the contractor had done slightly more than what he was paid.  What we are goingto court for is for breach of contract.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. J.N. MUNGAI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.We have, not been told specifically how long it took to determine the work donedespite the fact that they do not have enough personnel to do this work. The Minister has also not told us a how long it took for legal action to be taken.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

MATE asked the Minister for Healthwhether in view of the increasing number of mental patients in Embu District he could consider opening a mental, ward at the Embu Provincial General Hospital.<Newspeech>ASSISTANT MINIISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur): Mr. DeputySpeaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Plans are underway to open a 20-bed psychiatric unit at Embu Provincial General Hospital as soon as the- renovations currently in progress are completed. A building at the hospital has been identified, and renovation work is in progress to convert it into a psychiatric unit. So far over 80 per cent of the renovation has been completed and the remaining 20 per cent of the work will be completed soon.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATE: Mr.  Deputy Speakerthe answer given the Assistant Minister, can he tell the House specifically when he thinks the remaining 20 per cent of the workwill be completed, and when the patients could be admitted ? Will that happen next month, on Monday or tomorrow morning?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy,  Speaker, Sir, the  even the hon. Member himself cannot answer that question.  If already 80per cent of the renovation work has been completed and workers are still going on, you cannot say here that they will complete the remaining bit tomorrows You only ask the workers to work hard and finish the remaining work because they have already been able to complete 80 per cent of the same job. So, I have assured the 	hon. Member that the remaining renovation work will be done quicklyand the psychiatric unit opened immediately that work is completed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.K., KTHYAHJUI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, theHon. Questioner indicated that mental cases are increasing inThat area HOW many patients will this unit be able to accommodatewhen it is completed and opened?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, when we are going to open a-20-bed psychiatric unit, we will not send away anybodywho will be in need of treatment; instead, we will add an extra bed.All hon. Members know that when the number of patients increases,We usually squeeze beds here and there. However, for now we expectthe unit to have  20 beds.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAITG'OLI: While I appreciate the Assistant Minister'sreply, 2 he has not answered hon. Mate's supplementary question.He has told the House that 80 per cent of the renovation work isalready done. Since he knows how long it has taken the 80 per centof the renovation, then from that he can work out and tell us exactlywhen he expects the ar remaining 20 per cent renovation work willbe completed and the unit opened.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we consider to constitutethe remaining 20 per cent renovation is the plastering and paintingof the waiting bay, replacing of broken window glasses andre-location toilets to an appropriate place.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.Is the Assistant Minister in order to evade answering the supplementaryquestion by beginning to enumerate what is to be done? He knowshow long the 80 per cent of the work has taken and from that he candetermine when the other 20 per cent will be completed and then tell us exatly when the unit will be opened.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr.  Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to inform this House that my Ministry is a responsible one. we have completed 80 per cent of the renovation work and the remaining workof  fixing window glasses and will be completed quickly.We have accepted the responsibility of opening that unit. This showsclearly that we are  moving towards our goal. Telling this House thatthe remaining work will be completed within two to three dayswill not be sufficient to what is important is for us to ensurethat the  remaining work is completed and the unit opened because we have given an undertaking to open it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,  Any contract must have completion period. Could the Assistant- Minister, therefore, tell us what, according to the contract documents the completion period was?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr.  Deputy Speaker, Sir, the completion period is not the problem we should, talk about here. Our problem is to ensure the mental patients:can get treatment.  I have already told the House that what is remaining is just the work of  fixing of window glasses and conversion of some buildings into kitchen and toilets. This work may not even take us up to July, 1990, if I may say so.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. J.N. MUNGAI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the hon. Assistant Minister is trying.to confuse the House. It is only very important to realise that this is a very straightforward case because mental cases are very serious, and they can wreck people. The Assistant Minister has just told us categorically that 80 per cent of the job involved has been done, which means that he knows how long it has taken to do this work and how much time it will take to do the rest of the job. What is wrong in telling the House that after such and such a period, the remaining 20 per cent of the job will be completed so as to take-care of the mental cases in Embu, which are already on the increase? All the painting and analysis that he is telling.us about do not matter at all.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the time involved is not specified; we just want the contractors to do good work and when the work is completed, the hon. Member can inform us, and we will move in straightaway. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to imply from.the way he is now replying that he does not even know when this work will be completed? This is amazing! I challengedthe Ministry when the Assistant Minister implied earlier on that</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: What is your point of order? What is your, point oforder? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could you direct the Assistant Minister to tell us when this office is going to be opened? What is difficult in saying that it will be opened in one month or six months? Hon. Members sure prepared to wait even for one year so long as the Assistant Minister promises that the work remaining will be completed in that time. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the remaining work will be completed in about July, 1990. </Newspeech>(Hon. Mutiso rose up and walked towards the microphone) <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is your problem, Mr. Mutiso? I see you walking towards the microphone. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Mutiso): I want to raise a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is your point of order? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Mutiso): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.  I wouldlike to draw your attention to the fact that hon. Mang'oli is accustomed to rising on points of .argument under the pretext that they are points of order. Could you define to-him what a point of order and what a point of argument are? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SALAT: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is hon. Mutiso, in order to assume the authority of the Chair? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Mutiso, you have definitely noticed the bit of stir that was caused by the little trip you made in making your point. We will leave this matter to the Chair, and I also hope that hon. Mang'oli will take this in good spirit. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while noting the seriousness of this Question, could the Assistant Minister acknowledge before this House that disease is one of the three deadly enemies that this Republic is trying to fight. It is alarming to be told that mental cases in Embu are on the increase. What is the Ministry doing to curb this increase and to find out the cause of mental problems in Embu?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is a mere statement, and there is no statistical justification to show that people in Embu are increasingly becoming mad.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, my question is in the same line as the former one. There are two words here, "increasing number", which the Assistant Minister accepted without denial. Could he tell us the reason behind this increasing number and what the Ministry is doing to curb the increase?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have not accepted in this House the word "increasing", because people in Embu are not increasingly becoming mad.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister comes from Alego or thereabouts while the hon. Member here comes from Embu. The hon. Member has noticed the increase of mental cases in Embu. Is the Assistant Minister in order to deny this fact?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am a professional statistician, whereas the hon. Member is not even a doctor and has no justification for his claim.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. J.N. MUNGAI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I remember very well that when the hon. Assistant Minister was answring this Question initially, he clearly said, that the Ministry was introducing a psychiatric weird in that hospital, thereby accepting the fact that mental cases were on the increase in Embu. Could he tell us whether the Ministry is introducing this psychiatric ward there as a result of this increase or as a normal" development matter? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is a normal way of the Kenya Government of bringing as near as possible such facilities. There is a need to expand and even create health-facilities as close as possible to wananchi. These facilities include dispensaries, health centres, full hospitals and even psychiatric units.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister is denying the bare truth. He knows that mentally handicapped people are dangerous' to other people. Why is the Ministry not taking care of both these mental cases and the other people around them? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to inform the-hon. Member that mentally handicapped people are not the same as mental patients. </Newspeech>Question No. 74 <Header> Rural Electrification Programme for Mwala </Header> MR. WAMBUA asked the Minister for Energy what urgent measures he is taking to commission the Rural Electrification Programme in Mwala Constituency, in view of the fact that over 500 residents of this area, particularly in Masii Location, have paid Shs.500/= each in order to be supplied with electricity.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Moturi): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Machakos-Masii-Makutano-Makueni-Mbooni Rural Electrification Project, which includes a part of Mwala Constituency, was adopted by my Ministry for implementation in 1985, and construction work has been in progress since then.More residents from Mwala Constituency will be connected as the projectprogresses,.and their contribution of Shs.500/= each will be .taken into account.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this project, as the Assistant Minister says, was in progress in some areas in Masii sometime in April, 1989, but after that those concerned went away and have not come back since.Since they went away they have not returned to the area. When are they going to finalise the job they left undone? They left poles piling all over the area.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MOTURI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I have just mentioned, Mwala Constituency is just a small bit within this big project. Again, as I have said, the Machakos-Masii Makutano Mbooni rural electrification project was adopted by my Ministry for implementation in 198, and the total work was estimated to cost KShs.50 million. Work has been, in progress since that time, and up to now some KShs.35 million has been spent on the project. While it is acknowledged that 1,707 residents of Mwala Constituency had paid their token deposits of KShs.500/- in order to be considered for electricity supply, so far 91 residents have had connections at Masii Market. As opposed to the number of applicants mentioned by the hon. Qestioner, 1,707 people from the constituency have applied for connect¬ion.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the applicatns in question are widely scattered throughout the constituency, and it will time considerable time before all of them are covered. Those residents who are close to the line will be connected right away while those away from the line will be connected according to the Machakos District Development Committee list of priorities. Their deposits of KShs.500/- each will be taken into consideration when time for the connection comes.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, since this project crosses from one constituency to another, the hon. Member should know that the officials may be somewhere else working in the district. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister talked about Masii Market and the school institutions there. There is a line which parts from Kithangaini leading to Vyulya Girls’ Secondary School, and that line has been installed by his people to a certain distance. After that, they left the work incomplete without reaching the coffee factory ahead which had been, covered by their survey. They were supposed to cover that coffee factory, Katheka Secondary School and a nearby village polytechnic. When are they going to finalise the installation of that particular line?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MOTURI: Mr. Deputy.Speaker, Sir, as I have already stated, this work is still in progress and, therefore, the officers will still have to go back there to complete it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the Assistant Minister is misleading the House because the information we have is that the officers are not in the three constituencies  involved in the project, that is,  Mbooni, Makueni and Mwala Can he specifically tell the House where the officers are at the moment?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. MOTURI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for the information of the hon. Member, this was a big project estimated to cost more than KShs.50 million. The project started right from Athi River to Machakos town and then eventually to various lines. The officers are within the district and they are working on the project. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is deliberately evading my question, which is simple and specific. All we want to know is where the officers are at the.moment because they are neither in Mwala Constituency nor in Mbooni and Makueni constituencies. Where are they at the moment?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MOTURI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the hon. Member tell the House where he got the information that the officers are not in any of the three constituencies? The information I have is that the officers are stili working on the project.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I really do not know why the Assistant Minister does not want to answer my question. Since the project is only within the three constituencies, can he tell the House in which speicific area the officers are working at the moment? Where are they installing the wires and the rest of the facilities required for electrification? </Newspeech>(There was noise in the Chamber)<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Mutiso): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. There is so much noise in the House that we cannot hear what is going on.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon. Members Could hon. Members please consult in silence, so that we can hear what hon. Moturi has to say. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MOTURI: Thank you. Sir. As I have already indicated, this was a big on-going project, and the hon. Members have to take it that I am speaking nothing else but the truth. In actual fact, the original Question was about Mwala Constituency and I see no reason why the hon. Member would like to know where my officers are working at the moment.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.G. GODANA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the Assistant Minister is deliberately evading the question. If these people have not been seen working in either Mwala, Mbooni or Makueni constituencies, where are they stationed at the moment?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MOTURI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have said that the officials are somewhere within the district and that they are working.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Although I have been accused of rising on points of order and advancing points of arguments, I do insist that Ministers do evade answering hon. Members' questions. The question that has been posed to the Assistant Minister just now is very specific. It is only that the Assistant Minister did not consult his officers. Where are the officers working on the electrification project in Machakos stationed right now? That was the question. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order I It would, of course, be prudent for a Minister to say that he does not have the proper information rather than going round and round in circles in answering a question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MOTURI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not trying to evade the Question. I have already said that the officials are now busy working on</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order Mr. Moturi !  With all due respect is hon. Moturi I think I should repeat that I have just said, namely that if you do not know where the officers are, you should simply say you do not know and I am sure hon. Members would take note of that rather than going round in circles. There are three places you have mentioned, namely, Mbooni, Mwala and another place, and hon. Members are insisting that you should be specific and say where these officer really arec in the district at the moment.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MOTURI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon Member  should know that I come from Kisii but the fact remains that the officers are still in the district but I do not know exactly where they are.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The Assistant Minister has said quite clearly that he comes from Kisii. We would like to. know whether he is representing Kisii or the Ministry in this particular Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MOTURI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I represent the whole of the Republic of Kenya, but the fact of the matter is that I may not be able to know all about small towns and villages in the Republic of Kenyao</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Depuly Speaker, Sir, whereas we appreciate ihat the hon. Assistant Minister may not know about every town or village in the Republic of Kenya, I do not think he has any excuse for failing to answer the questions-that have been put to him by the hon. Members of this Eouse. It would have been most appropriate for the Assistant Minister to tell us that he is not satisfied with the information that he has received from  his officers, and we would have excused him.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

I am asking thisbecause before I raised this Question here, I visited Treasury and was toldthat the documents had been sent back to the Ministry Could the Assistantback Minister now tell us when the Ministry sent the documents back to Treasury. As far as Treasury is concerned, these documents are still with the Ministry. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

MAKEAIIU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not satisfied with the AssistantMinister’s answer. If the papers are sent to the Treasury, the noimal practice for Treasury to do is to allocatean A.P.A. number. Could we be told the number that has been allocated to this officer so that we can be able to follow up his case with the Treasury? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

MAKHANU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The Assistant Minister is misleading the House on the issue we are discussing. colleague here assisted me in asking why there was a delay in paying the pension to the concerned .officer and the Assistant Minister replied to the effect that there was no delay. However, we have just received this information here in the afternoon, during our discussions, that papers were sent to the Treasury in the first instance, returned to the Ministry ana then later back again to the Treasury, whichmeans that there was an amount of delay. Could the Assistant Minister tell us what was causing the delay? Is it laxity on the part of his officers, or what was the problem? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.NANG’OLE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like the hon. Member to withdraw the claim that I am misleading the House, because I am not doing that. I am giving him the information I have and it represents what actually happened. The fact is that there is a procedure between the Ministry of Livestock Development and the Treasury. If the delay came about because of that transaction between our Ministry and the Treasury, that can then be described as the causeo However, the hon.

The absence of readmarkings on this road is one of the reasons why there are so many accidents  occurring along this road Can he confirm that the Ministry is going to do the road marking before the end of this month? Is he  aware that this Road was constructed in 1975 and since then  no road markings have been made on this road? This is the Ministry's first attempt to put road signs, cat eyes, reflectors and yellow lines on this Road.

Thoya, Ex-Police Porce 2 No. 21105, since he left the service on 2nd January, 1983.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OPPICE OP THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Kamuren) Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.:The unfortunate delay in payment of terminal benefits for ex-police officer Daniel G.Thoya has been occasioned by lack of the claimant's  identity card and a filled optionform to commute pension, which the law requires must be filled by the claimant. The hon. Member is kindly requested, to ask the claimant to provide the two documents to enable the Government to process his. pension immediately. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NDZAI: Mr.Speaker, Sir, it is not my duty to ask retirees to fill forms It is the duty of the Ministry concerned to give the relevant forms to the person who has retired so that, it pays him How come that the Assistant Minister is asking me to contact</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>Mr. Thoya. Could he, therefore, communicate with Mr. Thoya so that he pays him? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. KAMUREN: Mr.Speaker, .Sir the  person in question 	has been repeatedly  asked by the Commissioner of Police to appear thepensions officer to fill in the Option Form to Commute Pension sothat it is processed and his pension paid,but he has never comearound. This why I am requesting the hon Member to request theclaimant to come and fill his form at the Police Headquarters. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZAUDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir does,the AssistantMinister want a to believe that with all the personnel the Commissionerof. Police has night from his head office right to the rural areas, he has tofailed to trace this person and that now it has become the dutyof hon.

The principal pensions officer was requested by the Commissioner of Police,through letter</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZAHDI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I asked the Assistant Minister to tell us whether despite an the personnel the Commissioner of Police, has, he has failed completely to  trace this person. He should tell us whether the Commissioner of Police has become so incompetent that he cannot deal with a matter like this one. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAMDREN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wanted to give very favourable supplementary information to the hon Questioner. However, let me still ask the hon. Member to request the claimant to get in touch with us. The Commissioner of Police has -all the machinery, but this man- has not been found anywhere. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. WASIKE—NDOMBI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is true that every Government employee has a file; it is time that every Government employee who retires or resigns fills in certain forms, including the "Official Secrets Act Form". Also, an officer who leaves Government service leaves his contact address. Now, what has the Ministry done since January, 1988 in order to  trace this particular ex-policeman? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Health when Kiambere, Kamumu, Kanyuambora and.Kathanye Dispensaries, in Siakago Division, will be equipped and opened. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur): Mr. Speaker, Sir, Ibeg to reply.Because the hon. Member has asked a Question relating to many dispensaries in his constituency, I request you to allow me to explain the state of all of them.With regard to Kanyuambora and Kamumu Dispensaries, the two rural health facilities will not be opened during this financial year because the necessary equipment for the operation of the facilities has not been procured. However, the Ministry will make arrangements to purchase the equipment in the next financial year, 1990/91. The two health facilities have the following already completed a service block, two staff houses, water sanitation and patients toilets.Kathanye Dispensary is not ready for opening because the Ministry has not acquired the necessary equipment and put up staff houses, which are necessary before the facility can operate.Kiambere Dam Dispensary is a property of the Kenya Power and Lighting Company Ltd. Arrangements will be made to open this dispensary sifter the facility is handed over to the Ministry by the company. Thank you. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Assistant Minister for the answer he has given, but when these dispensaries were being constructed, provision should have been made for the purchase of equipment and other apparatus which were required so that these health institutions could be opened. Could the Assistant Minister tell the House why we have to wait until the next rehabilitation have been lying idle unattended and when, they will be rehabiliated?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no secret about Governmentvehicles staying a little long under repair, sometimes due to lack of spare parts and sometimes due to the usual delay in getting money so that these vehicles maybe released	 The fact we have as a Ministry is that we have ordered that thesevehicles be repaired and taken back into operation, and we are going to pay for the repair work.</Newspeech> MR. NUNO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, out of the 17 vehicles stationed at Garissa Provincial General Hospital, the Assistant Minister said that two are attached to two health centres.

Why should the Assistant Minister -give a whole list of all the operational vehicles? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have informed the House that the two vehicles attached to health centres are operational, but the area Member of Parliament does not know this. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ARTE: On a point of order  Mr Speaker, Sir. The hon. Assistant Minister said that there are two vehicles stationed at two different health centres, and he was only asked which these two vehicles are and which health centres they are stationed at. This is what he should tell us. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the registration numbers of these two vehicles are GK G582, a Land-Rover, and GK H132, also a Land-Rover. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Assistant Minister to mislead this House when we know very well that vehicle No. GK 580 is stationed at Modogashe Health Centre? For his information, the other health centre in question is Masaiani, which has no vehicle. Is the. Assistant Minister in order to mislead the House? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, vehicle No.GK G582 was received and attached to Masalani Health Centre./Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NUNO: On a. point of oilier, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Arising from the Assistant Minister's reply, we know that there is no such vehicle at Masalani Health Centre. So, he is misleading the House.

Minister satisfied that the current staff establishment is enough? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to inform the hon.Member that immediately we have upgraded a facility to the status of a health centre, we know the number of staff by category. We have now found it necessary to add one more clinical officer in Tot Health Centre in July this year and not earlier. After all, we go by the number of patients visiting the institution. </Newspeech>(Hon. Kipkorir stood up)<Newspeech> MR. KIPKORIR: What is it, hon. Kipkorir? Are you on a point of order, a supplementary question or do you want to make a statement? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am on a point, of order. Even if the Ministry will send an additional clinical officer to. Tot Health Centre in July, who is performing the duties of the retired subordinate staff at the moment? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR.

MWAMZANDI asked the Minister for Agriculture what tangible steps he has taken to implement his undertaking to asist sugar-cane farmers in Kwale District as contained in his Ministerial Statement delivered on 2nd November, 1989. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. SPEAKER: I am sorry but Minister for Agriculture has asked that this Question be deferred. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Since hon. Kones, who is an Assistant Minister for Agriculture, is here, why should the Question be deferred? Why can he not answer it right now. </Newspeech><Newspeech> AN HON. MEMBER: The other one is also in. They are all here. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech> MR. MVAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Since the two	Assistant Ministers for Agriculture are here  and the two of them are equivalent to one full Minister why can they not reply to this Question? Is there some sabotage of some sort? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. SPEAKER: Oh no, Mr.Mwamzandii You are conversant with our system and you know that two Assistant^Ministers cannot make one Minister. It is not provided for in our Constitution. Nevertheless, the Minister requested that this Question be deferred until sometimes next week.MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. such behaviour from the Assistant Ministers cannot be tolerated. At least, it would have been better for one of them to stand up and say that he does not have the reply or say that the Question will be responded to by the Minister himself, rather than tokeep quiet when the Question is asked. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech> MR. SPEAKER: The Minister himself telephoned me. and requested that the Question be. deferred until next week. Next Question, </Newspeech>	Question No. 101<Newspeech> MR. BIDU asked the Minister for Public Works when the forty five workers of the Resealing Unit at Tiwi and Lunga Lunga will be paid their field allowances dating back to 1st October, 1987. </Newspeech><Newspeech> THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Mibei): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I begto reply.My Ministry has paid the forty five workers of the re-sealing unit in question their field allowance entitlement for all the period that they worked at Tiwi and Lunga Lunga. These officers were not entitled to any allowances between 1st October, 1987, .and July, 1988, because they were based at their normal station at Maungu. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, either the Minister has been misled by his officers in the field or he has not done his homework. Right now when talking here, I have a letter from those forty five people claiming that they have not been paid their allwances since 1987. I do not know whether the Minister is satis-fied with the reply he has given.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the permanent station for Coast Provincial Re-sealing Unit is at Maungu. The unit was patching the Maungu-Mazeras road A109 from October, 1987 to July, 1988, ahead of Firoze Construction Company Ltd. which was resealing the road. The unit was, by then, stationed at Maungu, which is their station. Therefore, the officers were not entitled to any allowances. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR.BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir is it possible that the forty five people who were working in this unit could come from the. same village and hence the non¬payment of allowances? </Newspeech>.<Newspeech> MR. MIBEIE: Mr.Speaker,  Sir, whenever these workers remained. in their usual station,they were not entitled to any field allowance. MR. SPEAKER: Next Question I , </Newspeech>Question No.149Completion of Kikuu River Bridge<Newspeech> MR. KYONDA asked the Minister for Public works what has delayed the completion of the bridge on Kikuu River on the road between Makueni  Kilili and Matiliku. </Newspeech><Newspeech> TEE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Mibei): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply oThe delay in the completion of the bridge on Kikuu River on the roadbetween Makueni-Kilili and Matiliku, was caused by the breakdown of equipmentwhich led to use of manual labour to backtill the approaches to the bridge andunexpected continuous heavy rain. </Newspeech><Newspeech> Mr. KyONDA: Mr.Speaker, Sir, I had asked a similar Question aboutanother bridge further down this river, and the Minister give me almost a similarreply. He is now saying that the completion of this Bridge has been delayed bythe breakdown of equipment and I am not convinced that that is enough reason.I am saying this because work on this bridge does not require the use of equipmentand all that is now needed is back; tilling which does not entail the use of equipment. This is why I am saying that I am not  with the reasons that the Minister has given for the delay in the completion of this particular bridge. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR.MIBEI: The lodgding of the bridge super structure is in progress and will be completed by may  this year. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KYONDA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is most disheartening when the  ministry under takes a major project like this, and then decides to abandon the project. This bridge passes across a very  big river and at the  moment people  cannot cross the river since is heavily flooded. I understand that part of the bridge has been constructed and to be told to wait until May is not fair Could, the Minister really tell is what is causing the completion of this bridge?If the Minister is not ready to complete this bridge, in fact, the local peoplea can even do the back tilling of the bridge which is what now remains undone. </Newspeech><Newspeech> Mr.Mibet:Mr.Speaker, Sir, as I have said, the backtilling of the of the bridge has to be done manually because the bulldozer which was supposed to be deployed for such work is under  repair. I had the opportunity of visiting the birdge and I would like to assure the hon Member that we shall den all we can to complete work on this bridge. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech> MR.

MISOI: Mr. Speaker,Sir, while thanking the Minister for that reply, could he tell this House how many people are expected to be employed during the reconstruction period of this Road, which is about 36 months. would he further assure this House that they will all come from Uasin Gishu District, particularly ELdoret South? </Newspeech><Newspeech> HON. MEM3ER: oh not not not</Newspeech><Newspeech> MRS. NDETEI: On a point of order, Mr .Speaker, Sir, while I appreciate the sentiments of liny, colleague, Dr. Misoi, is he really in order to suggest that people working on this bridge must all cane from Uasin Gishu District? Can they not come from somewhere else? I think that is absolutely out of order MR. SPEAKER: Let us give the Minister a chance to answer the question. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MIBEI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, at present the contractor is mobilising the plant and equipment as well as constructing the camp for the project and all the employed staff are now busy working and more people will be employed as sore equipment is brought into the project and the road work begins. So, at the moment I am not able to say how many people will be employed</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR.SPEAKER: Shall we now move to Questions by Private Notice. </Newspeech><Header> QUESTIONS BY PRIVATE NOTICE </Header > <Header> Increment on the Haji Allowance  </Header ><Newspeech>  MR. SALAT: Mr.Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Vice-President and Minister for Finance the following Question by Private Notice:- in view of the increased cost of air fare and fees charged by the Saudi government, could the Minister consider increasing" the Eaji allowance from Shs.20,000/- to Shs.30,000/-.</Newspeech><Newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF The Vice president MINISTRY OF finance (Mr. Keah): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Government recognises Haji as a noble religious object. It is on basis of this recognition that Eaji allowances have been reviewed upwards from time to time, the last such review  being on 4th .April, 1989 The airfare is payable in Kenya Shillings and does not form part of the K.Shs.20,000/- which is the allowance available to the pilgrim, in increase in the airfares should therefore not directly influence the increase in the allowance.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government is not aware of an increase in fees  charged by the Saudi Government. However, the Government will continue to review the allowance and appropriate adjustments will be made whenever there is justifi¬cation to do so. In this regard, the Government has decided to increase the  allowance from K.Shs.20,000/- to K.Shs25,000/- for persons going to perform the Eaji this year. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. SALAT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for his very good reply, could he tell this House what protection that is offered by our Government to these prilgrims, particularly because most of them are very old people. "What protection does cur Government offer to these people when they get to Saudi Arabia and back to this country? </Newspeech><Newspeech> Mr.Keah: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the only protection available to these people is the usual ambassadorial protection and I am not in a position to assure this House that any other kind of protection is going to be offered, other than on that basis</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MWenjE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, would the assistant minister consider extending the same allowance to Christians going on pilgrimage to Bethlehem. Although Christiansare given this allowance, it has never been made officially known that Christiansare entiled to this allowance. Could he therefore announce it here today that Christians going to Bethlehem for pilgrimage are also entitled to this allowance? </Newspeech>(laughter)<Newspeech> Mr. KEAH: Mr.Speaker Sir, that has never been an issue But if the hon.Member would like to make it an issue, I would like to inform, him that we do not, make such decisions here.These are Ministerial and administrative decisions in the offices and if he cares to make such a request, the Ministry will duly make the necessary review. </Newspeech><Newspeech> Mr. KAMUYU: Mr.Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for very kindly confirming that they have raised the Haji allowance from KShs.20,000/- to KShs.25,000/- could he review this situation immediately, because the cost of living is constantly, going up? In future he should raise this allowance to KShs.30,000/- from .r. KShs.25,000/-</Newspeech><Newspeech> Mr. KEAH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I started off by saying that this allowance is reviewed upwards periodically For information of the hon. Member, let me give the dates when the previous reviews were carried out so as to confirm to him that this is a periodic exercise. In fact the new allowance which I have just mentioned here takes effect immediately The , reviews have been made as follows :  November, 1975; January, 1979; 26th	May, 1983; 14th June, 1984;22nd May, 1987 and the last one before todays was on4th April, 1989. This record . speaks for itself. </Newspeech><Newspeech> Mr. KUBO: On a point of order, Mr.Speaker, Sir. In the Question it is clearly stated that fees charged by the Saudi Government have gone Up Could the hon. Questioner tell us where, he got that information? This is because if what the hon Questioner says here is true, then it means that the increase the Assistant Minister has talked about is not going to help at all. </Newspeech><Newspeech> Mr. SPEAKER: What is your point of order? </Newspeech><Newspeech> ME. KUBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, my point of order is that I want the hon. Questioner to explain to,the House or substantiate asto where he got the information to the effect that the feescharged by the Saudi Government have gone up. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MS. SALAT: Mr. Speaker, Sir,.the fees charged by the Saudi Government amount to about . US$240 ;per person You cannot get a visa to go on pilgrimage to Mecca before you pay thatamount in U.S. Dollars The Saudi Government has not been charging this fee before. So this is a new fee and that is the reason why I said that fees charged by the Saudi Government have gone up. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. SPEAKER: Let us move on to Mr. Kariithi's Question. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. SALAT: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir Allow me to ask an additional supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir This allowance of KShs.20,000/- was being given to the pilgrims to enable them to go and	perform Haji. However, since this is areligious and very noble objective, some people might want to visit the Holy City of Mecca maybe twice or thrice in their lifetime So, would the Assistant Minister considers allowing people who are alsoreturning to go and perform Haji once or twice, to draw simi¬lar allowances? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KEAH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure that the hon. Member is aware that we share our limited foreign exchange reserves amongst all our very many needs. I hope that he appreciates this fact and also accept the fact that whereas going to Mecca to performHaji is a noble religious objective, this must cue in with other national needs that we have We are constrained by foreign exchange aspects and I trust that my honourable colleague will acceptthis as a reality. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Kariithi's question. </Newspeech>Control of Game in Mt. Kenya Forest<Newspeech> MR. KARIITHI: Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Ministerfor Tourism and Wildlife the following Question by Private Notice.Since elephants and other wild animals have become a great menace to wananchi living along Mt.Kenya Forest boundary with? Kixinyaga District and realising the fact that farmers are no longer being compensated for their crops destroyed by wild animals, could the Minister, among other measures, construct an electric fence along this boundary in an effort to protect farmers crops?THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILDLIFE (Mr. Gakunju) Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.In an effort to proct farmers crops my Ministry is currently drawing up plans to ultimately erect some 2,800 kilometres of fencing in the sensitive areas of the Republic parts of Mt. Kenya boundary with Kirinyaga, as and when funds become available.</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR.KARIITHI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the AssistantMinister aware that, elephants are now destroying a lot of crops and making wananchi even fear going out at night? For along time the Game Department officials used to come and scare the elephants away. For the time being these incidents ofelephants coming out of the forest have been reported to the Game Department but nobody cares to come and scare away the Animals Could the Assistant Minister, please, tell us whether they are going to scare the elephants and make the wananchi a little bit happier because we have a fearful situation now? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. GAKUNJU: Mr. speaker, Sir, we are aware of thisparticular problem and that is precisely why we are making thesearrangements to put up the electric fence In the meantime gamerangers are assisting farmers to protect their crops and livestock within the limits of available resources They are doingso by patrolling those areas </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KyoONDA: Mr. Speaker Sir, the Assistant Minister is non-availability talking about the	of funds when in fact we are dealing with a serious matter lives of our people are in danger TheAssistant Minister's statement does not sound reasonable Could hetell the House what practical and urgent steps the Ministry is takingto save the farmers? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. GAKUNJU: Mr.Speaker, Sir, for the information of honMembers, at current rates, the cost of erecting  electric fencing averages KShs100,000/- per kilometre Also 37 kilometres of fencing along the Aberdares National Park is already nearing completion and will be extended farther over a total of 220 kilometres After the completion of this one we will move on to the next stage, and as I said earlier the funds are limited. So, the Ministry is already working on the fencing</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister has not replied to this Question. He has just talked about the Government's master plan, to erect electric fencing in the Republic He should be specific he should tell us whether there are any plans to fence the area mentioned by the hon.Questioner in this Question If he has no answerhe should say so. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. GAKUNJu: Mr.Speaker, Sir, I did not speak of a masterplan. I spoke of specific jobs that we are already doing. The peopleon the ground, the administrators,make decisions as we go on. So we are working in the Aberdares and Shimba Hills areas and we we will move on to Mt. Kenya area when funds become available. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. Kamuyu: On a point of order, Mr.Speaker, Sir. TheAssistant minister has still not answered this Question. This is because hon. Kariithi asked a specific Question regarding the: boundary between Mt. Kenya Forest and Kirinyaga District But you will find that the 	Assistant Minister proceeded to brief the Houseabout the 2,800 kilometres. of fencing they are going to  erect in various parts of the Republic and this is what hon Kiliku referred to as Government's master plan? But the Question is not interested in kind of thing at the moment Can the Assistant Minister make aneffort to answer this Question? He should tell us what he has doneabout Kirinyaga. </Newspeech>   <Newspeech>  MR. GAKUNJU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, had explained in the main reply that we have already  started fencing some forest areas. We have not yet started fencing the Mt. Kenya area, but after completing the working that we are doing right now, that matter will shal1 be looked into. I did not say that we have already started fencing that areas, but in the meantime, the game rangers are patrolling Kirinyaga area in order to protect farmers, their crops and livestock. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KARIITHI: Mr. Speaker, -Sir, I live along Mt.Kenyatask, boundary, and the amount that is being done is colossal. Theelephants have also become very brave. We used to bang debesand other things to scare them but today, even if we bang those debes	they do not move. Therefore, I am requesting the Assistant Ministerto send some game rangers immediately so that at least one or two elephants can be killed, and then thes± others can be scared and get out of the area. That is what used to be done in the past. Today those elephants cannot move away;they just continue eating crops. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. GAKUNJU: Mr. Speaker, Sir,we shall not kill those elephants. because it is illegal to do that, but we shall make sure that  we send more game rangers that area in order to carry out intensive controls. </Newspeech><Newspeech> DR. MISOI: Sir,in view of the fact that the Kenya Wildlife Servicesis trying to solicit funds from international organisations and donors could the  Assistant Minister confirm to this House that once those funds are obtained, they  will be used not only for anti-poachingpurposes, but also for fencing the forest areas, so that the farmers can be protected from the animals we should confine the animals in the natural habitats. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GAKUNJU: Sir, with due respect that is a different question and I shall give a proper answer when the hon Member will raise a specific Question on that matter. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR.MWENJE: Since the Assistant Minister has told us thatfencing of that area will be done when funds become available Could he now tell us when he anticipates the funds to be available what steps are they, taking to get those funds so that they can start that project because it is of urgent importance? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GAKUNJU: Sir,when this House approves  those funds then we shall start  that area fencing We have already started fencing some parts of the forest areas 37 kilometres of fencing is being done around the  a berdarex forests already. There are other areas in the country where fencing work is still going. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker,Sir. I asked the Assistant Minister to tell us when those funds shall be made available. He has told us that they shall available after  our approval we all know that will be done in June, 1990. Could he. therefore,  tell us that the funds will be available in June, 1990? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GAKUNJU: Sir, I cannot confirm that those funds will be approved in June, 1990, </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>Mr. SPEAKER: Next Question, Mr. P.K. Kinyanjui.Fate of Master Kamau's Ksns.30,000/- Deposit</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Attorney-General the following Question by Private Notice;What is the fate of Kshs.30,000/- deposited with ;Alliance Building Society by Master Patrick Kamau (minor) Account No. 01-13-00034, on 1st April, 1986?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli):  Mr. Speaker Sir, just before I reply, permit, me to refer to some most unkind remarks which were made yesterday by some hon Members on hon. Ogle, whenhe was answering this same Question on my behalf. Those remarkswere most unfortunate In fact somebody suggested that  have been	 shunning issues without giving a specific instance where I had done so before I did not take that commentvery kindly.Secondly,hon. Makhanu quoted a legal notice</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WAMEYo: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Mr. P.K. Kinyanjui has asked the Attorney-General Question, but what we are hearing right now from him is not the answer to that Question. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had asked for permission to make some remarks, and in any case, hon. Dr. Wameyo would have waited to hear whether I was only making some foundation for answering that Question.Sir, hon. Makhanu, refer to gazette notice, but he should have seen and read clearly the temporary transfer  of duties and functions are not </Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. With due respect to the Attorney-General, the Question by hon. P.K. Kinyanjui is Question No. 3 by Private Notice. I am sure that the Attorney-General is. very conversant with the Standing Orders. I am sure that he knows that if he. has got any statements to make as- an Attorney-General, he knows the time when he should make them It is now Question time therefore, can henow answer that Question,and then he can deal with the other matter later. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, you gave me permission to air those sentiments. Sir, that answer that was given yesterday by my friend hon. Ogle was the correct answer, but if the hon. Questioner wants me to repeat it, I will do so. If hon. P.K. Kinyanjui  wants to ask any supplementary Questions, he can do so  But perhaps to recollects I think I better repeats the answer, Mr. Speaker, Sir.Sir, I now beg to reply. I cannot tell you the fate of the said Kshs.30,000/- deposited on 1st April, 1986 with Alliance Building Society, by Master Patrick Kamau. as my office is not responsible for the day to day management of the building society. I confirm that the society is not yet under receivership and all enquiries a relating to the deposits with the society should be referred, to the head office of the building society.Sir,. I am  however, aware that the building society isilliquid and may not, at the moment be able to pay its depositors.The depositors may wish to take action to obtain judgement upon whichthey could force the building society to be wound up. Mr. Speaker, Sir, short of that, I cannot see any reason why that answer was, not satisfactory. I would like perhaps to ask Mr. Kinyanjui, through you, Sir, to put whatever questions he wants.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like to thank the Attorney-General for turning up in person to answer this Question. Secondly, the Attorney-General in his written reply said that he could not tell the fate of the KSh. 30,000/- In his second paragraph he goes on to tell us that he knows that the Building Society is "illiquid" which means that the KSh.30,000/- cannot be paid to the boy I cannot understand that kind of argument,since we have come here to seek theadvice of the Attorney-General, as. the custodian of the laws of Kenya so that when we see a mwananchi being robbed of his money, we should go to him That is why this Question was brought here. Can he tell us which specific law protects deposits of this nature? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MULI: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am sure hon. KabibKinyanjui has never understood me even when I was his prefect inAlliance High School a long time ago, but I would like to</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.K. KHTYAJUI: On a point of information, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I agree we were at Alliance: High School, together. He was one year ahead of me, but he was never my prefect (applause) </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. MULI: Thank you for partial admission of his allegation Now, a building society, is not like a financial institution or a bank. A building society is a society of, members who deposit money in that society. Just take knowledge of a company which naturally is a good example. When I register a company in my name, I do not go to look after the day-to-day running of the company because the board of directors do run their own companies. Similarly, a building society has its own directors who do run the day-to-day business of the building society itself. All that I require from it or from them is the returns which they do at theend of the year, but that does not show the liquidity of a building society or otherwise. So, it is impossible for me to say whether the ESh.30,000/- which was deposited by this youngster is still perhaps deposited in another investment by the same building society or whether it has been-squandered by the directors. What I can say is that I did at some stage have some of these directors prosecuted and fined a lot of money for wrongful management of a society.Now, the law for the protection of a building society lies.in the hands of the directors or investors or depositors. Ifthe depositors are not satisfied with the way the company is running or the way the building society is going, that is the only time whenlaw says that you can rise up and put the directors to task byway of winding up, or even calling for accounts. But the Attorney-General cannot do any more than to supervise the overall, operations"but not the day-to-day running of the company or society.Just for the information of hon. Kabibi Kinyanjui, when thefinancial, institutions behaved in a rather unethical manner abouttwo or three years ago, laws were passed so that they are nowsupervised "by the Central Bank of Kenya. So, if any financialinstitution is  getting out of hand or "illiquid", the Central Bankof Kenya comes to intervene. At the moment, that law has not beenextended to building societies.Sir. Speaker, Sir,  with those remarks, I hope my friend, hon. Kabibi Kinyanjui, will see it fit that a depository, like the minor he is talking about should move the court by way of suing to get judgement which will be the basis- for forcing  the assets of the company to be attached, sold, and the premiums or money is paid prorata to the depositor I am afraid, Mr. Speaker, I cannot help hon. Kabibi Kinyanjui. any further. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I very much appreciate the explanation given by the Attorney-General. Gould he answer one simple question? Here is a young person who is in need of this money in order to pay for his school fees. Is there any way - under the law - to enable the Attorney-General to intervene in .order to assist the young person? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MULE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Attorney-General has various powers to intervene, and that is his day-to-day affairs in his office. I think what we need to know here is whether the building society in question is able to pay the deposits,and the answer is negative. Now, how do we go about it? There are two ways of. deal¬ing with it. It is either to call for its winding up by the depositors themselves, or petition the Registrar of Building Societies who is myself to see whether we can also wind it up and follow any assets of the building society in question. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR, KIOMBUDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, here is a young person or a minor in the eyes of the law who finds himself in a "fix". Can the Attorney-General, as a friend of the court, not move the court on behalf of the minor to get this problem solved? If it is a question of winding up the society, the Attorney-General can do it on behalf of the minor. </Newspeech>(applause)<Newspeech>MR. MULI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the minor or anyone petitions me, I will perhaps try to find means and ways of going to court, but at the moment, there is no direct way I can go to. court because I am a member of that fateful society. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. KUBU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the problems the Attorney-General is having because of the law, on the other hand, it is the duty  to advise the Government and the country,  as a whole, on how to help's these unfortunate people. He is the custodian of the law and I know that the law can be amended if he initiates the move to make sure that peoplelike these ones are protected So, can he agree with me that heshould initiate at least, an amendment bill of Parliament whereby we can amend the Building Societies Act so that all the building., societies are answerable to him or to the public, as a whole because anybody can come up and form a building society and swindle wananchi a lot of money, if the law is left the way it is today.? . Can the Attorney-General help this country by amending that particular law so that these building societies can be brought to book where they go wrong? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MULI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think that is a positive request andhon. Kubo is quite right that the law is not static which is the reasonwhy we keep on plugging the existing loopholes. We will look into that. Letme also mention that there is no difficulty in advising the Government becausemy office has done, a lot towards that aspect and  in fact, hon. Members arewitnesses  efforts in retrieving money from the falling financial institutionsBy doing that we managed to retrieve a lot of money that would have gone haywireand paid it to the depositors. Building societies are in a differentcategory  altogether and we are looking into the Act that governs them to see how best to control, these institutions from getting away with the depositors money- In this case as I have already said, I have prosecuted the directors of that company and ordered them to pay shs.17,000.00 each for the offences of mismanagement. So we are not sleeping as my learned friend hon. Kubo would have us believe. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, perhaps the Attorney-General will agree with the House that we were not being  unfair to hon. Ogle because the explanation he has now given to the House is the one we wanted yesterday. </Newspeech>(applause)<Newspeech>MR. MULI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, with all due respect I must thank hon. Ogle for answering the Question very well. Although he is not a learned lawyerI must agree that he did marvellously but emotions more or less got out of hand and in the process lost the seed in the shack so to speak. I may not getanother opportunity but let me say that I will leave the House in the goodhands of ray brother and colleague, Mr. Timothy Mibei, for 10 days while Iwill be away on official duties in New Zealand. </Newspeech>(applause)Payment of Death Gratuities to Mr. Kinuya's Widow<Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Labour the following Question by Private Notice:-Why did the Provincial Labour Officer, Mombasa fail to pay asum of Ksh.29,000/— to the widow of the late Mr. George Kinuya, after hereceived this money from the late Mr. Kinuya's employers, Highway Carriers Ltd. 	of P.O. Box 81339, Mombasa? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): Mr. Speaker, Sir I beg toreply.The Provincial Labour Officer, Mombasa has. been unable to pay the Ksh.29,000/— to the widow of the late Mr. Kinuya, unfortunately, because the money was the subject of theft and the Labour Officer cannot, therefore pay the money at the moment. The matter at the moment is</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR .MAKHANU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir Are hon. Members in order to kneel on the benches when the Minister is answering? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I knelt at all, that was because one of our ushers brought in a note which I had to take and there was no other way for me to take it. Unfortunately the "DC" did not: see that and (laughter) </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): Mr. Speaker, Sir for that reason, the Labour Officer could not pay the money to the dependants of the late Kinuya. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, a cheque NO.HC5373 was paid on 25th November, 1987 by the employer of the deceased and deposited with the Provincial Labour Officer, Mombasa. I do not know why the cheque has not been paid over to the dependants of the deceased. Could the Minister explain? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, owing to the noise in the House, I did not get the question, but I have clearly stated that the money was received but, unfortunately was subject of a theft. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: The money was subject of a theft by whom? How could the cheque be stolen when it was a crossed cheque? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO Mr. Speaker, Sir, perhaps the hon. Member should listen as I explain again. The Provincial Labour Officer, Mombasa, is unable to pay the money to the widow of Mr. Kinuya because the money that was deposited with the Labour Officer was stolen from his office. So at the moment the Labour Officer does not have the money to pay her. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if this money was deposited, couldthe Minister tell us where it was deposited, in a bank account or was it justentrusted to somebody to keep in: the office? If it was deposited in a bank account, who authorised the withdrawal of that money? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, thieves are very organised people. The matter was reported to the police who carried out an investigation and as a result there is a criminal case No. 341/413 of 88 pending in court. So since this is a matter that is sub judice I cannot comment on it in case it prejudices the court proceedings. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI:Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the Minister says that the matter is still in court,. I. would like, to inform him that.it is not the widow who is being charged in court. While the case is still going on the widow will continue to suffer. Could the Minister, since he was the. custodian of the money that was stolen, get some other money to pay the widow while the Ministry tries to recover the money from the criminal if found guilty? What would happen if this suspect is found innocent? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKNODO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not at liberty to give an answer to that because the matter, as I have said, is still pending in court. So I would like to request the Chair to protect, me on that because there is. no way I can. comment an it without prejudicing the court proceedings. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. K'OMBUDO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is a wonder that the Minister has wilfully chosen to mislead the House. The criminal aspect of the case is sub judice. I agree with that totally. But the civil aspect of it is that the payment to the widow is not sub judice because I cannot see the Ministry defending the fact that the money was due to the widow. The money was in a Government account and the fact that it was stolen by some Government Officer, as far as the widow is concerned, is highly irrelevant. Could the Minister issue a cheque to the widow while allowing the criminal case to go on and on. </Newspeech>(laughter)	<Newspeech>Mr. OKOUEDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, Nyakach Constituency is very much like Bunyala where we have water, all over the place. I need to be careful here because the actions we take could affect the proceedings in court.. we need a fair amount  of legal guidance in this matter, the know that the matter is in court and the payment or acceptance that this was so, might be used in court as evidence either way He better wait until the case is finalised before sorting out this matter</Newspeech>.<Newspeech>MR. KUBO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Six As my learned friend hon. K'Ombuao said earlier on, the money was paid to the Provincial Labour Officer and put in a suspense account. It was, therefore, not at large at the time it waa stolen. Since this money was paid to the Government and accounted for and entered into the suspense account, could the Minister assure this House that this widow is going to be paid because it was there? It is irrelevant whether it was stolen or not. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Sir, I accept the fact that the hon. Member from thesouthern  part of Taveta is a lawyer, and is fully acquainted with courtproceedings. I did not at any time say that the cheque was banked; I only saidthat the money was received by the Provincial Labour Officer who was unable to pay the widow because it was stolen. This is the situation at the moment and I am not in a position to state more than that without entering into an area which might interfere with court proceedings. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. Ndetei: Mr. Speaker, Sir although accept the Minister reply, he wasquick enough to acknowledge the. fact that this money was stolen. As hon.K'Ombudo said, the question as of stealing is not the concern of this particular lady This lady was not supposed to be paid the exact currency notes that were received from her husband's employer. We know a lot of money is handled bylabour officers in every station with regard to this kind of compensation.Can the Minister go ahead and pay this widow and later recover the stolen money from the culprit or write it off as a bad debt? This is because the Minister hasaccepted that the money got lost in the hands of his own officers. Alternatively, can the Minister pay this widow using his salary because she is suffering? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.OKONDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, unless the hon. Members are prepared to conduct a Harambee and pay this widow until we have sorted the issue out, then I would like to say that at .the moment it would be a bit inopportune to tell the House what I know may not possibly work out. I can only .tell the House what I know would be possible. At the moment, I am not sure that any action like that would not be prejudicial to the proceedings in khz court in this particular matter For now, I would like to reiterate the fact the money was stolen and that is why the labour officer not been able to pay but we will do whatever we can to alleviate the situation. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order! I appreciate the concern being raised by the hon. Members. Mr. Okondo, I am sure hon. Members cannot understand the connection between this money which was stolen either between the office of. the Highway Carriers Limited or the Provincial Labour Officer. Since the money was handed over to a Government officer, then the responsibility lies with the Ministry</Newspeech>.(applause)<Newspeech>Mr. OKONDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question, of where the money was stolen is part of the case. It is believed by some parties that it was received by a Government office, having got lost on the way before reaching us or it was lost between our office and the bank.  is a question of this discussion and debate in court until the judge makes a decision. We do not know, as of now. what happened. That is why I am saying that any action either way could prejudice a decision on that particular aspect. </Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS:  On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Okondo, the question here is: Was this money received by your officer or not? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Speaker,Sir, I have said that we have not established that and that is part of the argument in court. We do not know whether it was lost between the company and my Office or between my office and the can We  have not yet established that and we are still looking into it. It is part of the criminal proceedings pending in court. If I say that we will or will not pay that will definitely have, a bearing on the evidence that is going to be given. We do not know yet where the money was stolen. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. we have been telling the Minister that there is a high rate of corruption in his office and he has now confirmed that. The Minister should note the fact that the. money  which was stolen did not the belong to deceased but the Ministry. This is because once the money is deposited with" the Ministry it becomes the property of the Ministry. The Minister is now trying to cover up the corruption that is going on in his office (applause)The widow in question has been suffering and her children have been expelled from school due to lack of school fees while the Minister is holding that money. This money was deposited with the Ministry on 25th November, 1987 HON. MEMBERS: Is that so? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: yes Could the Minister tell us when that a money was stolen? Was it stolen after it was deposited or before, say, 24th November, 1987? Tell us the truth and do not cover up corruption. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr.OKONDO: Mr.Speaker, Sir, things are not always clearcut in circumstances This is one of those unfortunate casesin which there are a lot of fussy areas and edges because whenthings were happening nobody knew about them  As a matter of fact,it looks as if the  stealing was an organised affair that had been continuing for a long time. By the time we realised it, atotal of Shs. 380,000/- had been stolen. We still do not know whether this stealing was confined to only the Ministry staff or whether it also involved other people outside the Ministry and that is why the  police are still investigating the matter I would like these investigations to continue so that we can get a clear indication as" to who was doing what in the syndicate that resulted in the theft-of-not-only this Shs.29,000/- but also the theft of a total of Shs.380,227.50. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MS. K'OMBUDO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir I think I will quote hon. Okondo correctly and hope that he will not take on the pressmen. Now, the Minister, hon. Okondo, is telling us that, the matter is still under investigation. So far as I know any matter that is still under investigation is never sub judice. We would, therefore, like to know who has been charged. </Newspeech><Newspeech> Mr. OKONDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is true that you canhave somebody in court and still continue to investigate relevantaspects of the case it does not necessarily follow that onceyou have put the matter in court you stop investigations into itAs I have said earlier, the matter is now in court as criminalcase No. 341/413/88. A number of people have been charged, includingthe cashier in the Ministry However, we have not exhausted thelist of people who may be charged we might have more peoplecharged with the offence. That is we are still looking into the matter in order to know who else was involved in this kind of racket. </Newspeech>(Several hon. Members rose on a point of order)<Newspeech>Mr. SPEAKER: . Order I think we should allow the hon.Minister to continue looking for ways and means of having this widow paid.I am sure that is the best way,out because the whole thing is beinglooked into So, let  us move to the next Question. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KELIBU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. TheMinister did not respond to my supplementary question: I said this money deposited on 24th November, 1987 I wanted to know when the theft of  money that the Minister is talking about took placed May be it is not the money I am talking about that was stolen." </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.SPEAKER: Mr. Kiliku, let us allow the hon Minister to continue looking ^a very satisfactory reply. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MXHDKA-OWTTOR: On a point of order, Mr.Speaker, Sir. I think you have given the Minister indefinite time It would helpfar him to be given an indication as to when he is going to report back.to the House, because he has been unable to answer any of the basicquestions Hon. K'Ombudo has asked him who to tell us the name of the person has been charged, buthe does not even know that. He should give us the names of thepeople who have been changed</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, what the hon Member hassaid is not true. I said very clearly that the cashier, has been	charged, and other people may still be charged along with him Sincewe do not know how many people were involved, for the time beingwe have charged the cashier. I think we should continue with theinvestigations until we get all those who were involved. If thehon Member wanted to know this, the theft was discovered in April, 1988and since then we have been trying to find the whole lot. </Newspeech>(Several hon. Members  rose on a point of order)<Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order! Let us allow the hon. Minister to look for the facts and report back as soon as he is ready to do that. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr.OKONDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I perfectly agree  to report back to the House as soon as I have, got full information on the matter, i am actively working on the it and the police are keeping me informed I am also going to talk to my labour officers and everybody else concerned with the matter and report back to the House, as soon as it is possible to do so.- </Newspeech>(Several hon. Members rose a point of order)<Newspeech>Mr. SPEAKER; Order I am not going to allow any more discussion on this matterReasons for Closure of, Kenya Cashew nuts Factory</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MWAMZANDI: Mr. Speaker  Sir I beg to  ask  the Minister for Supplies and Marketing the following. Question by Private Noticed	(a) What reasons led to the closure of Kenya Cashew nutsfactory Limited in kilifi District? (b) Why have the farmers sold cashew nuts to this company last season not been a paid</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr..Mudavadi ) :  Mr. Speaker, Sir I beg to reply(a) The Kenya Cashewnuts Factory in Kilifi District  had to be closed down as a result of gross mismanagement which has led the company to be indebted to the tune Shs.90 million, an amount which the company cannot afford to pay at this time when it is faced with serious financial difficulties.(b) Because of liquidity problems, some of. the farmers who sold their cashew nuts to the company have not been paid. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. MWAMZAEDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, what action has the Minister taken to ensure that this company is revived, the people who sold they cashew nuts are paid and the workers are reinstated? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. MUDAVADI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure the hon. Member that the Government has taken the closure of >this factory very seriously Consultations are going on and also  positive steps are being taken towards the reviving of this particular factory. Of course, I would also like to point out that one of the issues that led to  the  factory's financial problems was over establishment. This issue will also be addressed during the reviving process</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in his reply, the Minister said that the expenditure incurred by the company was not in accordance with the budget, and added that the extension of the office block cost Shs.9,077,407/. Could he tell this House why the management made provision to extend an office block at the cost of Shs. 9,077,407/= at the expense of the operation of the factory? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUDAVADI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue that the hon. Member has raised is one of the many aspects which, when all are put together, amounted to the mismanagement of that. particular factory. The cost of that extension was not a part of the budgeted amount of money and this, among many other factors, is one of the reasons that led to the collapse of the factory. When the factory is being revived, all the aspects relating to mismanagement will be addressed. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIRUKA-OWUOR: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Could the Minister let us know who the owners of this cashew nut factory were and their shares? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUDAVADI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the shareholders of the Kenya Cashew nuts Factory Ltd. in Kilifi, are the National Cereals and Produce Board, Kilifi Co-operative Union, the Industrial Development Bank and the Industrial and Commercial Development: Corporation. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.KDZAI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the Minister tell the House how many permanet and casual workers there were in the factory? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUDAVADI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in total, there were 2,039 workers, out of which 62 were a part of the management personnel while 1.990 constituted the unionisable staff. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Kenya Cashew nuts Factory Ltd., in Kilifi, is one of the biggest companies in Coast Province, which employed very many people and benefited local farmers. In his reply, the Minister said that one of the reasons why this company is in problems is that there is no proper marketing policy of the finished products. Could he comment on this aspect and tell us why the Government has not taken action to find a market for cashew nuts? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUDAVADI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I agree with the hon. Member thatone of the reasons that led to the closure of the factory was poor marketing, policy. The issue is not a problem with markets as markets are available. However, if the marketing policy is not well organised and if the people handling it are perhaps not well equipped and aggressive enough, definitely this is an aspect of poor marketing. This is one of the factors we are talking about. When you talk of mismanagement, this is a cross-section of a number of factors; you  will be talking about financial mismanagement; administrative mismanagement, marketing mismanagement, and so on. So, all these problems were compounded and they led to the closure of the factory. I must say that this is one of those sad cases of greed and lack of patriotism that -led to this situation. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this factory entirely depends on the cashew nuts grown in Coast Province. If these cashew nuts are not sent to the factory, they find their way to foreign countries in a dubious manner. How can our factory operate without the necessary raw. materials, which the Ministry allows to go outside the country in dubious ways? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUDAVADI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure the hon. Member that the Government has made very substantial steps towards sealing any Ioopholes that were used in smuggling cashew nuts out of the country without getting them processed, and the Government does not allow cashewnuts to go outside the country at will as was implied in the question. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, would the Minister confirm to the House that when this factory becomes operational again, no other person will be licensed .to export cashew nuts except through the factory?

On Tuesday. I did promise that today, after Question. Time, ;I would issue a Ministerial Statement on the measures being taken by Kenya Airways, in total consultation with the Government, to trim down the number of workers in our national airline I wish to thank you, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to issue the promised statement on the decision to restructure Kenya Airways, the national flag carrier.Mr. Speaker, Sir, Kenya Airways .was incorporated in 1977 as a private company under the Companies Act of the laws of Kenya. The reason for the creation of the Kenya Airways as the independent and separate national airline was the need to provide air transport service at the dissolution of the East African Airways. The dissolution of the East African Airways was a sudden act as was the foundation of the Kenya Airways As a result of this Kenya Airways was not established and organised in an orderly fashion, enabling the airline to prepare a detailed plan for organising itself gradually within the frame of a long-term development plan. </Newspeech>19.4.90.<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (ctd.):The staff, though unprepared; immediately embarked on the day-to-day running of a reduced airline. The new airline took over from the dissolved East African Airways 1,976 people and bought a substantial part of its assets for cash by the assistance of the Kenya Government. As shown, Kenya Airways inherited very large numbers of staff, most of whom were in the unskilled and semi-professional  cadre, hence the great heed over the years to strengthen staff. Attempts were made to recruit staff mainly to supplement the performance in key areas of finance, engineering and also in other professional side's.In this connection, Sir,  would like to House to note that the airline, at the time it took off in 1977 had only four African qualified captains. Today we have 100 captains all Kenyans, hired and trained within 13 years of Kenya Air¬ways' existence as compared to the four African pilots Kenya Airways took over from the former East African Airways. In other key areas the development has been  the same. However, in certain areas, attempts to increase manpower have in¬creased the numbers without necessarily increasing productivity significantly.Consequently, the present number of the airline staff of 4,000 by farexceeds the maximum number of the work force needed to enable the airline carry out profitable business Kenya Airways is therefore, overstaffed. For instance, Kenya Airways employes 4,000 staff and generates KShs.3.7 billion in a year. Air Mauritius, generating about the same revenue, employs 1,500 staff. Ethiopian Airline employs 3,300 staff and has 22 aircraft, and makes an equivalent of KShs.4.8 billion, which is 30 per cent of the revenue generated by Kenya Airways. The burden of the excess staff cost the airline about KShs.200 million a year. This amount alone can finance 30 per cent of the total Kenya Airways lean, interest and principal expenses in each particular year.In this regard, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is worth noting that this large workforce translates itself directly into increased overheads in terms of costs, hence the need to cut it back to an economically viable size. This is the inevitable andnecessary corrective action, though unpopular and unwelcome, must be taken meticulously to stem disastrous negative cash flows and the imminent collapse ofthe national airline.Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me underscore the point that we want and are working towards, a national airline which is a productive national asset. It should posses the aspirations to serve the nation and be able' to chart its path to viability in a harsh highly competitive business environment. This requires a high degree of understanding and co-operation from all the interested parties. Of the employees, we require maximum discipline, efficiency, efficacy and productivity.	Improvements in the effectiveness of Kenya Airways human resources must  be the key strategic priority for development. With this in mind, it has been found necessary for the airline to take whatever actions are currently possible to improve the use of. its human resources through effective planning and manage¬ment. The management, identified 15 senior managers whose performance has been consistently below, the expected standard and sent them on indefinite compulsory  leave. Mr. Speaker, Sir other members of staff have been appointed to act on thosepositions and if they do not make the grade, they will similarly be replacedwith innovative managers. Similar measures would be taken down the line inphases in order to get rid of inefficient and unproductive  members ofstaff, as the Airline prepares itself to meet the challenges of 1992 whenliberalisation of the aviation industry, comes into effect in Europe.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that what this liberalisationreally means  and it has the support of most of the international airlines -is that the big airlines of Europe America and the rest of the world, willhe free to be flying to any part of the world without following the existingInternational Air Travel Association regulations Therefore, a snail airlinelike the Kenya Airways will collapse unless it is efficient and productive tobe able to compete with international airlines.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Board of Directors of Kenya Airways and, indeed,the Ministry, recognise the gravity of laying off staff and is aware of thedifficulties that the affected individual staff members are bound to face. Imust say here that the alternative is the total collapse of the national airlinewhich in turn will mean all the employees of the airline going home Hon. Memberwill agree with me that this is something that this nation cannot afford to putup with Laying off staff is a very painful exercise, but it is a much lesser evilthan the collapsing of the whole airline Needless to say, Sir, in the long run,a profitable airline will create more jobs directly and contribute more tonational development than, an over established airline Which is making losses.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the decision therefore to lay off staff, will he denein stages, and a fair play will be exercised, throughout The number of staff tobe laid  off will be "based on the performance, devotion and productivity ofeach individual? The Ministry, together with the national airline and the labour unions are in constant touch so that fairness is done inthe laying off staff.Finally Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I state here quite categorically, that it is not 2,000 people who axe going to be laid off. There are about 450members of staff who are porters and discussions are currently going on betweenthe Ministry and the Office of the President to transfer these porters to theDepartment of Aerodromes. Secondly, 273 of the members of staff are over 50 years 3 old and therefore they will be given opportunity to retire voluntarily. Therefore, the exercise to trim down the staff of the Kenya Airways is not punitive and is based, on facts and the exercise is aimed at improving the produc¬tivity of our national airline Thank you, Mr. Speaker. </Newspeech><Header>  MINISTERIAL STATEMENT </Header ><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILLDLIFE(Mr. Ngala): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to make a short Ministerial Statement in connexion with the Editorial comment in The Standard of 18th April, 1990 headed, "The "blow of Kenya's Tourism".Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no doubt that Tourism is a very competitive business Indeed, the Government has recognised this fact and has taken steps to ensure that the standards of hotels,transportation and other tourist amenities are  kept to the highest standard possible These efforts have been extended to the provision of improved infrastructures, including. roads and airports. It is therefore not true that Kenya is out-pricing itself from the tourist market Kenya is still reasonably priced, long-hauled destination and it should be understock that the prices charged to. tourists in countries like the Canary Islands, Spain, Greece the bahamas and so on, cannot be compared to those prices charged to tourists in Kenya for several reasons. Firstly, the close proximity of thesedestinations to the countries where the tourists originate, make the air ticketalone to be cheap. Secondly, the tourist product offered, which is. basicallybeach holiday, cannot be compared to Kenya's safari holiday, which involves landtransportation and high quality accommodation in the game re serve So Incidentally,the cost of Kenya's beach holiday, compares very favourably with those of the tourist  destinations I have mentioned When the cost of air ticket is not put together. The Ministry's policy is to improve the quality of services and attract high-paying tourists, particularly for the safari holiday. It would not be in the interest of this country to aim at receiving, one million tourists without caring for the ready revenue that those tourists Would bring to this country. In the end, it would make a better economic sense to have a reasonable number of tourists who bring in higher revenue than large numbers of tourists who may bring less revenue In any case, one million tourists is not an ambitious figure and it will be accomplished as we continue to sake the necessary arrangements The key factor,±s however , is that we have already received in 1989  700,000 tourists. So, the number of one million tourists, is not very ambitious The key factor, therefore, should not he the number but the quality of services so  that we can strive to maintain high standards of services, generally available in the high-quality tourism There, is no doubt that there axe a number of short-comings at our " airports and these short-comings are very well known to the authorities concerned, and the Government is in the process of rectifying them. Thank you, Mr. Speaker </Newspeech><Header> MINISTER STATEMENT </Header ><Newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION(Mr. Karauri): On a point of order,Mr. Speaker, Sir last week, hon. Kirwa demanded a Ministerial Statement fromthe Minister for Education to explain why the University admission forA level students this year was raised from ten points to 12 points. The hon.Member also sought to know the grades of the $ 8-4-4 candidates that willbe considered for P1 and P2 teacher training and so on Consequently, I would like, Sir, to make the following Ministerial Statement. Mr. Speaker, Sir, admissions, to our national, universities  Moi University, Kenyatta University, University of Nairobi, Egerton University and Jomo Kenyatta University College of Agriculture and Technology  are done by Joint Admission Boards of the universities. The Board first receives applications from candidates through, their heads of schools indicating their choices of courses and also universities; On receiving examination results, from the Kenya National Examinations Council, the Board prepares merit listsof the candidates. These merit lists are done on candidates first, choices For example all candidates choosing medicine as their first choice would be listed under "Medicine" and those with education as their first . choice would be listed under "Education"and so on The candidates second, third and fourth choices would  also be indicated.Mr. Speaker, Sir, indicated on the merit lists are also course requirements and whether a particular candidate meets those course requirements For example, a course may require principal passes in KSCE. in Biology and Chemistry and subsidiary passes in KSCE or Credit passes in KCE in Physics; A candidate who may have excellent grades in the main"A" Level subjects but fails to satisfy the condition regarding the subsidiary subjects will not be deemed to have satisfied the course requirements and this would be shown on the merit list In other words he would not be selected for that course However, if the candidate is above the cut-off mark determined after taking into consideration, staffing and physical facilities,he would be considered for BA general or Bsc general-degrees Come to the admissions exercise, the Joint Add missions  Board considers individual candidates merits; the capacity in the halls of residence, classrooms, laboratories, workshops, studios and so on Courses like Medicine, Pharmacy, Engineering or Science demand so many hours of practical in laboratories, workshops or theatres and as such the number  of students to be admitted is limited by the specialised facilities required.Mr.Speaker, Sir, staffing is a limitation even forcourses not requiring specialised physical facilities, A lecturer can effectively teach only a limited number of students  With over-large" groups and without close interaction with students, through tutorials, seminars and practical, the effectiveness of lecturers suffers and the students do not get quality education^ It was to ensure that our universities continue to provide of a reasonable quality that the decision was taken to admit as many students as the capacity in halls of residence, classrooms and  laboratories in our publicuniversities can accommodate and the number that our university lecturers can cope withMr.Speaker, Sir, I hasten to observe that the cut-off mark . for science-based courses has remained what it was last year; that is seven points. I also acknowledge that Arts students with 10 and 11.  points are well qualified for University educational But we have also to reckon with, the staffing of our universities and the capacity of the physical facilities available, if the quality of education provided is not to suffer. When the universities admit 16,000 students for both KACE and ECSE, the., facilities and staff will be stressed to the maximum The students graduating from our universities this year are only 8,000 and the universities are going to admit 16,000 students this year. Mr.Speaker, Sir, concerning the question of8-4-4 candidates,they will be considered for training as PI teachers if they have a minimum of D+ average in KCSE. Diploma courses will require C and C+ average for. consideration For the "A" Level . candidates the situation will remain the same as "before;   one: principal, and some subsidiaries for science students and two principals for Arts students? P2 training, as in the past, will only be. for those  districts without enough condidates with KCSE passes at the required. level for PI training With time and with the supply of enough candidates with KCSE passes at the right levels from those districts, training of P2 teachers will be phased out gradually. Thank you, Mr Speaker" Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. K.OMBUDO: On a point of order, Mr.Speaker, Sir I rise to seek the guidance of the Chair  Therefore, with the permission of the Chair and that of ay colleagues, I propose to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent national importance, and that is the menace of floods This matter, is sufficiently important nationally and with the	permission of the Chair and with thesupport of hon.Members, I hope I  will be allowed to move this Motiony .under Standing Order No.20." </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

K'ombudo? </Newspeech><Newspeech>	Mr.K'OMBUDO:Mr.Speaker, Sir, I propose to move theadjournment of the House under Standing Order No.20 for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent national importance and that is the menace of floods. so, with your permission, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and with the support of my colleagues, I would like to move this Motion.MR.SPEAKER: Okay I accept the problem the people of Nyanza are now facing That problem is a definite matter of urgent national importance’s So, if you are able to get enough support, I have no objection? </Newspeech>(Hon.Members stood up in their places)<Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Okays. Be seated hcn. Members I think you have enough support, hon.mr.ombudo. So, I will allow you to move the Motion at 5.30 pm The discussion will run from 5.30 to 6 .30 pm</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.Kiliku: On a point of  order, Mr.Speaker, Sir I am rising on a point of order in connexion with the MinisterialStatement which has been delivered by the Minister for Transport and Communications .Through reliable sources, the Kenya  Airways is currently recruiting more staff and I want the Minister to deny or confirm that At the same time they are saying that they are going to reduce their establishment by half If we allow the Kenya Airways to proceed with the. so-called structural adjustment policy they areapplying If we allow the Kenya Airways to go ahead with the move,then the other State corporations will do the same. Ithink it is the aim and intention of the Government to create more job opportunities because the population of job-seekers is increasing. Mr . Speaker, Sir, the. Minister said that the criteria to  be used is devotion to work. That is out of the question because Kenya Airways employees are devoted to duty. That is why the air line  has been in existence The Minister cannot show any	prooftoday to the effect that workers have been disciplinedbecause of inefficiency. <Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: What is your question, Mr. Kiliku? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am on, a point of order,I am not asking, a question. Sir, the people who will be affected come from all over the country, and we are all here to serve people.Sir, the Kenya Airways should not use the so called structuraladjustment should apply other areas. Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on. Tuesdays afternoon, the Minister for Planning and National Development assured this House that the  establishment of a single market  in  Western Europe in 1992, will not affect any  industry our, country.. Therefore, I do not know why the Minister for Transport and Communications has quoted, the establishment of a single market in Western Europe in 199and associating it with the  structural adjustment being under taken buy the Kenya Airways. That	ruled out on Tuesday afternoon.I know that the Minister for Transport and Communications  waselected by the people Could he therefore, he kind enough and stop,.those structural adjustment from being effected because they are going to employees. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Kiliku, the Minister has heard yourpoint of order which has already been raised can we now on to orderrequest Next Order! </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: On a point of order, Mr.Speaker, Sir. I havegot two point of orders that I would like to raise. The first pointof order is related to what a hon. Kiliku has just said.Sir, it is so important that I would like to move a motion on that issue </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, my other point of order is that the Minister for Public Works, promised this House that he would start repairing Outering Road by 1st April, 1990. To date they have not yet started repairing ± it, and accidents are still taking place there it is now 20days since the Minister promised us that work would be started. Her also promised to make statement on that project, but he  has not done so  far. Sir, can we know what is hindering the commencing of that project? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Archbishop Ondiek) Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to reply to that point of orderSir, warning signs have "already been installed along Outering Road, some are at Umoja junction, Kariobangi, near the Catholic	Church and at the junction of Mumias Road justafter the railway bridge. Sir, arrangements are in hand ,to install rumble strips and bumps, and the repair work shall start from tomorrow, 20th April, 1990. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: On. a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir I raise on a point of order concerning what hon. Karauri said on the university intake. Sir, I hope that you will allow me time to clarify the issue such, that it can be  understood in the light of my concern. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Hon. Kirwa, you are not supposed to make statements! </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: I am not making a statement I am just trying to clarify that matter. It is clearly  shown in the HANSARD that I did request the Ministry of Education to tell the House how many students got 11 and 10 points in their A level examinations, and they shall not be admitted into our universities this affects students who were taking art subjects  but the assistant minister not say anything on that issue. Also in my statement, I asked what the Ministry is doing  about these students, so that then can  be admitted in other alternative educational institutions, locally or abroad. Those were the silent  objectives of my point of order which I had  raised last week. The Ministry decided fortunately or unfortunately to ignore the  entire issue.Finally, Sir, I am not sensationalizing that issue, but it is a very burning issue, in the sense that there are two groups who want to enter the university. One group was under the new 8-4-4- system of education, and the other was under the old system of education. The Ministry had said that the lowest admission  grade under the 8-4-4- system of education would be a B but now it has been reduced to  The A level students shall feel disadvantage than  the 8-4-4 students. That is a very serious issue which the Ministry should clarify, in the House. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): Sir, the art students who had 11 and 10 point were 3,200  they could not be admitted  our universities. Sir, the Ministryis not favouring the 8-4-4 candidates against at the expense of the A candidates Right now  our universities have admitted 7,500 candidates . from the A levels whereas last year, the universities had admitted7,300 candidates, Therefore there is even an increase in the intake this year. But I gave a reason why -our universities cannot admit all the candidates. I also assured the House that any science candidate with seven points shall be admitted into our universities  as it has always been in the past. I also said that anybody who did not qualify to join the  universities ishalljoin other colleges. There are some other openings for themsuch as diploma colleges, universities abroad and other educational •institutions. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU:On point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Sir, this matter concerning the Kenya Airways is very important.I Thought that the Minister for Transport and Communications could be courageous enough to conform to this House whether the Kenya Airways is recruiting people while at the same time sacking others. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Kiliku, can you draft a Motion on that issue, and  then I will look at it.Can we move on to the next order?(Second Reading)The Engineers Registration (Amendment) Bill(Minister for Public Works on 12.4.90)(Resumption of Debate interrupted on 12.4.90) </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION (Mr. Munyi): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would  like to  continue with my contributions on The Engineers Registration (Amendment Bill.Sir, when I was talking last time, I mentioned  very clearly that the Ministry of Public Works has got very many vehicles and machineries. The Minister for Public Works who is also the acting Attorney General today, is a very dynamic person. He is aware that his ministry has got very many vehicles and machineries like caterpillars. Sir, the Ministry has also employed very many engineers. Sir,  recently our beloved President  asked Kenyans to  to try and manufacture their own vehicle, and as a result a Kenyanmanufactured vehicle was assembled have  The Ministry  has gotsome modern workshops  which  machineries which are known	as lathe. which used to manufacture spare parts I do not know why the Ministry has not been making use of thosemachineries to make some spare parts which are needed in the agricultural field and other industries there are other machineries which have not been functioning, but with the use of the modern facilities that the Eavernment and various parastatals have, I am sure many spare parts can be made in those workshops Mr. Speaker, Sir. we have very many engineers.  For instance we have engineers working with the Kenya Airways Corporation. With combination of engineers from the Government, I am sure they can do a lot because this has happened in other advanced countries of Europe, Asia and so on. For instance, it has also happened in Japan, Sweden, Canada, United States of America and so on. I want to give an example of some engineering lecturers at Egerton University. What happened is that there were some machinery lying idle at Egerton University which could not be used. But thelecturers there advised the University authorities on how to make use of those existing machinery, like old vehicles and so on. The oldvehicles have been reconditioned so that they can be used forpractical. They are being used in a very good manner.I can also remember the good work which has been done byKEMRI (Kenya Medical Research Institute) and our Minister forResearch, Science and Technology, Mr. Muhoho, is here and is awareof it. He toured KEMRI and he is aware of KEMRI having discoveredKemron, the important drug. Kemron is a combination of the goodwork done by the engineers and other experts. Therefore Kemron was a combination of the good work of our experts in KenyaMr. Speaker, Sir, I want also to give another example. Someyears back I. went to Ibadaa University, Nigeria, and I  was takenround the Engineering Department. I found a machine which had	been made  there  When I looked at it, I found that it was a. goodmachine that could be used in our youth polytechnics I spoke tothe VICE-CHANCELLOR or lbaden University and requested him to get me one of those machines. He agreed and I brought one here. This machinery is just used for, crushing maize instead of using hands. It is a very simple machinery. When I brought this machinery here, I took it to Karurumo Youth Polytechnic in Embu. At the present,Karurumo Youth Polytechnic has produced en masse those machines We have trainees in this polytechnic from Kitui Machakos, and so on. So, when these trainees went hack to their areas, they also produced the same type of machinery in their areas,and. at the moment this machinery is being used all over the country. Next time the Minister for Research,. Science and Technology comes to Embu, I will take him to Karurumo Youth Polytechnic to see the work which is being done there This is something that was just copied from lbadan University, Nigeria.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to tell the Minister that in Japan we have the Honda motorcycles. Now, when Japanese who invented the Honda motorcycle was studying in the United States of America he took a honda engine with him to Japan. He used the same engine - using his own formular or idea - to manufacture: several "other things At present  you hear not only of Honda machinery, Honda cars, Honda shaves, but also so many other things. This was started by some body who got an old motorcycle engine from the United-States of America.	Another example is that we have pineapples in Thika which were imported from the United States of America. Somebody went to the United States of America and brought the. pineapple here.As a result, he introduced pineapple products in Kenya. Now, today, if you go to that pineapple factory in Thika where pineapples are being produced and processed, you. will find that there are engineers. Even the majority of the machinery that are being used for irrigation are just reconditioned there. Therefore, we would like our young people to be more motivated on the side of engineering so that they can invent more things.Sir. Speaker left the ChairThe Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kagwima) took the ChairAnother good example is that of Patrick Njiru, the young man who finished the Safari Rally this year. Mr. Patrick Njiru went to Japan to train as a motor vehicle mechanic and, as a result of that, you can see what he has done  We would like to have morepeople with that kind of motivation to  I fully parti¬cipated in getting Mr. Patrick Njiru a scholarship in 1977 to goto study as a motor-vehicle mechanic in Japan. We have very many Kenyans with this knowledge. So, we should follow what His Excellency 	from outsidethe President has been teaching us that nobody will come from out side to buildKenya  For instance, we have a lot of iron ore in Tharaka which has not been exploited because we do not have Kenyan geologists to do that. Therefore, I would like to request the Minister for Environment and Natural Resources to bring a Bill here so that we can register indigenous Kenyan geologists. For our information, at Independence, we did not have African geologists. We had only expatriates, and this is a big challenge to us. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION (Mr. Mwinyi) (ctd.):So this is therefore a challenge to engineers who as we know are bright people capable of bringing about many inventions. In fact as I have already, said this is one of the ways of fighting unemployment. Since there are- very, many machines in our factories which lack spare-parts our engineers can start producing spare-partswhich we can use to repair these machines. This is the way Japan did it. Therewas a time when they used the body of a sunk ship to produce steel because theydid not have any at that time From those humble beginnings the Japanese are nowthe leaders in car production, ship building and all forms of machinery. Thereis even in Japan from Hiroshima to Nagasaki an under the ocean channel thatmeasures 120 kilometres. This channel even beats the English Channel which measures only 20 kilometres. Why can our engineers also come in such. inventions? I hope to talk more about this when we shall be discussing, ways of increasing employmentopportunities in. the country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if you went to. Turkana you willfind some special backets woven there which, are of high demand, to the tourists who insist on buying baskets that come from Turkana. These baskets cost around shs.50.00 in Lodwar and between shs.800.00 and shs-1,000.00 around Limuru. Such weavers are "traditional engineers" We also have such traditional engineers in Samburu, Baringo, Kwale and Kilifi. These traditional engineers design localthings which are of the same standard as the designs that the industrial engineerscome up So when we are talking of industrial engineers we should also pay someattention our "traditional engineers". In fact, some of these local "traditional engineers" sometimes design things which perplex even the industrial engineers. There was even a guitar which I saw yesterday being played by a certain choir that was made in Luoland. This was a complex traditional guitar which was made by a local "traditional engineer". "So to repeal our "traditional engineers" also need some consideration.This being a straightforward Bill I would like to appeal to the Minister to send his  engineers to the districts and provinces to assess all. Governmentvehicles and machinery that is lying idle for lack of spare-parts. Afterthat he can set up a unit within his Ministry to find ways and means of manufacturingspare-parts for these vehicles and machinery.  If our engineers can invent a Kenyancar why can they not start producing spare parts for these vehicles? It would be joyous for us to hear that an engineer has invented a spare part for. a caterpillarthat has been lying idle in Nyanza or Embu.So, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, since I had talked a lot last week, I would like to support this bill I am sure that in combination with the views that I have expressed and those that have been expressed by the other hon. Members a solution will be found for the many problems that have tended to hinder our engineers. I would also like to take this opportunity to wish the dynamic Minister for Public Works success in- whatever he intends, to do after the Bill is passed. With those few remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Lijodi): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy  Speaker, Sir. Since I feel that the Engineers Registration (Amendment) Bill has been exhaustively discussed would  like to call upon the mover to a reply. </Newspeech>(Question, that the mover be now called upon to reply put and agreed to)	<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Archbishop Ondiek): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. I acknowledge with thanks the support expressed by,hon Members for this timely amendment proposed in the Engineers Registration Act. I wish to comment on some of the issues raised as follows:-The aim of the principle Act passed by this House soon after Independence was to regulate the activities and conduct of engineers and to ensure that those in practice complied with the academic and experience cadre. The Engineers Registration Board was established and given this responsibility to those who met the standards as registered accordingly and their names published annuallyin the Kenya Gazette for the information of the public under the current provision in the Act. Graduate engineers are those who meet the academic criteria only and registered engineers are those who have proven experience in addition to the academic achievements. As mentioned by the hon. Member, there is no seven year rule for graduate engineers to  automatically become registered engineers. A graduate engineer must certify the Board that he has obtained such experience since graduation so as to be allowed to practice as a registered engineer.In most cases, the graduate engineer must first past rigorous professional interviews to be registered as an engineer The interviews include presentation of engineering documents oral interview and written examination. A code of ethics for engineers has been formulated and published by the Board on the basis of which professional misconduct may be judged Registered engineers can-be charged under the law of negligence ofnon compliance with known engineering standards. in the same manner as other professionals. I shall comment on this point further later on.It has been mentioned that consumers of engineering services should be  represented in the Engineers Registration Board because if three hyenas were to judge a sheep, they can only rule that it should be eaten. Hon. Members are assured that consumers are represented in the Board which consist of four members chosen by the Minister for Public Works. Three members are also selected by the Institute of Engineers of Kenya and approved by the Minister The four members who are chosen by the Minister are from Government technical Ministries and paranatal organisations. who are the biggest consumers of the engineering services.Hon. Members have noted the increase in the fine under the proposed amendment. These fines refer only to deliberate misrepresentation of levels of professional competence with regard to registration. Anyone who holds him¬self out in any way as engineer not accordingly registered under this Act, is guilty of an offence for misuse of the title "engineer."Several cases of this nature are already being looked into by theEngineers Registration Board and the Attorney-General for prosecution. Further fines of misconduct may still be preferred under the other laws of this country. For example, corruption may be considered under the criminal law and sub¬standard specification of the basis of professional negligence. This, in fact, forces big consulting firms to take up heavy professional indemnity insurance.Potholes on our roads have s been noted as possibly reflecting un¬satisfactory engineering performance standards. The constrain of available resources is also relevant to the standards which roads can be built. Thedemand for roads in our country remains very high because roads steerdevelopment and if very high standards are adopted, initial investment costs become higher and the Government may not be able to built as many roads as are needed.Once built, our roads receive a rapid  increase in both the numberof vehicles and weight and, therefore, higher maintenance requirements must be accepted. Thika-Makutano Road has been mentioned as a case in point. It was constructed nearly 40 years ago in the colonial era to the engineering standards of the day when the mayi mim load was eight tons. After so many years of traffic loading, it now drains substantial portions of our maintenance. resources.Tenders were opened recently to repair and resurface it and construct a dual carriageway on separate alignments the tenders are being evaluated and work is expected to start between June and July this year on site.One hon. Member suggested that geologists be involved in road design. This is already done and we have a fully resourced Roads and Materials Branch staff with all the necessary expertise including geologists who are responsible for road pavement design.The Engineering Registration Act, as it is today, deals only with degree holders. with the advent of the 3-4-4 system of education, the amendmentbefore the House seeks to extend the higher national diploma holders so that the can, in addition, be accorded their appropriate recognition in the engineering profession. Hon. Members may be aware that artisans and  craftsmen areexamined and graded through the Ministry of Labour. This coverage was agreed uponwith the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology and the Directorate ofPersonnel Management The Ministry of Public Works is prepared to offer consultative professional services as may be requested on all  levelsincluding the. jua kali sector.Clarification was requested by one hon. Member on the intendedamendment. The , intention of Section IC Clause 3 of the amendment is toaccord recognition of achievement of only the required academic standards.	The a Act covers all recognized engineering disciplines,such as, mining engineering asrequested by the hon. Member mining engineers are few and to be precise,they are only three registered engineers.Hon. Members suggested that foreign consulting firms should "beused when it is absolutely necessary and that support should be given to the local firms. Potential firms should be assessed in terms of capability, competence and honesty. This is precisely the intention of the Government before the House. Consulting firms can only be assessed if their staff carry  the work for the firm. Their staff are  assessed first and registered proportionally. This will not only enable the Board to  assess the capability of foreign firms by starting with their employees but will also accord local engineers capable of offering appropriate legal recognition to practice on their on.A point has been raised on fees payable to consultants MR.

K'OMBUDO: Mr  Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move that the House do now adjourn. we know that now we are in the rainy season and it seems the usual ritual of if loads that occurs every year  is already with us, particularly in Nyanza and Tana River.	First of all I would like to thank the  Government for the immediate remedial measures that the Provincial Administration has taken to evacuate the affected people to higher grounds housing them in places like schools and so on. I also, on behalf of my people, appreciate the fact that some foodstuffs like maize, beans and so on have been given to the affected people.At the same time it must be realised that welcome as these measures are, they do not constitute a permanent solution to the flood menace Right now three quarters of, Wasare Sub-location of Nyakach is flooded In West Nyakach, the Sango Rota area is flooded In fact, this area is the worst hit? if you fly over this area you will see  euphobia plants that have been forming fences of wananchi homes protruding out of water many houses in this area are submerged in water. Three quarters of Gem Rail sub-location is also under water Crops and livestock have been destroyed and, worst of all, people have died Last  SATURDAY I attended a funeral of a Mrs. Banyala who had been washed away by the Asao River whileattempting to go and weed her gardensMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, yesterday I a drew theattention of the House to the fact that at Uyakwiri, which is near SangoRota, Mr. plus ombewa died in the floods I  also drew the attentionof the House to the fact  Gchieng Abuok was founding floating in AwachRiver. These are facts and I am not exaggerating anything.Now, something must be done to solve once and for all theflood menace. I wish to propose to the Government to taken the followingmeasures; first  a desalting machine  should be rushed to Nyakach, Nyandoand Nyatike to help control the situation. This is a good machinehave seen it working  It will remove mud from the river and canoperate even in a swampy area Considering that peoples lives arevaluable, I am pleading with the Government to take this machine tothese places as a matter of emergency.secondly I would like the Government to construct man-madedams on the Nyando, Euche, Tana, Awach and Asao Rivers. in order tocontrol the flow of. water. This water can, of course, also be usedlater during- periods of draught for irrigationThirdly, I would like the Government to builds walls on bothsides of the rivers at the point where they approach the dams andwhere usually the silting takes place These walls should be builtusing our resources, namely stones, sand and cement. We havecement at Bamburi, the stones at Nyakach and the water and sand inin these same rivers and we have ample manpower. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if these measures are	taken they will alleviate the flood menace once and for all This willalso enable Kenya to produce more food because this water can be used for irrigation  I know that a Government minister will stand up and.say that there is no money for this project However I must point out that this is an emergency situation. we have,  therefore, todivert money from other undertakings in order to rescue the peopleaffected by the floods. I know that we. have money because ourGovernment is not broke It can even borrow money from  the money marketsTherefore in the name of rescuing the people for whom the Governmentexists  ours is a Government of the people by the people for the people the Government should borrow money now for rescuing the people in affected areas like Nyakach, Earachuonyo, Nyakwiri and Okadei, where as I said earlier, the verocious Kuche River is now playing havoc on the Nyayo people. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to give as much time as possible to hon Members to give ideas on how to solve this problem once and for all. Do not let me hear that there is no money because I have amply explained that we have the Kenya Central Bank here, and we have money wizards, one of them being hon. Prof. Saitoti, who can create money. Banks are known for creating money, sometimes by, advancing credit. They simply tell,you "You can now overdraw on your account." The great banker, hon. Ndong is here,.and he can advise us on this.It was a shame, if I may say so, that a Government Minister, hon. Midika, was stuck in the floods. You read this in The Standard, and it is as if God wanted to prove that the question of floods is not just mere talk, but that it is as true as you have seen. Floods do not choose whether you a Minister or an ordinary mananchi Here was a Minister stuck in the floods. </Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON.

K'OMBUDO: Yes even the Government vehicle got stuck in the floods.Let us help the situation, because this Government is ours both the Front Bench and the Back Bench; it does not belong to the Front Banch alone. So, the Front Bench should support this Motion 101 per cent. We are swimming in the same boat as you saw in the picture in The Standard.With these few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move and, this being a national matter, call upon hon. Nassir, who comes from the Coast, to second the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING. (Mr. Nassir): Bw. Naibu Spika.wa.

Watu wote. wa vijiji kama tisa au 10 vya mawaki-lisho yangu wamekwishahama kutoka ng'ambo raoja ya mto hadi ngambo ya pili. Wale wote waliokuwa ngambo .ya upande raashariki wamehamia ngambo ya magharibi. Mwisho wa kuhama ulikuwa :jana, na ingawa mpaka leo hakuna mtu ye yote aliyekufa, mifugo imekosa nalisho na raiti mingi, kama vile miembe na migomba, imeng'olewa na kubebwa na maji. Kwa hakika, hasara ile wameipata watu- wa Tana River ni kubwa sana. Ikiwa ni lazima watu wahame au wafe wakati huu' wa Ramadhan, hili ni jambo muhirau sana, na Serikali inahitaji kufikiria kile itakachofanya ili kuyazuia mafuriko kama hay a.Kuhusu mafuriko yanayotokea kule Tana River, nimekwisnamwona Waziri anayehusika na barabara, na sote pamoja na watu wangu ninaowawakilisha hapa tuna shukrani kubwa sana kwa Serikali yetu tukufu kwa kutujengea daraja.raoja la kisasa juu ya Mto Tana. Daraja hili limejengwa na Chinese Road and Bridge Constructors. Kutoka kwenye daraja hili kwenda juu, karibu umbali wa kilometa 15, barabara imeinuliwa lakini hakuna culverts chini yake za kupitisna maji. Wakati Mto Tana unafurika huko upande wa kaskazini, maji huteremka na yakifika kwenye daraja hili yanaanzaarudi nyuma na kuingia vijijini. Hapo ndipo hasara kubwa hutokea. Kwa hivyo, ninamdokezea Waziri kwamba tungetaka culverts zivekwe mahali hapo ili maji yaweze kupata njia. ya kupita kuelekea Bahari ya Hindi. Silanga.pia zinafaa kujengwa kando kando y.a mto huu ili maji yatakayoingia humo yawafaidi wanyama wa porini na mifugo. yetu.

Kwa hivyo, ninatoa mwito kwa Serikaili tukufu itusaidie sisi watu wa Tana River na maharagwe, mahindi na hata maziwa ya unga. Hata hivyo, tuna maziwa mengi sana wakati huu na kwa kweli hatuhitaji msaada wa maziwa.

I represent an area where we have a lot of problems with floods, and I entirely agree with hon. K'Ombudo's suggestion that this House dis¬cusses the menace.Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, my appeal to hon. Members is that this is a very important issue which involves the lives of bur people. We know that our Government is solely concerned with the lives and welfare of its people, and I believe, that the Minister concerned, in conjunction with the Government, is going to take the necessary .steps to arrest the flooding menace in South Nyanza District and other parts of the country.Sir, in Ugenya. Constituency, Sifuyo Sub-location, we do net have river problems; we have, dam problems We would, like to see. these  properly built so that when it rains-rain water is drained away from people's homes I have seen many homes being washed away by floods,  and it: becomes even more embarrassing when my own. home is almost swept away and my people come to ask me what steps I am taking to solve the problem. I am glad that hon. Midika the Minister, in charge of these affairs, comes from Nyando area which faces the problem of flooding.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,  I do recall that the Lake Basin Development Authority was set up on order to deal with such problems as flooding, and I am appealing that the Lake Basin Development Authority, instead of dealing with dairy cattle" breeding and poultry keeping  things that can be dealt with by-individuals  should be more serious and more concerned about arresting the flooding Maybe, the problem the Lake Basin Development Authority is facing is that of adequate allocation of funds, and I appeal to the Government to allocate - the Authority more money so that it can tackle this flooding problem so that wananchi. can live safely.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sure that areas such as Kano, Nyando, Nyakach, Sifuyo Sub-location, Bunyala. and Usonga will not no crops during this particular year, and I do not know what steps the Government is going to take to alleviate the situation.  We would be very grateful if the Government could>take emergency steps to rescue these most unfortunate wananchi who are suffering at the moment. It is quite unhealthy, for a person to live with water covering five feet of his house.  This is not something we are just talking about for the  sake of speaking; we need some action to be taken. I believe that our Government, which is concerned about the welfare of its people, will take the necessary steps to resuce the wananchi who are having flooding problems.According to the report appearing in The Standard nespaper today, a most honourable Minister was stranded in water. That was not fair for him. We believe that the matter is natural, but we would like to our hon. Ministers from the embarrassment of getting stranded in water. Indeed, as far as security is concerned, getting stranded in water at night can be very risky. A Minister can drown and be swept, into Lake Victoria thereby bringing another tragedy in Nyanza Province I appeal that action be taken to save wananchi. in areas such as Sifuyo  Sub-location. Sedogo Dam should be reconstructed such that the water does not drain into people's houses.	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir, our wananchi support and believe in the Government of Kenya. When they bring  this matter up, they are not complain¬ing but raising the master with their leaders so that they can inform the. authorities concerned of their plight.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I supportthe Motion. </Newspeeech><Newspeeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Hon.

The issue of floods has been brought to this house quite often and I remember vividly thatlast year, we had the same problem and we debated it in this House. At thattime, the Minister of State, Office of the President, hon. Nabwera, assured thishouse that Government was going to take positive action and that our respective district development committees should make the necessary recommendations to the Ministry concerned Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would however like to express in¬gratitude to the Government for assisting the flood victims, both in Kisusu and Tana River. Last year, I remember that Government used helicopters to pick flood victims who were surrounded by floods. The issue to giving emergency relief food and tents will never solve the solution of floods in Kenya Mr. Temporary Deputy. Speaker, Sir, I suggest that the Government should, set up a special fund to he used in controlling floods right from the catchment areas. This is because when the flood waters get to the lowlands, it causes a lot of havoc  it destroys, homes, schools and livestock So, we should build water reservoirs all along the rivers starting right from the catchment areas. This water can be used for other purposes. We can use this water for irrigation as. well as for livestock and domestic purposes. The District Development Committee have very limited financial resources I am sure thatD.D.C.s have made recommendations to the Office of the President assuggested last year but the D.D.C.s do not have the resources to combat floods I therefore call upon the Government to make use ox the expertise of the Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority and other agencies to control floods I am sure we will eventually find a solution to 	floodsWith those few remarks, I support the Motion. </Newspeeech><Newspeeech>MR. JALANG.'O: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this valuable opportunity to contribute, to this very important Motion  As we debate this Motion here, hundreds of  families have been displaced as a result of the roaring rivers in Nyanza Tana River floods are also displacing peopled The very firs feasibility study on how to control the floods of River Nyando was done in 19471 We are. in 1990 but you will find that year in year Out, Hyando and Nyakach people are still being displaced, resulting in not only death but destruction of property. Floods are caused when rivers overflow their banks I can mention five major areas which are affected by floods The Nyando River is affecting very badly KysndoConstituency; Kuja River is affecting Nyatike Constituency badly; Miriu River is affecting Karachuonyo and Ndhiwa Constituencies. Yala River is affecting Busia and Siaya Districts and Tana River isaffecting Tana River Districts So, we are talking about a problemwhich, is affecting the entire nation and not just Kyanza Province alone, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, I believe that is why the House accepted unanimously that this is a matter of nationalimportance Therefore, it should be debated upon. Sir,since 1947,why have been debating this issue in this House, yearin, year out, Sir. Sir, rivers in other countries are so importantthat people are praying and asking god to give them an extra river Kenyais blessed with very  many rivers which run throughout the year.They are not seasonal rivers.Sir,  I would like to suggest a few points to the concerned Ministry. i would like to  divide those pointsinto three categories immediate measures, shortterm measures and the long term measures. I believe that thereare emergency funds in the Office of the President which caterfor these type of calamities. Sir, finally I would like to suggest that the  Office of the President should release least kshslmillion to every constituency in the affected areas for the assistant displaced persons. It is not. easy for a family which has been living comfortably be  moved into a primary  school leaving  their goats, sheep and cows dying in thefloods. Sir, floods cause untold damages Water borne diseases haveincreased in those areas. Soon or later we shall hear of increasedcases of malaria, bilhazia and even cholera.Sir, I would like to urge the Office of the President to assist those people immediately. Sir, as concerns the short term measures, I believe that we do not require additional feasibility studies because they are already there, and there is no need of carrying out feasibility studies year in, year out. The Ministry of Regional Development and the Ministry of Water  Development already have done feasibility studies on how to control those situations. I  would like to propose that all development funds of The  Lake.  Basin Development Authority to be channelledto flood controls in Nyando area. Sir, what is the point ofhaving that money if the people are suffering.Sir, this year, I believe that we should put asidesome K£100 million for floods only Some of that money can thenbe spent on the Nyando River,Yala River, Miriu River,nzoia and Kuja Rivers. Sir, I believe that we have to go by priorities.Is it our priority to save lives or continue with experiments.I believe that we have had too many experiments and research work, being done especially by the Lake Basin Development Authority. When shall the recommendations of that research work materialise? When shall we see the implementation of those research papers? and feasibility studies which have been going on since 1947 taking place Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was very much touched when I passed through there recently and saw the suffering of thepeople of Nyakachand Nyanza, in general at this particular time.Kenya, being an agricultural country, these are areas of our country their high agricultural potentials "Taming"' Nyando their alone and controlling that area alone would be able to give this country at least 200 hectares of" arable land. This is land which, if put under rice cultivation, should be able to feed this country and also enough food could be made available for exportation.The country is importing so much rice at the moment, and if we could use areas under floods at this particular time, like Yala, Nyando and so on, we should be able to feed this country.I would like to conclude by urging the relevant Ministry to accept those proposals and implement them immediately. Thank you. </Newspeeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Nassir): As ante sana,  Bw.

AND BROADCASTHTG(Mr. Nassir): Asante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda. Nilikuwanikitoa maoni yangu machache kuhusu ndugu ambao ni wanachama wahalmashauri ya Lake Basin Development Authority.Maji yangeweza kuhifadhika kwa njia ya kutumia mabwawa.DuniazLi tunajua kwamba kuna.watu amba.o-yrapahitaji pamba, mchele,iinga wa ngano ha kadhalika. Kwa hivyo, kama watu wa Lake BasinDevelopment Authority wangeombamikopo kutoka nje jfa kutengenezeamipango ya kunyunyizia mashamba maji ill tuweze kukuza mime a kamamchele, ngano na kadhalika, wangepatiwa pesa nyingi sana. Piawangewe.za. kuwapatiaiwatu wengi kazi nakujipatia faida kubwa sana..Kila mmoj? wetu katika.Kenya ni Serikali. Nashukuru sanakuona kwamha Wacrunge wengi kutoka upande wa Nyanza ni Mawaziri,Mawaziri Vasaidizi na pia wako katika Lake Basin DevelopmentAuthority. Kwa hivyo, nihgewaomba waombe pesa nje za kulimiapamba na kadhalikay ili nasi tujipatie pesa kidogo kidogo Hatamchele, sukari na pia unga wa ngano, tunaleta kutoka nje mpakaleo Ni kwa nini hatuwezi kuomba luikopo ya pesa kutoka nje nakuwa na mipango ya kunyunyuzia mashamba maji ili tuweze kukuzamimea kadhaa na tuweze kurjisaidia. Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ulimwengu huu una taabu sana. kwani kuna watu ambao wanaishi jangwani ambako.wao huyatengeneza maji ya bahari yawe ya kunywa na kunyunyizia mashamba yao. Lakini sisi tuna bahati sana kwani tuna maji ya kutosha. na hata mvua izidipo huwa yanaleta uharibifu. Tunahitajika kutafuta njia za -kuyakinga maji hayo kama vile kwa.taa kutumia mabwawa yasilete uharibifu. Inatupasa tujue  kuwa leo maafa haya yametokea- huko Kisumu^ lakini kesho yatatokea mahali pengine. Juzi juzi kulitokea mitetemeko ya ardhi huko Mombasa na kwa kuwa hatuna ujuzi wowote  wa kuj ikinga na mambo haya watu  wengine wangefariki huko sana.Kwa hivyo, ni wajibu wa.wanasayansi wetu na wale waliosemea soraola economics kuhakikishaikuwa tunatumia-mkopo kunyunyuzia maji mashambani iliwatu hawa wamesaidiwa. Sote tuna wajibu wa kusaidiana. Vakati maafa kama hayayaliyotokea Kisumu yatokeapo ni wajibu wetu kusaidiana kwani. haya ni maafa yanayohusunchi. nzima. Lazima tutafute njia ya kujihepusha na maafa kama haya kwani ninahakikakuwa kunafio pesa nyingi sana za kutuwezesha kujenga mabwawa ambako tunaweza kupanda chakuia kingi kama vip. mpunga, ngano au pamba. Ninaiomba Serikali itafutesulunisho la kudumu ili watu hawa wasiendelee kupata taabu kutokana na mafuriko. Hii ni kwa sababu maafa yaki.tokea katikasehemu moja ya nchi hii huwa pnawahusisha hata wale wa sehemuhyingine za ncbi- hii Tukiyatumia maji viztiri tunaweza kuyatumia kwa kiliuo ambako tunaweza kuviusa vyakula vyetu ng'ambo na kuweza kupata pesa nyingi.Kwa hayo machache naunga mkono. </Newspeeech><Newspeeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR  CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mr. Mak' Anyengo): Thank you very much, sir. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to cont ribute to this Motion. In the first place I must say that the Government must be congratulated for the short-term. efforts that it has  taken to help those people who have been displaced by giving them relief food and other .materials that they needed during this time. However, it is important to look at these matters very critically because it is a matter that has been on-going for many years. It is my opinion that a permanent solution must be found to control these floods which must be considered very seriously. The reason for my saying so is that when the floods come it is not only that the people are displaced but other problems  like diseases occur. As. a result.you will find that the mortality rate rises in the valleys of these flooded rivers. In fact, in some of .these places the mortality rate is as high as 100 peopled per 1,000. The other thing is that the people in these areas are not going .to harvest anything because all there. crops have been washed into the lake. After this you have diseases like cholera, menengitis and so on. We, as the Government, oust think of ways ana means of controlling these floods. How do we control these floods? They come once in a.year and it is important, during the dry season, for us to   acquire funds for  the construction of man-made lakes along these rivers, we should start from the x highlands so that the water can be controlled. This water, can be used far irrigation in the production of more food.I am convinced that if this is done, Hyanza would be the granary, not only of Kenya, but of East and Central Africa. This is because we shall have enough water for  the cultivation of all types of foodstuffs. is Excellency the President did a good thing by creatinine Ministry of Reclamation and Development of Arid, Semi-Arid and a: Wastelands. Plans should be made to pump tkts a water to the northern parts of- Kenya just like we are now pumping oil to the western part of kenya If we.do this, our brothers in those areas who lack water will benefit a lot. For example, they would be able to grow various  types of crops bence we shall kill two birds with one stone.I support any measures taken by the concerned Ministry as far as the controlling of Kaja, Hyando, Yala, Nzoia .and Tana Rivers are concerned.I beg to support. </Newspeeech><Newspeeech>MR. MiRUKA-OWDDR: Thank you, Sir., for giving me this opportunity to make a few remarks on this Motion. First of all, I must congratulated the Mover of this Motion who has ably presented the problems confronting us. I will not repeat what has been.said by the other hon Members.I would like to thank the House because when we are confronted with flood problems, it has  always supported us. In fact, today, I would Aiks to remind the House that this is a very special Motion because it was seconded by two hon. Members, that is, hon. Nassir and hon wakole. I  would also like to take this opportunity to express my gratituteand appreciation to the Government for assisting us.This.is because whenever>we have flood problems, the Government moves fast to rescue the people. Wehighly appreciate this. However, I must record some regret that occasion hasonce again risen in this House for us to talk about floods. In this country,we have been taught by the President to be  mindful of other people's welfare.The core of the floods is in Nyando and Muhoroni. As I speak today,more than half of the homes in my constituency have been devastated by floods.The people of Nyando: and Muhoroni live a in agony and have, been degraded and humiliated.I said that this is a matter for regret because on the 5th of Hay, 1938,I moved a. Motion in this House as a matter of  national importance with regard to floods throughout the Republic of Kenya. sMy Motion was unanimously supported by this House and the Government accepted it and assured us that they were going to take action..Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I regret that we-have to discuss this matter once again. This is not a new problem tc the Government and it is iss true that they know that every year, our people are going to die due to floods. They also know that the millions of shillings they use on the roads, in building hospitals, schools and so are, are going to be washed down and it is surprising that no action is taken, what we are now asking the C-oveaiment ± is to take the ..appropriate action to solve this problem once and for all. The action to be taken is very simple and straightforward. This problem of floods is more feared in some areas than others and the solution tc it is not difficult o This same Government has always  employed measures to clear rivers of weeds and silt, and the chiefs and other administration officers who used to do it are still alive and are ready to help. The wananchi in lyandc know how to clear the rivers and the problem is that they do not have enough naney to do so. The C-ovemment used to advanced money to the administration eveiy year, and with the use of chiefs and other administration officers, they cleared, the mouths of the rivers so that the rater freely flowed into the lake. If this was done, there would be nc more floods in this area.Therefore, Sir, instead of  spending millions of shillings buying food and medicine, Government should advance money to the administration in this area and our people will assist clearing these flsa rivers. TJith regard to the relief food that is sent to the flood victims? I would like to inform the Minister who is present in the House, that this relief food does not reach the people, vihat happens in Nyando is that the people get surrounded by floods and some of them are stranded ten miles away into the flooded area, and all the roads being  washed away and flooded, it becomes impossible tc rescue these people. There¬fore the food and the medicine which Government issues, does not rsach these people, but is brought up to Ahero and given to a few people there  So, it istrue that the majority of the flood victims do not get this relief food and Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Kisuma. District Development Committee has been deliberating on this problem and we have now found cut that the only solution to the problem is to build bridges vhere people are normally surrouiided by floods so that these people can free the flooded areas. This would also assist those taking relief medicine and food to the flood victims. Tie have also recommended that certain roads should be built in order to reach these  endangered areas where people become marooned. If there are no roads to reach these people, there is not way you can rescue them.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, I would like to pass a note of thanksand appreciation for their efforts in televising the flood situation in NyandoI am sure most hon. Members show the agony of my people in this area. So,the principle that our President taught us of being mindful to others, hasreally given us a challenge. How can we say we are mindful about the welfareof others when the Nyando people continue to suffer like this. The nationalTTater asst Pipeline Corporation was formed and we are very grateful about this,but the unfortunate  thing is that they are sitting here in Nairobi i.Titingpapers which will be implemented in ten years time.      We request this Corporation to mcve to the flooded areas and not to continue sitting here in the City of Nairobi where they do not know the problems affecting our people.Mr. Temporary Deputy  Speaker, Sir, as I speak in this House, about JO schools in sy areas have been closed due to these floods. The school buildings have been, washed down and the books have been destroyed and the Government policy of cost sharing is being defeated in ray area. The pecple contributed the little mfmqy they had but every- year, these floods once. fee crops have now been destroyed and I would like to take this oportunity to inform the House and the Government that we are going to "be faced by famine. in this area and mere money will be  used to "buy foodMr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, instead of using this money to buy food for the people, we can spend the money on cost- sharing basis  The people are prepared to offer the labour if the Government gives a little. bit of the money With the rise of dredgers we can clear the rivers and there willbe no floods Already we have a road between Ahero and Kisii which was  built in an area which is prone to floods and it has never been affected We requesting that proper roads be built to reach the people who are marooned so that they can get help from the Government. They need things like food and medicine.You will find that when floods come the people get marooned and they cannot get awayv In the olden days the Government even used to make use of   boats, from Kisumu, to relieve people from Kabonyo and other areas to assist, them to get away from the floods to safe land; But today it is impossible to do that because there fire no boats and the roads are impassibleiWith those remarks, I support the Motion. </Newspeeech><Newspeeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Amayo) : thank you Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity also to support this Motion on floods control My constituency, Karachyiojnyo apparently has not been given muoh publicity during the current flood menace.the flood menace	that is being experienced inmy constituency at the moment is the worst since Independence? So far two sub-locations in my constituency, that is Kobala and Kobuya id East Karachuonyo are under water and at least 1,000 families have been affected; 100 semi-permanent and mud houses have fallen. At the moment there are about 200 families winch are camping in two schools and local churches.' As other hon Members have already said, it is veryunhealthy and inappropriate to have a grandfather with his sons,daughters-in-law and grandchildren living in the sameroom? .Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the loss so,far registered is extensive and very severed It is in this regardthat we are looking for a long-term solution to the flood problem? There has great loss of livestock, grain crops and food crops and household goods? You will realise that these items are not insured and so the' loss is permanent? Myconstituents in this regard will not be able to recover anything out of this loss. It is  also in this regard that I would like to suggest that as a permanent solution to.the flood problem, we should.look into the possibility of constructing dams at the upper and middle courses of the rivers ia. question Miriu Hiver, Nyande River, Nzoia Hiver, Awach Hiver Kuja Hiver and even Tana River? Construction of dams at the upper and middle courses of these rivers will regulate the flow of the water downwardsAt the moment, once the water reaches the level of the Lake and the Lake is filled up, there is nothing that can be done to remove that water  But construction of these dams for control of the waters of these rivers will be useful?  The dam water can be used for irrigation purposes; it. can also be used for domestic consumption and it can equally be used'ior fishing and where appropriate for generation of hydro-electric trie power?Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other solution, apartfrom the construction of dams, is regulating or restrictingthe course of the river especially where weakness is registered Thiscan be done through the construction of concrete blocks? This willbe able at least to regulate and channel the water in..the directionin which .it is required to go i Lastly, while we' appreciate therelief assistance the Government is giving to the people, I would appeal for more	assistance because the flood waters are likely to stay longer before they subside and so the medicine, food and clothing may be required for a longer time? Thank you <Newspeeech>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Nabwera) : Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not the official Government responder. to this Motion I just wanted to speakbecause my Ministry is very much involved in the problems that are facing the country,  particularly Nyanza Province and other areas where our people are stranded and suffering?   Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as the hon.. Mover ofthis Motion, who is also the Member of Parliament for Nyakach sixsaid, some of our people have died. Sir, on behalf of my MinistryI would like to say that we entirely sympathise with the spiritof the Motion. I think that when my hon. colleague standsup to reply, he will aatoagree with what the  Mover of theMotion has said, because our Governments responsibility is to look after the welfare of ite our people. Since that is our major task whenever there is that kind of problem, we must try and do something to rectify it.I just wanted to say two specific things. Firstlyas the hon. Member for Nyando, hon. Miruka-Owuoi has pointed out,we have Ministry to take immediate corrective measures, to make sure that foods, medicineand other things which are needed by the people who are suffering from floods do reach them. I would like to appeal to all has. my hon. colleagues to be more useful in such a manner, not just in this HOuse they can even telephone the provincial and district commissioners «nd tell them  to infrorm the Ministry of any persons who might be stranded in the.floods. The Kenya Government will ,try and drop foods and medicines in areas where people are stranded.Secondly, I would like to say that my Ministrys responsibility is to produce the long term solution, but all the hon. Members in this House are collectively responsible h£ for making sure that long term solutions are found. But at the moment, I would like to assure the House that the Provincial Commissioners in Nyanza Province, Western Province and the  	<Newspeeech>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.Before I say anything, may I take the opportunity to thank the Office of the President, in particular the. Minister who has just, spoken, hon. Nabwera. I  have always seen him at all the flood affected .areas whenever this devastating state of affairs happens in this country. I also want to thank him for having taken a personal interest in the welfare of the people of this country.As has been said by many hon. .Members, our Government is always  all the time and every minute,. concerned with the welfare of the people of this country. As a matter of fact, we are here because those people brought here to look for. solutions to their problems, and not to joke around whenever a problem occurs.As the Minister concerned, I am sure the hon. Members will agree with me that there have been a lot of reports made  from time immemorial that is from colonial time about floods. But I want to correct one small mistake that many hon. Members might go away with that floods only occur in Kano Plains, South Nyahza ol- Bunyala. No! Floods also occur in Tana. River District, and we, as a Ministry, look after the entire country. "This is the truth. So, whenever floods occur, we are particularly with the entire country, but in respect of the floods in Sano, as one hon. Member  mentioned before, I was personally affected. But I was not affected because I am the Minister for Regional Development, but because I come from there and live there.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, measures are underway  and I want to assure the House by the Government to look for long term plans. Reports are available and we are looking for donors. Donors have been "filtering" gradually to us and one of these good days we are going to come up with a solution that will not only help Kano Plains, but also Bunyala, Tana River and other places. THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT Ctd.):I would like to appeal to the hon. Members to note, parti¬cularly this time, that Miriu River which had never swollen the way it has done this time has now flooded because the upper areas of Kericho and Mau Summit have completely "been depleted. There are no trees in those areas. They have been cut down, and this is a "broad environmental problem which must be prevented this time For instance, tomorrow, His Excellency the President is planting trees at Olkalou, and I want to appeal to every Kenyan we are about 22 million people that if each and every Kenyan could plant two trees tomorrow, particularly in the upper areas of Nandi, Llau Narok, and other places, the floods would be there alright, but the seriousness would be reduced. We also need to look at our forests. It is the forests that bring the rain and it is the same forests that prevent the floods. I would also like to request all the districts that are affected to come up with good reports on floods. We have very good brains in this country. They should come up with good reports through D.L.C.s as to what measures they would like the Government If we get reports through: .the .D.D.C.s, we hall definitely act on them because they affect us directly. This is very important. I know, as a member of Kisumu D.D.C., that we." have made recommendations which we will incorporate with other recommendations from other districts. Therefore, I would like to appeal to all hon. Members here because we are all members of the D.D.C.s to come up with recommendations that will supplement what we have done already.We have reports which are very much up to date and which we must implement. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is also true that sometimes the floods in these KanoPlains and Miriu area come unexpected which is why hon. Nabwera said that all the administrative officials in the area are now out in the field trying to assist the people. The floods in these areas do not occur there because of the rivers there but because of overflowing of rivers in the upper regions. This means that when there are rains in that area or not the floods will occur.I am sure that hon. Members will agree with me that our President has always reminded us that in order for us to succeed in this country we must ensurethat we do not leave matters in the hands of a few individuals This is the responsibility of each and every one of us even that of hon. Members whocome from the areas that are not affected by floods. We have properly qualifiedengineers in this country who should be used at a time like this. Kenyans mustlearn to volunteer themselves to help others. We should not be seen like people who feel happy when others are suffering. We must always volunteer, come out and say what we can do to help those who are suffering. In fact, it was recently that we challenged our engineers to design: and manufacture a car. If they managed to do that, then it would even be more easier for them to control the floods. SoI am appealing to any Kenyan with good brains to come out with ideas on how we can solve this problem once and for all. We will incorporate all the ideas with what we already have and I want to make a promise to this House we will take action. We will definitely take action.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIRUKA 0W0UR: When!</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): Mr. TemporaryDeputy Speaker, Sir, I can hear the hon. Member for Nyando asking "When". We arenot going to wait; we are going to take action immediately we get reports from the field. We are not going to throw them in the dustbin. I am know for sure that the hon. Member for Nyando is very worried. But he also should know that I am also worried about the floods. I am very worried about these floods which is why I promise that one of these days.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MIRUKA-0W0UR: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): What, is itching the hon. Member for Nyando?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIRUKA-OWOUR: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sorry to interrupt hon. Midika who is my brother and friend because we are sharing a common problem. As I have said, my people are in a state of agony and want to see the Government doing something about their plight. It is not good for the Minister to say that they are going to take action. We would like to know the action that they are going to take now. I have said that this is not a new problem because the Government knows about it. In the past days the Government used to send money to the floods victims and to clearly the rivers. The chiefs who used to do this work are still there and we have taken them to the district commissioner to show him what to do. Since the long term solution exists what we need is a short term solution like building dams for which our people have already set aside some land. Unfortunately, there is no help coding form the side of the Government. So could the Minister tell us the action that he is going to take because people sire right now dying?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the people are now in agony. I do not want to put the hon. Member into more agony. However, he was not here when hon. Nabwera was talking about the measures that are being taken now. I think he had	 gone out for tea because he has no water in his constituency. Nevertheless, I want to assure him that every thing that I read now is concerned with floods control.He is a lawyer and I am sure I will need his support, but for nowI need engineers and other technical staff. If he knows any of these people, he is welcome bring them to my office any time because we want to do something now and not tomorrow.Hon. KOmbudo has talked of a dredger" in Kakamega, which is used to open up rivers. As all of are in one Government, and not in two Governments, if need be, we will get it from Eakamega." In fact, as I stand here. I know that we have requested the Ministry of Water Development to get us that dredger .from Kakamega and I know that the Ministry is going to respond. I do not want to create unnecessary hope that may not be met, but I want to say that if we promise in this august House that we are going to do something, we must do it.As I said before, while I do not want to repeat myself I would like as many brains as possible to come up and assist me to come out with permanent solution to this problem.Now, for benefit of the hon. Member who had gone out for porridge, I was a saying that there donors who would be willing and look at the flood problem. Unless the hon. Member fails to hear me all the time, I want to assure him that since we are neighbours he can be sure that when he is stranded although he cannot reach my home ,he can telephone me and I will go to assist him.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in conclusion I want to appeal to the hon. Members .and the public to remember that we must always be in a state of preparedness for floods. Whenever therains begin those people who know that they live in areas thatare likely to be affected by floods must take certain precautionary measures so that we can reduce, the intensity of the effects of the floods when they occur. We do not want people to say that when the floods come the Government will come and help us: people must always, be on a state of preparedness. This is what call cost-sharing in efforts we must, also, employed our efforts to supplement those of the. Government I thus want to assure the hon. Members that for sure the Government is doing all it can to ensure that a long-term solution is found for floods not only in Kano, but in Kenya as a whole.With those few remarks, I beg to support.

Baada ya hapo kituo hicho kilifunguliwa mwaka jana mwezi wa nane. Jambo la kushangaza sasa ni kuwa kituo hicho kinasemekana kuwa kimefungwa kwa sababu hakuna nyumba. Je, ni rapango gani Wizara yake kuwa wamejenga nyumba za kudumu huko?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Bw.

WAKOLE: Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Spika. Ningependa kuuomba usaidizi wa Kiti hapa kwa sababu Waziri Msaidi anaseme kuwa hakuna kituo cha.polisi huko Waldena. Je, mimi nina wazimu kuzidi kusisitiza kuwa kuna kituo kama hicho? Ningependa kulifahamisha Bunge kuwa kituo hicho kilifunguliwa na Inspecta wa Polisi aitwaye Minamu. Ningependa uamuzi wa Kiti juu ya jambo hili kwa sababu kituo hicho kilikuwa kinazisaidia Wilaya za Kitui na TanaRiver.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Bw.

Ninataka usaidizi wa Kiti hapa kwa sababu dakika tatu zilizopita Waziri Msaidizi alisema kuwa mhe. Wakole aende akamuletee minutes za mkutano wa kamati ya usailama ya wilaya yake. Jambo lingine ni kuwa ingawa mhe. Wakole amesema kuwa kulikuwako na kituo cha polisi huko, Waziri Msaidizi anaonekana kamahana haoari hiyo. Je, Wizara hii itakuwa ikiendeshaje shughuli zake kama vituo vitafunguli wa na huko hedikwata watakuwa hawana habari yoyote?

Wakole, ni sawa kwake kutumia lugha kama hiyo katika Bunge hili?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAKOLE: Bw. Spika, D.D.C. ya Tana River pamoja na raimi tulite mbelea Waldena tarehe 11 Juni, 1989. Katika safari hiyo tulikuwa na Officer Commanding Police Station na Mkuu wa Wilaya ya Tana River. Hapo hapo pia palikuwako maofisa wa Serikali wengine. Hapo ndipo tulipokubaliana juu ya jambo hili. Jambo hilo pia lilichapishwa ndani ya magazeti kuwa kituo cha polisi cha Waldena kimefunguliwa. Sasa ningependa Waziri Msaidizi atueleze sababu za kukifunga kituo hiki mwezi wa Februari.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Bw. Spika, kituo kama.hiki hakiwezi kuanzishwa bila kuwa gazetted. Ingawa labda yote hayo rnheshimiwa amesema yalitendeka raimi bado ninasisitiza kuwa ladbda kituo hicho kilikuwa ni cha muda tu ill kisaidie kuzuia matata yaliyokuwako hapo wakati huo. Lakini vile tujuavyo hedikwata jambo kama hilo halijatendeka. Ningependa kumwuliza rnheshimiwa aende kwa O.O.C. yake awasilishe jambo hilo halafu watuletee habari. Sisi tumekubali kuanzisha kituo kama hicho. Hata kama vile nilivyosema tumeiomba kamati ya usalama. uchunguze jambo hilo halafu ituletee ripoti kamili. Sijui ni kwa nini rnheshimiwa hanielewi hapo.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SALAT: Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Spika. Jambo la ouhimu la kukumbuka hapa ni kuwa tunazungumzia juu ya usalama wa wananchi wa Tana River ambao pia ni wananchi wa Kenya. Mhe. Wakole amelieleza Bunge kuwa D.D.C. yake na watu wa huko waliona haja ya kuwa na kituo cha polisi huko ambako baada ya hapo askari wa polisi walipelekwa huko kwa muda wa miezi sita. Je, ni haki kwa Waziri Msaidizi sasa kumwuliza rnheshimiwa aende kwa D.D.C. yake ili wapitishe jambo hili wakati wananchi wa huko wanahitaji ulinzi?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Bw. Spika, mimi sikumwomba mheshimiwa aende aitishe mkutanowa D.D.C. baXi hilimwomba kama mwanachama wa D.D.C. yake atuletee ripoti ya jambo hili. Hii ndiyo sababu sote ni wanachama wa,D.D.C. zetu. Sisi kama Wabunge huyaleta mambo mengi sana katika Bunge hili na hii ndiyo sababu ninamwomba aende kwa D.D.C. wakutane halafu watutumie minutes za mkutano huo.

SPEAKER: Next Question.</Newspeech>Question No. 136Completion of Ishiara Hospital X-ray BlockMR. MATS asked the Minister for Health when Ishiara Hospital X-ray block will be completed and equipped.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Sompisha) : Mr. Speaker, Sir, . I beg to reply.I wish to inform the hon. Member that Ishiara Hospital X-ray block will be completed and equipped in the next Financial Tear 1990/91.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the information of the Assistant Minister, Ishiara X-ray block was started in 1983 and it has got very bad history. For example, money delayed by mplementing officers and then eventually returned to the Treasury. At times, if has been given inadequate funds. Since the Assistant Minister is saying that this project will be completed in the next Financial Tear, can I lay this paper on the Table of the House just to prove .that they are not going to do it Sir? This is because the project is nearly over six years old since it was started and it has never been completed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, can I lay this paper on the Table or I give it to you just to prove that these people are not going to do it?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SOMPISHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Question asked by the hon. Member is very clear and short. It is not calling for some more information apart from the time when it will be completed. I have, therefore, said that it will be completed in 1990/91 Financial Tear, I have answered the Question which was asked.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am giving the Assistant Minister background information with regard to this project because he does not seem to be aware of what is going on. Can he promise that what he has said in his reply is what is going to be done? I have said that this project has taken a lot of time and it has. often been said that it will be completed in the next financial year". I am taking it now like the old story that it will be completed in the next financial year. The Assistant Minister should tell the House why the X-ray block has taken so long to be completed?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SOMPISHA: As I said before, the Question is straightforward. The hon. Member just wanted to know when the X-ray block will be completed, and I have indicated the tine it will be completed. The Question does not seek further information.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CEEPKOK: On a point of order, a Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think the Assistant Minister is misleading the House. Supplementary questions are always there and it does not mean that the hon. Member just wanted to know only when the project will be completed. Can the Assistant Minister answer the supplementary question which was raised by hon. Mate?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: What is your point of order, Mr. Chepkok?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: My point of order is that the Assistant Minister is misleading the House. The supplementary question which was asked by hon. Mate is valid and he should answer it. Can he answer hon. Mates supplementary question?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SOMPISHA: First of all, Sir, that is not a point of order. The Question asked by the hon. Member is:-"When will Ishiara Hospital X-ray block be completed and equipped? I have just given the right answer. Even if there are supplementary questions, they should be based on this Question out not something new which requires some figures and so on because they are not called for.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.G. GODANA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to give us information which is not relevant to the Question?.  The House would like to know why his Ministry taken six years to complete that X-ray block.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ole SOMPISHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, that supplementary question had not been asked by anybody.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Ole Sompish, that is a very valid supplementary question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ole SOMPISHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, that was a point of order! nobody had asked me that supplementary question.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER: Order! Hon. Mate raised a supplementary question seeking to know why your Ministry has taken so long to complete that X-ray block. That is why he was of the opinion you should complete it even before the end of the next Financial Year.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ole SOMPISHA: Maybe, that block had not been Completed due to financial .problems, but I can assure thee House that money shall be available in the year.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order, hon. Members! Hon. ole Sompisha. is replying to hon. P.G. Godanas point of order therefore you should let him finish.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. ole SOMPISHA: I was saying that that block had notbeen completed due to financial problems, but now that funds will be available, that block will be completed in the Financial Year.1990/91.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MATE: On a point of order, Mr. .Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to tell this House that probably, the block was not .completed due to lack of money. The word "probably is not acceptable in this House. I had asked him to specifically tell us why that project had taken so long to complete. If he does not have the people answer, therefore, why can he not be a gentleman, and promise this House to so and look for it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ole SOMPISHA: Sir, I think the answer I that I have already given still stand. The project has taken a long time to be completed due to financial difficulties.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think I heard the Assistant Minister saying maybe . The word "maybe" is not supposed to be used in this House. That shows that the Assistant Minister does not have the right answer therefore, he should go back to his Ministry and bring us the right answer. He is not sure of what he is telling the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ole SOMPISHA: If the hon. Member does not want me to use the word "maybe", then I will say that the project had not been completed because due to of financial diffi¬culties. I think the word because" is allowed to be used here.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Sir, hon. Mate told us that at one time money for the construction of that block was returned to the Treasury. The Assistant Minister has now told us that the project has not yet been completed due to lack of finances Why was money returned to the Treasury at that particular time?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ole SOMPISHA: Sir, I have not yet said that any money was returned to the Treasury. If the Questioner had said such a thing, I am not aware of it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Sir, when hon. Mate was giving us the H history of that project, he stated that at one time, money was returned to the Treasury. The Assistant Minister has just told us that the project had not been completed due to lack of funds. If money was returned to the Treasury, then it means that there was money to complete that project, could he tell us why the money was returned?.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ole SOMPISHA: As far as I am concerned, I have not said that any a money was returned to the Treasury. It is the hon. Questioner who gave us that information, and in the first place, that should have been the basis of his Question. Since he is the one who gave us that information, I think he should tell us more about it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think we are in some kind of difficulties. It seems as if the Assistant Minister is not sure of what he is talking about at all. I said that the money was returned to the Treasury, and I have got documents to that effect. That money was returned when the current District Commissioner, Mr. Chelanga was the District Commissioner (D.C.) Embu. He was the Chairman of the Embu District Development Committee (D.D.C.) and he was asked to return that money to the Treasury. That information is there in record. Why Assistant Minister come into this House without proper information about that project. He should have asked for information from his officers rather than coming to answer a Question without relevant information. That project has taken over six years to be completed, and now he is denying the facts which are in record. Is theAssistant Minister in order to stand and give us wrong information. I have given him some information which I can -prove by quoting D.D.C. minutes to prove that the he is misleading the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ole SOMPISHA: The Question before the House is very simple. It says "When will. Ishiara Hospital X-ray block be completed ana equipped. You wanted to know when that project would be completed therefore, how would I have enquired as to why the money was returned to the Treasury. The question as to why money was returned to the Treasury was not relevant to this Questions that is a figure work. As far as I am concerned, no money had been returned to the Treasury.<Newspeech>MR. MATE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think we need your guidance here Sir. This House is supposed to be as august House, and therefore, everything that we say here is supposed to be nothing but the whole truth. Sir, is the Assistant Minister, therefore, in order to deny that money was returned to the Treasury?. The matter is there in record, and everybody in Embu and at the Treasury, knows that that money was returned. Can he therefore, go and look for a proper answer, and the done here to give us the right information.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ole SOMPISHA: Sir, the hon. Member is alleging that every hon. Member and everybody at the Treasury knows that that money was returned. I do not work at the Treasury and therefore, I never go through their files. I am answering this Question according to the way it was asked.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Maiyani): On a point of order Mr. Speaker, Sir. The hon. Assistant Minister, has told this House. that this project is going to be completed within the coming financial year, after he will have consulted with the Treasury and his entire Ministry. There is this assurance. Why should we go back to history and ask why the Assistant Minister did not do this work and, instead returned. the money to the Treasury whereas nobody knows about this. I would have thought that the hon. Member should have told the Assistant Minister that he would keep on watching to see that this money is utilised to build the said x-ray room.</Newspeech>Question No. 146Expansion of Garissa School of NursingMR. SALAT asked the Minister for Health what plans he has to expand Garissa School of Nursing since it is facing serious accommodation problems.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. ole Sompisha): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.I am aware of the present congestion facing Garissa School of Nursing My Ministry will repair and renovate the existing dormitory facilities and, to this end, funds to the tune of £20,000 have been allocated this 1989/90 Financial Year. Additional, funds have been budgeted to the tune of £150 which will be spread over a period of three years as follows - and you had better listen carefully:-1990/91 - £50,000, 1991/92 - £50,000 and 1992/93 - £50,000.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SALAT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the answer given by he hon. Assistant Minister, I would like to say that this school was started on temporary basis in 1980, and it is accommodated in an old tuberculosis hospital. You can imagine how an old tuberculosis hospital looks like. The school has only one classroom and one small dining hall, and students actually eat their meals outside because the small dining hall is being used as a classroom. Since 1980 up to now, 10 years have elapsed, and I wonder why the Ministry of Health has neglected this school for this long. The Assistant Minister now tells us that only £20,000 has been allocated for renovation not even for expansion,but for renovation. Why has this school been neglected?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ole SOMPISHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the hon. Questioner had been listening carefully, he would have heard me mention here that £20,000 has been allocated for renovation. I also mentioned that in 19.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. CHEPK0K: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Could the Assistant Minister explain this issue properly? The sum of £20 is always a boost to the Government to look for more money, and it does not mean that the money is allocated. Is he in order to mislead this House by saying that £20 has been allocated?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ole SOMPISHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have learnt that the hon. Member had gone to Mathari Mental Hospital to be checked and that when he came back he reported that he had been found sane.(Laughter) I did not speak about £20, but £20,000. So, I do not know why he is talking about £20.</Newspeech>(Applause)<Newspeech>MR. CHEPK0K: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for the Assistant Minister to quote what I said last time in this House about my having gone to Mathari Mental Hospital? Does this bear any relation to the question that the Assistant Minister has been asked? If not so, could he withdraw this particular remark?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ole SOMPISHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the hon. Member cannot tell the difference between £20 and £20,000, what else could have said?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPK0K: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. If the correct figure is £20,000 and I mentioned £20, this does not give the Assistant Minister an excuse to abuse me in this House. I stand corrected because I thought I heard him mention £20. Why did he not correct me if this figure was wrong? I need your guidance as to whether he should not withdraw the remark that I went to Mathari Mental Hospital to be checked.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. ole Sompisha, I think you had better withdraw theremark you have made relating to Mr. Chepkok. having gone to Mathari Mental Hospital because it is not exciting nor will it help the debate before us now. In any case, the hon. Member did not hear you properly.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ole SOMPISHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I withdraw my remark relating to Mathari Mental Hospital. I talked about £20,000 has having been allocated to this school in the 1989/90 Financial Year, £50,000 in 1990/91, £50,000 in 1991/92 and £50,000 in 1992/93. This is not little money when you consider that we have many hospitals to build throughout the country. We are giving hospitals throughout the country money bit by bit, and we are not going to give all the money we have only to one institution.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SALAT: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I appreciate the fact that some effort is being made towards solving the problem I have raised, although the money that has been mentioned is only in the Printed Estimates and you cannot know now whether it is going to be approved or not. What I want to know is why the Assistant. Minister, while knowing that there is a lot of congestion in this school its students are studying in the dining hall and eating their meals outside, and yet these are health people who are supposed to observe health rules neglected the school for 10 years. Not even a portion has been added to the school over the last 10 years!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ole SOMPISHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have learnt of the gravity of the need to expand this school, and this is why we are now coming out in full swing to do this.</Newspeech>					(Applause)<Newspeech>MR. A.I. M0HAMED: Mr. Speaker, Sir, although I appreciate the forward budget that has been read out by the Assistant Minister, this is the only such college in the whole North Eastern Province, but it is a 10 year old institution whose students are having their meals under trees. This is very unhygienic because the area where it is situated is very dry and winds there blow furiously. What immediate measures is the Ministry taking to safeguardthe health of these trainee nurses?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ole SOMPISHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member is asking aboutthe immediate measures we are taking, and I have been talking about large amountsmoney here £20,000 and £50,000 three times, amounting to almost £200,000.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.I. MOHAMED: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I seek your guidance here because I am asking about the immediate plans that the Assistant Minister has, whereas he is only reading out his long-term plans. What immediate plans does he have to safebuard the lives to these student nurses who are having their meals under trees as this is very unhygienic?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ole SOMPISHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am now told by the hon.Questioner that this school has been running for the last 10 years under the sameconditions, and I do not see why it should continue to suffer now that money forimprovement is available.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON.

No. 000-372-218, was underpaid his benefits and when he will be paid the outstanding balance.<Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. The claimant was employed by Mombasa Municipal Council from 1967 to 1986. His claim was made and received by the Fund on 18th March, 1987. There was a discrepancy in his return, which committed contributions for the years 1977 to 1986. Payment of KShs.8,902.20 for the years 1967 to 1972 and for the year 1974 was made to the claimant by cheque No. 065387 on 18th September, 1987. The Fund has now received an up-to-date record of the claimants contribution for the unpaid period between 1977 and 1986, and payment will be made to him in one weeks time.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. B3DU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for that reply, and taking into account that it took three years to rectify the dis-crepancy, can he tell the House what caused all this delay?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker; Sir, the delay was caused by the fact that neither the claimant nor his employers had furnished us with the information as to where the claimant worked for the period between 1983 and 1985. However, we cleared the records immediately we received that information.<Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been told that the claimant will be paid in one weeks time. Can we be told what day of the week the payment will be effected?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M.

MWAMZANDI asked the Minister for Labour what steps he is taking to expedite the payment of NSSF benefits for Messrs. Kasim Abdaiia, No. 013-118-021; Mohamed Hamisi, No. 038-381028 and Salim Athumani, No. 269-308-2-10.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. D.M. Amin): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. Mr. Kasim Abdalla s application for withdrawal benefits was received by the Fund on 26th August, 1988. According to his application, he worked for Kenya Bus Services, Mombasa, from 1971 to 1977. The Fund is making arrangements to pay him in two weeks time. The Fund has, however, noted that some contributions for the year 1966/67 were entered to Mr. Abdallas account without indication of the source. A letter was" sent to him on 27th September, 1988 and a reminder was also sent to him on 30th March, 1990, requesting him to indicate, where he worked for the year 1966/67.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Mohamed Hamisi, NSSF No. 038-381-028, has not submitted his with¬drawal application to the Fund. The Fund has also not received a withdrawal application from Mr. Salim Athumani, NSSF No. 269-308-210.	</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am told that the Fund has not received withdrawal applications from Messrs. Mohamed Hamisi and Salim Athumani. Since I am aware that these two gentlemen submitted their claims to the Fund head¬quarters, can the Assistant Minister tell us where those claims are? What efforts is the Ministry making to trace those claims since they were submitted to them?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said that the two gentlemen will be paid as soon as their claims are received by the Fund.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. My worry is that Messrs. Mohamed Hamisi and Salim Athumani used to work for the Associated Sugar Company which is now bankrupt and, for that reason, their records may not be available. How are they expected to fill in fresh application forms since the employer has been declared bankrupt and the records may riot be there?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M.

G0DANA asked the: Minister for Public Works why the Ministry has delayed the payment of compensation to Messrs. Galgallo Tano and Abdub Bante for their hand dug wells that were destroyed during the construction of the Moyale Border Control Post.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Malyanl): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Moyale Border Control Post is on a Government land, and from the time the site was identified and developed my Ministry has not received any informat¬ion that there, were any wells there.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.G. Godana: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not think it is accurate for .the Assistant Minister to allege that his Ministry is not aware of the existence of these wells when there have been various correspondence- on the subject over the years through the district officer s office. Could he promise to find out the facts from the District Officer, Moyale, and compensate1 these people accordingly?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as everyone knows, the Government is very much conerne d about provision of water to wananchi. The Ministry is, therefore going to look for the information as suggested by the hon. Member and the matter will be dealt with.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.G. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister give us a date by which he will give us the final reply?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

TERER, on behalf of Dr. Misoi, asked the Minister for Public Works why the construction of the Kasses Arwos road has taken so long to be completed.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Archbishop Ondiek): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The construction of the Kasses-Arwos road has taken long to be completed as a result of unusual rainy seasons experienced in that area over the last two years.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ANASWA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. When the Assistant Minister says that the completion of the road has been delayed due to erratic rains, can he explain what he means?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: What is your point of border, Mr. Anaswa?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ANASWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister explain whathe means by saying that the rains have been erratic? Furthermore, does he mean to say that roads will never be built in areas where rains are erratic?</Newspeech><Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member knows that when I talk of rains in the area being erratic I mean that they have been unusually heavy.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. TERER: Mr. Speaker, Sir, does, the Assistant Minister mean that roads cannot be constructed during erratic rain seasons? Does the Ministry not have the capacity to construct roads during such seasons?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the moment, there is too much rain in the area and this has made it very difficult for us to construct the road.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CEZFKOK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the Assistant Minister is misleading the House. I come from the area in question and I know that last year, there was no rain in this area and therefore, he should not come here to mislead the House. Can he tell this House why they did not construct this particular road.</Newspeech><Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP 01IDHX: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very interesting to hear that there was no rain in this area. If there was no rain in the area, could the hon. Member tell us how the people in the area have survived?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Somphisa): On a point of order Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is it really in order for the hen. Member to mislead this House by saying there was no rain in this area last year. Everybody knows that, in fact, it did rain in this place and therefore, the hon. Member should be asked to withdraw that statement because it is not true.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.CEEPKGK: Mr. Speaker,Sir, the hon. Member who cones from Masailand does not know anything about thus are a I am talking about. Perhaps he is still thinking about those Masai mud houses. That I am saying is that there was a long break between the rainy season and the dry season in Uasin Gishu and during this long break that we are able to plough and plant. Could the Assistant Minister tell this House why the Ministry did not construct this road during that period? I do not mean to say that it did not rain the whole of last year After,all, we know that rain is seasonal.</Newspeech><Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the dry season, we constructed part of this road and the rain cane before we completed the construction of the entire road which was supposed to take six months to complete. So, when the rain case, we just could not continue with the work on this particular road.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think the Assistant Minister is misleading this House because if the road in question was to be completed within six months, as he says, then it means that it could have been completed within early part of the year.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: What is your point of order, Mr. Mang'oli really?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, any point of order is whether the. toAssistant Minister is really in order to mislead this House by saying thatit was the rain that delayed the completion of this road.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

LOTIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for water Development, the following Question by Private Notice:-Since there is an acute shortage of water in Kapenguria and Makutano townships, what urgent measures is the Minister taking to provide the residents with adequate water supply.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER!"FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Kisiero): Mr. Speaker Sir, I beg to reply. There is no acute water shortage in either Kapenguria or Makutano townships as alleged by the hon. Member. That there is, is that the Ministry is not able to satisfy the current demand for water in the two townships because the production of water is below the demand per day. Kapenguria water supply is producing 300 cubic meters per day again a demand of 1,000 cubic meters per day. This is "being supplemented with 240 cubic meters of water per day from Makutano water Supply, totalling to 540 cubic meters of water per day. Makutano Water Supply is producing 500 cubic meters of water per day against a demand of 700 cubic meters per day. If an area has a deficit in the s water produced per day, I consider that situation as being inadequate and certainly not acute, since water is still available.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am seekingyour guidance in this Question because the House is at a loss to know whois now telling us the truth. The Hon. Questioner says that there is an acuteshortage of water in Kapenguria and Makutano and then the .Assistant' Minister says that that is not the case. who is now telling us the truth?MR. KISTERO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the hon. Member listened carefully, he would have heard me say that the water supplied does not satisfy the demand. In other words, we appreciate that the amount of water supplied to these two townships is not adequate, but the situation is not acute as the hon. Member puts it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LOTIM: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am saying that there is an acute shortageof water in these two townships in the sense that on two occasions, I have found Government officers going to the stream to fetch water. This in itself proves that there is an acute shortage of water. Last year, no operation could be carried out at Kapenguria District Ecpital due to lack of water and this proves that there is an acute shortage of water in these areas. So, could the Assistant Minister tell this House what measures his Ministry is intending to take to provide enough water in these two townships?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ZJSIERO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. 'Questioner knows very well that it is the district development committee which initiates these projects and it is the same committee which decides what project should be given first priority. With regard to this project, I would like to say that we do not have enough funds to be able to carry out design work and prepare a new water scheme which would be able to cover Kapenguria and Makutano which have grown quite a lot in population. The problem therefore, is that there is not enough money at the moment. All the same, it is up to the district development committee to decide which project should be attended to first.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALZSE; Mr. Speaker, Sir, when will Ministries stop saying that they will carry out certain project then money become available? I asking this because it seems to be the biggest excuse that all. Ministries give here for not doing their work on time. We know that district development committees are not really responsible for the funds because these  funds cone from other sources. So, when will Ministries carry out proper plans to stop then answering questions in this House in this manner?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KISIERO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, no Ministry car. plan without money. We need the funds to go to the field and carry out design work and so on. The Ministry of Water Development cannot design water schemes in the country without getting enough funds from Treasury.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>Mr. SPEAKER: Next Question.Disappearance of Mr. Koech a Game Ranger</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.arap SOI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Tourism and Wildlife the following Question by Private Notice:-Since Mr. Koech, Game Ranger Service No.019939, formerly stationed at Garissa, disappeared on 4th October, 1987 what steps has the Minister taken to establish his whereabouts.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOP. TOURISM AND WILDLIFE (Mr. Ngala): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. Following the mysterious disappearance of the Game Ranger, Mr. Koech on the 4th of October,1987 at Garissa, the matter was immediately reported to the Kenya Police for investigations. The whereabouts of Mr. Koech has so far not been established and the police investigations are still continuing.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SOI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, since it appears that the police are taking too long to establish the whereabouts of this man who went missing on 4.10.87, what has the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife done to assist the family of that man? This man's children are no longer going to school because there is nobody to pay their school fees. Would the Minister make immediate arrangements to send this man's usual salary, including all the arrears since 1987, to the District Commissioner, Kericho, so that the man's family can be assisted?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGAIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I share the hon. Member's concern about this officer. The Ministry , is also concerned and I do not want to make any undertakings right now regarding the payments But as I said earlier on, the investigations are still going on. That is the information we have as of today and we will continue to follow up the matter very closely with the help of the police so that we may know the results of the investigations.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALSBE: On a point of order, Mr.' Speaker, Sir. The Minister has not answered question asked by hon.: Soi. He was asked whether the Ministry can send this man's wages, since 1987, to the District Commissioner, Kericho, so that the man's children can continue with their education. Can he do so while we wait for the outcome of the investigations?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGAIA: Mr." Speaker, Sir, I said that right now. I cannot give any commitment. We have to wait for the outcome of the investigations and then after that we will look into the other issues concerning the family of the lost officer.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALESE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir; It is now three years since this officer disappeared and if the Minister is unable to tell us when the investigations will be completed, then he should be able to tell us when the Ministry will send money to Kericho to educate the children of this officer Could the Minister answer this question in the affirmative instead, of leaving it unanswered?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGALA: Mr.' Speaker, Sir, I have been affirmative enough in the sense that I have said that I cannot commit the Ministry right now. Investigations are still going on and it should be noted here that matters of investigations are rather lengthy. So, when we get the relevant information from the police we will act accordingly so that we do not make the family suffer unnecessa¬rily.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.K. kinyanjui: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Minister has told the House that investigations have been going on for the last three years. Could he tell the House what the preliminary findings, if any, have been?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGALA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not think we can comment on the preliminary findings of the investigations which are being carried out by the polices This is because the police have their own procedures and we are just waiting for them to tell us what they have been able to unearth so far and then after we will be able to say what steps we are going to take.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. LEWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the absence of any report from the police, could the Minister tell the House whether this gentleman's name still appears in the Ministry Payroll or whether it has been struck off the Payroll?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGAIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the officer's name no longer appears on the Payroll of the Ministry because the report has been given to the effect that he is missing. So, I do not think there is any reason why the name should continue to appear on the Payroll.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, "the Minister should take this matter more seriously. He is not telling us that the missing officer is dead. So, the Ministry's assumption is that the man is living somewhere and they are trying to trace him. But this officer has a family and that is why we are saying that the Ministry should send some money to the District Commissioner, Kericho, to enable the children of this officer to continue with their education. So, while they are looking for this man, could the Ministry consider paying some money to the family to enable the children to go to school?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGALA : Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to assure hon. Mwenje that I am taking this matter seriously . I do not want to pre-empt any situation. But I want to assure the House that we are going to take the necessary action once we are fully detailed by the police about the whereabouts of this man.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASIKE-ND0M3I: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are simply asking the Minister to make some payment to the family and at the end of the day, whether this gentleman will he dead or not, that money will "be recovered from the final payments. This is all we are asking him to do. This is because there are some benefits which have accrued and they should be paid to the missing man;s family. Could the Minister on humanitarian grounds because this may happen to him tomorrow release some money to this family?.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGAIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to re-state what I said earlier, that I do not want to commit the Ministry right now. But if we get a request from a member of the family we will consider it and see how we can handle it,</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SOI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Minister has talked about a request from a member of the family. But I am here as. a representative of that family. I have already made a request Could the Minister, therefore, arrange to a make some payment to the family of the missing officer, through the District Commissioner Kericho? The missing officer has more than eight children who are still going to school and they need help.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGALA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I quite agree that the hon. Member represents his constituents But when it comes to family matters I think our representation levels would probably not go that far. So, all that I was saying is that if we get a request from a member of the family we will look into it and find ways of assisting the family. We want a request from the members of the family and not from hon.' Soi.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SOI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Minister has said that my representation does not extend to the family. Does he not know that a Member of Parliament represents a constituency and	individuals in particular?Does he not know that a Member of Parliament represents even the infants in his constituency? Could the Minister appreciate and accept my representation?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGA1A: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not see why a misunder¬standing should arise between me and hon. Soi. I just said that once we get a request from one of the family members we will look in it and see how we can help. Any member of the family can write to us and we will respond to the letter. I agree that hon. Soi has a duty to represent even the unborn.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Text Order, please.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap SOI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. This concerns the Question I have just asked. Could I be in order to request this honourable House to allow me sometimes later on today to raise a matter of national importance under Standing Order No. 20? This is because the Government seems to be neglecting individual cases with regard to compensation, I want to ask the Ministry to consider.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order, Mr. arap Soil That is absolutely impossible and I am not going to allow it. Can we move on.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAHIHU: 0n a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Thank you for allowing me to make a comment on what appears in today's papers. In accordance with a story appearing is today newspapers a historical event took place when His Excellency the President stopped his convoy to rescue a sick woman. I rise to congratulate His Excellency the President for being mindful of the. sick. This is the first time the whole of the Presidential convoy stopped to resume sick woman lying on the roadside, if This is yet another good example that to all leaders in the rural areas whenever they are travelling, they should look around and help the sick.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the example set by our own President demonstrates once again that he is a true Christian because this has Biblical reference.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: mWAMBIE Askofu Okullu hayo!</Newspeech><NEWSPEECH>MR. MAHIHU: By the. same token, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am also raising the issue of Bishop Okullu. I do not accept ,as a committed Christian, that a Bishop should issue a statement telling this country that we must accept change, and if we do not accept that the constancy willforce us to accept change. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not right for any pastor of any denomination, including P.C.E.A. (Presbyterian Church of East Africa), who have been advocating multi-parties, to advocate for multi-parties How loudly are we going to tell them that this country has chosen one party system and we shall not go for a multi-party or multi tribal or multi section systems?In the same newspapers, Bishop Okullu is reported to have said that there should be a forum to discuss the Kenya we want, and in that forum there must be foreign observers. I think we have been independent for 27 years and the destiny of our future lies in our hands in. It also lies with our beloved President. who is mindful of the sick wherever he is. I felt that it is important for pastors to be told that this country has already decided the political path it wants to follow. Kanu, as a leading party since Independence has never surrendered its obligations and using to the wishes of the people. Thank you.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Biwott): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.	I rise to more or less make a similar remark regarding what hon. Mahihu has just said. First of all, I think all Kenyans have learned from His Excellency the Presidents action yesterday about the spirit of true Somaritan. I also believe that every Kenyan should borrow a leaf from there, and be sensitive to the interests of this country. Every Kenyan should also be sensitive to the people's, feelings; people's sufferings; and also to be sensitive to the things that we need to demonstrate, if we want to show that we are really being mindful of other people's welfare.I think that act of yesterday only very few people can achieve but we would like as may Kenyans as possible to do. I "believe that the entire House are happy with His. Excellencythe President and are congratulating him and wishing him well. I think God will also bless him for doing such an act. On the question of the one-party system, I think what we shall do by responding to Bishop Okullu is to ignore him. Bishop Okullu has nobody and he is sneaking for himself. The entire Kenyans are happy with one-party system. All Kenyans know, that this has been our way of life for many years, even before the colonialist powers came to this country. We existed for millions of years and we were choosing our own leaders at that time through the system that we have at the moment. As people, we never had parties, and I think what we need to do is for each individual hon. Member to continue preaching the good merits of one party system. I also want to state the point that we arrived at one-party system after experiencing a lot of problems, which arose out of multi party systems. For instance, we have had KADU, A.P.P., K.P.U. and so on. All those multi-parties brought us commotion. But now that we are a one-party system Kenya is much more united today than ever before, and wherever Kenyans are, they are all for the President. So, we should not be bothered about Bishop Okullu. I want to appeal. to all hon. Members to ignore Bishop Okullu as if he did not say any¬thing. We know that he is answering the wishes of those people he wants to see in the conference, and those people have no conse¬quence to us. So, we do not need them. If he needs them, then he can go and look for them anywhere. He can call his barazas and preach whatever he wants. But we should not appear unduly worried about somebody who has nobody to represent. We have the people behind us. We all elected and we are speaking with mandate, What mandate does he have?</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON.

Ni, fur aha kuu kwa watu. wa Mombasa wamenituma niseme hapa ndani ya 3unge hili ili.redio itangaze na magazeti yaandikwe jinsi ya mapenzi ya Mtukufu Rais Moi kwa kutuongeza mishahara wakati huu wa mwezi wa Ramadhani ambapo tumekuwa tukimwomba Mungu kila siku ili afahainu kwamba kuna watu wake ambao wanampenda sana.Bw. Spika, kwa sababu ya kitendo hiki ni lazima tumwonye she mgni yetu, na pia ni lazima tumshukuru kwa tendo lolote alilolifanya fyzuri. Hii ndiyo sababu Bibilia pamoja na Koran inasema ukifanyiwa mema, nawe shukuru.Lakini watu wa Mombasa wanashangaa kama Askofu Okullu ndiya Askofu Makarisu wa kenya. Hii ni kwa sababu Askofu Makarios alikuwa akipi gama urazs wa nchi yake. Kwa hivyo, uchungu tulionao ni jusu ya watu kusema maneno ili watu wanyamaze na kufanya madharau. Maneno ya Askofu Okullu ya leo ni ya kutukaha.isisi sote. Hii ni kwa sababu Wakenya wote arabao waipata railioni 27 walikubaliana kupitiaWabunge wao kuwa watakuwa na chama kimoja kwa sababu chama hieho kina sauti 100,000. Hapa oefe mtu akitaka kuchaguliwa husimama halafu huchaguliwa na watu 100 na si kama viie wale wenye vyama vitatu kwao ambao hukaa ofisini na kuwachagua wawakilishi wa sehemu zao. Sisi hatufanyi hivyo belli huenda uwanjani ambako huchaguliwa. Lakini vyama vingine kama vile the Labour Conservative Party hujifungia ndani ya nyumba ambako husema: ,Mr. Biwott will stand with Mr. Shariff Nassir. Hapo humpatia pesa na kutumia miujiza chungu mzima kwa sababu mtu huyo ni mwanachama wa chama wala si mwanachama wa watu wote England. Hapa nchini anayesimama huwa ni Mkenya na huchaguliwa na watuwote wa nchi hii.Bw. Spika, jambo ninaloona kama miujiza ni mtu kutaka kuibadili Katiba ya nchi hii ambako anataka kila miaka miwili tuwe na rais mwingine. Je, ni nani anayefanya fujo hizo? Ni Bishop Okullu! Kwa nini anafanya hivyo hali sisi tunayaheshimu makanisa na raisikiti? Tungependa yule anayetaka kujiunga na siasa akitokeze ili achaguliwe na wananchi. Mtukufu Rais haogopi uchaguzi na yuko tayari wakati wowote kusimama kwa uchagu zi. Kama Bishop Okullu ana mtu ambaye anataka awe rais basi sisi tuko tayari kuwasimisha kwa mlolongo ill wachaguliwe na wananchi. Sisi watu	 wa Kenya tuko tayari kabisa kwa sababu matendo ya Mtukufu Rais yanajionyesha wazi wazi kuwa ana imani na watu wa nchi hii.Mtu yeyote atakaye zaidi ya chama kimoja hapa nchini hujua kuwa akisimama atatupwa na wananchi. Kwa hivyo, hupendelea vyama vitatu ili kuwe na vyama vya ukabila ili atafute watu wakabila lake na watu wengine watokao kwenye kabila ndogo atafute njia ya kuwa rais. Lakini kwa kuwa watu wa Kenya huchagua mtu apendwaye ha watu wote watu kama hawa wana taabu sana.	 Lazima sasa tuambiwe cha kufanya na ni naugu wetu tu wa south	 Nyanza watakaotuambia cha kufanya. Sasa kukiwa na fujo mahali fulani niwajibu wa watu wa hiyo sehemu wafanye maandamano wamwambie mwenye kufanyafujo kuwa hawayataki ,nambo yake. Ni lazima sisi tujuane. Si vizuri kamamtu akifanya fujo Mombasa tunyamaze bila kufanya kituchochote.Mtu kama akitokea Mombasa nitamfanyia rnaandamano ili atubu wakati mwixigine. Kwa hivyo, ni wajibu wa sehemu nyingine za nchi hii kufanya vivyo hivyo. Mtu ynynte akitokea kiipinga Serikali au Chama cha Kanu lazima akomeshwe. Mimi hata akiwa ni sheikh au padre akiwa ananiharibi.a mambo yangu au anataka kumwaga damu nitapigana naye.Kwa hivyo, Bw. Spika, sisi ni jamii moja ya Chama cha Kanu na ni wajibu wetu kuambiana kwani sote culikubaliana kuwa na chama kimoja na tuchaguane kupitia milolongo. Si vizuri mtu kumuacha mwingine aendelee kutoa matukano ati kwa sababu ni wa, kabila lake. Ni lazima watu waambiwe ukweli na ukweli usemeke.Kwa hivyo, ningependa kuwasihi watu kama hawa wakome na kama wana haja ya kujiunga na siasa waje tuchaguliwe. Lakini hawezi kuhubiri huku wakijiingiza kwa siasa. One cannot ride two horses at the same time. religions and politics are two different things.

Wiki jana nilitoa taarifa hapa Bungeni ambako nilimwomba Waziri wa Afya atoe taarifa kamili kuhusu ugonjwa uliotokea katika mawakilisho yangu. Lakini hadi leo Waziri hajatoa taarifa yoyote kuhusiana na jambo hili. na hali watu wanaendelea kufa riki huko. Hadi leo niwatu wanane ambao wamekwishafariki huko. Ingawa ugonjwa huu unazidi, hakuna dawa zozote za kuutibu ugonjwa huu. Madktari wanasema kuwa kuna dawa iitwayo chloramphenicol inaweza kuuagamiza ugonjwa huu lakini dawa hiyo haipatikani. Sasa badala ya kwenda kuwatibu watu huko maofisa wa Wizara hii wanaenda huko kuwafundisha watu public health education. Elimu hii ina faida gani kama watu wanaendelea kufa? Kwa hivyo, ninamtaka Waziri alilieleze Bunge hili kama huu ni ugonjwa gani na njia gani za haraka watakazotumia kuwatibu watu hawa?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Kibaki): Mr. Speaker, Sir, we acted very quickly on this issue.

During that time I was emphasising the point that the Government from time to time does see the need of reviewing these laws so that the law of this country can be in line with changing situations in the country as far as they affect social, economic and political factors.</Newspeech> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to conclude my speech by saying that it is wish of the Ministry that the House supports this Bill because it is going to improve the situation as far as land acquisition is concerned, when land matter are entered into, there is a tine limit of two years and two months.The Government will also give the people the opportunity to appeal to the. land tribunal. for example, those who feel that they have been under¬assessed and so on, are free to air their views. The Government will then look into such grievances through the land tribunal which fill be created if this Bill sails through.I beg to support the amendment.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Thank you, Sir, for giving me this opportunity. I wish to support this Bill as amended. I hope that the Minister is going to take seriously the views expressed by the hon. Members who have spoken.This Bill has come at the right time because this is what the nation has been, waiting for. The part of the Bill which disturbs me is on land acquisition by the Minister through the Commissioner of Lands. The 3ill says that the person whose land is to be acquired, should be given time in order to remove his machinery. what will happen if the land owner does not need such machinery? In this case, the Ministry should remove that machinery at the expense of the Government since it is the one that is acquiring the land. There is no reason why the person whose land is being acquired should be forced to remove the machinery which he will not find useful.The Ministry should also compensate the owners of the machinery so removed because it may not be useful to them anymore. The Ministry should also be responsible for the removal of such machinery and not the owners as indicated in this Bill. I hope that the Minister will see to it that that is taken care of.'I would like to reiterate what former speakers have said about thepercentage of compensation. I do not know, whether it is incorporated in the amendment. It is not good to leave it to the Minister to decide on what percentage should, be paid. They should have a rate of compensation in relation to the commercial£and interest. for example, today We may have a Minister who will be fair. in his judgement but tomorrow, we may have another one who may set his own rates, say, with regard to the acquisition of land of his political opponent and he may say that compensation will be at the rate of .3 per cent, 5 per cent or 10 per cent, when the commercial value might be 13 per cent or 22 per cent. It is important that the Minister incorporates, in his amendment a specific percentage with regard to compensation.If the Minister is free to decide on the rate of compensation, he may, say, decide to acquire school land and give compensation at the rate he so desires. I hope that the Minister will make sure that commercial rates are incorporated a in the amendments. I would like to say that whenever the Government acquires land, it should take the responsibility of settling the displaced people elsewhere. The Government should identified an alternative site where they can be settled. I am saying so because when Nzoia Sugar Factory was being constructed in Bungonsa, the people whose:.land: was acquired for that purpose, are now squatters. They are living in town and have nothing. The reason why I say that they should be given alternative land instead of cash money is that the husband, will, for example, take that money and go to enjoy it in town without taking into account the settlement of his family. Whenever land is acquired, the Ministry should ensure that the owners are given alternative land instead of compensating them with money. In We buye we have a problem with regard to land acquisition. We have a Government forest which came up as a result of land being acquired from the some people. some people whose land was acquired were compensated and others have not yet been compensated.' The Minister should send a team there to establish those people who were not compensated with a view of compensating them. These people were living in a place called Chekambe which is now gazetted as a Government forest and they should be allocated alternative land so that the children do not sufferfor mistakes that are not theirs.The Minister should send a team to investigate the nu,ber of people who were compensated in Chekambe Hills, Webuye. This is because there are houses in the gazetted areas. These people are suffering and they cannot do any cultivation because they do not own that land. The Government should also identify land which, these people can purchase with compensation money.There are also members of the land tribunal who will decide no the fate of those whose land has been acquired. I hope that they will be fast in their decision making. The 3ill says that they will sit and decide within a period of 14 days. I think this is too long. The Minister should ensure that this period is reduced so that decisions can be reached quickly so that the affected families re settled without delay.Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to this Act, the Minister may issue a gazette notice to acquire a certain piece of land, but if he keeps quiet for a certain period, then it means that that land will not be acquired. If that is not done, then the owner of that piece of land is left inla dilemma, because he is not sure of what is going to happen.If the Ministry assured that it is going to acquire a certain piece of land then it must do so. The, Bill says that after the Ministry has gazetted the notice that it will acquire a certain piece of land, and it does not do so for, a certain period, then it means that the Ministry has stopped its intended acquisition. But, the owner of that land will have suffered a lot. Therefore, whenever the Ministry decides that it will acquire a certain piece of land, then that decision should be final. If the Ministry issue a gazette notice that it will acquire a certain piece land, and then keep quiet for three years the owners may know whether that land is going to be acquired or not, but just to realise later the Commissioner of Lands had decided not to acquire that piece of land. The Bill, as it is today, gives the Commissioner of Lands the leeway to decide other to acquire that land or not. That leaves the owner of that land in a dilemma. That is not right, because the land owners are left in a state of uncertainity. We would like the Minister to be precise. When the Ministry is acquiring and, there should be room of reversing the decision, because if it is not so the land. owners are left in a dilemma. The Ministry might stop acquiring some land because the compensation is too high.Mr. Speaker, Sir, some people have given murrain from their land for the construction of roads , but they have not yet been compensated at all. While implementing this Bill, the Minister should include compensation those people who give murrain for construction of roads. There are very many people who have given murrain in Webuye, but they, have not been compensated. Today, the Government is planning to construct Webuye Malaba Road. The Government is going to use people murram and acquire their land but those people will never be compensated. The Ministry should set aside some money for compensating such people. Sir, every time that the Government wants to construct a certain road, land is acquired but the owners are never compensated. Once the road is completed the Ministry forgets about compensating the owners.Sir, the Ministry should compensate those people who have given murrain, because they will no longer use that land for anything else. Therefore, those people who have given murrain should be treated the same way s as those people who have given land for other purposes. Sir, His Excellency the President has always said that we should consider the welfare of the poor people. Sir, when poor peoples land has been acquired, they are neve. compensated on time. Sir, it is also difficult to get the leases for some plots from is the Ministry's. The Ministry should also makesure that while implementing this Bill, issues the leases for those plots, so that the owners can get their title deeds and start using them. I appreciate the fact that the Minister has slat done a good job, but I would like to request him to work harder than before, so that people can benefit from their. We know that land is the backbone of our economy, and once you do not have a title deed you cannot get any loans. There are some plots which have been issued to the people by the town councils, but they have not been given leases The Ministry should come up with a general policy so that people can begin using those pieces of land for development purposes.Sir, the Ministry should now start working from the grassroots. The Ministry should start compensating the people in the rural areas such as Bungoma and Webuye ownership. There are very many compensation claims which have not been paid. This Bill is supposed to protect those people whose land has been acquired for public utility, and yet they have not yet been compensated. I am sure that after this Bill becomes a law, the Minister will ask his personnel on the ground to implement it immediately.With those few remarks, I beg to support the Bill.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Asante sana, Bw. Spika kwa kunipa nafasi hii ili niseme Machache juu ya huu Mawada. Bw. Spika, kama unavyojua, Katiba yetu imeeleza kwamba ardhi inaweza kuchukuliwa kwa matumizi ya taifa. Marekebisho haya ni mazuri lakini kuna sehemu nyingine zinazotaka kurekebishwa zaidi. Ningependa Waziri alete marekebisho ili Mswada huu uende sambamba na matakwa ya wananchi. Bw. Spika, Mswada huu umesema kwamba Wizara ikisema kwamba ina haja ya ardhi fulani, halafu inakaa.kwa muda fulani kaola ya kuitumia ardhi hiyo, basi itaonekana kwamba Wizara imebadilisha nia y a kuchukua ardhi hiyo. Hilo ni jambo la naana kwa sababu mtu anaweza kukaa bila kujua kwamba ardhi yake itachukuliwa au la.Mswada unasema kama ifuatavyo: " The Commissioner may for sufficient cause Kama Commissioner wa Ardhi ana helewa lcuitumia ardhi hiyo basi inaonyesha kwamba hana hajana ardhi hiyo tena.Bw. Spika wananchi wametoa ardhi kwa manufaa ya Serikali mara.nyingi hata mbila kutarajia malipo. Wakati Serikali inaootaka kujenga hospitali au amshule, wananchi wanatoa ardhi mbila kajt kuitisha malipo. Hiyo ni kuonyesha kwamba wananchi wana hamu sana ya kusaidia Serikali kwa njia zote.Wakatiardhi inapochukuliwa, ingefaa ithibitishwe kwamba, kwakweli, inachukuliwa kwa manufaa ya Serikali kwa sababu kama itachukuliwa kwa manufaa ya aina nyingine, hii itakuwa ni kwenda kinyume cha vile Katiba inavyosema. Kuna ardhi fulani kule Pwani ambayo iGietupa taabu sana, yaani pale panaposimama ile inayoitwa Diani Complex. Ninafikiri kwamba, kwa hakikav hapakuwa na sababu za kuichukua ardhi hiyo, lakini Serikali ikatumia werevu wa kutosha na kuiambia Konseli ya Kwale ipendekeze mara moja ardhi hiyo iwe ya Serikali. Ardhi hiyo ilikuwa trust land pale mwanzoni na, kwa kuwa palikuwa na tisho kidogo, ardhi hiyo ilitolewa kwa Serikali. Mtukufu Rais Moi alipouchukua uongozi wa nchi hii, alijaribu kusaidia, lakini tatizo lililokuwapo ni kwamba alisema kuwa atafuata Nyayo za hayati Rais Mzee Jomo Kenyatta ambazo alikuwa amekwishafanya mahali hapo tayari. Hata hivyo, tulipata msaada wa kuongezwa kwa thamani ya ardhi hiyo, na wananchi wakaibiwa ekari moja moja ningependa kumpongeza Waziri kwa sababu wananchi hao tayari wamekwishapata sehemu zao za ile ardhi ambayo haikutumiwa hata ingawa hawajapewa zile Sh.5,000 walizotoa kwa kila ekari Waziri amekuwa akiniahidi kwamba pesa hizi zingetoka siku fulani au kesho yake, lakini sasa miaka kadha imepita na baao hazijatolewa. Hata hivyo, sijakata tamaa kwa sababu kwa vile Waziri ametoa ile ardhi ya ekari moja moja, bado ninatumaini kwamba atarudisha zile Sh.5,000 mara moja.Ikiwa ardhi inachukuliwa kwa manufaa ya taifa, sababu yake inaonekana wazi, lakini sababu ya kuichukua ardhi hii ya Pwani haikuwa sawa sawa. Hata hivyo, kwa vile imekwishachukuliwa, tunashukuru sana. Tungependa kuihimiza Serikali ione kwamba wakati wananchi wanapotoa ardhi yao kwa manufaa ya taifa, Serikali yenyewe pia imetoa cirdhi yao, kama ile ya mipango ya makao, kwa manufaa ya wananchi wanaoitwa settlers. Hivi sasa, ardhi ya Serikali inatolewa kwa wananchi pole pole sana. Tungependa sehemu kama ile ya Shimoni itolewe kwampango wa makao ili wananchi wanapoulizwa kutoa ardhi yao wawe wakijua kwamba hata Serikali hutoa ardhi yake pia.Tungependa.mipango ya makao iwe ikiwafaidi wananchi wengi wa sehemu inayohusika Hivi leo, utaona kwamba hata kabla wananchi wa sehemu inayohusikahawatosheka,watu wengine.wanaletwaJcutoka.pembejnbalijnbali.za Kenya.na kupewa makao. Mtindo huu ungefaa kuondolewa ili ardhi ikipatikana, itolewe kwa manufaaya watu wale wanaoishi karibu nayo kwa wingi. Unaweza kuwachukua watu wanne au watano wa Kwale ukawapeleka Kisii ili kuwaonyesha watu wa huko vile watu wa Kwale wanavyoyaendesha mashambayao, lakini haifai kuwachukua watu 40 wa Kwale na kuwapeleka Kisii na pengine ardhi ya Kisii inawatoshea watu 20 tu. Ninajua kuwa huu ni mfano tu kwa sababu ninajua kwamba hakuna ardhi yo yote ya.kutosha kule Kisii.Wasiwasi.wangu katika Mswada huu unahusu mahali pamoja tu, na hapa ndipo nilisema ni lazima Waziri afikirie kupabadilisha. Huenda ardhi inahitajiwa mahali fulani na mahali hapo pana mashine, mitambo na majengo yangu mengi. Utaona kwamba kifungu cha 6(a) kinasema kwamba mwenye vitu hivi ndiye anayefaa kuviondoa, na hii si haki. Ninasema si haki kwa sababu wakati ardhi inahitajiwa na mwenyewe ana mashine zake, nyumba zake na vitu vingine vyake hapo, ridhaa anayolipwa mtu huyu inafaa kulingana na maendeleo anibayo amefanya mahali hapo. Kwa hivyo, ingefaa Serikali inunue siyo ardhi hiyo peke yake, bali pamoja na mitambo iliyopo hapo kwa sababu kama ardhi hiyo ni yangu halafu unaniambia nichukue mashine zangu na hali sina ardhi nyingine, nitazipeleka wapi?. Kwa hivyo, Waziri anafaa kuleta badilisho hapa. Ikiwa mtu mwingine anazitaka mashine hizo, basi ataziniinua kutoka kwa Serikali. Kule kwetu, kwa mfano, tuna mitambo ya sukari na chumvi na, ikiwa ardhi itatakikana huko halafu niambiwe nichukue mitambo yangu, nitaipeleka wapi na sina mahali pengine? Huenda ninakosea, lakini acha nikisome kifungu hiki ndio tujue ukweli uko wapi."3. The principal Act is amended by inserting by inserting the following new section 6A immediately after section 6— 6A (1) Notwithstanding that plant and machinery are attached to land or permanently fastened to the land, the person interested in such plant and machinery may, after receipt by him of the notice of intention to acquire the land under section 6 (2) and not later than fifteen days before the inquiry appointed under section 9 (1) appointed under section 9 (1), serve on the Commissioner a notice in writing that he desires to sever and remove the plant and machinery and the Commissioner shall, within fifteen days, in writing,nofity the person interested whether the plant, and machinery may be severed and removed or whether they are required for the purpose for which the land is intended to be compulsory acquired."Ingefaa pawe na option nyingine kwa sababu mwenye mashine hizi hana mahali pengine pa kuzipeleka. Kwa hivyo, ingefaa mali hii yote iliyoko katika ardhi hiyo ichukuliwe yote na Serikali na, ikiwa Serikali haina haja nazo na mwenyewe ana haja nazo, ajadiliane na Serikali ili azichukue. Tukiacha loophole ndogo hapa, itakuja kuwasumbua watu wengine ambao hawatakuwa na haja na vitu hivi au wale ambao hawatakuwa na uwezo wa kuviondolea mbali. Ninafikiri ingefaa Waziri alete badiliko hapa, na ninataraji kwamba Kaimu Mkuu wa Sheria, mhe. Mibei, ambay.e yuko hapa sasa, anakubaliana nami katika mawazo hay a.Bw. Spika, uchukuaji wa ardhi kwa manufaa ya taifa umekuwa jambo muhimu kwa sababu wakati mwingine tunaweza kuwa na haja kubwa ya ardhi mahali fulani na ni. lazima tuwe na sheria ambayo itailinda Serikali sawa sawa ndipo wakati. inapotaka kuchukua .ardhi hiyo iweze kufanya hivyo bila matatizo yo yote. Walakini, ninasema kwamba wakati mwananchi anataka ardhi ya Serikali kwa matumizi yake, hakufai kuwa na pingamizi nyingi, belli aipewe mara moja kwa sababu huenda anataka kujenga viwanda ambavyo.vinaweza kuwaletea wananchi kazi. Bw. Spika, sina mengi zaidi. Kwa hivyo, kwa hayo machache, naunga rakono.</Newspeech> 	Mr. Speaker left the Chair	 The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kagwima) took the Chair<Newspeech>MR. BOMETT: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me time to contribute to this very important Bill, which is verytimely and which should be seen in conjunction with the work that our Governmenthas carried out in land matters. For one to appreciate the importance of thisBill, he should think and visualise the work that has been carried out in theregistration of land so as to secure the interest of the people of this country.There is nothing else like land in the hearts of the people of this country, andthey value land very much. In fact, they adore it. It is a very wellknownfact that if the British who were ruling this country earlier on had not forcibly acquired land from the people of this country, maybe they would still be ruling the country up to now . However, they made the1 big mistake of acquiring land forcefully and making the people landless.The Government of His Excellency the President has actually demonstrated beyond doubt that it is going to ensure that land, which is so dear to. people , will be protected. That is why this Bill has been brought here, not as a first move but as a second move when we have almost finished land registration and issue of land title deeds to individual owners of land. It is a well known fact and if it is not known it should be recorded that most of the agricultural land in the Central Province has been registered and land title deeds issued. Thus, the land has been protected and given to the people. We are registering other few places in order to enable farmers to use land title deeds to acquire development loans.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, having done that, we have seen that it is necessary now, for the purposes of development, that we have a vehicle , to acquire land for public utility. That. is. why this Bill has been brought to this House, and we believe that it will be passed and be made law. The amendment is straightforward and, in fact, it is protecting the interest of the common man. Whereas in the: past the Commissioner of Lands had all the powers to acquire land compulsory, this time the! Government has introduced an element of disinterested persons whereby we are going to have a tribunal that will consist of a chairman in the form of an advocate and also we shall haver qualified valuers to assist when land is being compulsorily acquired. This element that has been brought in will ensure that the1 interests of the wananchi are protected.Sir, as I have said, this Bill is very straightforward and vital. The hon. Member for Msambweni did raise the question of removal of pland and machinery. I think what he is calling for is wrong because if the owner of the property so wishes to remove his property, he has that option. If we say that we shall make it compulsory that plant and machinery should not be used, then we! shall be working against the interest of a person whose land has been compulsorily acquired and who has an alternative land where he can take his property. Such a fellow has been given a chance to make a decision as to whether he should remove his propertyor not. If we make it compulsory that one should not remove his property, then weshall be tying the hands of wanianchi. In general , I think that everything thathas been proposed in this Bill is to the interest of wananchi and, therefore, should be supported.Another hon. Member did say that squatters who are evicted from Government forests should be compensated. That, cannot be the position because forests are Government land. If someone lives on Government land, then he does so at his own risk and, therefore, if he is evicted the question of compensation does not arise. If you live on land that does not belong to you, then you cannot be compensated upon eviction. So, the Government has every right to protect its forests. Indeed, we have seen that since the removal of squatters from the forests in this country rains have increased, and that is for the common good of everybody. We never had rains during the months of December, January, February and March in Rift Valley Province, but this year we have had rains throughout. That is a big blessing and if the present trend continues and there is no reason why it should not I can foresee ourselves being self-sufficient in food. His Excellency the: President has said time and again that forests should be protected. Since this is also the policy of the ruling party and this House, there should not be any reason why we should suffer famine.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Bill is nothing else but a further protection to our people. It is setting some machinery to be followed whenever the Government wants to acquire land for public utility. In other words, it is devising methods of doing things in a civilised way instead of creating frictions.Sir, I would like to sound a word of warning to our officers in the field, especially to chiefs, district officers and others. Those officers should be very careful when dealing with matters pertaining to land because they should not cause friction by taking sides. A matter like that can bring about a lot of mysery and mistrust in the Government. Land is so important that matters pertaining to it should be handled with care and concern. There is nothing that can makepeople hate the Government like tampering with their property. The vehicle that has been borough to this House should be accepted and passed the way it is. I am saying this because, in relation to the principal Act, this is just an improve¬ment to the situation.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Bill.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

ITaibu Spika wa Muda, jambo lingine muhimu kuhusu Mswada huu linahusu mipango ya makao. Wizara ya Kilimo huwapatia wananchi mashamba chini ya mpango wansettlement schemes. Kwa of ano, tuna Shimba Hills Settlement Scheme ambapo raia rema wa Kenya, wamepatiwe mashamba. ijabu ni kwamba kuna watu wengine ambac wanachukua vyeti vya kumiliki ardhi Icatika mpango huu a makao, na kuhama kabisha. Sasa ardhi hii imekuwa kama mwitu ambapo kuna ndovu, nyani, na ngurue mwitu. Watu kama hawa ndio wamesacabisha njaa katika sehemu ya pwani. vfao wanazidi kujisifu kwamba wana mashamba katika pwani na hata wakati niVinSlne unaweza insrasikiwa wakisema kvramba watu wa prai ni wavivu sajia.Bw. ITaibu Spika wa Muda, ardhi hii ina rotuba sana lakini wenye ardhi hii hawaonekani. Sisi tunawajua watu hawa na hata mkuu wa wilaya anawafahsmu na tumelalamika juu ya wao kwa auda nrefu lakini hakuna jambo lolcte amtalo linefanywa. .Ui. lazima sachacba haya yachukuliwe kwa nguvuna sijui ni kitu gani tunachongojea. ITinaposeca hivyo, ninatumaini kwamba Uaziri anasikia ninavyosema. zbv v. Mpango wa Makao wa Shimba hills ni mmoja ya mipango mingine ya makao katika Uilaya ya Kwale. Katika npango huu wa makao, kuna ya mashamba 500 na ndani ya mashamba haya, watu peke yao ndio wanalina na wengine wote wamehama, na kuweka vyeti vya kumiliki rnashamba yao katika benki. Sasa mashamba haya yamekuwa kama makuu ya ndovu, ngurue mwitu, nyanx na kadhalika. Unapowafukuza hawa nyani, wanatoroka na kuingia katika mashamba haya ambayo sasa yamekuwa kama mwitu. Hi kwa nini mashamba haya hay awezi kuchukuliwa kwa nguvu ili kuwasaidia wale wengine.Bw. ITaibu Spika wa Muda, ni lazima kila mwananchi wa Kenya aafikirie Mkenya X2H awenakeo Hata imeandikwa katikaBunge hili, For the .felfare of Society and the Just Government of Men. Eivyo ni kusema kwamba hata yule mzee aliye na shamba kule Shimba Hills, ni lazima afikiriwe. Eatutaki kwa hivyo kuwasikia watu fulani wanacpewa mashamba katika mpango wa makao halafU baadaye wanahama na kusababisha taabu kwa wengine. Hi lazima aashamba haya yachukuliwe bila xz wenyewe kulipwa ridhaa. ITasema hivyo kwa sababu mashamba haya sasa ni kama 33 mwitu kwa vile wenyewe hawayalimi. Eivyo ni kusema kwamba hakuna maendeleo yoyote katika mashamba haya na v.eriyewe wan a vyeti vya. kumiliki ardhi ile peke yake. Vile wanavyofanya siku hizi ni kujisifu, I have a farm.at the coast, Hata wengine wa watu hawa hawajui mashamba haya yako wapi kwa vile havrajaiika ±± kule, na jambo hili linasababisha matatizo mengi sana na ni lazima tulifikirie kwa makini sana.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, katika sehemu ya Malindi, iruna vfazungu waliopewa znashanba kutoka mnamo k 7alia wa 1°12 chini ya npango wa mashamba wa 99year lease, wengine wa iazungu hawa wamekufa na wengine wamerudi kwao na hatahai julikani sasa wenye mashamba haya walikuwa akina nani.

Hapa wanasema kwamba Mwenyekiti wa hiyo Bodi atakuwa mwanasheriai Mi mi nakubali. Lakini jambo nruhimu ni kwamba ni lazima wananchi wawakilishwe kweaye hiyo Bodi. Yafaa kuteuliwe watu ambao wanazifahaxnu shida za wananchi. Pia hapa wanasema kwamba Waziri ataanma kuhusu mambo ya interest rates. Lakini ukweli ni kwamba wakati mwingine mambo hucheleweshwa na kwamba hivyo ningemaomba Waziri aiangalie tena sehemu hii ya Mswada huu. Hii ni kwa sababu kifungu hi ki kinachohusiana na . interest rates kinaweza kuzusha matatizo mengi saua. Tunajua kwamba ni shida kubwa kupata malipo kutoka kwa Wizara zetu. Hili ni jambo 1 j.nal ojulikana wazi wazi.

Hii ni kwa. sababu katika Kenya hii kuna watu werevu sana kuhusiana na pesa. Kuna watu wajanja sana. Mtu akijua kwamba akichelewesha malipo kutakuwa na interest kubwa basi huenda akafanya hivyo makusudi tu Kuna watu ambao hupenda sana kujipatia pesa za mbwerere na ni lazima kifungu kiangaliwe tena na Waziri anayehusikaj.Hivi sasa tunaombwa tuukubali Nswada huu ma tutaukubali kwa sababu, kama kawaida, tunapenda mambo mazuri.

Haya ndiyo mambo ambayo tunataka yatazamwe kwa kwa sababu ni ya muhlirru sana.Bw. ITaibu Spika wa Muda, kifungu cha 7 (29)(7) ni kizuri. Kinasema hivi:  	“A person interested who is dissatisfied the award of the may apply to theTribunal in the prescribed manner for “Halafu kifungu hiki kinasema kwamba ikiwa mtu hajatosheka na uamuzi wa Kamishna anaweza kutumamaombi yake kwa Tribunal ama High Court.

So, instead of solving a problem, we shall be adding a problem on top of another. Tena, tunataka kum Tjatia Waziri shida nyingine. Hii itakuwa ni shida juu ya shida Kwa hivyo, ingefaa those cases that should appealthe High,Court to be of a certain magnitude above these rates.

Ingefaa Waziri aelezemambo haya hapa kinaganaga ni namna gani kesi hizi za mashambazinaweza kutatuliwa ikiwa mtu ana malalamiko. Hii ni kwa sababu kwetu Pwani kuna watu wengi ambao walinyakxta mashamba kwa njia sihalali, .na tuna kesi za aina hii nyingi sana kortini. Unajua kwamba ikiwa mtu ameshapata hati ya kuimiliki ardhi fulani ni lazima	kortini kama umeridhika ama hukuridhika. Hili ndilo tatiso ambalo liko sasa Pwani. La mwisho, Bw. ITaibu Spika wa Muda, ni kuhusu Wizara ya Ardhi na Nyumba yenyewe. Asubuhi utapata kwamba watu wote wanakwenda katika ofisi ya Wizara hii, na tungependa kuwe na mpango ma alum wa kuwahudumia watu. Kwa mfano, tungependa kuwe na mpango kama wa kutumia nambari ili wa kwanza ahudusiwe kwanisa, yaani first come, first served. Ikiwa huendi katika ofisi ya Vlisara kufuata jambo lako b as i we we utakufa bila kupata chochote. Kwa hivyo, ningeomba Wizara iwe na mpango maalum ama kamili wa kuwahudumia.watu wote.

MWENJE: Thank you very, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I wish also to support this Bill which is quite important and has come at the right time. It will go along way to solving a lot of problems which have remained unsolved, particularly for those with big plans which, have been affected.As we are seated now here, one of those areas which have been affected happens to be in ray Constituency of Embakasi. It was only this week when a Power line passed over certain land of some quarry owners. Because of this power line which has just passed over there, the quarry owners who have been there from time immemorial have had to be told that they cannot blast their quarries because the power line has passed over there are of just should thereby these lay effecting land acquisition and only of the quarry owners.When we are talking of acquisition of land, we must be very careful because we must also avoid trying to acquirer land where there has been other plans nearby. For instance, in this particular area we have nine quarries with very expensive and heavy machinery which have now been .stopped from working because of this acquisition by the Kenya Power higgling companies Causing about 5,000 people to lose employment when these quarries be closed down. So, we must very very careful when we are trying to acquire land, particularly where there is heavy machinery especially now that this Act is saying that the cost of transferring these machinery will be borne by the owners of the plants.For example if they had to move such machinery each one of them is bound to cost them not less than shs.l million. Now the Act requires them, to remove such machinery or plants at their own expense. So this is the reason why I am suggesting that whenever the Government is acquiring any piece of land it should try as much as possibly to avoid those that have machinery or plants on them.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am glad to say that of late the Ministry of Lands, Housing arid Physical Planning has improved the services that it officers to the public. Wananchi are now happy that they no longer need to queue at Ardhi House where in the end they ended up not getting the services that they required. So we are glad that the Minister has been able to introduce some positive moves in his Ministry which has reduced drastically the number of people we used to see standing or sitting around Ardhi House.We must not .abandon our other responsibility of taking care of our of people who will be affected by this Act. Although when land is being acquired we ask wananchi to co-operate that acquisition must be reasonable and. must be seen to be fair to everybody. The Government should ensure that they do not effect any acquisition of land where there are plants or machinery because it is very expense to the affected people to move all the machinery and plants. So the Government should ensure that acquisition of land takes place only when it is necessary. People can understand when their land is acquired for purposes of constructing a road or setting up a public facility. I hope that the Minister will take care of the Kenya Power and Lighting company and the quarry owners. Today there is a shortage of balast in the City of Nairobi because these quarry owner's are not able to blast their quarries to. be able to operate because of the acquisition by the Kenya Power and Lighting Company people. I hope that the Minister will step in and try to solve this problem before it grows and affect the employment of these people.Let us give credit where it is due. I have an example of anarea in ray constituency where people had to move to give way to giver to a construction by the Kenya Army. As a result of this my people were moved to another area and although they may not have been compensated for financially -they were allocated another area where they were able to put up houses. So I would like to differ with the hon. Member referred to a certain case in Lamu where people were removed but were not adequately compensated for financially. These people were given an alternative place of land elsewhere to settle. Although these people were not given any money as compensation, they were atleast allocated permanent pieces of land on which to put up their houses. So sometimes we should try to inform our people that sometimes because of security reasons, land has to be acquired by the Government. So I would like to differ with, the hon. Member who said that the removal of these people in Lamu for security reasons was wrong. I. would rather the hon. Member advised these allottees to accept these plots and develop them because land in that area, is the same. We should not. try to mix petty issues with serious acquisi¬tion. We will always support the Government where acquisition of land is necessary. But whenever possible the Government should look for alternative areas to acquire land. I sincerely hope that the officers charged with such responsibility will not misuse their powers by acquiring land without looking for alternative land to acquire. They should always try to -go and discuss with the affected people before they acquire their land. This is because although the Act is there to be applied in such cases, it is only fair to discuss with the affected people to see whether an amicable solution can be arrived at. It is not fair to acquire a person's land when there could have been an alternative land elsewhere. I am saying so because officers can misuse the powers of the act to settle personal scores. For example, if the land of a person has personal differences with an officer in the Ministry when it comes to compensation and acquisition of his land this officer my bring in personal differences and thus cloud his judgement. So I am not for acquisition of people's land just because the Act exists. So I would like to ask the Minister not give a free hand to his officers where this issue is concerned.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, land is so important to us Africans that most of us would opt for land instead of all other things. money because the value of land is not just financial but also sentimental. So when a person is displaced from his land, there is no compensation that can be given to him that is equal to his sentimental value for that land. Matters become worse when the land has some history on it. So,we must avoid such lands unless we have no other alternative but to acquire them.There are land boards in the up-country that consider land matters which meet once a month. The problem occurs now when somebody needs to borrow money but he cannot do so unless it is sanctioned by this board. I think there should be a provision where a person can request for a special land board meeting instead of having to wait for the monthly period that has been set aside by the Minister.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think a provision' should be made for special Land Control Board meetings where an individual can request the Board to sanction a particular issue. This is because I have seen cases where some people have lost large amounts of money, perhaps, loans just because the 3oara did not meet at the material time. The Minister should consider incorporating a provision where such meetings can be called like in the Liquor Board and so on.I am glad that in most cases, Land Control Board meetings are chaired by administration officials who are supposed to be impartial in their deliberations. Since the chairman of such a Board makes the final ruling, it is, therefore, necessary to have a provision where the aggrieved party can have the opportunity of airing his views further, and' make some kind of appeal. For example, when district officers are not there, such meetings are chaired by the chiefs who may have interest since they come from that locality.It is therefore, necessary for the Minister to clarify that such meetings in the absence of the district officers, should be chaired' by a member of the Board rather than by the chiefs. Perhaps, the district officers can be impartial because they are always under transfer from one place to another and will, therefore, not have a lot of interest. When such meetings are chaired by a chief, there is some likelihood that some interest will be reflected.So, I would appeal to the Minister to consider this kind of situation which can arise.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS(Mr. Mibei): On a point of information Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. It is not true that chiefs chair Land Control Board meetings. It is usually done by the administration officials such as the district commissioner or the district officer but not the chief. May be, if the hon. Member has any instance in mind, then we would like to know about it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am surprised that the hon. Minister is saying, this. Almost in all Sand Control Board meetings I. have attended which are normally chaired by district officers because they belong to the divisions, in the absence of the district officers, such meetings are chaired by chiefs. I have said that I have attended.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING Mr. ole : Caparo): On a point of information, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Under the Land Control Act, there are provisions under Section 10 and 12 which spell out the composition of the Land Control Board. For the benefit of hon. Mwenje, I would like to read that regulation as follows:(l)The Land Control Board shall consist of:(i)	The District Commissioner of the district in which the land control area or division is situated or a district officer deputed by him (the district commissioner) in writing he shall be chairman (ii)	Not more than two other public officers,(iii)	Two persons nominated by the county council having jurisdiction.- within the area of jurisdiction", of the Board; and(iv)	Not less than three and not more than seven persons resident within the area of jurisdiction of the Board."It is absolutely clear that the chiefs have no authority and have not chaired those Boards.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

I am saying that in the absence of the district officer.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Kr.Mbela): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I appoint the members of the Land Control Board and I have no chief who is a member of that 3oard in this country. If he attends such a meeting, he does so as a stranger and he cannot, therefore, chair a meeting.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: we are now getting somewhere. I would now like to inform the hon.

I have attended some of those meetings because I have a piece of land there and I would like to refer hon. Nduati Kariki to go and check the Board's.

Mwenje cannot continue to mislead the House. He made a categorical statement when he first said that in the absence of the district officers, chiefs chair Land Control Board meetings secondly, he said that all chiefs meaning all over the Republic are members of the Land Control Board. How can we continue to to be misled by hon. Mwenje when we know too well that what he is saying is not true? Can he withdraw or substantiate his allegation?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: Sir, let me clarify the point so that we understand one another whichever Board meetings I have attended, I have seen chiefs in attendance. I have been believing and made to believe that they are member of the Land Control Board.

I am surprised that hon. Mwenje purports to know more about Makuyu, than the hon. Member Makuyu. The information which I have is that the chiefs in Makuyu do not attend or even chair Land control boards. I am surprised to hear the hon.

MWENJE: Sir, I am speaking about this Bill because is going to affect the whole country. Therefore, if "anybody thinks that what I am 	saying is not right, I prepared to get the minutes of those land control board meetings which the chiefs have attended and even chaired there. I will lay those minutes on the Table of this House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. ole Kaparo): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the hon. Member is continuously and deliberately trying to mislead the House. His first premise was and I remember what he said quite well was the chiefs	 were chairing land control board meetings in place of either the district commissioner or the district officer. When his premise was proved untrue after I had read the relevant provisions of the law, the hon. Member turned to the attendants of the meetings. If he says that the chiefs attend those meetings, there is nothing wrong with that, because they can do so as spectators, just like any other a Kenyan or resident of that particular area They can also go to give evidence or even give advice where necessary. I do not think that was the point in question the question was on the chairing of those meetings by the chiefs. If hon. Mwenje has got evidence contrary to the provisions of the law and what the hon. Minister has stated, can he prove it?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: Sir, unfortunately, we have some hon. Members 	who are not listening to the debate. The Minister said that the chiefs are not even supposed to attend the meetings. Some of the chiers attend those meetings., and there is one or two . cases where chiefs even, have changed the meetings. That has been happening, and I will stand by that information until the end of the world . because it is true and I have witnessed it. In one particular meeting I had presented my own case.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL HERITAGE (Mr. Lalampcla): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Hon. Muenje is just trying to explain. one issue in many sue words, but he cannot get away with it. He made a categorical statement that in the absence of the district commissioners on district officers, the chiefs normally chair the land control board meetings. We know that it is wrong to do that.

I think you would save the House a lot or time by naming just two meetings where you witnessed chiefs attending or even chairing land control board meetings.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE:. Sir, I will name those meetings. It might help the House, because the Minister will be able to check on minutes of those particular meetings. I attended two land control board meeting in a certain place between Makuyu and Kigumo. At that time that area was in Makuyu Constituency, but now it is in Kigumo Constituency, The first meeting was chaired by a chief, and the other one was chaired by a district officer. The are specific meeting and if anybody is doubting, that information, I am prepared even to get the minutes and give them to the Minister because that is a fact.Sir, I am not here to belittle anybody.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL HERITAGE (Mr. Lalampaa): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Hon. Mwenje did not react to a point of order which was raised by hon. ole Kaparo. Hon. Mwenjet said that hon. Members should be taken to a course to learn what are points of order. Is he in order to impute that other hon. Members are ignorant? He does not even know our Standing Orders. When an hon. Member raises a point of order, he should be given time to state his point of order. If the hon. Member conserved does not react to it, or does not answer the point of. order satisfactorily, then hon. Members have to raise further point of order again to remind him to reply. No since hon. Mwenje is trying to evade the whole issue, we have to raise further order to make him understand. He is totally ignorant of he Standing Orders of this House. Can he therefore, withdraw and apologise for imputing that hon. Members are ignorant?.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: First of all, I would like to inform the hon.

Hon.

MWENJE: I am glad, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, because you heard my withdrawal, which I put very clearly because I am very clear in whatever I say. So, I do not need to. repeat the withdrawal instead I should proceed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Order, Mr. Mwenje I 	have asked you to repeat your withdrawal of the statement that all chiefs chair. land control board, meetings. This is a ruling from the Chair, and you should obey it so that all of us may hear you now.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is the second time I am withdrawing the statement that all chiefs chair land control board meetings. I do not know what happens in other areas, but I said that I was referring to specific cases.Proceeding with what I was saying, in certain areas, you find that estate developers are supposed to surrender some land that is meant for public utility to the Commissioner of Lands before they develop it or carry out sub division. This should be strictly followed so that the Commissioner of Lands may subsequently allocate this land for public utility. It is important that this land be set aside.I would like to cite some of the estates within the city where developers have been doing quite a good job. These estates include Doonholm, 	Green view and others. This work should be checked thoroughly so as to ensure that, this land is set aside for that use. It is my opinion that the Minister should go round the estates that developers are developing not only to see that they set aside land for public utility, but also to ensure that they, develop schools and other social institutions. These people make a lot of money developing houses, and yet the people who buy the houses are the same ones who are left to build schools, but they do not do so; instead, they Leave this work to the rest of the public. It is necessary for the Minister to look around for a kind of are that will ensure that developers do not only set aside that land, but also develop schools, hospitals, social halls and other social amenities that the public will require. I do not know whether this is true, but it has been said that some developers do not even set aside such land. We have a lot of land being developed by developers or companies that have been buying land within the country. Therefore, it is necessary that this land be set aside.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is another section of the Bill, that is clause 9, regarding compensation. The 3ill says that if. you are not paid in time and you appeal, and then the amount involved, happens to increase, the difference, will accrue interest at the rate of not less than six per cent. I feel that talking about six per cent, this is a very small figure at the moment especially when you consider that today's rates of interest have gone up to 17 and 18-per cent, so, six per cent is hot even a half of the prevailing in teres rates today. Instead of having six per cent here, which figure can be used for the purpose of compensation, I think the Minister should leave it open by saying that the difference I have mentioned will accrue interest to be calculated at the prevailing bank rates. Six per cent interest is totally outdated when it comes to being paid interest by any bank.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Mbeia) : On a point of information, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think it is quite obvious from the clause, the hon. Member is quoting that this rate of interest will not be less than six per cent. If you look at the clause dealing with the memorandum of objects and reasons, you will see that it is stated clearly that the Minister will have power to prescribe this rate of interestfrom time to time. This will be done by regulation, depending on the prevailing rates of interest. At this particular time, the rate of interest is certainly not six per cent, although this is the rate that was prevailing in 1968.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am glad for this information and for the fact that the Minister is aware that six per cent is not the prevailing rate of interest today or anywhere near the current rate.Saying that this rate will be more than six per cent is not enough because, since seven per cent is more than six per cent, you could use seven per cent for the purpose of compensation. So, there should mention of the prevailing rates of interest to avoid ambiguity. When the Minister comes to reply, it is important that he gives consideration to this rate of interest.The other area that I feel is quite important has been touched on by another hon. Member. When you talk of members of a tribunal, lawyers and two valuers the latter of which there are only three you must realise that these are simply professionals Most members of the public are not professionals and. therefore, it is important that the tribunal should have a person who shall be responsible to the public. I suggest that the tribunal should include either a councillor or a Member of Parliament or any other person who represents members of the public in other fora. Lawyers of not represent members of the public unless they are paid.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, looking at the tribunal itself, it may happen that your lawyer could be the person who is appointed in the tribunal. You need a person who actually represents members of the public. After all, whose land are we talking about? We are talking about land owned by individual members of the public. Therefore, it is important that the Minister responsible for this Bill reviews this particular provision. Even if it means reducing the membership of the professionals in the tribunal and including a member of the public instead, then he should do it because members of the public have every right to be represented in the tribunal. That way, they will believe that they will receive a fair deal. The appointment of the tribunal should be done just like in appointing members of the land control board where people who are well versed in certain areas are appointed. I think it should be fair to have a person who is well versed with the affairs of the public being appointed to the tribunal to represent members of the public.When we talk of compensation, Mr. Temporary deputy Speaker, Sir, we have professional valuers like hon. Nduari Kariuki who can be appointed to assist. but also have the other value where the other person will feel that this was supposed, to be my value as opposed to the professional point of view. That is where the negotiation I am nor saying that hon. Nduari Kariuki should be appointed to the tribunal. I am only saying that.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. ole Kaparo): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think hon. Mwenje should tell this House who is that other group of valuers other than the qualified valuers. I am raising that point of order for the guidance of the House.MR. MWENJE. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not understand what the Assistant Minister1s point of order is all about.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. ole Kaparo): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I can gladly repeat point or order. Mr. Mwenje said that valuers like hon. Nduati Kariuki are only qualified valuers and that there should be other valuers to ascertain that other aspect which the qualified valuers cannot ascertain. I am inquiring of the hon. Member who those other valuers, other than the qualified ones, are.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are people who are qualified in matters of the public like me and other hon. Members of Parliament. When it comes to dealing with affairs of the public, I am qualified. I am sure that hon. ole Kaparo is also qualified in that aspect, otherwise, I am surprised that he is here. I am talking about a situation where we have people in the tribunal who understand the affairs of the: public, in addition to the professionals. It is important to have members of the public represented properly in this tribunal.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, to conclude my speech, let me say that. I am glad that the Ministry is really concerned about the members of the public in as far as compensation to those whose land will be acquired under this Sill is concerned. At the same time, I would like to add that it is important that the compensation process should be done quickly. When the land on which you depend for your livelihood is acquired and then you are not compensated for about one year or two, then you are subjected to a lot of suffering. If quickly compensated. the man whose land has been acquired can look for an alternative land elsewhere and settle down- So, it is important that compensation should be paid almost immediately ones land has been acquired.Sir, I also feel that the question of interest should not be there at all. I tend to differ with one hon. Member who said that the Minister for Lands, Housing and Physical Planning should set some figures which should go to court and others which should not. KShs-20,000/- may be a little amount to one person out a lot of money to another. So, let everybody have a right of appeal' to the High Court. No amount should be set that should be taken to the court If your compensation is agreed on KShs. 10,000/- and you feel that that amount is not fair, then you should be able to go to court to contest it because the court will cater for the cost of the case. So, I tend to agree with the Minister that everybody should have a right to contest any decision in a court of law. All cases should be traced the same because they do not affect only one person; they affect different people of different status and positions. With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I very strongly support the Bill.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Kariuki): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Before I make my contribution, I would like to to make my contribution very clear, that chiefs in Makuyu Constituency do not chair, land control board meetings.Having said that. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I must join my hon colleagues in thanking the hon. Minister for Lands, Housing and Physical Planning for coming up with this very beautiful Bill. The rationale or the principle behind this Bill is the provision in our Constitution that protects the rights of the properties of an individual. The Constitution clearly says that where any property is required for public use, there will first of all be a compensat¬ion that will be 'adequate and prompt. I think most of the provisions of the Bill are merit to rectify any faults that may have been there and which made it difficult to the provisions to be catered for. They ensure that the compensation is there and that it is prompt. 	Of course, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the most important provision of the 3ill is to be found in Section 7, which sets up a tribunal. In order to appreciate the importance of this Section, one has to take into consideration what the situation is at present. The situation at present is such that whenever land has to be acquired compulsory, it is the Commissioner of Lands who sets up an inquiry to find exactly what is the value of the land and what compensation is to be paid. In other words, the situation is such that the Commissioner of Lands is a judge in a case where he himself is a party. That does not, of course, auger well for our sense of justice and, for that matter, I am grateful to see that this is what the Bill seeks to aright.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, sir, the only request like to make to the Minister and I hope he is listening it with regard to Section 6 which is amending Section 19 which says:-“After the award has been made, the commissioner shall take possession of the land by serving on every person interested in the land a notice that on a specified date, which shall not be latter than 60 days, after the award has been made, possession of the land the title to the land, will vest in the Government”,Here, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, sir, I am talking about the 60 days. When we are talking about the compulsory acquisition of land we are talking about somebody who is losing his home and who has to look for an alternative place to go. What this amendment is saying therefore, is that after 60 days on receiving the award, this person whose land has been taken, will have to look for an alternative place to go. With the situation as it is today it is impossible for anybody to find a replacement in 60 days. Let us be factual when we consider this. If today, you were dislodged from your shamba or from your home where you have lived throughout your lifetime, and asked to find an alternative home within 60 days, this will be nearly impossible. Therefore , I hope that the Minister will increase the period of notice.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, sir, I would now like to come to section 7 of the Bill. As I said, I am very glad that a tribunal. It says that the tribunal will have one advocate with not less than ten years experience who shall be the chairmen of the tribunal. There shall also be two registered values in the tribunal. Eon. Mwanje said that be would like the tribunal to have more unregistered valuers, but I think the assessment of the value of land is a very technical matter and therefore, it is not something that we can leave to laymen. Therefore, I totally disagree with Eon. Mwanje then he says that we should include laymen in the tribunal because we should have technical people with skills to enable them to assess how much compensation is supposed to be paid for land acquired by Government.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, sir, I would also like to advise.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: On point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister really in order to say that he disagrees with the idea of having laymen in this tribunal while he knows very well that most land disputes have been certled by laymen, particularly the rural areas.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Kariuki); Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am very much aware of what the hon. Member is saying, but in this particular Bill, we are talking about land valuation and not land disputes. We are not talking about land cases where there is a depute as to who owns a pises of land or who inherited it. Here, we are talking about land valuation; we are talking about accounts and this is a job that requires skill, and therefore, it is different from the question of deciding who owns a piece of land. 'The question of land disputes can be left to the laymen, but when it cores to land valuation, re require skilled people.</Newspeech>Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the ether point which I would like to make is that this Bill will now free people those land has been taken compulsorily from going to the High Court. You know how expensive it is to put a case to the High. Court. Previously, we knew what has been happening in the High Court where outstanding awards have been made just because this tribunal had not been set up. We are even aware of one case where somebody was given an award of Shs.23 million for 17 acres of land at Roys Sambu that we have a tribunal which will be comprised of skilled people to adjudicate, Government is going to save money that it would otherwise, have lost, through, cases going to the</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: On a point' of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker The Assistant. Minister has mentioned a very serious case Where seme body was paid Shs.23 million for 17 acres. Can he	substantiate this allegation by telling us who was involved in this case because we did net hear of such a case?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR FINANCE (Mr. Kariuki): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member wants me to substantiate a fact and I would like to tell him that the case I am referring to is in the courts records. I am not saying this is wrongsine it was a judgement made by the High Court and we cannot challenge it. All I am stating is a fact that an award of Shs.2l million was given for 17 acres at Roys Sanbu.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER(Mr. Kagrima): Yes, out I think the hon. Member ranted to know who were involved in this case. wanted to know who was paid Shs.22 million through the award of the High Court.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Kariuki): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the hon. Member wants to quote 3d: the case number, I would do so in the near future, but I must say that this case was even published in the newspapers and is in the court's records. However, if the hon Member wishes me to bring the actual case number I am quite prepared to do that. However, let me take one point clear that I am not saying the court judgement was wrong since we cannot challenge</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

MWENJE: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. did not challenged your so that we can see it in accordance with, your ruling.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwika) : Let it get it quite clear new, The hon. Assistant Minister is using the same document to contribute to the Bill and when he finishes his contribution, hon. Members oar. have a lock at the dement.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Kariuki) : Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. As I was saying, before I was rather rudely interrupted the establishment of a tribunal is something that should be hailed. This is because here we are saving the common mwananchi the problem of having to go to the High Court, knowing very well the high expanses that one has to incur to put his case to the High Court. So, I entirely agree with the setting up of the Tribunal; I entirely agree with the composition of the Tribunal. I think this is something that no hon. Member will find difficult to support However, I have one suggestion to make to the Minister; that we do seem to have too many tribunals dealing with land matters in the country. It is my view that we have too many tribunals dealing with valuation of land. After this Bill has been passed we will have the Land Acquisition Compensation Tribunal, the Rent Restriction Tribunal which is also a valuation tribunal and we will have a tribunal under the Landlord and Tenant, Shops and Catering Establishments Acts This is also a valuation tribunal. We also have another tribunal that caters for rating valuation. I would suggest that instead, of having these too many valuation tribunals, doing more or less the same kind of work, we should have one land valuation tribunal that will cater for all valuation; be it valuation for rating, landlord tenant, hotels and catering establishments or rent restriction. I do believe that if we had one valuation tribunal, maybe with branches all over the country, this would speed up. valuation work." It would also streamline ail matters that are concerned with valuation. This is because when a tribunal is valuing a piece of property, many facto come into consideration. The rent that is payable forthat property comes into consideration Under the present system,that rent section is catered for by a different tribunal So, I dobelieve that if all these tribunals could be amalgamated into onevaluation tribunal then this would be like a pool . This one tribunalwould have a pool of knowledge on all matters affecting valuation 'So, I would like- to request the Minister to consider that point. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me divert a littleand talk about the i control boards This was a very favouritesubject in this House just a few minutes ago These boards are very.Important But it has become evident that some of the people inthese land control boards do not actually understand the Land ControlBoard Act. They should all be taken to seminars to understandexactly what they are supposed to arbitrate. This is because I dobelieve that some of them are confused as to whether they are aldersto determine cases or decide inheritance cases or cases of ownership But the Act is very clear These people are supposed todecide on transactions of land whether A can transfer his land to They are not supposed to take over the work of elders They arenot supposed to take over the work of magistrates. But you will findthat in some cases the members of the land control boards becauseprobably of not being well informed properly about their role consider themselves as magistrates or elders to adjudicate on cases and related matters I say this because according to the Act, they are supposed to control land transactions and especially to see whether the person selling land is going to be left landless or destitute. They are also supposed to see whether the price is expositive. These are the two issues that they are supposed to consider. They are not supposed to consider hew you got that land.If the court or the elders have given you the lard it is not thebusiness of the land control board members to adjudicate on that matter. Theirs is to adjudicate on the transactions concerning that land.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, these land control board members should be requested to take note of the fact that not every¬body in Kenya wants to become a farmer. There are some people who would like to depart from farming and go into other activities like industry and business. But the problem is that when an enterprising wants to leave farming and goes to the land control board to inform them that he wants to sell his land go into industry, he is told "If you do not have another land then you cannot sell the land you have now. In other words, he is being forced to be a farmer when his heart is not farming. I think, in cases where somebody has an alternative source of livelihood, it does not matter whether he has agricultural or not. If he is going to establish an industry we do welcome that activity. So, he should not discourage from doing so just because he does not have an alternative agricultural land. This is because the person who wants to buy that land may be a keener farmer than the person who is. holding the land. We should not just imagine that everybody in Kenya can become a farmer. No. That is not possible We do want other people to venture into other activities to create employment by going into, business or industry. So, let us not insist that people should be farmers when they do not want to be farmers. I do believe that the land control boards should relax their attitudes a bit in as far as land transactions are concerned.  Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me also say that the land control boards are doing a very good job. They have saved situations that could have been very explosive where people would. have sold their land only to go back to the Government and cry that they are landless. I think these boards have been of great assistance to our people.I must also mention that we all owe a Lot of gratitude to His Excellency the President because of the personal interest he has taken in the problems facing the people of this country.

Box 1971, Kitale, cannot be refunded her share contribution of shs.29,500.00 together with interest as the society has no money to pay her. All the society's money is lying with their advocate, who is working on their behalf to purchase land.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could I know from the Assistant Minister what happened to the members' contributions to this society?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EJORE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mango Farmers Co-operative Society was registered as a farm purchase society. The society currently has a total membership of 410 out of which 250 are settled on the farm as squatters. This society was to purchase a piece of land of 600 acres from Mr. Mwangi Kabure. This farm is in Endebess Location, Kwasa Division. From 11th June, 1986 to 11th September, 1989, the society collected shs.2.8 million for the purchase of the land. Out of this money, shs.876,300.00 was refunded to 127 members. Another amount of shs.125,500/ has been given out to the committee members as soft loans. Other 17 members have also been given shs.43,695.00. The remaining balance was given to the vendor as deposit, but he rejected the amount and the money is lying with the society's advocate, Messrs. Simiyu Wetangula & Company Advocates. The vendor is asking for shs.14 million for the land. It is not possible for the society to settle all its members as the workers of Mr. Mwangi Kabure on learning that he was selling the land, got together and formed anotherfarm purchasing co-operative society to purchase the same piece of land This society is known as Namutokolo Multipurpose Co-operative Society. All their members totalling about 200 are also squatting on the same land. At one time Mango Farmers Co-operative Society Limited took Namutokolo to court in order for the latter to be evicted, but the case was .unsuccessful as both were not legal owners of the the land- but mare squatters.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the society currently has no money and is not in a position to repay its members unless they withdraw from buying the farm and use the money that is with the advocates to repay members. Alternatively, Mrs. Makokha can get hers money back if someone was willing to buy her shares.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

In normal cases when the Government has a certain project in mind,   those people who are being moved should be paid first so that they can go and acquire alternative settlement before they are moved. 	The land in question was acquired in 	1988 and the owners have not been compensated to date and they must have been inconvenienced a lot. Where are they settled now?

B.A. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that health  centre cannot  be  expanded because   the  current  utilization is under   	 capacity. The out-patient monthly attendance stands at about 	  1170 patients  that is about 40 out patients per day. As regards in patient attendance	 the number of bed occupants stands at about 1.1 per cent. The health centre is under utilized by 88.9 per cent.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. arap CHEPKOK: I think the Assistant Minister is misleading the House.

If up to this moment,  some patients go to other health centres for treatment why should	he therefore, say that the health centre has got adequate facilities?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR: B.A. GODANA: Sir; I have given authoritative data which my Ministry has.  If the hon.

The hon. Member has made a very serious allegation which he cannot confirm.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEPKOK:  Sir, I have not made, any allegation. It is a well known fact.

We know it.That is what I am telling the Assistant Minister for Health.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY	SPEAKER:	Order!	Mr.  arap Chepkok,  I thinkyou can afford to be kind to the Front Bench.	Instead of generalising 	 the situation, perhaps, you could pin point out those particular members  in the Front Bench who have left questions unanswered. 	The Chair is not aware of such incidents.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. arap CHEPKOK: 	Sir,  hon.  Ogle is one of them. 	I would now like to ask-</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER: 	Order, Mr.  arap Chepkok.  I would like to refer you to Standing Order No.73, which is about imputing improper motive on another hon. Member. Since hon.  Ogle is not here, you better. withhold those remarks for the time being.	He is not here to defendhimself against those members. and it is having a general effect on afforestation in the area.  Secondly, the pricing structure of	that is the money paid to farmers for their curedtobacco, is very little.	Since this is a multi-national company that is capableof running its own afforestation schemes and building its own curing barns, it is simple logic to direct the company to save the farmer by building its own tobacco curing barns.	Would the Assistant Minister agree to this?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGARURO:	No, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will not agree to thisrequest because the whole operation is based on the fact that B.A.T. contracts farmers to grow tobacco and use their own firewood to dry the tobacco. Before these farmers are contracted by B.A.T., they are required to plant trees for the purpose of curing their tobacco and, in this case, they do not encroach on natural forests. Therefore, there is no need of changing the whole set up because doing this would mean extra expenses on the part of the farmer that we want to protect.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>Mr. mangoli: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is very interesting that the Assistant Minister insists that he is not going to do anything about this problem.  B.A.T. is making a lot of profit, and it can afford to build tobacco curing barns at its own cost.	So, could the Assistant Minister direct the companyto take over this service that the farmer is now supplying?	It appears that theMinistry is colluding with this multi-national company.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR.  arap CHEPKOK:	I am not a Masai, but I think yourname is ole “Nkuparu”. I. have now corrected myself.	I think youcan now allow me to ask my supplementary question.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

Deputy Speaker Sir.Hon. ole Kaparo is a very qualified lawyer.	Was he	n order to refer to thestatement made by hon. Chepkok and say that he was rumour mongering in the House? Can there be rumour mongering in Parliament?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING 	(Mr. ole Kaparo): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, to the best of my information, any information that is not factual must be hearsay and, consequently in local balance, rumours. Hon. Chepkok said that he was not in the House at the time in question and that he read what he said in the papers, that is, he got this information from external sources.	Surely, that could only be rumours.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER:	Hon. Members, let us not labour the point here.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI:	On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker., Sir.	Is theAssistant Minister in order to continue to impute an ill motive in respect of an hon. Member of this House when the latter has clearly said that what he is saying is not rumours as it was in the newspapers? How can this be termed rumours? We would like the Assistant Minister to withdraw his remark in this regard because  what has been published cannot be rumours.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING 	(Mr. ole Kaparo):Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Attorney General, in reference to the answer given by hon. Ogle, clearly stated that that answer was correct and that anybody  who said that it was not correct was, therefore, not speaking the truth. 	This is in the HANSARD.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MANG-OLI : 	On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. 	Since you are a lawyer, I think we had better</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER:	Order, Mr. Mang'oli!	As I said, I think thisis only a matter of semantics as far as the Chair is concerned, and it was saidwith a very light touch.	It is also important for hon. ole Kaparo to note that there is freedom of speech in this House and that words that can be misconstrued to be unparliamentary should not be used here.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. WASIKE NDOMBI: 	On a point of order, Ar. Deputy Speaker, Sir. In the light of your ruling, could the hon. assistant Minister now withdraw his remarks?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

I urge the hon. Assistant Minister for Health to get in touch with his officers in the field in order to get a proper answer because the data he has given us is wrong.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure hon.

This is why I am telling the Assistant Minister that what he is saying is not correct. 	 When I said that people were dying from a certain disease in my 	 constituency, in Elgeyo Marakwet, last week, the Ministry sent its officers there but, instead of treating the sick, they merely taught them in public places as to why people were dying. Is this not the truth? This is why I am urging  the Assistant Minister to  go back to the officers in the field to give him the  proper data.	I cannot agree to the data he is now giving us.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER:	Order, Mr. Chepkok!	In order to disprove whatthe Assistant Minister is saying, he has actually invited you to come up withdata different from his.	He has said that this health centre is under utilisedby 88.9 per cent, and I would advise you not to mix issues up.<Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK:	On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.	I told	the Assistant Minister that I know the area in question.	I also know that somecouncillors give lifts in their own cars to patients and bring them to Kapsowar,Tambach and Iten.	How can the Assistant Minister now say that the health centrethere is under utilised.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.	I think we have a smallproblem here.	Hon. Chepkok never feels satisfied when he does not get the answerthat he would love to hear.	Unfortunately, this is the stuff of which life ismade, that is, sometimes, you have to hear unpleasant things here and there.	Theunpleasant thing in this case is that this health centre is heavily under utilised, and the Government does not have resources to waste in building it while the present facilities in the health centre are not even fully utilised. So, it is not proper for the hon. Member to say that just because he is a member of Parliament from that district.  interestingly, he is not even the hon. Member for that particular area   he is the sole</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR:	On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.	It isvery much out of order for the hon. Assistant Minister to mislead the House.What hon. Chepkok says is absolutely true.	Could the Assistant Minister clarifywhat he means by saying that this health centre is under utilised by 88	percent?	People in that area are dying every day.	When you transport a patient by a private vehicle, he passes away on the road before you get to a health centre, and there are no sufficient transportation means nor enough medicine in the health institutions there.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>DR: B.A. GODANA:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Kipkorir should havebeen courteous enough to apologies first because when he  says that he does</Newspeech>   (Applause)<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER:	Did I hear hon.

KIPKORIR:	Mr, Deputy Speaker, Sir, I apologise for coming late</Newspeech>   (inaudible). <Newspeech>B.A. GODANA: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,  I am now pleased with this courtesy. Hon. Kipkorir does not. understand what I said because he quotes the figure of 88 per cent, but this is because he was not here. when I gave the data that made us arrive at the conclusion that the said health centre is under utilised by 88.9 per cent.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

B.A. GODANA:	Again, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have another hon.Member here who was either out of the Chamber or asleep when I read out the main answer to the Question before us. I said that the daily attendance of out patients in this health centre is only 	40 persons, and that occupancy is only</Newspeech> (Several Members stood up in their places) <Newspeech>MR.

What I was doing was trying to alert you to. the fact that hon. Members are standing up on points of order when another hon. Member  is on a different point of order.	I do not know what the Chair is doing about 	   	       	                     educating hon. Members on the fact that when an hon.

Is theAssistant Minister in order, while in his seat, to teach the Chair what shouldbe done?	After all, the Chair had given its ruling on the matter.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER:	Well, Mr. Mang'oli, as a matter of fact, that isprecisely what I had in mind because hon. Karauri could have stood up to draw the  	attention of the Chair to what he thought was out of order rather than issuing orders from where he is seated. Can we hear what Dr. Godana has to say?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,  I was in the process of saying that had the last hon. Member to ask a supplementary question been awake when I gave my original reply, he would have understood how we arrived at the figure I mentioned.	However, for his benefit, I will repeat what I said in my main answer.The daily attendance at the health centre is in the region of 40 per sons per day.	'  Bed occupancy is 1.1 per cent and, therefore, the figure of 88.9 per cent.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. FALANA: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think we have a problem here. Perhaps; the figure the Assistant Minister is giving may be correct, but what would be the point of a patient to go to a hospital where services are not being rendered? Probably, the attendance is low because when people go there they do not get the proper attendance or even medicine. Could the Assistant Minister be kind enough to check why the attendance is so low? It could be that there are no services rendered in the health centre.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have no information thatservices are not being properly rendered in the health centre.	The informationwe have is that services are being properly rendered as they should be rendered by a health centre and not a hospital.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like the hon. Assistant Minister to give an undertaking to this House that he is going to visit the health centre, accompanied by Members of Parliament.	I came from that place today andI know that there is no medicine.	In fact, people are running away from the healthcentre because there are no services being rendered there at all.  In view of the fact that this is the only Government health institution in the constituency, can the Assistant Minister say when he is going to visit the health centre to see for himself what is happening?  As a matter of fact;, people are dying in the health centre due to lack of proper attention and lack of medicine.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>DR. B.A.GODANA:  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member cannot possibly be serious with those allegations.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS:  He is serious!  He is serious!</Newspeech> <Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA:  If he were serious, he would have sought to know, in the first place, when the Ministry would expand the health centre and not when the Ministry would provided the basic services for which the centre was built.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI:  On a point of Order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.  The Assistant Minister has not reacted to the supplementary question raised by hon. Kipkorir.  The hon. Member said that the matter is so serious that people are dying due to  .lack of services, and he wanted the hon. Assistant Minister to promise the House that all hon. Members of Parliament shall visit the health centre, together with the Assistant Minister, so that we can prove to him that he was given a wrong answer. Can he tell the House when we are all going to visit the health centre?</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR. B.A. GODANA:  Mr. Speaker, Sir, if it is all that necessary—</Newspeech> (Mr. Ekidor shouted something at Dr. B.A. Godana) <Newspeech>MR.

Mr. Ekidor, please note that it is out of order to threaten to resort to physical confrontation when you are sitting there.  It is out of Order to do that.</Newspeech>  	<Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, whenever it is necessary, senior officials of the Ministry of Health, including the Minister himself, do not hesitate to visit any locality where we think it is necessary to supervise the dispensation of health care.  Therefore, if it is necessary in this case, we will visit the health center in question.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR: BIDU:	On a point of Order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Is he in order to put 	the condition of "if" when there is something very serious happening in that place?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>DR.

Having done that,  I beg to reply.I am sure that the hon. Questioner knows the number of schools in Fafi Constituency. 	There are 13 primary schools in that constituency with 58 teachers, 24 of whom are trained and 34 of whom are untrained.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

Those hon. Members shoting "No, no", may not have read the Standing Orders properly. If the hon.

Can we now hear what you are driving at?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SALAT:  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am glad that the Assistant Minister has given me the breakdown of the trained and untrained teachers.  Can he now give the House the breakdown of the teachers in every primary school?</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR. BIDU:  Sema hujui!</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KARAURI:  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the hon. Member wants me to give a breakdown of the number of teachers per school, I cannot do that right now; I can only do it later.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. SALAT:  On a point Of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.  Whenever we  ask Questions here, Ministers should expect supplementary questions to arise. When I ask how many schools and teachers there are in Fafi Constituency, I do not just want to know that.  There should be some supplementary information.  Therefore, the Assistant Ministers should not take so much time of the House by coming here unprepared.  When we ask Questions here, Ministers should look at all angles and be prepared to answer any supplementary questions that may arise.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. KARAURI:  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do accept that this Question was not asked today as were leaving the Ministry offices: It would be misleading to give a breakdown on the number of teachers, both trained and untrained, school by school because there is mobility of teachers. Teachers are not permanently in any one school. So, if the hon. Member asks about the breakdown of the number of teachers in a period of two weeks, we would be able to give the right information.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. SALAT:  On a point Of  Order, Mr.  Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the Assistant Minister is out of order. 	He is misleading the House when he tells us that the figure he would have been given two weeks previously would change suddenly before he comes to this House.	I expect that whenever a teacher is transferredfrom One school a replacement is provided.	That would not make' any differenceIn	the number Of teachers in any one given school.TO assist the Assistant Minister come with a proper answer, he could also consider the number of Standard VIII schools in the constituency so that he comes with a proper answer this afternoon.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KARAURI:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we seem to be arguing with thehon. Member.	I did not hear the question he posed.	He is trying to explain howI should have brought the answer giving a breakdown of teachers in the schools. What was his last question?</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. ARTE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Assistant Minister knows very well that the schools are already closed and what the hon. Questioner is asking is the breakdown of trained and untrained teachers as at the time the schools closed. 	After all, we do not expect the teachers to have been transferred when the schools closed.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KARADRI: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is not a point of order but a supplementary question which is not relevant to the original Question. The hon. Questioner wanted to know the number of  primary schools in Fati Constituency and the trained and untrained teachers in these schools. 	Although the hon.

I think the Chair has a duty to direct the louse on this Question which is straightforward. The Questioner is seeking to know how many Primary schools there are in Fati Constituency and the number of trained and untrained teachers manning these schools.  The Assistant Minister should be able to give us the breakdown of trained and untrained teachers per school and he should not say. that this is a different question altogether.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPIT SPEAKER I think I quite agree with hon. Mwamzandi that this Question is fairly straight forward except for the fact that he joined in the issue of primary schools Which had been raised by hon. Salat.  That is a valid    rejoinder as far as I am concerned, but ma the question of the number of trained and untrained teachers, is relevant to the Original Question, and the House 	 therefore, expects the Assistant. Minister to have come here with the facts and figures regarding this issue.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question of the breakdown of trained and untrained teachers per school is not relevant to the original Question. Furthermore, there are a number of teachers who .have graduated from teacher training colleges and we are in the process of posting them and it is very. difficult to-</Newspeech>	 	 	 <Newspeech>MR. SALAT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,. I think the  Mi Assistant Minister is challenging your rand ruling.  You have clearly said that this Question is fairly    straightforward. When I put this Question, I did not have in mind the teachers 	 Who are graduating but the trained and untrained teachers Who are currently in the list of the District Education Officer, Garissa.   I wanted to know the breakdown of these teachers per school in Fati Constituency.</Newspeech>  	<Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member asked the number of primary schools in the constituency and the number of trained and untrained teachers manning these schools. I gave the number of the schools as being 13 and if: there is a 14th school that is not registered by the Ministry, we are not aware. I have given the number of untrained teachers as 34 and the number of trained teachers as 24. The question of the breakdown of these teachers per school is a different one altogether, but if the hon. Member wants me to give him that breakdown up to the time that the schools closed, I can give it to him later.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEFUE! SPEAKER:  Very well. 	I was hoping that hon. Karauri would  join issues again with hon. Salat regarding the first part of the Question. 	I would like to refer you to the Standing Orders No.37 	(12) which says: A Question, the answer to which is readily available in ordinary works of reference or official publications, shall not be asked. Mr. Salat, I thought  I heard you referring to a list of teachers in the District Education Office, Garissa. Therefore, if you knew the precise number of primary schools, it would only be in order that you abide by the Standing Orders.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SALAT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was referring to the number of primary schools in Fati Constituency.  These schools are not there today and then disappear tomorrow.  They are always there and therefore can be counted. When I asked how many trained and untrained teachers there are in these schools, I knew that there are some teachers Who do not come from this particular constituency. Therefore, the Assistant Minister should be able to tell the House how many trained and untrained teachers there are in each school. When the Assistant Minister brings that breakdown to this House this afternoon, I will also give him the list of the 14 schools which I know are there.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: 	Hon. Karauri has promised to bring the breakdown of teachers per school this afternoon and I hope he will be able to do so.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it really in order for the hon. Questioner to bring this Question when he already has the answer.	He says	he knows the number of schools in his constituency.</Newspeech>	    <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Yes, he says he was driving at something which has just managed to explain.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KTLIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I do not think that the Assistant Minister should be given more time to m answer this question because he already knows the answer. Could he tell us how he arrived at the total number of trained and untrained teachers without first knowing the breakdown per school?  He should not be given more time to answer this question and if he insists, he should be thrown out.</Newspeech> (laughter) <Newspeech>MR. KARADRI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if hon. Kiliku, for example, asked the Minister for Education how many untrained and trained teachers there were in his constituency, the Minister would simply consult the District Education Officer in the constituency because he has the list. 	As we are all aware, teachers 	" are transferable, but in this particular case, since the hon.

I have put this Question again and the Assistant Minister has said that the bridge will be completed in August this year. Can the Assistant Minister really assure this House that this time the bridge is going to be completed in August this year. I am saying this because it is now become like a chorus on part of the Ministry that they are going to construct this bridge While my people continue to wait and are now tired of waiting. Can he assure this House that  what he has said today is the truth and nothing but the truth, so that Almighty God can also help him, particularly knowing he is an Archbishop.</Newspeech> (laughter)  <Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI:	On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker,Sir.	You will find that some time last year hon. Mate asked aQuestion regarding this same bridge and the Assistant Minister said that the project would be completed by November, 	1989.  But you can now see that the Assistant Minister says that. the same project will be completed in August, this year. He has added another year without any explanation about the delay in implementing the project. What are we supposed to do in a case like this one; where a Ministry fails to honour its promises?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member  knows that I always tell the truth and the truth of the matter is that the project will be completed in August, 1990.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from the reply given by the Assistant minister    He said that he came late because he was looking for this reply;  But the reply is very short.. It is just one sentence which.	says that the project will completedin August this year.	Last year he said that the project. would becompleted by November, 	1989.  I do not know whether the Assistant ministers are treating our Questions with the seriousness they deserve;	I think they just come to reply to Questions without first,finding out what is	happening in the field.  Can the	Assist ant Minister assure this House that the project will be completed in August this year?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Archbishop Ondiek, the point hon.  Members are raising is 	fairly serious.  The Chair would like to have it confirmed that this Question came up last year and the answer was that the project was going to be completed before November last year..  This is because if that is so, from the Ministry's point of view, then explanation will be	. in order before youproceed to answer this Question.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the reason why the project was not completed in November, 	1989, was because the funds were	coming from NORAD and there was a delay inreleasing the funds. This resulted in	the delay in theimplementation of the project.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATE:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are gettingdisturbed.	Most of the promises we get from Ministers	here arenever honoured.  The field officers never follow up these promises.I could give two or three examples here.  The Assistant Minister saysthat the project will be completed in August this year but the workhas not yet begun.	Is he In order to y, come here and say things andthen	go away?</Newspeech><Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon.Member should appreciate that the Ministry has made a lot of efforts to try to get the donors	to release the finds.  He should bemore interested in when the project is going to be completed and the project is going to be completed in August this year.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. JALANG'O:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I believe that eachand every project,	no matter its size, has got aspecific implementation period.  Construction of a project may require about	20 man months or 30 man months, depending onthe size of the bridge.	Could the Assistant Minister tell us whatthe Ministry's engineers have estimated the work to take?	If, forinstance, the work is going to take 	20 man months, and we are in Aril now, will . the work be completed within four months?	What wasestimated period of implementation of the project?	We expect to geta realistic reply from the Ministry.</Newspeech>  	 <Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, my engineershave estimated that the work is going to be completed In August this year. But you will find that if the funds are not released in time there is nothing the engineers can do.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

I answered that Question adequately and the hon. Questioner, hon. P.K. Kinyanjui, the Member of Parliament for Kikuyu did request the Chair to-</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

The chair certainly discourages consultations that could be deemed. Violent. This is because from facial expressions I am convinced that hon. Chepkok  had something to fear.  So, I would urge hon.  Ogle to sit very, very far away from hon. Chepkok.  If hon. Ogle wishes to join, issue with what hon.

The A.P.'s are usually sent there from the D.O.'s Office, Tot, for patrol purposes when the need arises. 	The A.P.'s were, therefore, not transferred but were withdrawn from the two areas when the security situation improved in the area .</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, why is it that the location has been without A.P.'s for the last four years and yet the security in the area is so poor?  by do you transfer the ones who were there?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. 	KYALO: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to differ with what the hon. Member has just said. The security in that area has not been bad during the last four years.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: 	On a point of order, Mr. Deputy. Speaker, Sir. I would like to6.sk the Minister whether he meows the area better than the Member for the area?  Last time, hon. Kipkorir complained of the security in Embobut area whereby one person was killed and two people are  in hospital right now. So, how can the Minister beg to differ with the Member for the area while the security in the area is not good at all? I will give the names of the two people in hospital right now.  One of them who Was admitted on 13th April, 	1990 is called Joseph Kipchumba Yaga? and he is still in hospital. 	The other one is called Dine? Jacob who was admitted on 25th March, 1990, and the name of the person who was killed is Kiptum Komen(?).	This is why I am saying that the Administrationin the district mislead the Ministry, or rather the D.C. in suchmatters.	We come from the area and we know it better.	Therefore,What We tell the Ministers here is the truth.	These people havebeen admitted in  KaPsor Hospital right now.	So, can the Ministergive a proper answer to the House.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. KYALO:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, although the hon. Memberhas said that some people have been killed, I would like to tell the House that the security situation in that area is under constant  review, and if the hon.

But I can assure him that the question of security in the area is taken very seriously by my ministry.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MANG’OLI: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,  arising from the reply by the Minister and bearing in mind the names of people quoted here, does this not indicate that the security in the area is in problem? This is obvious. So, instead of withdrawing the A.P.’s who were in the area, the Administration ought to have informed the Minister that the security in the area is bad. Can the Minister assure the House now that these A.P.'s are going to be sent back to the area to men security?  People have been killed and others are sick in hospital:   This is a clear indication that there is insecurity in area. So, can the Minister assure the House that the A.P.'s and police officers will be deployed in that area to maintain security?</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR. KYALO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure the House that the security in the area will be ensured, and if need be, instructions will be sent to that area so that the security is maintained.	That is the assurance. I would like to give to theHoused</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI:	On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.The Minister is not answering my question.	He says "it will be" ;in other words, he is not sure.	I am asking whether the A.P.'S.can be sent today.	He still believes that there is security inthe area.	The	English phrase "it will be" means "in future".Can he tell us when the A.P.'s are going to be sent there?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KYALO: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the hon.

MAKHANU:	 Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, will the Minister bekind enough to tell. us the official Government policy with regards to manning   of   chiefs'  camps?  all  I  know is  that every chief’s camp      must have permanent A.P.'s.

Sir,  this week,  the whole district received only	600 bales, and each businessmen consume more than	600 balesper week.	There is one businessman whom I know, and he consumes1,050 bales per week,  therefore,  if the whole district is getting 600 bales per week,	then you will all agree with me that thereIs an auto shortage.

Sasa ningependa Hoja ifuatavyo.KWAMBA, kwa  vile mawasiliano bora haswa ya barabara ni muhimu sana kwa kuleta maendeleo kiuchumi .na kwa kuwa  wakazi wa tarafa ya Nginyang wamependekeza kwa kauli mpja kupitia kwa kamati ya maendeleo ya tarafa yao kwamba mabarabara ambayo haipitiki wakati wa mvua yarekebishwe,  isitoshe,  Bunge hili laihimiza Serikali kutafuta pesa iii kuwezesha kuwekwa lami mabarabara ya Loru/Nginyang/Maron/Tot/Lomut/MariCh:.Pass;  na Loruk/Tangulbei/Maralal/ haraka iwezekanavyo. Tangu  wakati wa serikali wakolonyi lya sehemu hiyo ilikuwa imesahaulika 	 kwa mambo mengi.	Ilisahaulika kwa maendeleo kama ya ujenzi washule,	 mabarabara	na maendeleo mengine.	Ilifikia wakati watuwa kamati ya maendeleo ya Tarafa ya,Nginyang	ilipojiuliza nikwa nini barabara iilitoka sehemu	zikiwa na lamu lakinizilipofika	huko Loruk,  lami haikuwekwa tena.	Juzi stimaililetwa huko lake Baringo mpaka Kambi ya Samaki,  na ikakwama hapo.Tarafa hiyo ika na shule nyingi sana.	Shule kana NgoronyKaloo,   na	ambazo zikollehemu ya Kerio zilifungwa mapema kwa sababu gard	peleka vyakula vya uukk shule. 	Tena wakulima wanapata shida sana kwa kusafirisha mazao yao kwenda kuuza katika masoko,  hasa wakati huu wa mvua.. Basi viongozi wa tarafa hiyo walishangaa sana kuona kwamba barabara katika tarafa zote za wilaya hiyo ziko na lami lakini tarafa ya Nginyang haijapata barabara zenye lami kusaidiak 	maendelee ya sehemu hiyo.  	Katika upande wa Kerio Valley,	mengisana.Madiniainayafluosparni mengi sana hasa huko kwa mhe. Chepkok.	Barabara hizi zikiendelea kuwa katikahali hii, itakuwaje wakati Serikali itakapohitaji kwenda huko kuwasaidia wananchi kutengeneza madini haya kwa manufaa yao? Viongozi wa sehemu hiyo wanajua kwarriba kuna sehemu fulani iitwayo Chepkeria kwa lugha ya Pokot.. Chepkeria ni kijiji  	kikubwa chenye madini yanayoweza kuisaidia Serikali yetutukufu kiuchumi na kuinua hali ya maisha katika Kerio Valley. 	Wakati huu wa mvua, hakuna magari yo yote, hata yale ya ulinzi, yanayoweza kutumia barabara itokayo Goret kuelekea Kapedo 	(?) Barabara itokayo Tangulbei kwenda Wilaya ya Samburu pia imekuwa mbaya. Hata ingawa barabara hii iliwekwa murram kidogo, sasa.imechukuliwa na maji na ajali kubwa inaweza kutokea huko. Tunafaa kufikiria njia ambayo tunaweza kuzirekebisha barabara hizi iii kupunguza ajali barabarani. Barabara zinazoelekea Maralal ni nzuri kidogo, lakini sehemu nyingine zake ni mbaya.. 	Ni utaratibu gani Wizara ya Ujenzi inaweza kufanya iii iweke lami barabara itokayo Maralal, kuptia Loru, hadi Baringo??.. Wizara hii inafaa kutafuta pesa za kuwekea7barabara hii lami.  Barabara hii inaunganisha wilaya tatu na wananchi wa huko wataweza kusaidia sana katika kazi ya kuweka lami. Baiabara hii ikiweka lami hakutakuwako na taabu tena ya kufunga shule ovyo ovyo, na walimu na wanafunzi wao wataweza kusafiri kwa urahisi. Hoja hii ni muhimu sana kwa sababu inahusu mambo mengi, na haihusu Wizara ya Ujenzi peke yake, bali pia hata Wizara ya Kilimo.	Kerio Valley nisehemu ya maana sana kwa kilimo.	Wananchi wetu hawawezi kusafirisha mazao yaokutoka Kolol hadi Tot, kwa mfano, wala kutoka Tot hadi Iten au Marich Pass.	Kwahivyo ninamwomba Waziri atafute pesa za kutosha kuweka barabara hizi lami. 	Wananchi wa Lokesheni ya Kolol hawana mawasiliano sawa sawa kwa sababu hawana barabara wala simu. 	Pale Mkuu wa Tarafa anapokaa, yaani Chemlingot, hapana njia zo zote za mawasiliano na ofisa huyu akitaka kupata ripoti kutoka kwa machifu ni lazima atumie watu ambao huleta ripoti baada ya kila miezi mitatu. Barabara za huko hazipitiki na inanibidi hata mimi mwenyewe kutembea miguu mwendo wa kilomita 40, huku nikilala njiani siku tatu. Ni vigumu sana kwa Mkuu wa Tarafa  Kuwasiliana na machifu wa kolol na tiriok.	Mr. Deputy Speaker left the Chair The Temporary Deputy Speaker 	(Mr. Wabuge)  took the ChairHii ndiyo sababu nimeiomba Wizara hii iyaangalie maslahi ya wananchi wa huko. 	Waziri anafaa kuyatia maanani sana maombi tunayotoa hapa iii wananchi waache kulalamika kwamba hawana njia za mawasiliano hapa na pale. 	Umefika wakati ambapo sisi viongozi tuliochaguliwa.tunafaa kuziomba Wizara zetu na Mawaziri wenyewe watusaidie.	Katika sehemu ya kutoka Sigor, kupitia Marich Pass, hadiLodwar hatuna lami yo yote.	Utaona kwamba wananchi wanaoishi katika sehemuitokayo Loruk mpaka kule Lokicha ni kama wako katika dunia nyingine.

Nilikuwa nikisemakwamba wakati umeWadia ambapo kila sehemu ya nchi hii ingefikiriwa kwa kuhudumiwa,hasa tunapozungumza juu,ya biashara, shule, dospitaii na huduma nyingine mbalimbali.	Kwa mfano, siku hizi kuna maziwa ya watoto wa shule ambayo hutakikana yapelekwekatikashule za msingi, ziwe ni bweni au za aina ile nyingine.	Utaona kwamba ikiwabarabara zinazoelekia shuleni hazitengenezwei na kuhifadhiwa, watoto wengine hawatapata maziwa yaliyotolewa na Mtukufu Rais kwa sababu huduma za usafirishaji haziko. 	Kwa haio machache, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, naomba kuipeddakeza Hoja hii na kumwuliza mhe. Chdpkok alunge mkono kwa sababu anayaeiewa sana mambo ninayozungumzia. Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda. 	Ninayo furaha nyingi kupata nafasi hii kuiunga mkono Hoja hii ambayo ni ya muhimu sana. 	Hoja hii inasisitiza huduma za usafirishaji iii kusaidia elle hili kuendesha biashara ya utalii, kilimo na mambo mengine mengi. Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, Hoja hii inauiuliza Serikali iweke lami barabara ya kutoka Loruk hadi Marich Pass ili huduma za usafirishaji kati ya sehemu'hizo mbili na hata zaidi ziweze kupatikana. 	Barabara hiyo.ikiwekwa lami, watu wanaosafirt kwenda hata Sudan watakuwa wamesaidiwa sana. Hii ni barabara muhimu sana katika kuendeleza sekta ya utaiii  katika eneo linalohusika kwa sababu lina hoteli nyingi za kitalii. Ninampongeza sana mhe. Twarith kwa kuileta HOja hii papa na kuiomba Serikali itafute pesa kuiweka lami barabara iliyotajwa. 	Pia, kuna barabara nyingine inayotoka Kabartonjo kwenda kukutana na hii ya Loruk, kuingia Tot na kwendelea bad' Wilaya ya Turkana. Hii ni barabara muhimu sana katika sekta ya utalii, na Zerikali ikiiweka lami itaieta pesa nyingi sana. 	Ninasema hivyo kwa sababu tayari kuna mipango ya kuanzisha hifadhi za wanyama katika sehemu za LimOi, 	Lodwar na Ziwa Turkana.  Pia, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, barabara hii ikitangenezwa itakuwa ya muhimu sana kwa wakulima katika sehemu ya Tot ambao wamekuza ndizi kwa wingi. 	Pia itawahudumia wakulima katika Wilaya ya'Kerio, hasa katika Kerio Valley, ambao wamefanyaka kazi kubwa sana ya kilimo na huku hawapati huduma za usaftrishaji. Kwa hakika, nataka kusema kwamba hata wakati mhe. Kipkerir alipokuwa akiuliza Small lNapa juu ya kituo cha afya fulani, niljua to shida iliyoko hasa ni ukosefu wa njia za mawasilianos. Barabara katika sehemu hizo hazipitiki. Je, ikiwa hakuna njia za kuwasiliana kwa barabara, watu watawezaje kwenda kutibiwa katika kituo cha afya? 	Ninawaomba Wahe. Wabunge wenzangu waiunge mkono Hoja hii iii kuiwezesha Serikali kutafuta pesa za kuiweka barabara hii lami. Kwa wakati huu, watu wanabishi katika sehemu hii hawawezi kutoka hukO na kuja kuuza Chakula chao hapa Nairobi kwa njia rahisi. Ukienda katika seheMu ya Tot,leo utashangaa kuona vile wakulima wa huko waiivyojitahidi kukuza ndizi, maembe, machungwa.na aina nyinginezo za mazao kama vile aihogo, na huku hakuna njia kamili ya kusafirisha mazao hayo mpaka sokoni. Kwa hivyo, ni jambo la busara kwamba kuhakikisha kwamba barabara hii inatiwa lami ili kuwahudumia vilivyo wakaaji wa seheMu hizo za Kerio Valley.  Njia ya kutoka Loruk hadi Marich Pass, kama vileilivyotajwa hapa na she. Twarith, ni ya muhimu sana na nataka kuIlhakikishia Bunge hill kwamba barabara hiyo itaweza kuwa ya manufaa kwa nchi hii kiuchUmi ikiwa itatehgenzwa.  Hata mimi sitakua na haja ya kupitia njia nyingien ninapbenda nyumbani. Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ni jambo la busara sana kufungua biashara;ya kfutaiii katika seheMu hii.

MASINDE: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to support this very important Motion. A.4e are all aware, we cannot have effective development in this country without proper road communication. Communication by road is very important because it enable wananchi to meet and exchange ideas. It also enables farmers to transport their  farm produce to the markets or to the various trading centres.	This cannotbe  effectively done with cut proper road communication.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, besides opening up new roads, we havethe existing roads, some of  which have been there for many years.  These roadshave over the years turned from b  bad to worse and the excuse generally given is that there is a lot of traffic using these roads.   While we have acquired better knowledge, experience and machinery to construct and maintain our roads, it is appalling to note that many of our roads are completely impassable. I do not know What has happened to our modern technology regarding the maintenance of our roads.  You will have notice that most of our roads do not have proper drainage system and When it rains, water stagnates. In the middle of the road and this wears out the road, rendering it impassable even if the road was graded a few days previously. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry concerned should made dare that the maintenance team  does proper maintenance of our roads by opening up drainages and keeping them viable throughout the year. 	There are certain roads which are vital to our development and while there may not be any immediate plans of tarmacking these roads, it would not be asking for too much, if today we asked the Ministry to Put murrum on these roads so that they can be all weather roads. This would enable wananchi to travel easily without much trouble-</Newspeech>      <Header>QUORUM</Header> <Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to draw your attention  to the fact that there is no quorum in the House at the moment.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): You are right, Dr. Wameyo, there is no quorum in the House. 	Would You please ring the Division Bell.</Newspeech> (The Division Bell was rung) <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER 	(Mr. Wabuge): We have a quorum now; would continue, Mr. Masinde.</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR. P.J. MASINDE:	As I was saying, Mr. Temporary DeputySpeaker, Sir, those roads which have not been earmarked fortarmacking should be gravelled and made all weather roads so that the wananchi is able to transport his farm produce without any problems:. If this is done, it will also save the Government the expense of having to send road gangs to repair roads which are washed away 	  by rains the following day. 	This will also save the Government foreign exchange.  This is because these  rough and badly maintained roads make vehicles break down very  fast and this leads to the importation of more and more spare parts for the vehicles.	If these roads were in a good condition the needto import a lot of snare parts would not ariseMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, with regardto those roads earmarked	 for tarmacking in the near future,like the road between Loruk and Maralal and the Mumias-  Nambale Busia 	 Road and	Butula Fugyula Ruambwa Road, and while waiting for these roadsto be	tarmacked, they should be kept in proper order. Theyshould be made all weather roads. For instance an appeal has been made for help to be provided to flood	victims in Bunyala butvehicles cannot get to Bunyala easily because the roads are almost impassable or nonexistent for that matter. The fishermen in Busia cannot have their fish transported to the markets because vehicles can longer reach the shores of Lake Victoria:  For this reason, I do support this Motion wholly and urge the Government to maintain these roads and also do tarmacking where it is required:	I would also urgethe Government to look for money   probably loans	  to	ensurethat 	all these roads that are earmarked for tarmacking are tarmacked without delay. 	I assume that when the Government approaches a country that is willing to help us they should be able to negotiate fast and finalise everything  so that work is carried out without delay.  I say this because the more we delay in carrying out properMaintenance or	tarmaking of these roads themore foreign exchange we loss.	This is because the cost of materials 	keeps on increasing  and there are also devaluations and . the taxpayer will suffer in the long run. With those few remarks, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>ME. MATEBE:  Thank you very Much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to support this Motion: I think it is high time the Ministry of Public Works came out with a master plan for all the roads in the country.  This is because apart from the roads being impassable during the rainy season, there are some areas which are completely Inaccessible.  There are areas which have no roads.  So, I would like to request the Minister for Public Works to come out with a master plan for each and .very division in this country This is because we haves high agricultural potential areas which   after 27 years of Independence   have no roads:  This Motion is talking about a very potential pastoral and ranching area. This area has good potential for mining and so on.  You will find that it will not be easy for anyone to reach those potential mining sites because there are no roads:  At the same time you will find that people living in that area look like people who live in the wilderness. So, the time has come when the Government should open up this wilderness so that development can take place faster. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, while I support the Recommendations by the Baringo D.D.C. these roads should be given top priority as far as the tarmacking 	of roads in Rift Valley Province is concerned:  Also the tarmacking of roads in this country should be looked at in a liberal manner.  This is because I am aware that some tractors and graders were imported from Japan last year. A total of 43 tractors and graders were bought from Japan last year but the way the Ministry distributed these tractors is quite amazing.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir you will find that all the	43 tractors were taken to the Rift Valley Province and	thissort of distribution left many hon. Members dissatisfied.  The ministry promised that when the second lot of tractors arrives in this country, those tractors will be distributed to other provinces. But those graders and bulldozers do not seem to be forthcoming at all.  So, the roads in other parts of the country 	still remain unattended:  For instance in Meru we have three graders which are not serviceable.	I think the Ministry has got a lot of teethingproblems which should be solved without delay	The Minister shouldtell the entire country why the Ministry is unable to maintain roads in this country.  This question of impassable roads has become a daily song.	Roads have become impassable anti bridges have beenwashed away by floods	Sometime last year the Ministry decided to	make the Thika-Makutano Road a dual carriageway but nothing has beendone on that road to date.  So, everything	appears to have cometo a standstill as far as road construction and maintenance is. Concerned.  In my constituency, Igembe, we have 	the Maua-kanuni.  Road which also joins Tigania with Tharaka constituency:  This is a security road but all the promises from the Ministry that the road will be graded and murrammed have not been honoured.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>THE	ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND HOUSING	(Mr. Mutiso):On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The hon.Member speaking on this Motion is just wandering about, talking about Igembe and many other parts of the country; and the Motion is very specific to particular areas. So, can he concentrate on those areas rather than wandering about in other areas because those areas are not relevant to the Motion?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER	(Mr.	Wabuge):	Orders!	Orders!It is true that some hon. Members are talking 	on the Motion including some other areas which are not covered in this Motion. Now, according to our Standing Orders, you  are not allowed to do that. You can only speak on the subject before the House. This Motion is specifically asking the House about a specific area, or specific roads in that specific area and, therefore, hon. Members should stick to that.	It is more or less becoming a general policy thatwhen a Motion comes up here, hon. Members to include	"other areas".Now, under our Standing Orders, that is not allowed.	Therefore,hon. Members should concentrate on the Motion as it is before the House.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: 	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the point is taken, but you should also understand that if I am talking on a specific road, the problem is not specifically for that road because</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER 	(Mr. Wabuge): 	Order, Mr. Malebe! It is true, but the Motion before the House deals with a specific area. Therefore, you are  not allowed to introduce other matters which are not covered in this Motion because you will be putting the Minister into a very difficult position to answer that particular question which you might have raised concerning that particular road. Therefore, hon. Mnlebe should concentrate on this particular Motion.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. MALME:	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I take noteof that.	with regards  to  this road in question ,  if  the  D .D.C for  the area has approved this road three times, I Think,	it is high time for the Minister concerned to come and tell the House why they are not taking the D.D.C..'s resolutions seriously. This is because if a road has been recommended one, two, three, four and five times, it means it is first priority by the D.D.C. of Baringo so that when they do the budgetting   soon we are going to discuss the Budget for 1990/91   the Minister should now bring this road to this Budget, as a priority of the D.D.C. in that area. 	I note that when travelling to Lodwar, or even when travelling to Marit Pass, or even when I have to pass through Maringat, I normally stop there and make a different decision. 	I decide to   	go through Kabarnet, down into the valley, Tambach, Iten, Eldoret, Kitale, down to Kapenguria, writ Pass and so on.	Now, this road is toolong and it is high time it was shortened:	In fact, to travelfrom here to Lodwar is very short if that road was tarmacked, and in particular, there was a road down in the valley passing through Tot going down to Merit Pass. So, I support this Motion very strongly.

As we know roads are 'prime movers of development in any country, particularly in certain areas, such as Nginyang, where my hon. colleague, hon. Katurkana comes from. One aspect of development that roads would assist in this area, is farming. A farmer would find it very difficult to operate in an area where there are no proper roads. If a tractor 	 breaks down and the farmer is forced to go all the way to on the back of a donkey to look for stare parts for the tractor, this is most inconveniencing. It may even be necessary for the sane farmer to take a mechanic back to Nginyang on top of the donkey to repair his 	 tractor and perhaps that mechanic may never have had a ride on a donkey before. 	So, it may not be easy for the mechanic to agree to accompany the farmer to Nginyang on a donkey. Therefore, if that farmer has to rely on his tractor for farming, his farming activities would be hampered with greatly. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, food would be much  cheaper in this country if it was transported quickly and more effectively on roads which are passable throughout the year. 	It is pointless for a farmer to produce a lot of food which ends up rotting on the farm just because he cannot reach the market due to the poor condition of the roans.  However, if food was transported quickly and easily to the market, we would then have a lot of food being taken to the market and consequently, the price of the food would go down. So, with the availability of a lot of food in the market due to good roads in any given area, the prices would go down and all Kenyans would be happy. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, similarly good roads do assist businessmen a great deal. 	I am sure the businessmen in hon. Katurkana's area would be able to establish a lot markets all over the place if there were good roads in the area. However, at the moment, these businessmen cannot take their goods to the existing markets due to the poor state of the roads in the area. So, if roads in this area were improved, the people in there would become very good businessmen and everybody in the area would be happy.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the case of school milk, Our Government has x been very generous in supplying our schools with free milk. This has proved the love that our President has for our children because it was he Who directed that our primary school children should enjoy free milk. However, it is most likely that some schools have not been able to receive this milk due to the poor states of roads.	Therefore, if these roads were tarmacked, thiswould assist the children in the area to get. free	Way milk at school.As we have been told, this area has potential for tourism and with the improvement of these roads; many tourists would be able to visit this area and to several other areas in the Narth/Eastern Kenya. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, roads are very important when it comes to security of a country.	I would like to give an example which I understand moreregarding Mr. Elgon area where we have problems of lack of security.	Due tothe poor state of Road D275, it has not been possible for our security forces to move fast enough to arrest the situation when we get attacked by some foreigners who have been living in Mr. Elgon forest.  These people have been raiding us almost every week, stealing our cows, injuring and killing our people.   Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the roads were good they would go a long in ensuring that our security forces can move fast and deal  with the situation fast:   Once these people who raid our area know that our forces can move very fast, they will be frightened. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other point I would like to make is in connexion with the condition that has been attached to this Motion, that the District Development Committees decisions have to be respected:	I am very grateful that theMinister has	made it absolutely clear that the decision of theD.D.C. will be paramount, whether we accept the Motion or not:	I wantto give the reason why I back the Minister very strongly.	Some ofour friends have formed	a habit of coming to Nairobi,after D.D.C.s have decided on the Priorities in a given area, let us say roads in this case.  The D.D.C. sets priorities but some people have become very clever. They come to Nairobi and get hold of their friends and insert their own "Priorities" here in Nairobi so that when the Ministry's .  Printed Estimates come out, they do not reflect the wishes of the D.D.C. That is a criminal act as far as I am concerned.  This is because we have had an example of the Namuela Kapsiro Kapsokwony Kaptame Road which is in the Bungoma D.D.C.'s printed	development programme.	This road ismarked as priority number one	  Road D275.   This road has beenearmarked for tarmacking.  Other roads have been earmarked forgravelling	But you will find that someone somewhere decided totake over the duties of the Bungoma D.D.C.	He came	to Nairobiand saw his friends and the priorities were changed and that road was erased from the programme. We cannot allow the D.D.C. to be run by some invisible people here in Nairobi.  This is why I support the Minister in his insistence that the D.D.C.’s priorities mitt be respected. I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge):	I think it istime for the Mover to reply.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.	KATURKANA:	Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muria, kabla sijajibu,ningependa kumpatia mhe. Terer dakika mbili to aseme yake machache.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. TERER.	Thank you very	 much, Mr. TemporaryDeputy Speaker, Sir. This Motion is very, very timely and. I happen to know the area hon. Katurkana is talking about.  In fact the importance of 	roads all over the country cannot be over-emphasised: We know that the road network is the nerve centre of economic development	That area, where hon. Katurkana comes from, was onceupon a time a restricted area and therefore the development	in	that area was very much restricted	It was a closed area and  nobody was allowed to go there during the colonial days.  We shouldnow give priority to all areas that	used to be known as	closedareas during the colonial period	It was not Baringo District thatwas a restricted area but there were other areas that were restricted and as a result of that they remained backward.  We knowthat that area has a	potential for tourism and once it isopen it will be easy for the goods	that are produced in thatarea to reach the markets.  The people who live in this area depend very much on animals. Of course, they are farmers. We know in some areas they produce  	banahas.  They also produce onions, but those products cannot get to the markets until or unless the roads are brought up to standard. 	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, talking about tarmacking of roads, I think, the Ministry should be very .careful when awarding contracts to these people. The Ministry should a? so be there to supervise and they should not award contracts to people with dubious qualifications and experience. We know some of the roads in the country that have been tarmacked but they have just peeled off after a short time. We would like the Ministry to be very careful in awarding the contracts and supervising the contractors. 	I would also like to  ask the Ministry of Public Works to employ local people when  constructing these roads because these are  the people with knowhow. In fact, they know their areas better. They know even the height of the bridges because at this time of the year, we have floods and some bridges cannot be seen. They have been covered by water, but if the local people were consulted, they 	 would be able to tell the engineers how high the bridge should be built. Another thing is the question of supervision of roads. think when roads are constructed they should be supervised regularly by the Ministry. The Ministry should employ more road inspectors so that the roads are maintained all the time. Touching on roads in other areas of the country like mime 	 where you cannot now get foreign exchange because you cannot get tea out of the farms to the factory, or even from the factory to the market due to bad roads-   I think roads are an important 	communication network.	Unless roads are well maintained, I thinkwe are going to have a problem of shortage of foreign exchange. 	With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR.

The present level of economic activities aroundSiakago Market do not warrant the establishment of commercial banking services at that particular market.

KEAH: Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir, before I attempt to 	tell the House what the minimum requirements of establishing a bank ina certain area are,  I would like to make it clear that for anymobile bank to be established, it must prove to be a viable project.Profitability is of essence in terms of the minimum requirementsfor establishing a bank or a mobile bank in any particular place.I would like to assure this House that in so far as the economic 	activities at Siakago are concerned, and on the bases of the feasibility   	studies that have been done a siakago market, the banking facilities are not unable or profitable, and therefore anybank	  leave alone the Kenya Commercial Bank	  would find itdifficult to establish banking services there.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MATE: 	For the information of the Assistant Minis per,  Siakago Market is a Divisional Headquarters 	of Siakago Division. 	There are very many economic activities in that area: There are people who are employed,  such as teachers and others, but there are also tobacco farmers and all the other traders who . do their business there.	I, therefore,  think	the AssistantMinister did not carry out his home work properly, because there is enough cash flow in that area which would warrant the opening of at least, a mobile bank there. 	could the Assistant Minister, therefore, advise his officers to re visit that area and carry out a feasibility study,  because I think the information that he has is not correct.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  KEAH:	Sir,  that is his opinion.	The informationthat I have is as latest as February,	1990.	I would like to givethe hon. Members the following information.	I	would like tgive some detailed information because this	is the third time in the recent six to nine months that this Question has appeared before this House,  and I have always answered it. 	I am, therefore,  pretty close to the facts that have been given to me by the bank concerned. Sir,  the honours of establishing banking services in any areas, leave alone Siakago,  is the premise of any interested commercial bank,  not necessarily the Kenya Commercial Bank.	That isdone after the particular bank has carried out 	feasibility study which supports the viability of such a project. 	Such a project also requires the support of the relevant district development committee The Kenya  Commercial Bank, as has been stated here,  carries out   feasibility studies and this one for Siakago was done in February 	1990. 	The Kenya Commercial Bank periodically car out country wide network of feasibility studies in various headquarters,  the frequency of which is dictated by among other factors,  the business potential and the economic circums The Kenya Commercial Bank carried out a feasibility study in Embu District including Siakago,  during the first week of February 1990,  the results of which indicated that it would be uneconomical to operate a mobile bank,  leave a lone a branch o   a sub branch service at Siakago Market.	The fact that SiakagoMarket is a divisional headquarters is very well known.I would also like to add that that Kenya CommercialBank operates full branches at Embu and Runyenjes.	I doappreciate that Embu and Runyenjes towns are within 20 to	30 kilometres away from Siakago, but the point here is that SiakagoMarket does not warrant the establishment of a bank due 	 its level of economic activities.	The people are at the momentserved by the	  bank branch 	which is 20 kilometres away.  I knowthat 20 kilometres is a long distance, but the economic viabilityof Siakago Market still does not warrant the consideration ofestablishment of banking services.Sir,  a feasibility study was also undertaken by the KenyaCommercial Bank some years back for upgrading Runyenjes  Town.At the moment, Runyenjes Town has got a banking branch. 	I wouldto say that the Barclays Bank is in the process of establisheda branch at Runyenjes Town, because its economic activitiescall for an establishment of a bank. 	May be  the hon.  Member hasgot statistics which are contrary to mine,  but I would like totell the House that Siakago division covers 779 square kilometres 	  	       	 It has	56,520 people.	That information is based on the EmbuDistrict Development Plan for	1989/1993.	Therefore,	informationthat I have is up to date, and so the hon.

SALAT 	Sir, while appreciating the answer given by the Mimi Assistant Minister and for the concern of the Ministry to construct a new maternity wing, could he tell the House when renovation works started at the maternity wing?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SOMPHISHA: 	Sir, as I said, the work is continuing and I cannot give the exact date when it started.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I know the facilities whichare being used at present to provide maternity services in that hospital.	Sincethis wing reouires repair, where are women delivering?</Newspeech>  0 <Newspeech>MR. SOMPISHA:	Sir, the	hospital is using the old facilitiesthat were there.MR. CHEPKOK:	 On a point of order, Hr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.	TheAssistant Minister has not answered lion. Wameyo’s Question.	The Assistant Ministerused the words	‘I think' in his reply.	Can he answer the	question?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SOMPHISA:	Sir, instead of using the words 'I think', I will saythat I know that they are using the old facilities that were there before.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. WABUGE:	When replying to Dr. Wameyo’s supplementary Question,the Assistant Minister said that the facilities are there.	Can	tell the Housethe type of	facilities which are there?  Are they modern facilities or oldfacilities which were used by 'natives' before Independence?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SAMPISHA:	Sir, when we talk of renovation	mean working onthe things which were there before be they of a native nature or not.	I think weare all natives and are using 'modern native' facilities.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO:	On a Point of order, Sir.	My question has not been.answered.	In a maternity wing, there  is a labour ward, post natal ward, ante natal ward and a theatre to operate on those women who cannot deliver normally.	Are thesefacilities available in the maternity wing at the Garissa provincial Hospital?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SOMPISHA:	Sir, I know that all these wards are there  but when oneof them is under renovation, the other rooms are converted to serve the required maternity needs.	They can be converted into, say, labour ward and delivery bedscan be transferred to the rooms that are not in use.	It does not mean that maternity services must go on in the same room where	  renovation is being undertaken.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO:	Sir,	want to	know from the Assistant Minister whetherthe labour ward at the Garissa Provincial Hospital is still in use as of now or is it closed.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SOMPHISA: 	Sir, 	definitely, I cannot say whether it is being used or not because if I say it is being used, then I will not be telling the House the truth because I do not know</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. WASIKE NDOMBI:	Sir, hon. Salat comes from Garissa  and hon.Sompisha comes from Maasailand.	Can the Assistant minister tell the House whenhe was last in Garissa a so that we can know whether he is answering this Question effectively or not?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SOMPHISA: 	Sir, I come from Maasailand, hon. Salat comes fromGarissa and hon. Wasike Ndombi comes from  Western Province in Kakamega. Therefore. the only man who  may have been in Garissa latest is hon. Salat. 	I would like to say that my Ministry is there in full swing and a we Have our officers everywhere, in the country.	It	is, therefore, not necessary that I personally or the Ministergoes to that area.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASIKE-NDOMBI:	On a point of order, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister.in order to mislead the House by relying on theoretical information:	We knowthat hon. Salat is telling us the truth of the matter with regard to the situation Garissa Provincial Hospital.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SOMPISHA: 	Sir, 	I think hon. Salat is satisfied with the reply I gave because he said earlier on "while I appreciate the answer..."  I know  	 he was appreciating the answer.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SALAT:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, once again I appreciate theAssistant Minister's reply.	What I am talking about is the building that housesthe maternity wing in Garissa Provincial Hospital whose roofs are leaking. The building in question is tilted 25 degrees, and it can collapse any minute now.	In addition, I am not aware that there any officers of the Ministry ofPublic works doing any work there.	I maintain that they are not there.	If theAssistant Minister claims that he has sent his officers there, when did work start on the hospital?on in that place. I think he is misleading the House by saying that work is goingOur mothers, wives and daughters deliver in that hospital and,  	to date, these people have not been transferred from the original maternity wingto another place while work is going on.	What action is the Assistant Ministertaking to safeguard the lives of the patients in this ward?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. ole SOMPISHA:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I said earlier, thehon. Questioner appreciated the original answer I gave.	In that answer, I statedthat the staff of the Ministry of Public works are on the site renovating the maternity wing, and this is done when there is some leakage or something similar. The hon. Member says that our staff are not there, but we got this reply from our officers there, and I trust that they are there</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: 	On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. 	Is the Assistant Minister in order to keep saying what he is now saying while we persist that he is misleading the House by saying that he is relying on his officers in Garissa who telephone him from there and give him the wrong information? The hon. Member came from that place only last Monday, and he says that no repair work or renovation is going on in the hospital. The Assistant Minister is misleading this House by saying that his officers are on the site renovating the maternity wing of the hospital when there are no such people there.	We are tiredof this kind of answer.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ole SOMPISHA:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as the hon. Member says,I am relying on our officers in Garissa.	Who else could I rely on?	I cannotrely on the hon. Questioner nor can I be at Garissa and Nyatike, in Kisumu, at the same time in order to get first hand information. we normally rely on our officers on the ground to get the relevant information.  We ourselves do not have to fly to the centres from which Questions come from in order to be able to answer  Questions here. We will keep on relying on our officers as this is not wrong.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let us have the last supplementary question on this Question from Mr. Arte.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. ARTE: 	Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. 	Although the Assistant Minister denies what we are telling him, we know for sure that nobody is repairing the maternity ward of that general hospital right now. However, I want to know from the Assistant Minister when he released authority to incur expenditure in respect of the repair of this maternity ward. Could he give us the date and quote the covering letter?</Newspeech> " <Newspeech>MR. ole SOMPISHA: 	Mr. Deputy. Speaker, Sir, I do not know whether this is a point of order or a question.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: 	Mr. Arte, repeat your question for the benefit of hon. ole Sompisha.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. ARTE:  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have just come from Garissa, and I know. for sure that nobody is repairing that maternity wing right now. 	In any case, could we be told when authority to incur expenditure in respect of the repair of that hospital was released?</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR. ole SOMPISHA:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the question of thedate and time the authority to incur expenditure in respect of the repair of this hospital was released was included in the original Question, I would have been able to get this information, but I do not have it right now.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR. ARTE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has said that officers of the Ministry of Public works are renovating the maternity ward of the hospital right now, but I have been there and seen that no such thing is  happening.	Not even authority to incur expenditure has been released in thisregard.	If what he says is true, could he give us when this authority wasreleased?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. ole SOMPISHA: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I still stick to the fact that officers of the Ministry of Public Works are working there right now because this is the information I have here in black and white. 	If our officers,  who are supposed to inform us accordingly are Misleading us, the hon. Member 	should be able to prove this.	I have said that we rely on the answers we getfrom our officers in Garissa and elsewhere, and we trust	I hope thatour officers in Garissa are not misleading us, but if the hon. Questioner proves that they are misleading us, he could see us in the Ministry and check things with him to see if what he says is true.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS:	On a point of order.

MAKHANU asked the Minister 	for Agriculture whether, in view of the high cost of drying tobacco by farmers in Malakisi B.A.T. Leaf Base Zone and the effect this has on natural forests, he could direct B.A.T. to undertake to purchase raw tobacco and dry it at his own drying barns. <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE 	(Mr. Ngaruro): 	Mr. Deputy Speaker,  Sir, I beg to reply. I cannot direct B.A.T.  to undertake to purchase raw tobacco and dry it since the company has no drying barns and, at the same time, this may prove to be disadvantageous  to farmers in that area</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is a very unsatisfactoryanswer and, particularly coming from a Kenyan, it is very interesting.	The pointI am raising here is that the cost of curing tobacco in that area is very high,  and it is having a general effect on afforestation in the area. Secondly, the pricing structure of B.A.T., that is the money paid to farmers for their cured tobacco, is very little. Since this is a multinational company that is capable of running its own afforestation schemes and building its own curing barns, it is simple logic to direct the company to save the farmer by building its own tobacco curing barns.	Would the Assistant Minister agree to this?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGARURO:	No, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will not agree to thisrequest because the whole operation is based on the fact that B.A.T. contracts farmers to grow tobacco and use their own firewood to dry the tobacco. Before these farmers are contracted by B.A.T., they are required to plant trees for the purpose of curing their tobacco and, in this case, they do not encroach on natural forests. Therefore, there is no need of changing the whole set up because doing this would mean extra expenses on the part of the farmer that we want to protect.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>Mr. mangoli; 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is very interesting that the Assistant Minister insists that he is not going to do anything about this problem.	B.A.T. is making a lot of profit, and it can afford to build tobacco curing barns at its own cost.	So, could the Assistant Minister direct the companyto take over this service that the farmer is now supplying? 	It appears that the Ministry is colluding with this multinational company.</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR. NGARURO:  	 Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir  ,   the Government  is colluding with any multinational company.	In fact, the policy of the Governmentis to try and assist the farmers to get a fair return for their efforts. 	what the hon. Member is suggesting would mean that the farmer would have to shoulder a lot Of expenses because, in the first place, the quality of tobacco grown by different farmers is not the same. So, central curing would result to poor quality  tobacco and expense to the farmer and the company. 	BAT technicians assist the farmers in farming and, indeed, in curing the tobacco to ensure that the quality is maintained arid that returns on investments are guaranteed and continually improved. 	Secondly, central curing is not economical for tobacco farmers as BAT would be collecting green leaf which contains 90 per cent water and, therefore, transporting water instead of leaf. 	Consequently,  the return to the farmers would be extremely low s most of the value added in curing would go into transportation and into hiring extra labour.</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: 	 Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, is the Assistant Minister interestedin encouraging farmers to grow tobacco	or is he interested in promoting BAT?	Ifhe is interested in encouraging and supporting BAT instead of the farmers, thenwe can tell the farmers not to grow tobacco.	It is wrong for an Assistant Ministerfor Agriculture to come here and support BAT instead of supporting the farmers.	Canthe Assistant Minister tell the House whether he. is encouraging farmers to growtobacco or not?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGARURO:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,	for sure, we are encouragingfarmers to grow tobacco.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU:  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, probably the Assistant Minister has not done  his homework with regard to this affair.	It is very costly to curetobacco in Malakisi, and it is even becoming more costly to us and the governmentin its afforestation programme.	First of all, BAT is not very forthcoming inassisting the farmer to defray expenses in afforestation.	If they did so, theywould have allocated money to the district development committee to plant trees.  In light of the problems that are being faced by farmers, I would like the Ministry to review the price structure of tobacco upwards and, if that fails, to direct the BAT company to take over the curing process even if it means curing the tobacco On the farms of the farmers.	Can he think of doing that?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGARURO:	Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir, I think we have been talkingabout the curing of tobacco.	As regards pricing,. we are prepared to ldok into thematter. 	As far as the curing of tobacco is concerned, it is better to note that the crop is well graded when it is cured.	It is very difficult to grade tobaccowhen it is green.	For record purposes, BAT company has over 11 tree nurseriesin the country, from where tobacco farmers and other Kenyans can go for seedlings. There' is also the company's afforestation programme and today there are 21.1. million surviving trees grown by the tobacco farmers in tobacco growing areas. On the. balance, therefore, there are more trees grown by tobacco farmers than they use in curing tobacco. The alternative of curing tobacco would be more expensive as we would be required to use oil. 	Therefore, the method currently employed is more economical. As for the pricing, the Ministry is prepared to look into the matter.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: 	While now appreciating that the Ministry is getting back , to its senses, I would like the Assistant Minister to assure the farmers in Malakisi that the pricing structure is going to be adjusted soon, even if it means being done tomorrow.	It is that particular aspect that we are concerned with.	Firstof all, it takes too much time to dry tobacco.	As the Assistant Minister has beensaying here, there is the aspect of afforestation. 	The people of Malakisi use ordinary trees.	We are telling the Assistant Minister what happens because wecome from the area.	So, what we want the Assistant Minister to do is to ask theBAT company to raise the prices of dried tobacco.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. NGARURO:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, since I am in my senses, I cannotdirect BAT company to review tobacco prices tomorrow.	That is not possible, andI am sure that the hon. Member, since he is in his right senses, sees the reason.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: 	On a point of Order, Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir. 	Did I under stand that the Assistant Minister well , that he is going to direct BAT company to take over the responsibility of curing tobacco and doing it on the farmer's farms? Did he say that?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sure the hon. Member heard it all wrong.</Newspeech>	  <Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: Then what is the right answer?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Sir,  I said that as far as the system is concerned, the farmer himself takes care of his own  production because he has been trained. A gold farmer will not tolerate his tobacco being mixed up with somebody else's  tobacco.	As I said, it is very difficult to grade green tobacco. Therefore, the    farmer should dry his own tobacco so that he can get the maximum return for his effort.</Newspeech> Question No. 	112 <Header>Payment of NSSF Benefits to Mr. Juma</Header> MR. MWAMZANDI asked the Minister for Labour why Mr. Hamadi Juma, NSSF No. 127 283 501, has not  been  paid his benefits. <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR	(Mr. D.M.

His firstapplication of 24th November,	1986, was rejected on 17th March,	1987, due to unclearthumb prints.

It is for .the Questioner to find out the whereabouts of thecheque.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Next Question!</Newspeech> Question No.165 <Header>Number Of 1989 K.C.P.E. Masalani Students in Government Schools</Header> MR. ARTE asked the Minister for Education how many students from Moi Masalani.2oarding Primary School, who sat for the 1989 K.C.P.E. obtained entry to Government maintained and assisted secondary schools. <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT 	MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Omodi): Mr. Deputy Speaker,  Sir, I beg to reply. None of the 	18 pupils who sat for the 	1989 K.C.P.E at Moi Masalani Boarding Primary School were admitted to any secondary school. This was because it was proved beyond any doubt that there was cheating involved in the Arts 	 and Craft  Music, Home Science and Business Education examination papers.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, would the Assistant Minister tell this Rouse where the invigilators were when the cheating was done by the pupils.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR. OMIDO: Unfortunately, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it was one of the  	invigilators who gave the question papers to the pupils and the necessary actionhas already been taken against him.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KUBO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the Assistant Minister is taking this matter very lightly but it is a very serious issue.  The fact of the matter is that it was an officer of the Government from that same Ministry 	 who was responsible for this mess, and as a result of this, innocent children are suffering.  Would the Assistant Minister agree with me that since the fault was on part of the Ministry, these children should not be punished and that they should be given their results?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.OMIDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is taking this matter very seriously.  We have  always insisted that cheating should be avoided in all examinations and this is why the Ministry took disciplinary action against the officer concerned. For the information of the Rouse the pupils concerned have been Allowed to repeat so that they can sit for the same examination at the end of this year.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. ARTE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the answer given by the Assistant Minister is most unsatisfactory. 	He himself is a father and therefore he knows that the education of these innocent pupils has been retarded by one full year. Therefore can he tell this Rouse what action has been taken against those responsible for this serious offence?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. OMIDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to inform the House and the hon. Member that the officer concerned has been interdicted  pending any, 	 disciplinary measures that the committee concerned might recommend to be taken against him. However, I have already told the House that the pupils affected have been allowed to repeat Std. VIII so that they can sit for the same examination again this year. We very much regret their suffering but we must stamp out cheating in all examinations.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SALAT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is a very serious issue since it has also affected other schools. I remember there was a similar question asked here by another hon. Member regarding cheating in an examination as a result of which innocent pupils suffered. Could the Assistant Minister tell this 	 House what criteria they use  to find out that pupils in a certain school have cheated? Supposing  an invigilator passed the wrong answers to the pupils so that they ended up failing the examination, would that be called cheating?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMIDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, it is very easy to detect cheating in an examination and it has not been difficult at all to detect schools in which pupils have cheated. 	If all the pupils in this school accepted to be misled, they are also party to this cheating and we have taken this action to try and impress upon the pupils that they must not accept to be misled by any invigilator. 	If they accept to be cheated, then they stand to suffer the consequence. 	Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to all the pupils to report any case where they feel they are being given information which they are not entitled to get.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the reply by the Assistant Minister, how did they find out the pupils who had cheated?  If for example, there are three streams in a school, and it is found out that pupils in one stream have cheated, is it right for the pupils in the entire school        to be punished? How did the Ministry come to the conclusion that the pupils in the entire school had cheated?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MB. OMIDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is a hypothetical question, but 	in a case where children have received examination answers, they could Very easily 	 pass on the same answers to pupils in the other classes sitting for the same examination in which case, the whole school will be affected.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KUBO: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. 	I think the Assistant Minister is misleading the House. Earlier on, he said that the invigilator is the one Who passed Examination papers to the pupils and now he is saying that the pupils agreed to be misled. These children were very innocent and I do not think he is in order to say that they agreed to be misled. I was replying to a supplementary question by hon. Salat when I said if an invigilator passes on answers to pupils in a class, and then the same pupils pass the same answers to people’s in another class in the same school, then the whole school would be affected. That is what I said.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. ANASWA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the Ministry's decision to allowed the pupils to repeat the K.C.P.E., it is important to note the parents of these unfortunate pupils paid school fees, boarding fees and examination fees last year. In view of this fact, could the Ministry consider waiving the examination fees for these pupils.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. OMIDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will not consider that because the pupils themselves condoned that act.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. BIDU. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in view of the seriousness of this matter, what steps is the Ministry taking to make sure that this kind of cheating does not happen again in future?.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. OMIDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have told the souse that the Ministry is doing all it can to ensure that examination answers are not leaked  	to the pupils.  However, we know there are crooks in this country as there are  everywhere in the word, but We are trying as much as possible to eliminate any cheating in examinations and we shall continue to do this to the best of our ability.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>DR.  WAMEYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker,  Sir, we have all taken for granted that the pupils in this particular school cheated in this particular examination. However, may I know from the Assistant Minister how the examiners came to find 	out that these pupils had cheated?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. OMIDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if candidates give similar answers throughout, then examiners would know there is something wrong somewhere and investigations start from there. When investigations were carried out in this particular case, it was found beyond any reasonable doubt that cheating had taken place.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has told the House that if all the children give the same answer to a Question in an examination it means that they have cheated.  We know that 2 x 2 = 4.   But if all the children in a class get 4 as the answer that does not mean that they have cheated. May I have a better explanation from the Assistant Minister?</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR. OMIDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in this particular case we are not, dealing with 2 x 2; we are dealing with   subjects like Arts & Crafts, Music, Home Science and Business Education.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. A.H.O., MOMANYI: Mr. Deputy Speaker,	  	Sir, sincethe Assistant Minister says that it	is very easy to detect cases 	of cheating in an examination, could he find ways and means of helping those pupils.	In this country we have beautiful houses	but youwill find that when it	rains, the roofs ofsome of the houses do leak.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMIDO:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we cannot do that.But where possible the Ministry will act	as it acted in thisCase; by allowing the pupils to repeat the examination.   However, I am not saying this is going to be the	trend because it caneasily create a situation whereby pupils will find it easy to cheat. We want to eliminate cheating in examinations completely.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. WASIKE NDOMBI:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, theAssistant Minister has informed this House that the	officerconcerned has been interdicted.   That means that the officer is enjoying half salary when the children are going to 	sitfor the examination again at double the expenses.	Would the	 Assistant Minister consider, as a future policy, introducing a  more  	deterrent punishment instead of sheer interdiction?  This is because after this interdiction you may find that the officer has gone back to work.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR.

Could he tell the House what he is going to do with these Qualified people who have worked for seven years as casuals?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. BOMET: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the reason why we call these people casual  workers is that every year, at a period known to them, they are actually asked to go back home; If they were on permanent employment they would  work for 12 months continuously.  But since these 	jobs are seasonal these people are asked to go home at a certain period when there is no work to be done.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.	 DEPUTY SPEAKER:	Mr. Momanyi's Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NDZAI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER	Overruled!</Newspeech>Question No.162 <Header>Sub standard Battery Cells from Union Carbide Limited.</Header> MR. A.H.O. MOMANYI asked the Minister for Industry since the battery cells currently produced by Union Carbide Limited are sub standard, what 	measures he is taking to direct the management of this company to manufacture cells that comply with the regulations outlined by the Kenya Bureau of Standards; <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY	(Mr. Kiplagat):	Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply;From 24th October,	1986, the battery manufacturing businessof the Union.	Carbide Limited was taken over in Kenya by EvereadyBatteries, Kenya	Limited. Dry Primary cells and batteriesmust conform to the Kenya Standard Specification No. KS 04-184 of 1979. The Kenya Standard is equivalent to the International Electro technical Commission (IEC) Standard, and tests batteries on  six parameters; 	(1)  dimensions 	 (2)  1eakage 	(3) initial life  (4) delayed life, i:e. life six months after manufacture 	(5) off-load voltage conditions and (6) insulation. There are two type6 of batteries manufactured by Eveready yin Kenya: (a) The Red Label  (Standard) type which should pass an "initial life" test	   of	24 hours, and a "delayed life" test of102 hours in use:	(b) The Black Label	(Heavy Duty) type which shouldpass an "initial life" test	of 164 hours, and a "delayed life" testof 135 hours in use:	  plumbers and carpenters are engaged as casuals:  This means thatthey are already working	 on temporary terms.  The  AssistantMinister should not talk about "when vacancies arise" because thevacancies are already there.	Why can he not employ 	these people on permanent terms?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOMET:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, those people areCasuals.	We do not have any permanent employment openings.	Whenvacancies arise we will employ them.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NDZAI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir:Does the Assistant minister want to tell the House that thesetrained	plumbers and carpenters who have been working forthe last seven years will not be employed permanently?	Does want totell us that no  	vacancies have arisen over the last sevenyears?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. BOMET: 	We have no permanent establishment there, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,  There are quite a  number of Government Ministries that service that particular Settlement Scheme.  But we do not have permanent openings for these people:  If vacancies arise in future, we will employ these people.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. DeputySpeaker, Sir.  When a person works as a casual for seven years it means that there is a steady job for him to do there.  So, could the Assistant Minister consider employing these people on permanent and pensionable terms?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: He himself is am casual!</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. BOMET:	Mr. Deputy	Sir,	these jobs doneby plumbers and carpenters do are of a temporary nature.  They ariseoccasionally in the		settlement schemes	Theseworks are carried out seasonally.  For instance we	may requirea plumber when there is water shortage particularly during the dry season;  We therefore cannot employ them on a permanent basis.   Recent tests by the Kenya Bureau of Standards 	(K.B.S.) on battery samples submitted by Eveready Batteries (K) Ltd. have sometimes shown that one out of three batteries 'failed the "leakage" and "life" tests. The information	was communicated to the Company which under took to make improvements.	Members may have noticed the launchingby the Company of the nevi PAKA POWER  PREMIUM Battery which will replace the former BLACK LABEL Heavy Duty Battery.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO:	On a  point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.The hon. Assistant Minister is reading to us a long story.	Butthe 	question before the house reads, and I quote: "Since the battery cells currently Produced by the Union Carbide (K) Ltd. are substandard,   " We wanted to know from the Assistant Minister, does  he agreethat the Union Carbide 	(K) Ltd. is producing substandard batteries or not, and why?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY 	(Mr. Kiplagat): 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in matters of standard or Quality, one has to be very detailed. So, I was going to that conclusion and I hope the hon. Member will allow other hon. Members to listen to what we have done about the complaints that we have received so far. 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have taken action and the K.B.S. is working closely with the Company to monitor progress.	 TheGovernment is encouraging competition in our industries.	Productsof the two battery manufacturers are also being tested currently by the K.B.S and will be approved for normal distribution after satisfying the Kenya Standards.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. LEWA: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the reply from the Assistant Minister is very detailed and he does, in fact, accept the fact that one out of every three batteries is defective from   the Eveready Batteries(K) Ltd. 	If this is so, why does the Ministryencourage this continue misleading the public by heavy   expenditure on radio and television on their advertisements which are advertising products that are defective?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KIPLAGAT: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as a matter of clarification, it is not always that one out of three batteries that is defective, but sometimes. 	This is not a recurrent experience. 	So,  I would like to correct the impression that one out of every three batteries is bad. Secondly, as to the question of advertising which they negotiate probably with the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation 	(K.B.C.), we have no control on their advertising expenditure. But we think they have a reason, if they are launching a new product, they may have to spend quite a bit of money to inform the customers about the new product.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. LEWA: 	On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think it is not fair for the Assistant Minister to say that it is out of their control to monitor the advertising budget for this Company.  But surely, wananchi have a right to be protected by the  Ministry, particularly if a company is spending so much money to promote what, in fact, is a defective product. Any comments?</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR. KIPLAGAT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question was whether the Ministry is aware that the batteries are substandard, and we have gone to great length of explaining our investigations and findings. 	They are meeting the standards.  However, as for the advertising budget, we do not consider it to be Misleading because, after :	all they are talking about a new product.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MONANYI:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Company has beentaking wananchi for a ride by manufacturing substandard batteries. Since these batteries are so many in the market, can he consider reducing their prices?</Newspeech> (applause)  <Newspeech>MR. KIPLAGAT:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think it would bemisleading if we said that the Ministry had accepted that the company 	 had been taking the consumers for a ride. 	What we have said 	is that whenever any deficient product was found, they Were informed and asked to rectify accordingly.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. KUBO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in view of the fact that	 the Assistant Minister has accepted that the random checks haveProved that some of their batteries are below standard, would he agree with me that the Company should be stopped from selling those batteries and sell the new type because the ones that are in circulation are likely to be of substandard quality?  Can he order that they be withdrawn completely from the market until they have produced the new type which they approved?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.	KIPLAGAT:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think when I didmention of cases where one  out of every three batteries was found to be defective, this was on the popular brand, the Standard Size.The popular bred is the one that is commonly used by wananchi, and, therefore, it would not be fair to order the company to stop the manufacture or sale of a Product that is being relied upon by many people for their radio, torches and son on in the rural areas</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

EKIDOR:  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister of State, Office of the President the following Question by Private Notice. 	What urgent steps is the Minister taking to eradicate cattle rustling in Lokichoggio, Kakuma and Kibish Divisions of Turkana District and how many animals have so far been recovered as a result of the incident of 25th January; 17th March and 7th April, 1990?</Newspeech> <newspeech>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Kyalo): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. The Government tightened security and intensified patrols and reconnaissance in Lokichoggio, Kakuma and Kibish Divisions following the cattle rustling incidents. A total of 500 heads of cattle have been recoveredas a result of the incident of 25th January,1990; 581 goats have also beenrecovered as a result of the incident of 17th March, 1990 and 60 heads of cattle have been recovered as a result of the incident of 7th April, 1990. </newspeech><newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: 	1.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, is the Minister sure of handing over records of the goats and if so can he inform the House the names or the handing over certificates of the people who received these goats? This is because not even a single goat was handed over. </newspeech>	<newspeech>MR. KYALO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the Questioner has any information that is contrary to what I am saying, he should pass it over to us so that the truth can be established.This because as far as we areconcerned the goats were handed over. </newspeech><newspeech>MR. EKIDOR:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have notified the Minister that there was not single goat that was handed over. So, it is his dutyto find out from the district commissioner whether the handing over was done properly and officially. He should not ask me for about this matter. </newspeech><newspeech>MR. KYALO:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would be very gratefulif the hon. Member could provide me with information showing that the information we have is not correct.If he does that, then action will be taken. </newspeech><newspeech>MR Arap CHEPKOK:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, what sort of informationdoes the Minister need when what we are talking about is common knowledge. What the hon. Member has told the House is nothing, but the truth. He shouldinstead get more information from the district commissioner. Is he in orderto ask the hon. Member to provide him with information? </newspeech><newspeech>MR. KYALO: MR . Deputy Speaker, Sir, the allegation that	hasbeen made by the	hon. Member that the goats were not handed over was very serious and such a matter needs to be handled with the seriousness it deserves. My Ministry is prepared to look into this matter and ensure that all the correct information is obtained which is why I am requesting the hon. Member, to provide us if with that information which he thinks is contrary to what we know. </newspeech> 	 	<newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Minister also tell the House when security was tightened in that area, that is, whether it was done yesterday or today? This is because although there has beensecurity in that area cattle rustling has been going on. What does he meanby tightening security when people are still being killed by bandits and cattle are still being rustled? </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  KYALO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the fact that 500 head of cattle were recovered is an indication that our security personnel there  are very alert. </newspeech><newspeech>MR. KUBO: 	MR. Deputy Speaker, Sir, since this is a very serious matter and since the Minister has said that about  500 head of cattle were recovered, would it as a matter of policy not have been proper for the Ministry to involve the local leaders and politicians in that area when they were handing over these cattle so that everybody could have seen for themselves and be	  made aware that the cattle were being handed over to the owners?	 Since they did not do that it seems that the information they have may be misleading because they did not involve the local leaders of that area.So, could he in the future promise to involve the local leadership in such matters	show the people the action that the Government is taking? </newspeech><newspeech>MR. KYALO:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, from that I would assumethat the hon. Member is trying to find out whether our procedures regarding such matters are correct. I would like to assure him that the laid down  procedure is adhered to the letter. </newspeech><newspeech>MR. ANG'ELEI:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the Questioneris not satisfied with the reply given by the Minister, and since he says that  no single goat was handed over, could the Minister be asked to go back and get us the proper reply to this Question? </newspeech> <newspeech>MR.  KYALO :-  Mr.- Deputy Speaker if the hon. questioner has information to the contrary, I am prepared to meet him after Question time, so that we can discuss that matter and establish the truth. I therefore, invite the hon. Questioner to bring the information that he has so that it can be verified. Riots at-the Kenya Water Institute </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  KIPKORIR: 	Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to ask the Minister for Water Development the following Question by Private Notice. What has been the cause of the numerous recent reported riots at the Kenya Water Institute,  Nairobi ? </newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr.  Kisiero): Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to reply. I am not aware of there having been numerous riots at the Kenya Water Institute recently, as alleged by the hon. Member. If my English serves me right, Sir, a riot is a violent outburst of lawlessness by people in an area. 	There has never been such a thing in the Institute, otherwise, the Institute would have been closed. However, there was a sit in, in August/September, 1980 by those students who were attending Courses at the Kenya Polytechnic when their accommodation allowance was discontinued in accordance with the current Government policy on cost-sharing. This was,  however,  solved when the students were given accommodation at the institute. Again,  on 26th February, 1990,  the same students complained that they should be offered transport to the Kenya Polytechnic. This could not be done as it is not provided for in all training institutes to pre-service students unless they are on training tours. The students m realised they were losers and  	continued with their studies. On	12th March,1990,  the students refused to attend classes claiming that they were not allowed to have visitors rooms and that their diet was not varied. Again, after explanation of the school rules and disci1ine and that they getting food which was comparable to any offered in any  other institute, continued with their studies. Sir,  I cannot go by what appeared in the newspapers. All I know t is that there were no riots. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  KIPKORIR: 	The Assistant Minister has said that there has not been  there. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  KISIERO:	Mr.  Deputy-Speaker,  Sir,  as I had saidearlier, sit-ins and minor complaints are not riots.For theinformation of the House, one of the students who has been a ring leader of those sit-ins was introduced to the Institute by hon. Kipkorir. He has been the main ring leader who have been leading the others and organising the sit-ins. I would, therefore request hon.  Kipkorir to talk to him so that he can concentrate on his studies and not on petty complaints. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  KIPKORIR: I have personally received those complaints from the students, but the a Assistant Minister has denied that the Institute had experienced any riots. He has also referred as a booster of the sit-ins, as if I am a student Is the the Assistant Minister in order  to say that? </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  KISIERO: Sir, the three ring-leaders were	Mr.  Eric Mureithi Rutere, Mr.  Herman Kirwai and Mr.  David K. Biw who was introduced to the Institute by hon. Kipkorir. Through the introduction of the hon. Member he was taken as a student after  the other students had been admitted. I have the documentary evidence here.	That is why I have requested the hon.  Member who is a dedicated leader,  to talk to that young man,  so that he can complete his studies properly. </newspeech><newspeech>MR. MALEBE:	I think the Assistant Minister israising very  advanced allegations on that issue. He has said that hon.  Kipkorir introduced that young man so that he could be enrolled as student,  it is it wrong for a Member of Parliament to introduce his constituents for admission to a college or for employment? Could the Assistant Minister withdraw the statement that hon. Kipkorir was the ring leader because he brought that student to the Institute. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  KISIERO:  Sir,  I never said that hon. Kipkorir was  a ring leader in that matter. I was only seeking his assistance  as a leader and also as a person who knows that young man very well.	I only requested him to talk to the young man and advise him to do his studies instead of involving himself with other things.That is all I said. I did not accuse hon. Kipkorir of anything. </newspeech><newspeech>MR. MALEBE:	I think the matter still serious because theAssistant Minister is taking Mr.  Kipkorir as the counsellor of  the Kenya Water Institute. 	Is the management of the Institute not capable of disciplining that fellow instead of asking the hon. Member to go and discipline him? </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  KISIERO: Sir, we are all old men, and if there is a problem that we can help one another, we assist other we shall write final warning letters to those three young men telling giving the final warning and that they should not involve themselves in matters that are not conducive to studies. otherwise as elderly People we should talk to those young men. </newspeech> <newspeech>MR.  KUBO:  From the answer by the Assistant Minister,it is quite clear that there has been some misunderstandings  between the Institute management and the students, although it may not have been a riot. The question here is what is the Ministry trying to do about that problem. Instead of penalising individual students? Why does the ministry not set up a committee to investigate the  operation of the Institute ?. Penalising a few students will not slove that problem. Therefore could the Assistant Minister tell us that he is doing to solve the problems that are affecting that Institute, because it appears that he has already agreed that they are there? </newspeech> <newspeech>MR.  KISIERO:  Sir, we have already talked to the students.  One of the problems was that the students wanted to g be given a bus to be taking them  from one point to the other. 	We told them that due to the current system of cost sharing, it was not possible for the Institute to provide them with a bus.	There was also the issue of pocket money which was withdrawn last July.	Itwas not only withdrawn from the students at the Kenya Water Institute, but also from similar institutions, We explained that  issue to them and they understood. The students also wanted their visitors to be visiting them in their rooms at odd hours.	We explained them that according to the school rules, it 'not right to have visitors in their rooms at odd hours.	Therefore,	we have solved the differences,  and the students have understood us and  we have also understood them. </newspeech>  4Its <newspeech>MR.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. This morning the very hon. Chepkok alleged that Members of the Back Bench were having problems with the Front Benchers when answering Questions. Hon. Chepkok made this allegation when hon. Mbori had risen to answer a Question here. Because this was wholesale accusation, hon. Chepkok was asked to substantiate and in the process, cited me as one of the Assistant Ministers who came to   this House with inadequate  answers.	I was not in the House at that time and Mr. Chepkok was restrained	from discussing me in my absence.I am now in possession of the HANSARD and because at a later stage I indicated my intention to take up the issue and having studied the circumstances under which the remarks were made, I would like to state here that I have always taken the business of this House very seriously and answered any Questions referred to me to the best of my ability. I would not like to take the issue further with hon. Chepkok in the light of the fact that I am now convinced that he is a normal Member of Parliament and taking into consideration the fact that he had only obtained a certificate of sanity from Mathare Mental Hospital two weeks ago. Thank you. </newspeech> <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION,(Mr. Karauri):-On apoint of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. You will recall that this morning hon. Salat asked a supplementary question which I said I would respond to later on. I said that I was going to ring the District Education Officer and ask for the required information. First of all, I wish to apologise because the hon.

Last time when I was answering; Question No. 74, I was asked to inform the House where the construction team was based in Machakos District and I have the following answer: Masii camp was set up in 1987 and the team has beenworking in the area since.It is, however normal to seek skilledsupport from one team to another. For example, in December 1989,the Masii team was temporarily transferred to assist in speeding up the construction of the line from Machakos junction to Salama in order to provide power to the Nore Turesh booster station which serves Machakos District. This work covered 57kilometres, and teams had to be temporarily transferredfrom various other sites to assist in this work. The team also assisted in theconstruction of the line to Kilungu, also in Machakos District. For theinformation of the hon. Member, the team is now back to Masii, and it will continue with its work as programmed.To be very specific, the team reportedback on 23rd April,1990. Thank you. </newspeech><newspeech>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. My point,of order regards the tea conditions in Nyambene Sub-District, and I intend torequest the Minister for Agriculture to come up with a statement on the situationregarding these conditions. In Nyambene Sub-District, we have only one teafactory, called Kiegoi, whose capacity is 50,000 kilogrammes of tea. Currently,this factory is working over capacity at 80,000 kilogrammes. As a result, tea is rotting in all collection centres because, due to the rain conditions we have today, tea is not reaching the factory. .17 In 	1983, Meru District Development Committee recommended that an extra tea factory be built somewhere between Igembe and Tigania Divisions, and we would request the Minister to come up with a statement informing the farmers in that area as to when his Ministry is going to start constructing the new factory to cater for the tea that is currently rotting in collection centres. Thank you. </newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri):	Mr. Deputy  Speaker, Sir, I appreciate what hon. Malebe has said about tea in Nyambene. I represent Tigania, which is in Nyambene.  The hon. Member talked about 80,000 kilogrammes of tea, but Tigania alone harvests over eight million kilogrammes, and not 80,000 kilogrammes of tea. </newspeech><newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Naibu Spika.  Ningependa kumweleza mwenzangu, mhe. Ogle, kwamba hafai kudhubutu kusema kwamba nilikwenda Mathari Mental Hospital kwa sababu akifanya hivi, nitamchafua vibaya sana katika Bunge lili hili kwa sababu ninaijua hali yake sana.  Ningependa kumweleza pia leo kwamba akitaka kwenda nje ya Bunge, asitumie ule mlango wa kando pale pembeni ambao unatumiwa na maofisa wa Bunge wanapoleta ujumbe hapa ndani. Mlango wa kawaida unaotumiwa na waheshimiwaWabunge uko pale mbele. Leo asubuhi, alipitia kwenye ule mlango wa kando nakutokea mlango wa mbele.	Kwa hivyo, inaonekana kwamba haelewi na utaratibu wahapa, lakini ninajua kwamba hii ndiyo mara yake ya kwanza kuwa hapa Bungeni. Hata hivyo, ninaijua Hospitali ya Mathari sana, na nitampeleka huko ili aangaliwe kichwa kwa sababu kichwa chake si kizuri. </newspeech><i>(Laughter) </i><newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Mibei): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I offer to promote reconciliation between the two hon.

(Mr. Cheruiyot): On apoint of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. In view of the fact that there hasbeen a lot of contribution and that perhaps we have exhausted our contribution, I beg to move that the Minister be now called upon to reply. </newspeech>	<newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I will put the Question straightaway. </newspeech><i>(Question, that the Mover be now called upon to reply, 	put and agreed to) </i><newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Mbela): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. I would like to start by thanking hon. Members for the good contribution that they made during the debate on the amendment Bill. The principal intention and object of this Bill is to amend the Land Acquisition Act (Cap. 295 of the Laws of Kenya) to ensure prompt payment of compensation and  settlement of disputes on compensation for compulsorily acquired land. Thisaim is stated in the memorandum of objects and reasons, and it is definitely not that we should nationalise any land, but that we protect the property of owners at all times.  At times, there occurs a conflict of interests between individuals and community property. The whole Bill intends to protect public interests by justified acquisition of land and speedy and adequate compensation for the same. 	As hon. Members are aware, our Government is very mindful of the people's welfare, and also Section 75 of our Constitution offers full protection 71. of individual ownership.	The Government has no intention of deviating from thisconstitutional guarantee.	At the same time, it is important that schools,health centres, security installations and other public facilities be built for wananchi's benefit.	In the	1968 Act, speed was not essential.	In fact, we evennotice that the rate of interest was fixed at 6 per cent. This Act onlyprotected the Government and did not bother about the interests of wananchi. 	I would like to take this opportunity to comment on some of the contribution that was made by various hon. Members of this House. Firstly,  I would like to address myself to the issues that were raised by hon. Habib Madhubuti during his contribution to the amendment Bill. The hon. Member implied during his speech that, having been born in Taita-Taveta District, I should show some bias in solving land problems affecting Coast Province. This is a new dimension in our national politics because, as far as I know, a Minister is appointed to carry out the functions of his office nationally without favour or prejudice. To be more specific, I would like to inform hon. Madhubuti that the whole of Lamu District is state land and this, as far as I am aware, has in no way inconvenienced the residents of the District. Recently, my Ministry demarcated 747 settlement plots at Hindi and Magogoni Settlement Schemes and gave priority to the Gunya tribe in Lamu, to which hon. Madhubuti belongs. <i>(Mr. Deputy Speaker left-the Chair) </i><i>(The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Wabuge) took the Chair)</i> Unfortunately, only 580 accepted them by paying 10 per cent.  As I speak, 167 plotshave not been paid for. To make it worse, only 30 per cent of the people who wereoffered these plots of land in Lamu District have moved to the land. I considerthat hon. Madhubuti has a duty of educating his people to utilise land. They seemto believe that life is only complete if it is within Lamu and Manda islands. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I feel that hon. Madhubuti has been a bit unfair in the sense that we are involved in negotiations concerning Manda -	Island, negotiations which have reached a very delicate stage. Unfortunately, what he said is quite imprudent and impolitic because it goes to interfere with whatever we are discussing with some of my colleagues. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to refer to your own contributions during this debate. 	First, I would like to assure you that the cost 	_ of moving from land that the Government intends to acquire will be borne by the Government. In particular, I would like to assure the House that where we are taking over a land that has a house belonging to the owner, we will ensure that we compensate him at a price not below the cost of rebuilding the house anew. In addition, we pay 15 per cent over and above the valuation of both the land and the development, to make sure that the man is not unduly inconvenienced. As I said earlier,  in 1968 the prevailing rate of interest was six per cent." Times have changed and, currently,  the Kenya Government is paying about 13.5 per cent when you deposit money in a bank. 	We would like to assume that once compensation is determined at a particular level, that is safe money that the Government is holding, and if it is held beyond time considered to be reasonable, then interest will be paid as if that money had been invested in a bank. Sir, I share the concern of this House also that those whose property is acquired should not become destitute. Here, however, we are faced with thegreed of man. As soon as men are paid huge amounts of money, they disappear fromtheir homes, go and spend the money and come back when it is fully spent. The Government cannot be held responsible where a man goes and spends money given rightly  as compensation and then comes back to face the family without any money to resettIe. As you are aware, His Excellency the President is very keen that where family land is being sold, the matter should go through the relevant land control board and all members of the family should have their views sought before the land is disposed of. Maybe, there is need for the provincial administration to make arrangements such that where compensation money is being paid, there is opened a joint account between the husband and the members of the family in order to ensure that money paid out as compensation is protected until the family find an alternative place to settle. In our experience, we have found that we rarely acquire complete propertybelonging to a family. In many cases, we acquire little portions which do notsubstantially affect the future of the family. On occasions where we have acquiredthe complete property of a family, we have gone out of our way to see whether we can settle that family. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I can recall cases of land which was acquired for extension Of Karatina hospital, and where the people were given alternative land in Magutu Settlement Scheme. We have also had the case I mentioned earlier in Manda Island, where people were given alternative land but, unfortunately, they resorted to staying within Lamu Island without taking up the allocated land. Sir, we have had other very informative contributions from other hon. Members, one of them bordering on a complaint on land owners, particularly at the Coast Province.	The case was raised by hon. Nassir.	He complained about themany absentee landlords who have land and never make use of it.	In a situationlike that,  it is very tempting for landless people to move in and begin to produce food to feed their families. I would like draw the attention of the House to the fact that there exists a law in this country where, if a squatter stays on your land for 12 years, under adverse conditions, you cannot get rid of him without making adequate provisions as to where he is to go.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we also had a very good Contribution and very good suggestions from hon. P.J. Masinde concerning land that was acquired for Sofia Prison in Busia. The issue has taken eight years to resolve. If we were happy about the Act as it exists, we would not be bringing it forward for amendment; we are bringing it forward for amendment because we feel that it does not do justice to land owners as it is. In this particular case, the matter took eight years, and I am pleased to say that the problems have been resolved. Eight years, however,  mes that the money has depreciated because it was earning interest at the rate of six per cent. Sir, there was also another suggestion that the tribunal to be set up should sit permanently. I would like to assure the House that it is the intention of the Ministry to ensure that the tribunal sits to dispose of all the cases as speedily as possible. At any rate, all cases should be disposed of within 24 months so that nobody is kept in any suspense at all. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there was another contribution from hon. Keah, which I consider to be unfortunate. His argument was that the people from Kilifi District are entitled to move into Government land as and when they want. Those people have a style where they cultivate Government land and then the following year move to another piece.In no time at all, you find those peopleoccupying as many as five different pieces of land.	I would like to say that theConstitution of Kenya protects the property of its people, and Government property is no exception. 	We will not entertain the idea of people merely moving into a Government land just because they want to lay a claim to it. 	Unfortunately, we have had some very bad experiences with squatters down at the Coast. 	A lot of them are not genuine squatters; a lot of them are even sponsored by rich Arabs and Asians so that they can go and be allocated the land. After being allocated the land, you find them vacating it immediately and wanting to sell it to these same Asians and Arabs want to be considered for that particular land. I would like to promise that we shall be very vigilant to make sure that commercial squatters are not entertained.   Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Mang'oli and several other hon. Members raised a point regarding  machinery and said that a set of equipment or machinery could become redundant the moment Government acquires the plot on which the machinery has been installed. As matter of principle, we compensate for, any machinery that we are disturbing and this proposed amendment makes a provision for this so that the owner can be compensated for the machinery whether he wants to use it or not.	If he does not require it, Government will compensate himallowing for any depreciation that there could be.	On the other hand, if it ishis wish to take away the machinery, he is allowed to do so at his own cost. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, a remark was made that my Ministry is only active in Ardhi House.  I would like to assure this House that we now have a scientific way of managing the various functions that we have been given. Everybody within the Ministry is given a task and a time limit in which to accomplish that task. That is why it has been Possible to produce in no time at all, one million title deeds that are now become a problem for us to store. We have been very active in areas like Bungoma and 	Mt. Elgon, although we have been  working very quietly there. 	We have dispatched 22 teams to Uasin Gishu District to ensure that company and co-operative farms are sub-divided with speed. 	Although there have been cases which have been very difficult to resolve, we have managed to resolve them.  There are farms like Sio Farm whose case took 25 years to resolve. 	We have now been able to resolve these cases within only a matter of 24 months. We are very active in areas like Narok and Kajiado and if we are able to get additional survey equipment from Japan, this will speed up our survey work and thus enable us to move with speed to ensure that we do not inconvenience anybody. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there were contributions by hon. Members that tended to invite the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Physical Planning to find ways and means of resolving the issue of the nine quarries in Nairobi which have been stopped from operating resulting in the loss of jobs of thousands of workers. I would like to say that this issue does not concern my Ministry, but the Ministry of Energy and I hope they will resolve this issue in due course.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, in conclusion, I would like to give comments regarding the 	_ assessment of the issues that have been raised during the debate on this Bill. First, the proposed Bill intends to re-introduce a tribunal that will have a lawyer as  the chairman with two  valuers as members. There have been requests that we Should include people who are not professionally qualified in those field, and I see a lot of sense in that. Therefore, with the permission of the House, I would like to introduce an amendment during the Committee Stage of the Bill, so that we  can have two more members included in the tribunal so that it has five members. Mt. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have already mentioned the question of machinery and we shall make sure that compulsory acquisition is not led to mean victimization.  There was a point raised regarding the type of notice given to a family being required to vacate the entire piece of land that Government intends to acquire. I agree that 60 days notice is not enough for a man to move out of his land and therefore, it is necessary to give adequate notice so that the man can go and put up am house for his family. Therefore, nine months in this  case, I think, would be quite a reasonable notice. 	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, a point was raised, namely that we have introduced too many tribunals.  There was an argument put forward that we already have the tribunal for house rent, a tribunal for business premises and now a tribunal for land being compulsorily acquired by Government. All these tribunals, in my views, are absolutely necessary because there is enough work for each one of them. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I feel that I have adequately covered the various issues that were raised by hon. Members, and therefore, I beg to move. </newspeech><i>(Question put and agreed to) </i><i>(The Bill was read a Second Time and committed to a Committee of the whole House tomorrow) </i><Header>BILL </Header> <l>Second Reading </i><Header>The Statute Law (Repeal and Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill </Header><newspeech>THE MINISTTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Mibei): Mr. Temporary deputy Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Attorney-General, I beg to move that the Statute Law	(Repeal andMiscellaneous Amendments) Bill, be now read a Second Time.This Bill seeks to introduce certain minor amendments to the 16 Actsof Parliament set out in the Schedule and also seeks to repeal the metric systemAct Cap.523 of the Laws of Kenya Which has now become obsolete following the enactment of Weights and Measures Act, 1987. 	I will now highlight some of the important points regarding the Acts to be amended. As you know, Sir, the Metric System Act was enacted in 1968 with the main object of introducing the metric system of weights and measures as the only system permitted to be used in trade transactions. At that time, the existing Weights and Measures Act, was based on the British Imperial System of pounds, ounzes, yards, feet, inches and so on. However, with the enactment in 1987 of the Weights and Measures Act No.18, the Metric System Act became obsolete, since the new Act is based wholly on the metric system. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Act we are amending is set out 	on page one of the Bill.  The other point raised in this Bill is the area that is of vital importance in any developing country like Kenya, and that is 	the registration of births and deaths. The provision of basic services such 	as education, health and so on are based on the proper projection of population 	growth. It is therefore important that the registration of births and deaths 	is done properly so that the economic planners are able to know the actual 	needs of the country in the provision of essential services.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, with the finalisation of the Civil Registration Project, it was decided that the registration of births and deaths be transferred from the office of the Attorney-General to the Office of the President. It is therefore necessary to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act Chapter 149 of the Laws of Kenya so as to reflect that policy change.  A new office of Principal Registrar of Births and Deaths has been created and Principal Registrar of Births and Deaths will take overfr om the Registrar-General who has been the registrar-general as well as Registrar of Births and Deaths.  Since these changes took effect from the beginning of the current Financial Year	1989/90	- the amendments have been back-dated to	1st July,	1989.  The amendmentto the Births and Deaths Registration Act is on page 60 of theBill we are discussing now.On page 59, another amendment which has been Proposed in the 	Bill and which I would like to draw the attention of the House to. It is proposed that the Criminal Procedure Code, Chapter 75of the Laws of Kenya be amended.  One area of concern to those involved in the administration of justice is the treatment which is meted out to those who are brought before the courts charged with minor criminal offences; Many People feel that such people should not be committed to prison.  In that light, we are	proposing that the system of suspended sentences should be introduced in our Laws so that a person who is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment C. for a term not exceeding two years should have his  sentence suspended.  The courts have various ways of dealing with a person whohas been convicted; where he could be sent prison, fined, getabsolute discharge, be placed on probation and so on.	So,  this aspect of suspended sentences, Which we are proposing to introduce, will be another option which will be open to the courts.  It will not be mandatory that_ anybody sentenced  to less than two year  imprisonment should have his sentence suspended. Butthe courts will have discretion to use this method among the other modes of sentences. If a person whose sentence has been suspended commits another offence within the two years his sentence has been suspended, it will mean that he will now be sentenced to serve the original two years imprisonment plus imprisonment in the new offence which he has committed. So, this calls for exemplary behaviour on the part of the accused person or convicted person whose sentence has been suspended. One of the reasons why this mode of sentencing has been proposed, is to ease any likelihood of overcrowding in our prisons. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, another area which we intend to look into is mentioned on page 61 of the Bill. This isin connexion with the Pensions Act Chapter 189 if the Laws ofKenya.  You will recall that a few days ago this august House passed the Pensions Increase Bill of 1990 and this was a great boostto our retired gentlemen who have rendered good service to thisRepublic.  We now propose to do more in this area.  Following areview of the Pensions Act Chapater 189 of the Laws of Kenya, it wasrecognised that the existing provisions of the Act which limit thepensions payable to a retired officer to two-thirds of thehighest pensionable emolument drawn by him in the course of his service to the Government, was grossly unfair to the officer. It has	 therefore been decided that a Person retires from the Public Service should be paid a full pension which does not exceed the annual pension emoluments he was drawing immediately prior to his retirement.  I trust that that will be good news for officers in the Civil Service when this Bill is passed. I hope that retired officers who are drawing pensions are participating in nation building wherever they are in this Republic.  Mr: Temporary Deputy Speaker,: Sir, during the lastSession, hon. Members approved the Statute Law (Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill of 1989, which contained provisions for the introduction of an annual Professional licence in respect of professionals, engaged in private practise.  All professionals were required to obtain annual licences and pay an annual fee of KShs:5,000/- each to the Treasury.  However, some professionals were omitted and I now intend to streamline the law so that all professionals are treated equally. 	The professionals now being included in this Bill are the lawyers, doctors, dentists, pharmacists, surveyors and veterinary surgeons .Once the Bill becomes law, professionals in private practise will be required to obtain the annual professional licence on the payment of a fee of KShs	5,000/-. I have emphasised the fact that this affects	only professionals who are in private practice: On page 66 of the Bill, the architects and quantity Surveyors. This provision will not apply to architects and quantity surveyors who are registered persons and who are employed by the Government, public body or any State corporationas defined by the State Corporations Act Chapter 446 of the Laws of Kenya. Also,  at Page 79, these provisions will not apply to advocates who are employed by the Government or any other public body or by any State Corporation, as defined by the State Corporations Act (Cap.446) of the Laws of Kenya. Now, the rest of the Bill sets out minor amendments which are self-explanatory and are aimed at removing obsolete provisions from the Law, or making the relevant Provisions more clearer. So, in that case, I need not go into details one by one because they are self-explanatory. With those few remarks, Sir, I beg to move. </newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MAREETTNG (Mr. ole Kaparo): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I wish to second this Bill which has been very ably moved by hon. Mibei, on behalf of the Attorney-General. I do not wish to repeat what my learned colleague, Mr. Mibei, has just said, but I just wish to outline certain areas that Bill  affects.	I hope hon. Mibei will forgive me, if I make a little correction here.	I think there are	17 Acts involved, takinginto account the intended amendment that the Attorney-General has given notice of, which will include the Police Act (Cap. 84) which intends to amend Section 49 of that Act. But in general terms, there are those amendments dealing with introduction of licences to the various professional bodies and, as hon. Mibei, has stated,this was an oversight because at the end of last Session, a similar Bill was introduced to cater for various professional bodies,and a few professional bodies were excluded.	So, to make them equal,it was necessary to bring such a Bill.Such professions as advocates doctors, valuers, surveyors and so on, I think, it is only right if they have to participate in the prosperity of these professions because the State itself also invested in the education of such     professionals. All those professionals, at one stage or another, have enjoyed the benefit of the State in education, Protection andeverything else. So, I think, it is just right that they too, likeother Kenyans, contribute a part for the good management ofthis country which, I am sure, they are also proud members of. There are also those Acts which seek to remove, as hon. Mibei said,  "obsolete" provisions that are just "sitting" there in the law books doing absolutely nothing.	An example, is a reference made in the Evidence Act which is found on page	60 in  Section	3Reference to the Secretary-General of the Community and the Community is the East African Community which "died" many, many years ago. Consequently, they have no existence, there is no Person in existence by the name of "Secretary-General of the Community. Yet there is that Provision "sitting" in the law books doing absolutely nothing.. I think the Attorney-General should remove those provisions that have no purpose at all and make our law books a little "thinner" than they are now: There is also another class of amendments. Some of the Acts tend to "re-designate" titles, as hon. Attorney-General explained, in relation to the Question of registration of births and deaths. Because of the new office coming into existence in place of the previous office, it is only reasonable that the creation of the office should be "legalised", and where it tended to collide with the previous description, then the amendment should iron that out. This is being done in relation to Section 3 of the Registration of Births and Deaths Act. There are also some Acts , Sir, introduce certain substantial  amendments,	it is here that would like to take little more tine and invite the attention of hon. Members.	Among thesubstantial amendments, you will find two substantial amendments  in the Criminal Procedure Code . Firstly and I think most important, is the “suspended sentence “, the concept itself. I think meeting this concept in our Penal system. The principle of sentencing in Kenya is coming into it for the very first time now.We had various modes of sentence. For instance, you could be sentenced to death, prison, corporal punishment, fined,  jailed, put on probation and so on. But we did not have a suspended sentence. This is a new concept and, I think, it is absolutely I say so because in it are certain inherent advantages. 	First and foremost, this kind of sentence will keep from our prisons petty criminals who have, no business at all in being in prison,  if they can and should reform. For instance, on occasion, you will find that a person has probably stolen, say, KSh.10/-. Theft is theft and the law says "if you have stolen, you must be Punished".	If you must be punished, you are told to go to prisonfor three weeks, or two weeks, or two days and so on. But to  prison, you must go, and when you go there, you increase the population of those prisoners unnecessarily. So, the first advantage, in my view, is that it keeps out of prison petty offenders who can otherwise reform. The second advantage this provision will have, in my view, is that it will also, at the same time, act as a deterrent to other would be offenders. If you are told that you will be sentenced to one and a half years in prison but you will be given a suspended  sentence of 	18 months, what it means is that if during the course of those 	18 months you commit an offence, first of all, once you are convicted of that new other offence, you will commence your prison term for l8 months, and then you will also be sentenced for that other offence but the sentences will run consecutively, one after the other. So, you will be having this petty criminal who will  be having this suspended  sentence hanging over his head for atleast	18 months.	This person must behave himself. I think thiswill  act as a good deterrent and it also gives people a chance to reform.I think this is a good concept. That would be a good chance for people to reform. This is a good concepttoo. If you have by some bad misfortune fallen foul of the law and havebeen convicted you get through the suspended sentence a chance to reformand be a good citizen without ever having to step in prison.	As it is with	most other principles of sentences, this is not a mandatory requirementto the court.	It only gives the court a discretion to either give you asuspended sentence or put you into prison immediately.	What is the differencebetween suspended sentence and probation?	Even today courts will put anoffender on probation if they think that he should not go to prison immediately In Kiswahili they say;"Utafungwa kifungo cha nje". The difference between a suspended sentence and probation is that probation requires a person to directly keep on reporting to the probation officer in regular terms.	Asthe criminals increase in prisons because of petty crimes, so does the	workof the probation officer who gets overburdened.	This results in too manypeople reporting to him.	So,  I think this new concept will also lessen theworkload of the probation officers, but this does not, of course, mean that they will not be required.	They will be.	So, this	new concept requiresa person to discipline himself.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other issue that I wouldlike to address myself to is on the Criminal Procedure Code.	There is anintended amendment to section 123 of the Criminal procedure Code.	This sectiondeals with bail in the High Court.	According to the old procedure, whichis to be amended, it reads as follows:-"The High Court may in any case whether or not an accused person has been commited for trial direct that the person be admitted to bail or that bail required by subordinate court or police officer be redeuced." In addition to the High Court allowing bail or varying bail given or refused by a subordinate court, it made provision that at the same time the High Court could as well refuse that bail. That is now being streamlined in this amendment.    This is because as you will see in the amendment itself, the words that.be inserted will include the fact that the High-court may direct that theperson be or not be admitted to bail. That makes it regular. I think thatis the correct thing to do so that the law is clear because the clearer itis the better it will be for everybody and the less clear it is the worse itis for everybody;  for those who practise it from the Bench and those who doso from the bar and for those to whom it is supposed to be administered.	So,I think it is a good thing that the Attorney-General is making it absolutelyclear for the avoidance of doubt.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other amendment to theCriminal Procedure Code relates to the power of review of the sentences handedby the High Court in exercise of its original jurisdiction.	This is foundin the amendments to section 379 of the Criminal Procedure Code which now readsas follows:-""Sub-section 5	(a)	-Where the Attorney-General certifies that the 	person a sentence passed by the High Courtin exercise of its original jurisdictionshould be reviewed by the Court of Appeal the Court of Appeal may after giving the accused person or his advocate anopportunity of being heard make such order by the way of enhancement of sentence ormaintaining the sentence first as is consistance with the end of justice."This previously meant that there was no provision for the Attorney-Generalif aggrieved in certain limited sentencing by the High Court to make a reviewto ask the Court of Appeal to review the sentence passed.	At the same timethere was a provision that the. Attorney-General	may	petition the Court	ofAppeal to review an acquital only to establish the law and not to reverse thefact.  What happened if an Attorney-General was unhappy about a certain sentencepassed by the High Court in exercise of its original jurisdiction?	Then hishands were absolutely tied down; he could not appeal.	The beauty of the legalsystem that we have is that any party who is aggrieved by the decision of a  court should be able to move to the next court and appeal and argue his case. That includes an accused person in a criminal case. 	So to be fair, the Attorney- General should also have similar rights to go and appeal. So, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, those are some of the substantial amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code which I believe are meant for the benefit of our society. 	There is also another good amendment that affects those officers who have served this country very well but could  not draw benefits beyond two-thirds of pensionable emoluments. Now these officers can draw the complete full amount of their pensionable emoluments. Section	9	that deals with registration of deaths and births	is supposed to be removed altogether.	I think this is a welcome gesture fromthe Attorney-General because this section is by itself discriminatory.	Thisis because it required a certain class of Kenyans to have compulsory registration. I am of course talking about the previous section which is going to be deleted. That section states as follows:- "The registration of the birth of a child shall be compulsory if either of one or both parents are of European or American or Asian origin or descent or in the case of an illegimate child not recognised by the father if the" mother is of European or American or Asian origin or descent."  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  The Attorney-General is asking the House to repeal Section 9 of the law which seeks to treat a certain class of either citizens or residents,  in a way that would be considered discriminatory. Sir, when that section is scrapped	off the Attorney-General or the Principal Registrar of Births and Deaths may require or to order, that a certain group of  persons,  or a certain locality	to have compulsory registration,irrespective of their race. I think we have reached a stage whereour enlightenment is not dependent on once race,  tribe or locality, but it is dependent on the individual. That is a move in the right direction,  and I commend the Attorney-General for bringing that amendment. In conclusion, Sir, I remember that last week, the hon.  Members were requesting the Attorney-General to keep on reviewing the laws so that those sections that are out dated can be scrapped off and where we have not made proper provisions, we can do so.I think the hon.  Attorney-General is responding properly to the sentiments of the hon. Members,  and I would like them to support this Bill and give the Attorney-General the mandate to effect the changes that he has proposed. With those few remarks,  Sir,  I beg to support. </newspeech><i>(Question proposed) </i><newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR CO-OPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT (Mr.  Cheruiyot): First of all I would like to commend the Acting Attorney-General for moving that Bill very ably. He has enlightened the House on the 16 Acts which ka would have warranted the hon. Members to introduce several bills to this House.  The Bill was again seconded very well by hon. ole Kaparo. Sir, that Act is very technical to our learned friends. I would like to say that we are in a changing society,  and therefore, we should keep on revising	our laws all the time,  so that they canreflect the society we want and the Kenya we want.	Therefore,we have to refer to our books quite often,  so that we can single out the obsolete laws and the out-dated ones,  so that we can  either remove them or up-date them to reflect our modern society. Sir,  our society today is very sophisticated. We have got four universities,  and the turnover of those universities are people who are very learned; people who are aware of their rights and  privileges. 	 When those people want to write something official, they know that they should consult their lawyers or other private practitioners. in different fields. I would like to commend the Attorney-General for being so sensitive to our changing society,  and to some of the outdated laws, which are useless and also denying this nation a chance to prosper. A few years ago this House changed some of the laws that we had in our Constitution.	Some of those laws were denying His Excellencythe President,  who is the Head of State, to do certain thingsbefore he had consulted the Commonwealth organisation.	If we arenot aware of what is happening,  we can continue using outdated laws which are not in keeping with the society that we have at the moment. We have a very complicated society. Sir,  most people are aware of the new Act of registration of births and deaths. We shallmake a minor amendment,  where we shall create the post of principal registrar of births and deaths. Previously,  people were not aware of the importance of birth certificates, but today nearly everybody is aware that birth certificates are required in most primary schools.	If a child does not have a birth certificate,he cannot be admitted into most city primary schools. The same things applies to many other things. Even when acquiring a passport you have to be in possession of a birth certificate. Therefore, almost everybody is aware of the importance of birth and death certificates, in our everyday life. Therefore, it is important to repeal and amend that act so that it can suit our modern society. Sir, I would also like touch on the pensions Act.	The Bill says that instead of the two thirds  pension emoluments that used to be Paid, the full pension  shall be paid to pensioners. We are a maturing nation, and for we have started seeing very many people retiring at a go. Some years ago, we used to see ten or fifteen retiring at a go, but since our nation is  maturing very many people are retiring each year.	The retired civil servants are very	qualified people, and they have a wealth of experience, because they have been in the service for very many years-. 	Unfortunately Sir, when those people retire, they feel as if they are not wanted by the society, and they would like to run away from responsibilities as first as possible. I would like to support what the Acting Attorney-General said, that those retired civil servants should continue. participating in nation building.	They are knowledgeable andqualified people.	In some other countries people retire at theage of65, but if people here retire at the age of 55, then theyretire when they are just beginning to mature.In fact peoplesay that the age of 55 is the beginning of wisdom.But unfortunately, our retired civil servants run away and keep away completely from active service even in their own villages.  Sir, the Bill also touches on the surveys Act. This Bill has come on time, when in fact the Minister for Lands and Housing has just replied to the Land Acquisition Bill. This is an area which touches on all professionals,  such as surveyors, architects, pharmacists,  and so on. I would like to appeal to those professionals to be people of high professional standards. The people who have acquired professional licences should be of high moral integrity , people with good discipline and people whom we can rely on,  so that when we indigenise everything, we are sure that they 	will offer service which is relevant and necessary to this  nation. Sir, the Bill touches on the Architects and Quantity Surveyors Act.	Although we have started indigenizing thoseareas,  we have experienced problems in them.	Sir,  after amendingthe law,  those professionals should try as much as possible to give us good services.	Sir, a few years ago,  we totally disbanded the National  Construction Corporation.	That Corporation did not serve the interest for which it was meant.	In any area wherethere was construction work, the Ministry of Public Works used to give the Corporation 10 percent mobilisation funds. 	Instead of our people utilising that money for the contract, they used to use it for their own things. Therefore,  you find that our people are not responsible enough, and that trend has tended to keep many foreigners in our country,  running our professions. I am happy to say that in the  fields of architecture and medicine,  we have our own people. I would like to appeal to the employers to employ the indigenous Kenyans. Quite often,  you see the foreign quantity surveyors busy discharging their duties,  when the other qualified indigenous quantity surveyor have no jobs. We think distribution of consultants should be very fair. so that we engage our professionals fairly and actively. 	This will show that we have got qualified people whom we will depend on. 	There is another Act which is, touching on the Kenya 	Broadcasting Corporation.	This is a new Act	- No.	15 of	1988	-and I would like to commend the Voice of Kenya for unifying thenation through their broadcasts. They  are doing a good job andnow even the ordinary people in the field are able to know what the country wants:  This Corporation should find a way of giving small radios to the public so that people in Maasailand and North-Eastern Province can be able to receive the Voice of Kenya loud and clear.  All these is happening in a democratic society .Somepeople are so sensitive on what is out-dated and obsolete. We arehappy that our Attorney-General is sensitive on what is out-dated. This is happening because we have the rule of law in this country which the President has guaranteed and we are very grateful to him. Unfortunately, some people have abused the democratic system that we have. 	We were surprised yesterday how a bishop could go out of his way - instead of praying for the floods in his own area of Nyanza, this nation and offering Easter prayers to call the Press and comment on political ideas. This is a very dangerous precedent that we are taking in this country. If we continue like this, we shall land into a situation where everybody will say what he wants thereby abusing the rule of law and our democratic system. If we keep on revising the law, people will take advantage of what is being changed and do whatever they want. I commend the Acting Attorney-General for the work he has done and with these few remarks, I beg to support.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. LEWA: Thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to express my views on this Bill.  On the outset, I would like to  congratulate the Attorney-General for bringing this Bill particularly because it touches on the registration of professionals, such as, pharmacists, doctors and so on .I would like to bring to the attention of the Attorney-General that while Chapter 244 of the Pharmacists and Poisons Act has yet to be amended to include the registration of pharmacy technicians, these technicians have been licenced to practice pharmacy in private practice:  I would like the Attorney-General to take note of this and remove that anomaly lamina because I think it is not fair to licence pharmacy technicians. I know that they are worth  their salt as they are doing a good job especially those who have worked in hospitals for many years at a time when there were not enough registered Pharmacists Until such a time that the law is amended to give them an opportunity to be registered as such, I think it is unfair to licence them to practice. When I look at the element of the annual licence that would be issued to these professionals, I note with concern the fact that where it touches on pharmacists and doctors, it states that licence  will bear the date it was issued. That is just about all:  There is a danger here if this licence does not also indicate the place where such a professional is going to practice:  There is a danger of issuing somebody a licence which will in the end be misused.	I am saying this because this is a personalised professional service.	It is important that such a licence states where the licence is going to practice. It has been indicated here that a veterinary surgeon will be restricted to a specific area of operation:  It is importantthat doctoral and Pharmacists' licences specify where the practice will take place.	As time goes on, we want to see 	our own indigenous  professionals taking more interest in private practice.It so happens that even though the Bill indicates that people working in Government do not necessarily have to pay the annual fee for practice, I feel we have a duty to encourage young professionals to opt out and practice when they get the opportunity. I am particularly appealing to lecturers in various professional fields. The scientific world changes rapidly and there is a danger of somebody sticking in the lecture room for 10 to 15 years and all over sudden thinking that he can go out pay the required KShs.5,000 for the licence and practice effectively.  By 'effective' I mean rendering the goods to the consumers. We should encourage professionals to ensure that whenever they get an opportunity, they should align themselves to various practices so that they can update 	themselves with the modern scientific methods and procedures. As the population grows, I feel that, perhaps, we are 	not keeping pace with the training of some of the professionals. I will keep on talking about the training of pharmacists because I happen to be one of them.  I would like to say that we do not have enough pharmacists in the country:  Now that the Government is	embarking on the introduction of a School of Medicine at Moi University, Eldoret, I feel it would be an opportune moment to  also start the training of pharmacists in this university.  Mr . _ Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir ,_ turning_ a_ little_ bit to how_	_parastatal bodies treat our indigenous professionals, I feel that at this time and day, we are not being given a fair deal. You have so many corporations, such as Kenya Airways, Kenya Ports Authority, and so on, which, for whatever reason, tend to want to give professional services, such as the appointment of doctors and pharmacists, to non indigenous professionals. This is a shame, and I feel that we need to be encouraged. we can only hope that it is these parastatal bodies that can appoint us to practise for the benefit of our fellow Kenyans.	In most cases, there is no Shah or Patel in the boards of directors of these corporations.	So, one wonders what criterion is used to a Shah adoctor or pharmacist when an indigenous doctor or pharmacist is ready and willing to serve on such panels. I once again commend the Attorney-General for bringing this Bill here, and I beg to support it. Thank you. </newspeech><newspeech>DR. WAMEYO: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.For a change, I am not going to mention that there is no quorum this time; instead I would like to contribute to this Bill. <i>(Applause) </i>First of all, I would like to pay tribute to the Office of the Attorney-General and the Government for bringing certain amendments under this Bill.	I will confine myself to the amendments dealing with the MedicalPractitioners and Dentists Act.	When it was directed that doctors in privatepractice should also get licences from the offices of district commissioners, this raised a lot of resentment because it meant that although these doctors were just in business like any other business people, the doctors would find it very embarrassing because whereas other business people are authorised to advertise, doctors are not supposed to do so according to their ethics. Therefore, I am very grateful to the Government for introducing this amendment which allows doctors in private practice to apply for licences and pay Shs.500/= per year to the Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board. This Board will have the duty of  	paying the amount of money_so_collected.to the Treasury. This amendment isacceptable to the members of the medical profession. I am also very pleasedthat the Government has allowed some doctors to go into the private sector and others to practise in the Government.  However, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are having a few problems in our medical institutions and, with the introduction of cost-sharing, a few more problems have come up, and these relate to some practice by employees of the Ministry of Health in the field without the authority of the Government. There are certain standard fees that patients reporting to Government institutions are supposed to pay as a result of cost-sharing, and I would like to appeal to the Minister and his Ministry to make sure that patients are not ' involved in unnecessary suffering for lack of unnecessary fees being asked for. One example is when people are involved either in an accident or in a fight. These people go to the police and pick up "P3" forms, which are supposed to becompleted by our medical staff in the field, either in health centres, in Government hospitals or in the Casualty Department for a standard fee which the Government has introduced as a result of cost sharing. Unfortunately; there are some problems here. In Mumias, where I come from, there is a health centre, called Makunga Demonstration Health Centre. 	If a patient goes there with a "P3" form, he is asked to the pay the clinical officer there Shs.200/=. This practice is raising eyebrows and, since I know that it is illegal, a certain patient came to me because she could not afford to raise the Shs.200/= and asked me to pay the money for her.	I said, "All right.	If you want me to pay this money to the clinical officer, let me take you to the people who pay such money."	I took the patient to the police in Kakamega, who gave her Shs.200/= to go and pay the clinical officer. 	Anyhow,  this clinical officer was transferred and replaced by another person who behaves the same. This sort of thing is embarrassing and delaying police work.	Eventually, the patients who went to Makunga Health Centre had to to go Bungoma District Hospital to get their forms completed in the manner  required for submission to the police. I  would like the Ministry to look intothis matter and make sure that such things do not go on because they embarrass the Government and make people lose faith in their representatives, whom they expect to bring up such matters and make sure that they are sorted out. We are also having problems in hospitals.	Drugs, regardless ofwhat anybody else may say, are not available in a lot of our hospitals.	Someequipment there requires repair, but it is not being done. Sometimes, you evenfind that the company that deals in oxygen does not want to supply oxygen which used in operating on patients simply because the Ministry has not settled past bills. Eventually, patients do not undergo operation because such things are not available, and this creates a bad impression to the public, who lose interest in their representatives. 	They think that their representatives are not doing anything to alleviate their problems. 	Because of this licensing of medical practitioners, I am afraid  andI must say it here that some of our colleagues will insist that patients paythem money before they are operated on.	So, there will be delays in operatingon certain patients because they will be unable to meet the resulting bill.	Oneday, somebody here may ask me to substantiate this claim.	Some two or threeyears ago, a surgeon asked a patient to give him money, but the patient had no money.	So, the patient decided to go to Central Police Station in Mombasa, andthe police obliged.	They gave her the money, and the doctor was later picked up.this brought embarrassment to the profession and the Ministry.	Efforts were madeto prosecute the doctor, but other people made efforts to make sure that the doctor was not prosecuted.	The doctor too leave and came back to the police intheir base.	They picked up the doctor but members of his tribe although therewas no tribalism involved, fought very hard in the judiciary to make sure thatthe doctor was not prosecuted, and the Ministry also took no action against thedoctor.	As a result, the system has continued to exist to the embarrassment ofthe Ministry.	Doctors have been allowed to carry on private practice in alimited way, but the issue of insisting that patients who go to Government  hospitals should also pay the doctors there is both unethical and embarrassingand also lets down our Party. I am requesting that since its now obvious that doctors are paying KShs.5,000/- to the Treasury through the Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board and they carry out limited private practice, they should cease to embarrass patients.  The fact that one is a patient does not necessarily mean that he has the money. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, with regard to the availability of drugs, there are a lot of papers going round as of now indicating that although the Ministry of Education has tendered for certain drugs, the people being awarded the tenders are those who have quoted the highest.  As a result, in certain areas calculations are being made and they indicate that the Ministry is going to lose KShs.7 million. I do not know the truth about those statements, but they are there and they have been written to certain officials in the Ministry of Health.  However, what I am bringing forward is that it is embarrassing to the Government, the public and the members of the ruling party. </newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Chesire):  On a  point of order, Mr: Temporary deputy Speaker.  The hon. Member speaking is alleging that the highest tenderers are being awarded contracts by the Ministry of Health. This is a very serious allegation which the hon. Member must substantiate. </newspeech><newspeech>DR. WAMEYO:  Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.  I have said that there are certain papers circulating, and the best thing one would have asked me to do is to lay them on the Table. </newspeech><newspeech>MR. KUBO:  It is not a substance. </newspeech><newspeech>DR. WAMEYO:  I have said that there are certain papers going round, and  I will lay them on the Table because they are embarrassing us, who are party leaders.  We are party leaders, we come from areas. </newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogui):  On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.  I stand on a point of order regarding-the several statements that have been made by hon. (Dr.-) Wameyo.  He is trying to associate corruption with the Ministry of Health in the Kenya Government.  In other words, hon. 	(Dr.) Wameyo does not understand the difference of a corrupt person, whether  he is a doctor like him or a priave person. My Ministry and the Kenya Government does not, and cannot, associate itself with a corrupt person whether he is a nurse, a doctor, or a private practitioner. 	In this connection, it is not correct that there are papers circulating in the Republic of Kenya indicating that people who bid highest are sure to get tenders in the Ministry of Health and that those who bid reasonably and are in a position to deliver drugs do not get tenders. That is not true. </newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): What is your point of order then? </newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur):	Mr. Temporary DeputySpeaker, Sir, my point of order is that hon. (Dr.) Wameyo should not only substantiatehis claims verbally but should also lay the papers he is referring to on the Table. </newspeech><newspeech>DR. WAMEYO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is the right procedurein this Parliament and not the original contribution from my hon. friend.	I will laythe papers on the Table next Wednesday. In fact, one of the papers is addressedto the hon. Minister. </newspeech>	<newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Order. Dr. Wameyo has made An allegation which has been challenged by two hon. Assistant Ministers, and he is asking for the indulgence of the House that he be allowed to lay the papers in 	question on the Table bf the House on Wednesday, next week.I give  him that opportunity. </newspeech><newspeech>  DR. WAMEYO: 	Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. am very grateful for that wise ruling. If I may be permitted to continue, I want to say that the allegations in some of those papers and I am not saying they  are true  which are addressed to certain individuals In the Ministry of Health drawing their attention to those variations in awarding contracts, are embarrassing. If we have sat here and votedmoney to the Ministry for both development and recurrent expenditure, why shouldthere be no drugs in hospitals.	It is an important issue to which the Ministry of Health should address itself very Clearly because it is undermining the confidence of the people in the Government and in the party. <i>/The Temporary Deputy speaker(Mr. Wabuge) left the Chair/ </i><i>/The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Tuva)  took the chair/ </i>If there are no drugs in the area each individual Member of Parliament comes from, then people ask "What are you doing?" 	If the people manning health centres and hospitals demand extra payment on top of the statutory payment, that is undermining the status of Members of Parliament from the area that that is happening. Therefore, it is important that the Ministry, after I have laid the papers on the Table  and they are quite a number addresses itself to that problem and ensure that at least we have some anti-diarrhoea mixture in a particular hospital  we have asprin, penicillin and other drugs in hospitals. The denial that there is no cholera in Nairobi does not amount to something that can convince the people that we are speaking the truth. 	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is very important that as we amend the law to get things straight as they should be, health services must continue to be provided in a manner that is acceptable to the people. 	Then, and only then, that our people will have confidence in us as their representatives.	It is someof their representatives who are chosen to man the Ministry of Health.	I must oncemore say that I am very grateful for this amendment.	At the same time, I wouldlike to appeal  to the officers in the Ministry of Health to ensure that services 	to wananchi in terms of drugs, co-operation and maternity anti-natal care services Continue to a standard that is acceptable to our people so that people do not laugh at Parliament and utter statements which are unacceptable, which indicate and imply that we just sit here and do not do anything arid, for that matter, we should be sacked. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is important that we address ourselves to these matters because complaints about health services are very strong. 	Thank you very much, Sir, for granting me this opportunity to air my views on medical services. With those few remarks, I do support the Bill. </newspeech> <newspeech>MR.KUB0: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir , for	allowing me to air my views on this Bill. Looking at the amendments, it appears that the main idea behind them is to allow the Treasury to collect more funds from professionals in this country. To me, it looks as it there was an oversight on the part of the Treasury when they were presenting the Budget for 1989/90.   Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, some hon.Members said that there shall be a sum of Shs.5,000/- to be  professionals-in this-country, a sum that they have not been paying before.While we appreciate that the Treasury has a duty to get enough money to run Government services, we must also look at the dangers of commercialising certain professions in this country. I am saying this because in the long ran what is likely to happen to accountants, architects, quantity surveyors, advocates and doctors? If these professionals are going to be more concerned about raising money from the people they are rendering services so that they can in turn be able to pay what they are required to pay to the Government, this would be creating professionals who are money orientated. We know that the first and foremost duty of any professional is to render services to the people and stick to his or her professional etiquette in so doing. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this gives the impression that the Treasury has been unable to collect enough funds from the existing machinery. Therefore, I am appealing to the Government to make sure that the tax system in this country is improved so that wananchi are able to live within their means. I am saying this because asking these professionals to be paying Shs.5,000/-  gives the impression that the Treasury just looked around and said, "Okay, we can easily collect this money from the professionals and if they do not pay, we Shall stop them from practising". 	At the same time, I would like to appeal to the Treasury to make sure that these taxation measures will be started next year because it would be taking the professionals by surprise to just say, "From now onwards, you are required to pay so much". If this law is going to be used by the Government as the most convenient way of colleting Government revenue, then it Should start operating next year. Government must also came out to wipe out the impression that it is not encouraging the professionals to be money minded. So, I hope, that the Minister concerned is paying enough attention to what I am saying and that he is going to consider my advice seriously. 	With those few remarks, I beg to support. 	</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. WABUGE: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to also contribute to this Bill. 	I would like to say right from the very beginning that this is the traditional way of updating the obsolete pieces of legislations in the laws of Kenya and as such, I have no quarrel with this Bill. The only observation that I would like to make here is with regard to the amendment to the Criminal Procedure on page 56 where they say:— "Any court which passes sentence of imprisonment by a term of not more than 2 years for any offence order that the sentence shall not take effect unless during the period specified". This point has been explained by the Mover of the Bill, but there is one thing. that I am worried about here.  Although the intention of this amendment is good, the sentence might be suspended and_ the individlIal involved assures the authorities that he would continue to show good behaviour during that period of two years, something could go wrong somewhere. In our society, there are people who commit offences and then say it is some other persons who have committed these offences. In such a case, somebody could m commit an offence and then point an accusing finger at a person whose sentence has been suspended by the court, and it may well be that the person is convicted and another sentenced imposed on him so that he serves the two sentences consecutively. 	Therefore, what I am saying that in applying this law, we must taken into consideration the fact that we are living in a very complicated society. We have heard of cases where people have quarrelled in drinking parties and police arrive and arrest some people. A person whose sentence has been suspended may be found in such a place and arrested and his position now becomes worse. So, what I am saying is that before a second sentence is imposed on such a person, due consideration should be made regarding the circumstances in which the person has been arrested. I am saying this because I feel many people will really get into trouble through no fault of their own. So, when this Bill is passed and becomes law, hope that our magistrates will take this point into consideration so that a person whose sentence has been suspended is not unduly harassed.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, on page 60 of the Bill,we have subsection 123 	(3) where they want to direct that a person be or not be granted bail. Here again, we are trying to update our laws so that the court will have the alternative of either directing or not directing that a person be given a bail. At the present moment, there is no such option and therefore, this is a good intention on part of this Bill which will enable the court to exercise its discretion in a good way. On the same page, we have Subsection 131 and here, I am greatly disturbedin that it is now ten years since the break up of the East African Community. 	 I am surprised that our laws still have this anomaly of incorporating the East African Community. It is unfortunate that the East African Community broke up. This was against our wish because we wanted it to continue in order to bring the people of East Africa together as they used to be. We felt that if the Community continued, we could eventually get rid of the artificial boundaries separating the three partner states. These boundaries had been put by our Imperial rulers against our wishes. However, since the break up of the Community 5 it is now ten years and the Attorney-General should have seen it fit to up-date our laws that have any reference to the East African Community. It appears that there is laxity in the Attorney-General's Chambers and I do not know whether there are still some laws that needs to be repealed. If there are such laws, I do not know why they have not been incorporated in this particular Bill. Therefore, I am requesting the Attorney-General to go back to his Chambers and go through all these laws with a view to bringing amendments to this House to repeal them and do away with them once and for all.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other pointis about	the registration of births and deaths:  When this Act wasintroduced, our people were resentful; they did not want to register the births of their children.  They also did not want to register their dead.	That particular law was a very new thing to our people but you will find that now our people have accepted to have the births of their children registered.  They have alsoaccepted to register the deaths of their relatives and so on.	That being so, I would request the Government 	to decentralise the registration of births and	deaths to the districts. 	I know thatthey are trying to do that. Some districts have been given thatresponsibility. But there are some districts, particularly Trans Nzoia where I come from, where people are still compelled to travel all the way from Kitale to Nairobi for birth registration or death registration.  This is because people have now realised the importance of registering	deaths.  The want to possess the deathcertificates in case there is any claim or anything that they want to certify. If you want to show that the person in question is dead you have to produce a death certificate as a proof that the person is dead. Therefore, people have realised that there is a need to register	births and deaths.  That is why they are incurring a lot of travels expenses to come to Nairobi	to register births and deaths.  They are wasting both money and time.The registration of births and deaths must be decentralised to	the districts to enable people to get births and deaths registeredthere instead of wasting time and money coming to Nairobi.  They should be made to stay there so that they can concentrate on faring activities so as to produce enough food for this country.  Therefore, I would request the Government to decentralise these activities so that the services are within the reach of the rural people.  Mr. Temporary  Deputy Speaker, Sir, here I can see that the word "Registrar-General" is being deleted.  The reason given here is that the "Registrar-General" is being deleted and substituted with "Principal Registrar"	because the function has been transferred to the Office of the President. If this function has been transferred to the Office of the President, I take this to mean that the function is also being transferred to the provincial administration.  Therefore, there is need for decentralisation to the districts and if need be, to the divisions.  This is because there are some divisions which are so vast that even if you decentralise these activities to the district, the long distance to the district headquarters will still be a bother to the people in  those particular divisions. So, the decentralisation of these activities is the answer to our people's Problems; This is because by decentralisation, we will also be creating employment opportunities for our people.  You will need  to employpeople to man these offices at the divisional or district levels. So, these activities should be decentralised so that they are in line with the District Focus for Rural Development Strategy. We should not waste time saying "We are looking for manpower; we have no funds”. I am saying so because Trans-Nzoia is far away from Nairobi and it is not an easy task for people to travel all the way from there to Nairobi for birth or death registration. The other point that I would like to mention here is in connexion with.  As the Mover of the Bill said, all these clauses affect all the professionals in this country. That is good butI still maintain that registration should not be done just forthe sake of registration or for the sake of earning revenue for the Government.-  The purpose of registration should come first and the revenue aspect of it should be a secondary issue. The purpose of registration should be that before someone renews a licence   consideration should be given, as to whether he has conducted himselfin a decent manner  during the preceding years or not. He shouldbe examined to establish whether he has maintained professional ethics and 	discipline or not.	If he has not adhered to the laid-down regulations then I think there will be needfor us to retain this clause.  So, before a person renewshis licence these things must be taken into consideration. If hehas misbehaved he should be rejected; he should not be given a licence.	If he has misappropriated public funds through his professional dealings, his licence should not be renewed. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I feel that the purpose of this clause is mainly to ensure that professional ethics and discipline are maintained. The purpose is not to earn revenue for the Government.-  If the whole idea here is to earn, revenue for Government, then I think this is the wrong way of doing it. I say this because there are many types of professionals.  There are professional thieves and professional mafioso.  I am talking	aboutthe interpretation of the term "professional". It means thatit is very difficult for a layman to handle a professional's job.That is why I am saying that the purpose of this clause should not be to earn, revenue for the Government. The aim should be to maintain professional ethics and discipline.  Therefore when the Minister stand to reply, he will have to tell  us the purpose of this clause. If the idea is to earn, revenue for Government then I say "No" to the clause. But I understand that the element of revenue may come inbecause this also entails paper work. So, nominal finances should be given to that organization or professional body to continue with its	work.	But the idea should be to earn, revenue  for the Government; the revenue should be	symbolic.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to come to another clause. This is where they say "advertisement for drugs". "Subject to this clause, no person shall advertise any drug or poison except with the written permission of the Board". And it goes on to part three to say:-"The application for the advertisement of any drug or poison shall be made to the Board in the prescribed form and shall be accompanied by prescribed fee". Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am very perturbed  in that this is a-</newspeech><newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Mibei): On a Point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Can the n'or': Member: be heard in absolute silence? There is a lot of consultation going on in the House now. </newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva): Hon. Members, thereis a bit too much noise in the House at the moment. </newspeech><newspeech>MR. WABUGE: Thank you very much, Mr Temporary Deputy Speaker. I was saying that I am a little perturbed in that when we begin to license people to advertise for drugs, if we are not careful, this very, very far-reaching.	I say so because presently you hear on the radio medicine for malaria – malariaquin – being advertised. They say all you need to do is to take “4-2-2-2”, and they go further to say that if symptoms persist, you should see a doctor. Now, we have a society which is not learned. So, when this advertisement is put through the radio, meaning that the Government has already licensed somebody to sell this new drug anybody from the rural area who falls sick starts to take that drug for malaria when, face, he may not be suffering from malaria as such. A patient takes the drugs for a certain period and when he gets very sick-even at the point of death he is then taken to the hospital. But one gets there when it is too late, and he cannot be helped. He passes away. People in the rural areas know that anybody with an headache, diarrhoea or an illness of that nature, is suffering from malaria. Now, I am saying that instead of advertising medicine like this, let the advertisement go long way to say let the blood be tested to confirm whether it is malaria before he starts taking that dosage of “4-2-2-2”. This is because even in hospital, before one is given treatment for malaria, the blood must be tested to find out whether it is malaria, typhoid, pneumonia, cholera or whatever disease that may be. Therefore, I feel that this advertisement is misleading many people in the countryside. There should be very strict control over these advertisements over the radio and so on drugs.	 Some people are allowed to take Aspirin, but because it has been advertised on the radio, when a person gets sick he does not even find out whether that medicine contains Aspirin or not. Therefore, I feel that this type of advertisement should be controlled very much at the present moment and if need be , let the sick go to the hospital so that the hospital can verify such drugs and treat the sick for the correct illness. Otherwise, this “4-2-2-2” has misled too many people in the rural areas and they die without knowing the cause of their illness.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, another thing I would like to mention is about surveyors whom I think are the same as pharmacists. As I said, the intention is to maintain the profession and not to earn money. On the same clause under medical, survey and other profession, it says:-“The license year shall be from 1st January to 31st December each year”.  This confirms what I have been saying that before one's licenceis renewed,all these other things should be taken into consideration. 	On medical Practices, I have no quarrel with it, but I would like to mention one thing. With this cost-sharing in Trans-Nzoia, KitaIe District Hospital, has come about when the hospital has gone for a long time without drugs. Even when it comes to operation cases,	I do not know what terminology they use.	Somebody who goesfor operation is asked to go and buy the drip water, the strings for stitches, wool and so on.	Even as I am speaking now, the hospitalhas no drugs for meningitis. When you ask them you are told that even Eldoret Hospital does not have them, and people are dying. I was there on Monday and there was a child with difficult in breathing. In fact, he was at the point of death. The hospital did not have any drugs.  So, the boy was asked to go and buy from local chemists. It was only by sheer luck that one chemist had only six doses of the drug, and he was required to have ten of them because he had to be given ten injections of that medicine.  So, I asked the medical officers at the district level; "Can you get drugs from the medical store in Nairobi?" 	They said; "We have placed an order but so far there is nothing that has been forthcoming." 	So I would like to appeal  to the Government to avail drugs to district hospitals because people have accepted the-cost-sharing programme	in health services.	Since life is morevaluable than money, it becomes very sad when a patient pays money only to be told later that there are no drugs. This is very absurd and something must be done soon in order to save the lives of people in this country. 	So,  I would like inform the Government that perenial shortages of drugs are not a good reflection of the Government. 	If the cost-sharing programme was not there then the Government would have the excuse of saying that they do not have money during the current year 	but would supply them during the following year. 	But  with the introduction of cost-sharing we expect the revolving fund to exist in each and every district of this country to ensure that there are drugs at all times.	We would understand a situation where a disease breaks out unexpectedly and we fail to have drugs; but we cannot excuse any shortages for diseasesthat are of ordinary nature.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, on page	65 of the Bill,  thereis proposed an amendment for income tax.	In the amendment paragraph	(a) issupposed to be deleted and a new paragraph inserted thereof. 	Let me say something about taxation measures in the country. It is understood that a good and a patriotic person will always willingly pay his taxes in order to enable the Government to function. Whenever the Government intends to introduce some taxation measures it should remember that too much taxation ends yields nothing. So, taxation should be reasonable to enable people to make a little bit of a profit to enable them to pay taxes comfortably. I have a feeling that at the moment the taxes being levied are too high.	For example, you will find that the farmers have to pay taxes for their milk, maize and many other crops. I would like to suggest that as far as food stuffs are concerned, they should not be taxed because food is the security of a country. A nation without food  is not secure. Taxing food in a country is a way of telling the farmers notto grow enough	food.	So, I would like to appeal to the concerned Ministryto ensure that food is considered last when taxation measures are being introduced. 	It can only be done, for example, when the country is going bankrupt, but since this is not the case with our country, we can afford to do without taxing food. Since I realise that my time is running out with these few remarks	I beg to support. </newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATINAL CO-OPERATION	(Mr. Munyi):	Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to comment on this Bill.	I would liketo emphasise the point about the registration of dentists, pharmacists and other professionals. 	I would like to inform the House that when we are amending the law, even the ruling Party Kanu also amends its laws and continues to do so to ensure that our laws conform with our society. In fact, I remember one international lawyer who on comparing different African countries said that Kenya has done more than any other African country in amending its laws. 	As for registration of deaths and births, I am  glad that now the people of this country are knowledgeable about the importance of this. This is because there was a time when people did not know about its importance. There were even some chiefs and assistant chiefs who used to cheat about their ages to avoid retiring.	But when people are legally registered they cannotkeep on changing their ages.
