MUKUNA  asked  the  Minister  for Agriculture,   what  is  delaying  the  gazettement of  Emuhaya  Constituency  as  a  tea  growing  area as  recommended  by  Tea  Research  Foundation and  Kakamega  D.D.C. <Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT  MINISTER  FOR  AGRICUTLURE  (Mr.  Ngaruro): Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,   I  beg  to  answer. Emuhaya  Division  has  not  been  gazetted  as  a  tea  growing area  because  the  necessary  investigations  and  the mapping  of the  boundary  by  the  Kenya  Tea  Research  Foundation (KTRF),   the District  Development  Committee (DDC) , the  Kenya  Tea  Development Authority (KTDA)   and  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  have  not  been completed. As  soon  as  this  work  is  completed,   Emuhaya  will  be gazetted  along  with  the  other  areas  in  the  Republic. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.   MUKUNA: Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,  whereas,   I  would  liketo  thank  the Assistant  Minister  for  the  answer  he  has  given  tothis  House,I  would  like  him  to  be  more  precise  and  tell  theHouse  when  exactly  will be gazette  Emuhaya  Constituency  as  atea  growing  area? At  the  Moment  in  my  constituency  wehave  got  at  least 200  acres  under  tea. The  farmers  are  compelledto  carry  tea  for  a  distance  over  20  kilometres  to  the  nearest buying  centre.I  would  therefore,   like  the  Assistant  Minister  to  tell this  House  when  precisely,   they  will  gazette  Emuhaya  as  a  tea growing  area.  As  I  am  speaker  here,  Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,   the  DDC, the  KTRF  and  the  KTDA  have  passed  Emuhaya  as  a  tea  growing  area. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.   NGAGURO: Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,   I  appreciate  the sentiments expressed  by the hon. Members. A team  from  the  KTRF,the  KTDA,   the  DDC officials from my  Ministry  will  be  visiting  Emuhaya  areaearly  in December, 1990. It  is  hoped  Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,   that  oncethe  w Irk  is  done  gazettement  of  this  area  as  a  tea  growing  areawill  be  done  by  the  end  of  January, 1991. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.   MWAMZANDI: Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,   KTRF  and  the  DDCHave already  recommended  that  the  area  be  gazette. However, The  Assistant Minister, is saying that  they  are  going  to  visit  the  area  probablybefore  the  end  of  this  year, why do they  want to  visitthe  area  when  recommendations  have  already  been  made  by  people in the  field?What is  delaying  the  gazettement? </Newspeech>"<Newspeech>MR.   NGARURO : Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,  when  the  area   wasvisited  some  years  back  it  was  found to  suitable  for growing of tea. But, the   farmers  have  kept  on  growing tea areas outside  the  originalboundary. So,   it  was  found  necessary  by  the  Ministry  and  theother  Authorities  to  revisit  that  area  so  that  we  can  visit  all  the  areas  that  have  the  potential  for  growing  tea  and that  iswhy  the Ministry  and  the  officials  are  going  there. As  soon  asthat  work  is  done  we  shall  gazette  that  area  and we  are  certainthat  this  will  be  done  by  the  end  of  January, 1991. </Newspeech>""<Newspeech>MR.  MIRUKA-OWUOR: Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,  could the AssistantMinister  explain  to  the  House  the  reasons  for  restricting thegrowth  of  tea? Since  Kenya  is  an  independent country, I thoughttea  can  be  grown in  all  areas  in  the  interest  of  strengtheningof  the  economy  of  the  country. </Newspeech>""<Newspeech>MR.   NGARURO: Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,  we  are  not  restrictingthe  tea  growing  in  the  country. In  fact,   on  the  contrary  myMinistry is encouraging farmers  to  grow  tea,  but  of  course, thereare  some  formalities that  must  be  followed  if  the  small  farmersexpect  to  benefit  from  the  services  and  advice  of  the  KTDA  and one  of  them  is  that  the  area  must  be  gazetted. </Newspeech>"Question  No. 480"Mail  Delivery  at  Taveta  Post Office"" MR.   KUBO  asked  the  Minister  for  Transport and  Communications,   in  view  of  the  fact  that there  is  no  daily  delivery  of  mail  to  and  from Taveta  Post  Office,  what  steps  is  the  K.P. &  T Corporation  taking  to  ensure  that  mail  is delivered  to  and  from  Taveta  Post  Office every day. "<Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT  MINISTER  FOR TRANSPORT  AND  COMMUNICATIONS (Dr.   P.K.  Momanyi)  :  Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,   I  beg  to  reply. As  of  now,   the  Kenya  Posts  and  Telecommunications Corporation,   is  not  taking  any  action  to  delivery mail  to Taveta daily. Formerly, there  were  daily  deliveries  of  mail  to  and from  Taveta  until  December, 1989,   when  the  Corporation mail contractor, Kenya  Bus  Service (KBS)   discontinued  its  own  passenger services  on  that  route.As  of  now,   Kenya  Posts  and  TelecommunicationsCorporation  (KPT&C)   has  not  managed  to  identify  another  reliable contractor to  provide  daily  mail  services.  At  the  moment, however,   the  Corporation  depends  on  the  Kenya  Railways  whose  trains operate  to  Taveta  on  Tuesdays,  Wednesdays,   Fridays  and  Saturdays.  Due  to  the  distance  and  low  capacity  of  mail,   the Corporation  is  not  in  a  position  to  provide daily  postal  services or  deliveries  to  Taveta  using  its  own  transport. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.   KUBO:  Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,   it  is  very  surprising  to see  that  while  in  this  country  we  are  improving  services,   this Corporation  is in  fact,   going  the  other  way  round. There used tobe  daily  delivery, but  now  we are  not  getting  the  mailsdaily. So,   could  the  Assistant  Minister  explain  as  to  why  theCorporation  can  not  use  the  services  of  the  daily  buses  that go to  Taveta,  because  we  have  buses  operating  to  and  from  Taveta Daily,  but  the  Corporation  has  chosen  not  to  use  them, instead  they are, using  the  old train services? So,  Mr. Speaker,Sir,   can  he  explain  why  we  cannot  get  daily  mails as used  tobe  before? </Newspeech>"<Newspeech>DR.   P.K.   MOMANYI:  Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,   as  I  said  the  KBS which  used  to  be  the  main  contractor  stopped  going  to  Taveta  in December, 1989. To  contract  other  services we  need  certainconditions,  we  just  cannot  contract  any  bus  service  that  goes  toan area. </Newspeech>"<Newspeech>MR. BIDU On  a  point  of  order,  Mr.   Speaker,   Sir. TheAssistant  Minister  is  not  conducive in his  answer  and  he  is  notanswering  the  question. The  Questioner  has  asked  this  House  why he  cannot  get  another  contractor because  if  the  former  contractor ceased to operate  services  there  are  others  who  can  do  that. Youshould  answer  that  question  before  you start  reading. </Newspeech><Newspeech>DR.   P.K.   MOMANYI:  Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,   if  hon.   Bidu  was patient  enough,   that  is  exactly what  I  was  going  to  do. I   said  the  Corporation  cannot  just  take  any  bus  service as  its  contractor  because  it  has  to  attain  a  certain  level  and satisfy  certain  conditions  because  mail  is  a  very  important  item. The  availability  of  vehicles  must  be  considered  because  a  bus company  may  have  only  one  vehicle  and  you  cannot  rely  on  that and  its  time  table  may  not  be  relevant. For  example,   if  itoperates  at  night,  where  should  they  leave  mail? Realiabilitywhich  is very  important  must  be  considered. We  can  only  usea  reliable  bus  company. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.   ADEN:  On  a  point  of  order.  Mr.   Speaker,   Sir. Is the  Assistant  Minister  in  order  to  mislead  this  House,  when  in actual  fact  we  know  that  there  are  several  bus  companies  that operate  at  least  three  trips  per  day  to  Mombasa  and  three  trips from  Mombasa  to  Nairobi? </Newspeech><Newspeech>DR.   P.K.   MOMANYI: Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,   I  thought  I  wasdealing  with  Taveta. I  did  not  know  whether  there  was  a  problembetween  Nairobi  and  Mombasa. </Newspeech>       - <Newspeech>MR.MIRUKA-CWUCK: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. In manyareas  in Kenya, the corporation  has sub-post offices, but where there is need for putting up a post office, the Corporation must first of all assess the need to find out whether this xxx warrants the putting up of post office there. Could the Assistant Minister clarify to  the House whether there is a standard procedure for serving the people where they have put up post offices  due to demand for postal  services? We would like to know Whether this procedure varies from post  office to post office or whether it is a standard procedure because-</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.SPEAKER: What  is your point of order, Mr. Kiruka-Owuor? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.KIRUKA OWUOR:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, my point of order is the one that  I have already made. </Newspeech>(laughter) <Newspeech>MR.SPEAKER:  Which one? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.KIRUKA-OWUOR: That is important for the Assistant Minister to tell  this House what procedure the Corporation adopts in providing </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.SPEAKER:  That is a supplementary question. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.KIRUKA-OWUOR:  Okay, Mr. Speaker, Sir, my point of order then is that  the  Assistant Minister is misleading to the mouse because there should be a Presumption that where there are Post offices, there is a standard service seconded to people in all areas, and people in certain areas should not be left  to  suffer just because there are no postal agencies available. It is their obligation to have this service given to all who</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.SPEAKER:  That is still  a supplementary question. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRUKA-OWUOR :  Okay, Mr. Speaker, Sir, could it be answered then. </Newspeech> (laughter) <Newspeech>DR.P.J.KOMANYI: Mr.Speaker,  Sir,  that question is very vague. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.BIDU:  On a point of order,  Mr.  Speaker, Sir, is it really in order for the  Assistant Minister to say that the supplementary question by hon.  Miruka-Owuor is vague?   Is that really Parliamentary? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.SPEAKER:  I do not really  know what you are trying to tell about. Could you answer the supplementary question that was put to you by hon.  Kiruka-Owuor? </Newspeech><Newspeech>DR.P.K.KOMANYI:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, I said that the question was vague  but I will  endeavour to answer it to the best of my ability.  To provide a Post  office in any place, will necessitate the quantity of mail in that place. That  is one requirement. Number two requirement is that there must be a considerable distance from one post office to another. For example,  in this case we are dealing with Voi and Taveta and we find that the distance between the Post offices in these two towns, is quite long . For this reason, we have put up intermediary post offices between Voi and Taveta to serve the community in Jipe and Chumvini. Therefore,  there is no laid down criteria as such, but  the putting up of a post office in any place will depend on the quantity if mail  and the distance from one post office to another. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I think the Assistant Minister is misleading this House. I am  saying this because there is a very regular bus which goes between Taveta and Mombasa on a daily basis. In fact, there   are  two buses,  one which leaves at Seven o'clock in the morning while the other one leaves at Two o'clock in the afternoon and up to this time, these buses are  running. Therefore, would the Assistant Minister tell the House why the Corporation is not using the services of these two very regular buses which are in very good condition? </Newspeech><Newspeech>DR.P.K.MOMANYI:  Mr.  Speaker,  sir,  hon. Kubo has not told us whether these buses are reliable. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.KUBO:  Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  these two buses are very reliable, and the  operator of these two buses was supposed to have been given the contract  for  transporting mail,  but for reasons better know to the Corporation,  they refused to give him the contract. I do not know whether they  wanted chai  to do so or not.   Could the Assistant therefore explain to the  House why  the Corporation has allowed the Public to continue suffering by not trying to improve the postal  services in this areas which,  in fact,  are going down from day to day? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.P.K. MOKANYI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all know that the people in Tavera do not grow tea and I do not know what the hon.Member means by saying that the corporation perhaps would like to be given some tea by the people in Tavera. What in the first place would they want the tea for?To plant it or to drink it? </Newspeech> (laughter) <Newspeech>MR.BIDU:  Kr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I heard the  Assistant Minister saying that the Kenya Bus Service has stopped the contract of transporting mail  from Taveta and Voi vice versa,  could he tell us whether the  Corporation has tried to look for another contractor if the present contractor is not  reliable? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.P.K.KOMANYI: MR. Speaker,  Sir, I would like to assure theHouse that the Corporation is still considering applications by certain bus services asking for this contract. However,  as I said,  there are criterion to be  followed,  namely,  the a reliability of the vehicles they have,  their timetable and   I am  saying this because it important for any contractor to be able to handle the mail reliably. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  KUBO: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I come from Taveta myself and I know that almost  every  day,  there  is a Corporation vehicle going to and from Taveta and  this vehicle carried Personnel  only. In fact,  the Corporation should be utilizing this vehicle.  I know. I there  are  also other corporation vehicles which are  always traveling between Taveta and Voi  on a daily basis. Why can these vehicles not be transporting mail? </Newspeech><Newspeech>DR.P.K.MOMANYI : Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Corporation has many departments, The Telecommunications Department, for example,  does not handle mail. For the  Corporation to handle  the mail,  it must  have the vehicles to do so and it does not mean that these vehicles would be  attached to  the  job of operating between Voi Taveta   and Mombasa,  just to collect mail.  This would be highly uneconomical. However,  the  Corporation's vehicles to be able to handle the mail,  the distance between two post  offices must be within 20 kilometres but where the distance is more that it would be uneconomical. </Newspeech> Question 77:Payment of N.S.S.7. Dues to Mr. kutula MR.KILIKU asked the Minister for Labour When Mr.Sele Mutule, M.NS.S.F. No.o033990026.Will be Paid his total benefits.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANTMINISTER FOR LABOUR(Mr. D.K.Amin): Mr. Speaker,Sir,  I beg to reply. Mr. Speaker, Sir,   Mr. Mutula was Paid his benefits for the period  he worked on 26th May, 1989 by Cheque No.107125 for K.Shs.9,503/30 throughthe address supplied by him, namely, P.O. Box 93098, Mombasa. He cashed this cheque through the Central Bank on 27th June, 1989. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister does not appear to understand the Question.   This Question is talking about the payment of the total benefits to Kr. Mutula.  This gentleman was Paid part of the benefits and the balance has not been paid up to date.   I  do not know whether the amount the Assistant Minister has referred to as having been Paid to Mr. Mutula represents total benefits or part payment that was done in 1989.   Could he clarify the position? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D. K . AMIN: Mr.Speaker, Sir, this is the total payment of benefits for all the   period that Mr. Mutula worked, namely from 1967 to 1969 and from 1977 to 1984 and that is the period he worked as far as the Ministry is concerned. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRUKA-CWUOR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, many questions have been raised in this Pause regarding I delayed payment of N.S.S.F. benefits and the Ministry of Labour always comes here and assures this House that they would speed   up the processing of these payments.   These type of questions are still coming up which realty means that no attention has been paid to the matter.  Could the Assistant Minister clarify the position to the House? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.D.K.AMIN: Mr.Speaker,Sir, not only are we paying out delayed cases, but also current cases where people have retired or left employment.   I would like to assure this House that the Ministry will continue to do the best they can to speed up these claims. </Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR.  KILIKU: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  supplementary  question was not onthe  said payment,  but on  the  time  taken  to make  it. It  is  taking the Ministry  toolong  to pay  retired people. What  action has  the  Ministry  taken  to  quicken such payments? It  is  not  that retired people  are not being paid their benefits,  but that  these  payments  are  delayed. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  D.M. AMIN:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if claimants  give  us  the correct information,  obviously,  we  pay  them  their  dues  as  soon  as  they apply for them. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  KILIKU: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  do  not  want  the  answer  "as  soonas  possible"  to  be  given  to  the  House.Could  the  Assistant  Minister,  therefore,tell  us  how  soon  a  retired  employee  can  expect  to  be  paid  his  retirement benefits if he  has  given  the  correct information? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  D.M.  AMIN: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if we  are  given the  correct information,  payment  of these  benefits  normally  takes  two  weeks. </Newspeech>Question  No. 581Payment  of N.S.S.F.

Amin): Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,I  beg  to  reply.According  to  our records,  the  above-named claimant  has  not yetapplied  for  his  benefits. Therefore,  he  should be  advised  to  apply  for  them. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MWAMZANDI: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Assistant Minister  says  thatMr.  Masudi  Abdalla has not yet  applied for his benefits and that he should do so. Has  the  Assistant Minister checked with his members of staff on this  issue? It looks  as  if Mr.  Abdalla  applied  for his  benefits many years  ago. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  D.M.  AMIN: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  checked  this  issue  andfound  that the  claimant has not yet applied  for his benefits.Therefore,  he  shouldbe  advised  to apply  for these benefits  so that we may pay him. </Newspeech>Question  No. 546<Header> Rehabilitation  of Eldoret  Furfural  Plant </Header> DR.   MISOI  asked  the  Minister  for  Industry  what the  outcome  of  the  study undertaken  to  rehabilitate the  furfural  plant  in  Eldoret was. <Newspeech>THE  MINISTER FOR  INDUSTRY (Mr.  Otieno):  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  beg to  reply. Two  engineering  inspection reports on  the  Eldoret Furfural  Plant were  completed  in  January,  1989  by  the  engineers  of  two of the  United Kingdom firms  who  were  the  original  project  design  and construction  engineers. The reports  indicated that  the plant needed some modifications  and refurbishing, which  would  require,  at  least,  Sterling £6.5 million (approximately  Shs.300 million). More  accurate  estimates  would,  however,  only be  obtainable  after a considerable amount  of further  engineering  effort  which would be  costly  and,  therefore,  required prior  project  re-start  and rehabilitation  funding arrangements. The  detailedfeasibility  study  would cost  approximately  Sterling £200,000 (Shs.9 million).Thefirms  were  Messrs  Foster  Wheeler Energy  Ltd.  and Sulzer (UK)  Ltd., who  conducted these  studies  at their own  expense  and were willing to  co-operate with the Government on  the  rehabilitation efforts. I  am  still  at  the  stage  of finding interested  investors  and the money  for this project which,  otherwise, is technically very complicated and would  for a long time be  wholly  dependent on European engineers and management, let  alone  the  other  economic  factors  of raw material  supplies and markets  for its designed  capacity  production  of 5,000  tonnes  per annum  of furfural, 2,500  tonnesper  annum of acetic  acid and 300  tonnes  per annum of  formic  acid.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>   DR.  MISOI: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I,  indeed,  thank the Minister for thisanswer,  but what  is  puzzling  is  that the Minister says that this  is a very complex project  in  which  we  will  have  to rely on European management skills. Could he tell  us  whether  it would really be  feasible to rehabilitate this project? If not, could we  dispose  of it in any manner? He  says  that  even  if the project is rehabilitated,  we would still have to rely on European management skills and this gives  a  negative  connotation. </Newspeech>  <Newspeech> MR.  OTIENO: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the world  demand for  the  products ofthis  factory  is  large  enough  to  accommodate  the  capacity production  in Eldoret, but  it  is  the  management  and maintenance  of  the  available  machinery,  together with the  necessary  capital  for  effective  production,  that makes  the project a bit complicated. So,  feasibility  would  depend on  the  availability  of a person who  is capable  of  doing  this  work. </Newspeech><Newspeech> DR.  MISOI:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  could the  Minister  tell  this  House how  soon  he  think he  will  find  an  interested  investor?  The  longer  the  available equipment  stays  idle,  the  more  it  deteriorates  due  to  rust. At  the  moment,  there is  no  maintenance  team  to  keep  the  equipment  in good  shape  and,  in  the  end,  it will  become  obsolete. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR.  OTIENO:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  cannot  say  how  long  it  will  take to  find  an  interested  investor  except  that  I wish this  should  be  tomorrow. Question No. 514<Header> Number  of Tippers  in  Kwale  District </Header> MR.  BIDU  asked  the  Minister for  Public  Works how  many  tippers  the  Ministry has acquired during the  current  financial  year, 1990/91,  and  how  many have  been  allocated  to Kwale  District  to  assist  the officers  stationed  in  the  district to  perform  their duties  more  effectively. <Newspeech> THE  ASSISTANT  MINISTER FOR  PUBLIC WORKS (Mr.  Maiyani):  Mr.  Speaker, Sir,  I  beg  to reply. The  Ministry  has  procured  chassis  for  45  tipper  trucks  during the current  financial  year.  These  trucks  have  not been  allocated because  they are not ready. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR.  BIDU:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  it  in  order for me  to have asked a  Question  on  the  number of tipper acquired only to be  told that there  are  45 chassis? Is  the  Assistant Minister replying to my Question or not? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR.  MAIYANI: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  are 45  chassis  for  tippertrucks  and  unless  these  have been built,  they are really not tippers yet. </Newspeech>MR.  MWAMZANDI:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  the Assistant Minister aware that  the  reason  that  led  the  hon.  Member  for Kinango to ask this  Question is  that there  is  no  tipper  truck  in  Kwale  and that  it is impossible  for  the Ministry  to do  good  work  in  Kwale?  Would  the  Assistant  Minister consider  doing good work for the  people  of  Kwale  by  sending  two  or  three  tipper trucks  to  the  district? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR.  MAIYANI:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  explanation  I  have here  is that  when  these  tipper  tucks  are  ready,  each  district  is  going to  be  given one. So,  Kwale  is  going  to have  one  such  truck. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MWANZANDI:Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I would like  to requestthe Ministry to give Kwale  District  a tipper because we do not  have  one.Other districts have been given tippers. Why is the national  cake not  being  shared properly? Why  is Kwale District not getting its  share  of the  national cake? </Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON.  MEMBER:  Why not Mandera even? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MAIYANI:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  can assure  the  hon. Member that  these  tippers  are  going to be  taken where  they are required. One  tipper is going to be  delivered to Kwale District. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATE: On a point  of  order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  Is  theAssistant Minister  in order to mislead this House? He  is  supposedto talk a  about  tippers  but  here he is deliberately talking about  chassis. Can he  confirm that he  is having problems with language? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MAIYANI:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  the  body  of a tipper is  built  it  is  called chassis.  So,  probably it is  the  hon.  Member who has got problem with the English Language. Theses  Chassis  are with the  suppliers,  the  Cooper Motors Corporation. They  are  expected  to  start  delivering the  trucks in the  form of cabins and  chassis with effect  from 9th October,1990,  which mean that  they have  already started delivering the chassis  for construction. They will be  delivered  in consignements  of 15 per delivery. The Ministry will  in turn,  through the  Department  of Mechanical  and Transport Engineering,  build the bodies  and  install tapping gear. Each   District  in the Republic, including Kwale,  will be  allocated  one  tipper but the distribution will be  gradual because  of construction work.  The Ministry has  funds to  facilitate building of the bodies and work will commence  as  soon as the  cabins and chassis are delivered.   In  fact  delivery has already commenced,  The Ministry is not  in a position to know when building of the bodies for all the trucks will be  completed because that will depend on the delivery schedule being adhered to by the  suppliers. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MIRUKA-OWUOR: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the reply by theAssistant Minister is rather disturbing. This  is because he saysthat  the  Ministry  is not  in a position to know when the tippers will be  ready. That  is a rather disturbing answer because the conditionof roads  all  over the  country is really poor. Therefore    when the ministry is awarding contracts it  should know when the tippers are  going to be ready for delivery to the districts._ This  is because people  are  suffering all over the country. The roadsare  not passable. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MAIYANI:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  I have already stated, the   supplier is making delivery in batches  of 15 chassis. When we receive them we  start building the bodies.  We have no control  over the  Cooper Motors  Corporation. If they delay delivery,our work will also be  delayed. But the  assurance  I  can give  to theHouse  is that  each district  is  going to receive  a tipper. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.BIDU: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  you will  agree with me  that the  Ministry has not  taken any  serious  action regarding the  condition of roads in this  country. The  Assistant Minister has  said that  the tippers have  not  been   distributed to the  districts  because  they are not  ready. He  has talked  about 45  chassis  and When will thesetippers be ready? The Assistant Minister should not  say that hedoes  not  know. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>Mr.MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  I have  clearly stated  that  these  tippers  are  being built  by  our Mechanical Department. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  BTDU:On a point  of order,  Mr. Speaker,  Sir. I knowthat  certain documents  must  be  signed before  a contract  is awarded. Is  the Assistant Minister in order to tell this House  that he does not  know what  the  Cooper Motors  Corporation is  doing? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: I  am  quite  in  order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to state  that  I do not know how soon the  Cooper  Motor Corporation are going to  complete  the  contract. They  are  deliveries  the units  inbatches  of 15 per delivery. When we  receive  them we  start theconstruction  of the  bodies.  When the  tippers  are ready  they willbe  delivered  to respective districts. </Newspeech>Question No.572 <Header> Relocation  of Ena Toll  Station </Header> MR.  MATE asked  the  Minister for Public Works when the  Ena Toll Station will be moved to another  site  as recommended by the  Embu D.D.C. <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS  (Mr.  Maiyani):  Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to reply. At  present  the  Ministry is a carrying out  the  necessary studies  to  establish the viability of shifting Ena Toll Station. The Ministry is therefore unable to confirm at this time when the toll  station will be  shifted. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MATE: Mr.Speaker, Sir, the issue of Ena Toll  Station in  Embu is  a sad  story.It  is  a painful and  sad  story because thesiting of the toll  station was imposed on the people of Embu without the  consent  of the  D.D.C. The farmers who move  from their homesto the  factory  experience a lot  of problem. Could  the  Ministry  closedown the  toll  station until  it  finds  a suitable  la site  as the  Embu D.D.C.  decided? </Newspeech>  <Newspeech> Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  I am not in a position  to  sad whether we are  going to close it down or not. If the  road in that  area develops potholes and if some bridges are destroyed by the floods,  the  hon.  Member is  going to ask a Question here  seeking to know when the Ministry is am   going to fill the potholes and repair the bridges. The purpose  of the toll  station is to raise  funds  for the  maintenance  of roads in that particular area. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  MATE:  On a point  of order,  Yr.  Speaker,  Sir.   Is the Assistant Minister in order to  evade my Question. He  is telling us  the  advantages of a toll  station but we  are all  aware  of  that. But what  I am saying is that  this toll  station wasconstructed at Ena contrary to  the  wishes  of Embu people. This  ispunitive to the  farmers  in Embu. Could the Ministry close downthe  toll  station with immediate  effect until they find  a suitable site  for it? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MAIYANI: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  cannot  state here thatwe  are going to  close  dorm the  toll  station. But  we  are  carryingout  a feasibility  study  in the  area to  find  a suitable  site  forthe  toll  station. As  soon as the  study is  completed,  the  D.D.C.  willbe  in and  the  construction of a new toll  station will begin.I  cannot  at say whether we  are going to  close  it  down  or not becausethe  money is needed. </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR.  MATE:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  agree with the Assistant Minister that they  are  doing feasibility  studies with a view to shifting the toll station. Since  the  Embu District Development Committee has decided,  in their two previous meetings,  that the  toll  station should be moved from its current site unconditionally,  is  the Ministry's  decision not in direct confrontation with the wishes of the  district  development  committee? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MAIYANI:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  Ministry  is  in  touch with the Embu Development Committee,  and we  are looking for an alternative site for the toll station. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

WAMEYO:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  beg to  ask  the  Vice-President  and Minister  for  finance  the following Question by Private Notice. (a)  When  did  the Kenya  Commercial  Bank  Limited  introduce mobilisation fees  on  overnight excess? (b)  How  is  it calculated? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT MINISTER,  OFFICE  OF  THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr.  Keah): Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  beg to reply.(a) The Kenya Commercial  Bank Limited  introduced Deposits MobilisationFees  with  effect from 1st October, 1989.(b) Deposits  Mobilisation  Fees  are calculated  as  follows:- '    (i)  A  10  per  cent  fee is  charged on overnight excess for  amounts not exceeding KShs.10,000/- with a .minimum-fee of KShs.20/-(ii)  A  graduated reducing percentage scald is applied to  a maximum  of KShs.10,000/- for amounts  in irregular  excess of over KShs.2 million,  hence the following calculations:-(a)  Excess  between KShs  .10,001/-  and KShs.50,000/-Flat  fee  of KShs.1,200/-(b)  Excess  between KShs  .50,001/7  and KShs.100,000/-Flat  fee of KShs.1,500/-(c)  Excess  between KShs  .100;001/-  and KShs.500,000/ Flat  fee  of  KShs.2,000/-(d)  Excess  between KShs  .500,001/-  and  1,000,000/-Flat fee of KShs.3,000/-(e)  Excess  between KShs.1,000,00I and KShs.2,000,000/-Flat  fed of KShs.5,000/-(f)  Excess  between KShs.2,000,001  and above Flat  fee  of KShs.10,000/-</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO: Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  may  I  know from  the Assistant Ministerthe purposes  for  introducting  this  charge to  clients  of the Kenya Commercial  BankLtd.? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  KEAH: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, the Deposit Mobilisation Fee on overnightexcess  were  introduced  from 1st  October, 1989,  in  order  to  defray  the cost  ofcollecting deposits  from  the money markets  and paying relative interest on related operating expenses. As  you  are  aware,  the Central  Bank  of Kenya has,  from  this year,  introduced penalties to commercial  banks that exceed credit guidelines with the  aim  of discouraging additional  lending. Such penalties  have to be passed, quite naturally,  on  to the borrowers in excess of approved limits as  this would, primarily,  have been responsible for the excesses at the. Central Bank of Kenya.  Deposit Mobilisation Fees are,  therefore,  used to help meet such Central Bank  of Kenya penalties.  Deposit  Mobilisation Fees on onvernigh excess only apply where  a borrower  issued  cheques without prior arrangements with the bank and where such cheques would make  the account to be overdrawn above the limit agreed with   11, the bank. Naturally,  a borrower can avoid this  fee by ensuring that he or sheoperates  the account within the limits  approved or by arranging with branch managerfor temporary  additional  facilities before issuing any cheques. It  is  to  benoted that  all  commercial  banks and other lending institutions do charge variousforms  of commissions under different names since deposits are scarce and expensive.Those who have  access  to them do,  of necessity,  have to pay a price.The  Kenya  Commercial  Bank Ltd.,  therefore,   operates  in exactly the samemarkets as  other privately  owned commercial banks  and has  to offer competitiverates  for  deposits  and,  consequently,  must recover the cost from the users of thosedeposits  -  borrowers  -  in order to make a reasonable margin profits for it toremain  viable to  the share-holder.Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  now  trust  that Dr.  Wameyo has  the full  reason asto why  Deposit Mobilisation Fees  are charged. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  KUBO: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  very  interesting because what the Assistant Minister  is  saying  is  that  there is  an  automatic  find when  any  cheque bounces,  and  that  is  what  is  happening  in  this  practice. In  view  of  the fact  that this  is  scaring  a  lot  of  customers  and  that Kenya  Commercial  Bank  is  likely  to lose  all  its  business-- There  is  no  logic  at all  as  to why  an  account which  isoverdrawn  by  a  few  shillings  is  charged  so much  money. This  is  a  fine. So,  couldthe  Assistant Minister  think  about  this  matter so  as  to encourage more  people touse  the Kenya  Commercial  Bank? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  KEAH: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  sure that  I  did  not hear hon.  Kuboquite correctly. I  can  only add here that it is  important for those who operatebank  accounts  to  do  so  in a matter  in which they will not overdraw their accounts.It  merely  calls  for good  management of bank accounts. The borrower  or  the customeris  the only  decider of that aspect. If he chooses  not  to  overdar  on his,  accountand  if he chooses not to have  any  excess on his account,  then he will  not paythe  penalty. So,  the answer really lies with borrower and not the banks. </Newspeech><Newspeech>DR.  WAMEYO:   Mr. Speaker,  Sir, may I know from the Assistant Minister the time allowed by the bank to credit a cheque,  if a client is given a Nairobi  cheque and banks it at a Kenya Commercial  Bank branch in Mombasa?   How long does the bank take to credit the bank account of such a client? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  KEAH:   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I am not in a position to reply to that and cannot,  strictly,  give a straight answer as I am not a bank officer. I cannot tell  the time taken to credit a customer's account in Mombasa after he has deposited a Nairobi  cheque. However,  I can find out the duration taken if the hon. Member could cite specific instances. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>DR.  WAMEYO:   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a customer was given a co-operative bank loan and banked it in the Kenya Commercial  Bank branch at Treasury Square, Mombasa on 7th September, this year. In the process,  he issued cheques which made his account overdrawn and he was eventually creditted with the Ksh.100,000/- on 24th September,  having banked it on 7th September. There was a lapse of about 18 days.   Was that reasonable? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  KEAH:   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as I did say, we will try to get more information regarding the duration normally taken.   However,  I would like to refer hon.  Wameyo to my reply on good banking practices; of the need for the customer to liaise with his branch manager; of the need for the customer to tell  his manager, for example, that he has a Nairobi cheque against which he wishes to issue local cheques in Mombasa.   He would be accommodated as this is just a matter of talking and agreeing with a branch manager. I  have personally done that many times and,  I think,  it is good banking practice for hon. Wameyo to advise the gentle-man who banked his cheque  on 7th September to,  perhaps,  speak with his bank manager for greater liaison. </Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO:   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, many customers have written many letters to the Kenya Commercial Bank complaining about these charges. The letters have been forwarded to the headquarters in Nairobi  and no answers have been forthcoming.   When will the headquarters respond to them? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  KEAH:   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, if the hon. Member cares to let me have a list of all  the customers who have written to the Kenya Commercial Bank and-have not received any answers from the Bank,  I will undertake to ensure that they receive the specific answers required.   Secondly, this message will  be passed to the Kenya Commercial  Bank's management. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

TERER:   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to ask the Minister for Energy the following Question by Private Notice. How much money has the Ministry set aside for rural  electrification programme in Konoin Constituency during the current financial year? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LANDS AND HOUSING (Mr.  Mbela):   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, on behalf of the Minister for Energy,  I beg to reply.  My Ministry has set aside K£75,000 for rural  electrification programme in Konoin Constituency. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. TERER:   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  could I  know the specific areas where the electrification programme will  cover? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  MBELA:   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before I do so,  I would like to say that the planning for this particular area was done as part of the old Bomet Division. Having said that, I would like to add that four kilometres of line has been built with an expenditure of Ksh.1,156,939.00 in between Mogogosiek-Koiywa Market,  Cheptata Kenya Posts and Telecommunications booster stations. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  TERER:   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  could the Minister tell  the House how many people have benefitted from this line? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MBELA:   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, the programme is under construction and having been designed as part of the old Bomet Division, the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation is awaing for guidelines from the local DDC on which other areas should be covered. I  suggest that the hon. Member takes up the issie with his DDC so that any fresh requirements can be taken. </Newspeech> <Header> Deductions from Teacher Shiranda's Salary</Header>  <Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO:   Mr.  Speaker, Sir,  I beg to ask the Minister for Education the following Question by Private Notice. When did the Teachers Service Commission commence deducting Ksh.179/-per month from the salary of Mr.  Emmanuel  Shiranda N., T.S.C.  No. 61778? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr.  Amayo):   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, I beg to reply. The Teachers Service Commission commenced deducting Ksh.179/- from Mr.  Emmanuel  Shiranda's salary with effect from 1st August, 1986. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>DR.WAMEYO:Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  since Apollo Insurance Company has not supplied Mr.  Shiranda with the life policy,  despite several  inquiries, and since the Commissioner for Insurance has not replied to Mr.  Shiranda's letter of 5th June, 1990 on the same matter,  may I know where the Teachers Service Commission is sending the money? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AMAYO:   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, the Teachers Service Commission is remitting Ksh.l79/- every month to Apollo Insurance Company, Mombasa, P.o. Box 81821. </Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO:   Mr,  Speaker,  Sir,  that is not the right answer to my question because Mr.  Shiranda has not received his policy since  1986 and despite writing to the insurance company, there has not been any reply. The Commissioner for Insurance has not replied either.   Does the Ministry get any receipts from the Apollo Insurance Company to prove that they have received the money? /Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AMAYO:   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the issue here would have been if the Teachers Service Commission was remitting money elsewhere. We have been remitting money to the Apollo Insurance Company from 1986. The employee hasnot complained to the Teachers Service Commission. If he does not want themoney to go to the insurance firm, we could be advised to stop remitting it. Otherwise, the Teachers Service Commission, really, does not go into the details of making sure that the policy is issued; that is a persona! contract  between Mr.  Shiranda and the relevant insurance firm. </Newspeech><Newspeech>DR.  WAMEYO:   Mr.  Speaker, Sir, my question is whether the Commission has received any receipt from the Apollo Insurance Company to show that the money has been received by them. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AMAYO:   Mr. Speaker, Sir, the money is normally remitted in the usual manner of computer deductions.   Unless Apollo Insurance of Mombasa complain that they have not received any remittances, we normally continue to remit the Ksh.179,  and there have been no complaints as yet. </Newspeech> <Header> Relase  of 1990 Mungwo  School KCPE Mock Results</Header> <Newspeech> (MR.KIPKORIR)  to ask the Minister for Education:-Why were this year's K.C.P.E.mock results  ForMungwo Primary School in Elgeyo/MarakwetDistrict  not  released? </Newspeech><Header> Road Machinery  For Meru District Works Officer</Header> <Newspeech>MR.MALAMBE: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to  ask the Ministerpub1ic Works the  following Question by Private  NoticeWhat  urgent  steps  is the Minister taking to  providegraders,  tippers,  rollers and  a low loader to  the  District Works Officer,  Meru,  in  order  to  assist  the  said  officer maintain the roads  more  effectively. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS(Mr.  Maiyani): Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  beg  to reply.  The Ministry has  already  embarked  on  an  exercise  of rehabitating equipment  which  is  at Meru, but which has been  out of  order. At  the  same  time  the Ministry has  plans  to procureone tipper for allocation to Meru District  to facilitate Maintenance of roads. The  low loader  available  at  Embu will,  therefore,  continue  to  be shared  thin  Eastern  Province. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MALEBE:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Meru District  is  similar to  a  Province  because  it  is  considered  to be  the  size  of three districts.  The  district has  only  one  tarmac road that runs  from Embu through Meru to Nanyuki and most  of its road distance requires grading  and murraming. The  Assistant Minister  says that there  are plans  to  procure  a tipper for Meru District,  but will he tell us when  this  tipper  will  be  procured.Have  tenders been  awarded? If so,  what  is holding back the  procurement? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MAIYANI: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, as  I  said  in answerto  another question  earlier, Meru District is scheduled to receive one  of  the  tippers which are being built for my Ministry. I agree  that Meru is a large district,  but if my memory serves me right,  it will be  sub-divided,  and when that is done the new district will  get its equipment for road maintenance. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MALEBE: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I think the AssistantMinister  is  just  giving excuses. Already we  have  the  Proposed  Tharaka-vdtini  District  and it would require tippers,  graders, rollers and a low loaders. Since he  admits  that Meru District is the eauivalent  of a   province,  then he should accept that it needs a low loader  and  stop that the  district  should be  served by the one for  Eastern  Province. Furthermore,  roads  in Eastern Province areso  Poor  that we require more than one low loader. So,  can theAssistant Minister  consider  giving Meru District  a low loader? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MAIYANI: Mr.Speaker, Sir, as  I have  said we certainly have  one low loader  in Eastern Province.But MeruDistrict  can forward its request through the  DDC,  Meru. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MALEBE:On  a point  of order, Mr.  Speaker,  Sir. Itis  good  that  the Assistant Minister has raised the  issue  ofMeru District making its request through the DDC. In fact,  the Ministry is  sitting on                         a  letter,  which was  sactioned by the DDC, Meru, from the  District Works Officer, Meru, requesting for this euipment. Is in order for the Assistant Minister to say that the request should  be  made  through the  DDC. when it is already in his Ministry? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MAIYANI: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  neither here  nor in myofficer  have  I been  sitting on  papers.If  the  letter has  not  beendelivered,  to  us,  the  hon.  Member  can  find  out  what  happened.

In fact,  in  addition we have  also  appointed29  co-operative  societies  as  agents  for  collection  purposes  at  a commission  of  Shs.6.50  per bag.

MWENJE:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  is why we  are  saying that we  have  appointed  29  co-operative  societies  within  that distriict  to act  as  buying agents  for  the  board. These  are  socities  which can  effectively reach  all parts of the district and have started buying the maize. </Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR.WABUGE: Mr.   Speaker,  Sir,  is  the _Assistant MinisterAware that  this  year  we will have maize  shortage  in  the  country?since  maize,  is ready for harvest, could he  ensure that  the  buying centres  are opened  this week so  that  we  can arrest the situation? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MWENJE: Mr.Speaker,  Sir,  I have  said that there arearrangements  for  starting of operations immediately.The appointedagents have been  instructed  on what  to do and can_start buying themaize  as  soon  as  they are ready,  Particularly for  stocking Purposes. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.KIRWA: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  can  the Assistant Ministerassure the  House  that Kapsingilai Buying Centre  will  be openedbefore  the  end of January,1991? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MWENJE: Mr.  Speaker, Sir, we will  open the  centreimmediately the  farmers  are ready to  deliver the maize. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.WABUGE: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in view of the  fact  that farmers are ready to deliver maize even today, will the Assistant Minister instruct the board the buying centre within this week? He says the center can be opened “immediately”. Which means the board is ready to open the centre any time. When I say immediately,  I mean when the farmers are ready.   For instance, they are just about to be ready.   We are just about to open the centres, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   We have sent our men to see whether the maize is ready.   I can assure the hon. Members that the farmers will be served properly.   We will immediately open the centres for the purpose of delivery. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WABUGE:   Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister is not telling us when he is going to open these centres.  He is just saying that when the farmers become ready although the farmers are ready.   Is he going to open the centre's tomorrow or the day after tomorrow?   Is he going to ensure that the farmers delivering maize are paid on delivery as opposed to the  previous years when maize was not been paid for on delivery and hence the farmers were dissatisfied and as a result some of them used to sell maize through back door. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MWENJE:   Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member now raises the question of payment, but I would like to assure him that there will be no delay in payment. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI:   Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Spika.   Mnamo tarehe 20, June, 1990, niliuliza Swali Nambari 277 kumhusu Bw. Kassim Mwalim., ambaye bado hajapata nambari yake ya kazi.   Waziri Msaidlzi-wa Mawasiliano na Uchukuzi, Bw.

Mwishowe alisema kwamba huyu Bw. Kassim Mwalim , kabla ya miezi sita atakuwa amepata nambari yake ya kazi. Tulimpigia makoti Waziri Msaidizi kwa sababu ya jibu lake.   Lakini, Bw.

Ikiwa hakuna hatua yoyote ilichukuliwa, hilo in jambo ambalo linaleta hesima mbaya kwa Mawaziri hapa Bungeni.   Mpaka sasa Bw.

Ninasikitika sana kwa sababu mara  kwa  mara nasimama kwa mambo ya nidhamu juu ya hospitali ya Kinango ambayo inakabiliwa na  taabu sana. Kila mara mimi  husema kwamba hospitali hiyo haina ambulensi  na hata siku moja.Waziri wa Afya akij:ibi  alinishukuru kwa sababu ninalitumia gari  langu kama ambulensi.Kwa muda mrdfu  sana wagonjwa wamdkuwawakipata  taabu  sana. Pia mimi  hupata taabu  sana kwa sababu hakuna ambulehsikatika hospitali  hiyo.Kila  mara ninaambiwa kwamba ambulensi  iko njiani,  lakinisasa miaka miwili  imepita bila jambo lolotd kufanyika. Tutaendelda mpaka lini na hali  hii wakati  mambo ya wagonjwa yanapodnddida kuzorota katika Hospitali ya Kinango? Nigdp6da Waziri  wa Afya ambaye yuko hapa,  awaambie wananchi wa Kinango  kumetoked taabu gani.Kama kuna  taabu  basi,  ni  heri  tupdwd nafasi ya kuchanga pesa kwa njia ya Harambee iii  tuweze kununua ambuldhsi.Tunge'taka Waziri  ajibu  sasa. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  MINISTER  FOR  HEALTH (Mr.  Kibaki);  Bw.

Time today by leave  of the House) <Header> Second Reading</Header>  <Header> The Appropriation Bill </Header> <Newspeech>THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINSTER FOR FINANCE.(Prof.  Saitoti):Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I beg  to move   that  the Appropriation Bill be read aSecond. Time.  his Excellency  the President has  signified his consent to this Bill. Speaker,  Sir,  hon. Kembers have been able to discuss at great length the various votes including the  1990/91  Recurrent  and Development expenditures. The rest of the votes which could not be discussed,  wereguillotined on the 31st of October, 1990 in according with the Standing Orders No.142.  The purpose of this Bill  is therefore to  seek authority for financial provisions from this House in accordance with Section 102 of our Constitution. The Vote on  Accounts allows me  to release  half of the net provisions including the 199-/91  Estimates of recurrent  and develornent  expenditures. Once  this Bill is passed and given ascent by His Excellency the President,  I will be able to issue  the total  amount  from the  Consolidated   fund and to enable the Ministries and other Government  Departments to meet their financial requirement.  The  Appropriation Bill, 1990,  contains  the  armpits  and provisions for  each vote including the Appropriations in Aid as detailed in the  summary of the  statutory estimates as contained, in the 1990/91  recurrent and  develotment  estimate books. Mr.Speaker,  Sir,  Clause two of the Bill provides for the issuance out of the  Consolidated Fund,  of a sum  of £1,885,458,670 necessary  to meetpublic  expenditure for both recurrent  and  development during  thefinancial year ending on the 30th of June,1991. The sum to be isuedout  of the Consolidated Fund  includes the amount nrevious authorised by the  .; National Assembly under Vote  on Account  on 19th  of  June, 1990. The  Clausealso  emnowers us  to  appropriate  the  sum granted ta for the  supply servicesspecified in the Schedule. Clause 3 make provisions  for Appropriations-in-Aidfor those services  and and purposes.Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the provisions  enumerated in  this Bill  follows strictly  the  established practice  and  I would therefore like  to urge hon. Members,  to pass  this  Bill   so  that  I can be  able  to release  the  total  voted provision  to  the Ministries and departments from  the  Consolidated Fund to enable them  to  render these  services  to  wananchi  and chance  the development of our country  through the implementation of projects.  Mr.Speaker,  is  also  pertinent  at  this  juncture  that  I Should also draw to the attention  of this House  that  at the time this financial year's budget  was being  formulated,  the  international  economic  situation did  look  fairly  favourable. I  am  sure  that hon. Members are aware thatabout  three months ago,  a crisis  did erupt  in  the  Gulf area and this crisisis continuing  and it  is not very clear when it  is going to come  to an end.however,  what is very important  and  ought  to be borne  in mind,  is that theGulf crisis has brought  about  asituation where  the price  of crude oilhas  gone up  tremendously.  In fact,  since  I read last year's budget,  the price of crude oil  has more  than doubled and this  trend  dses not  seem  to bechanging.  What  we  are  now  seeing  is a gradual  increase of prices of petroleum products. How long  this crisis is going to last,  is anybody's guess,  but the  fact  that  our  total  oil  bill has gone up,  kas means that our own balance of payment position has been affected.  To this extent,  the Government has looked  into  the  matter and  is  continuing  to  look into it.  This means that we have  to te very careful  in  the manner  in which we manage our own foreign exchange. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would like  to  say right here,  that it is no longer going   to be  easy  to have people with  the  appetite of  imported goods.  We  cannot allow  such people  to continue using  our meagre foreign exchange to import particularly  goods that  are  available in this country.  This is a time of retrenchment and the meare foreign exchange that we have ought  to be directed towards the procurement of the raw materials for ourindustries so that  they can continue to operate.This  would enable usto continue to  employ our own people. The foreign exchange that we have should be used for the purchase of spare parts and for the most important agricultural  inputs. We shall  have therefore to put aside all other.luxuries   and strive to be more and more patriotic and I would like to take this oPportunity to urge Kenyans to be patriotic. They  should buy Kenyan goods and avoid importing  similar goods from abroad. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I would like to say that we shall ensure that no licence application will  be processed for the goods that are of luxury nature.It does not help anybody for Kenyans  to  import goods from other countriesthereby  assiting them to build their industries more and more. When we do  so,we also  assist  these countries to creat employment opportunities to their people all  at the expense of our own industries and that of our people. We have  to build this nation.   We  have  to  build this  nation.Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would also  like  to  draw  the  attention of the Houseto  the  fact  that  as  a result of the  recent very  large  increase  in the price of petroleum products,  Kenyans  will  have  to pay higher prices  for these products. As  long as  these prices  go up  internationally,  there  will be no alternative but to pass  them  over  to  consumers. Even  more  important,  I  must  say  that  this  is one time  when  Kenyans  should  exercise  the  greatest  economy  in  the  use  of petrol. We have  to  conserve  our  foreign  exchange. The  more  petrol  we  use,  the  larger ourimport bill  for petrol becomes.Kenyans  must understand that we  are  no  longerable  to  lead.a fairly  cavalier  life. We have  to  take  into  account  the  fact that the  world has  been gripped  by  a major  economic  crisis. At  this  time,  we  have  toensure  that we  embark  on  austere  measures. Kenyans  should,  therefore,  not  drivearound  merely  for  leisure;  we  must  learn  to  conserve  fuel  in  order  to conserve our  foreign  exchange. At the  same  time,  it must  also be understood that because  of the very  nature  of our  own  industry,  this  industry  is  very much  dependent on oil. This  is  basically  the  major  source  of oil. The  Government  is,  of  course,  using various  ways  to  explore  other  alternative  sources  of energy,  such  as  electricity. For  the  time being,  however,  it must be understood that the nature of our industry is  heavily  dependent on oil. Therefore,  when  the price  of oil  goes  up,  ourindustry  is very  much affected. It  behaves  every hon.  Member of this  august Houseto  explain  to wananchi  that we  have  a problem  that has  been brought about by the Gulf crisis.This  problem  is  not  of Kenyan  make nor  an  issue  of management,  buta purely  external  factor. However,  we  cannot  just sit  idle and say,  "We have  aproblem."  We  have  to  face  up  to  the  problem squarely and clearly by embarking on austere  measures. I  refer  to  the  public  sector-Government Ministries.We  must bevery  careful  in  the way we use  our vehicles so that we may conserve energy.Inall  ways,  there  must energy conservation.Above  all,  as  I  said,  we  must  lookinwards  in  terms of consuming what we  are manufacturing. For  the  time  being,  we must  forget  about  having  to  consume  imported goods. Let us  consume  the  goodsthat  are  being manufactured here. It  is  important  that we  recognise  this  fact.I  must  also  say  here  that,  apart  from  the  Gulf crisis,  the  world economy  is  undergoing a very  interesting trial.  For  one,  the  situation  in eastern  Europe,  where  there has  been  a  liberalisation of the  economy,  has,  in itself,  meant  a much greater  competition  of  funds,  especially  investable  funds, in  those  countries  than was  the  case  before.  Eastern European  economies  are nearer  the  centres  of money  and  they provide  a very  interesting excitement especially  to  multi-lateral  bodies,  which  is  going  to  create  problems  for developing countries  because  a  lot.of  the  available  investable  money  is  likely to  go  to  eastern  European  countries.  We  must  take  this  into account and understand that we  are  also beginning to  see  regional  economic blocks being created  in  the world. Europe  is  likely  to  become  one  such  block  in 1992. Therefore,  we,  in  this region  of Africa,  have  to understand  that we  are-entering an  extremely  difficult situation. Above  all,  and  of  immediate  concern,  there  is  the  fact  that  there  is some  recession  in  the world  economy which  is going to  create  problems  by  coming up  with  a more  diminishing demand even  of our  exports. We  are  also  going  to be hurt  by  the  fact  that  interest  rates  are  likely  to go up because  we  will  have  to look  for  more  resources  to  service  our own  debts. It  is  for  this  reason,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  we have  to  be  very careful  in  our  own borrowing policy.  We  are  firstly going to go  for  concessionary borrowing  and  discourage  very  vigourously  commercial  borrowing. (Applause) We  will  have  to  educate  our people  on  this  because  if we continue  to borrow commercial  money,  we  might  end  up  being embarrassed. Kenya has  never  been embarrassed  in  servicing  its  debts. Let  me  say  that  we  very much  value  the  aid that has  been extended to  us,  both  in  development and  in other areas,  by our friends over many years. We  appreciate this assistance and hope that we will  continue  to maintain that long relationship  in  which  donors  continue  to become major partners  in our own    -development  efforts  for  the  improvement  of the  living Standards of our people.However,  I  think  one  thing should  be  made  very clear here.Kenya has  neverwelcomed  aid with  "strings",  and we  are  not,  even now,  about  to  do  so. We  willaccept  the  aid  that  is  given  to  us  because  of  our policies  of  development,  butwe  are  not  going  to  accept  aid  with  "strings".(Applause)We  are  not  going  to  accept  to  be  dictated  to by  external  forces  so  that  we  may get,money  from  them. The  Independence  of  this  country  was  obtained,  first  and  foremost,so  that  we,  as  Kenyans,  could  be  able  to  sit  down  and plan  our  own  programmes,  ourpolicies  and  the  destiny  of  this  country. We  do  not  believe  that  any  price  canbe  attached  to this particular freedom. We  say  this  with  due  respect  to  ourfriends.I  say  this  because  a  certain  statement appeared  in  a newspaper,in  which  I  believe  there  must be  an  error. I  had  discussions  with  the  peoplereported to have  made  that statement,  and  these  discussions were  fairly cordial.At  no  time  did what  was  reported  in  the newspaper emerge  in our  discussions. So,I  believe  that  in  not  too  distant  future,  a  statement  to  clarify  that matter willbe  emerge. We  want  to  state  very  clearly  once again that our freedom  is not onsale. It  is  not  on  auction.(Applause)We  will,  as Kenyans,  stand firm on this  issue. There  are  certain  things  that wehave  to  change. Only  we,  Kenyans,  can  do  this. We  normally  adjust  ourselveswhere  necessary. So,  we  will  not do anything to  appease anybody because we arenot  on  an  appeasement mission.With  those  few remarks,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to move. </Newspeech>   <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY (Mr.Otieho):  Mr.  Speaker,Sir,  I rise to  second the Bill as moved by His Excellency the  Vice-President  and Minister for Finance and wish to emphasise that we are  going to  experience  a  situation of very serious  foreign exchange  constraints. We will be  facing this  situation as  a result of the rising oil prices while  at  the  same time we  are  coming unaer presssure  from strange  sources;  that  any further aid  or assistance by way  of bailance  of payments support and so on, will be conditional. We  are being pressurized to live  the way  other peoplewould like  us  to live.This  issue would  call  on Kenyans to betruly patriotic,  as  the  Vice-President and  Minister for Finance has  said. All Kenyans  should realise that  foreign exchange constraints and  the need to  spend more money to import  oil will also  affect  Government revenues.  So,  every Shilling that the Government has voted,  in this Appropriation   Bill thatParliament is  reauested to approve,  will   matter. It   will  only be  on those projects where we have  officers that will value the Kenya Shilling that  we  are  likely to achieve  the highest  success. I would like  to mention that there  are  several  Governmentprojects,  capital projects,  that  are  still uncompleted.We  have toappeal  to  our Accounting Officers that no new projects should be started  until all  the past projects have been completed. The situation becomes very dangerous when you   think of the  private  sector;  that  the  more new capital projects you start and then you induce the private  sector to perform those  functions. For instance  a private company may render services to the Government and is  not  paid  for six months. That  kind  of thing is  a going to destroy  our  own  private  sector particularly where we have   indigenous  companies that  are  still thin  on capital.A privatecontractor may construct  a hospital  as reouested by an AccountingOfficer  and then he  is owed KShs.10 million. That  is veryruthless  on the Dart  of  such an a Accounting Officer;  to reouest the private  sector developer to render  services  only to be  told later that  the  money is not there  and yet the  Government  budgeting  system is very clear and the  Accounting Officer should have known whether money was  available  or not. I would like  to  take  this  opportunity to  appeal not  only to  our Accounting Officers  but  to all  those are responsible for lmmiementing.Government  projects,  starting at tne D.D.C.  level,  that it  is  important that we  look after every  Shilling we  have particularly at this time when we  face  an uncertain future;  a future  when we are  likely to  face  increasing foreign exchange  constraints and reduction in Govelument revenue while  at the  same time we  are sure  of rising demand for Government services;  particularly  socialservices,  education and health.It  is important that this  should  come  out  clearly not  only to civil  servants but also to people  in the private  sector;  that  it  is time to look after the Kenya  Shilling. The  more we  spend  on goods that  are  manufactured outside  this  country,  the  more we  are weakening the Kenya Shilling and the more we  are  subject  ourselves to the whims and wishes  of  foreigners.  They have  sent the warning to us,  that  they  are  not likely to  be  that  kind unless we live like the Americans,  British and  so  on. We  need  our Independence  and we  know that Kenyans will never allow a situation where their way  of life  is  dictated from elsewhere.Wemust  take some  action on our part.That action means protectingour resources  and ensuring that the little we have  is put to the best use.  Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  all  of UB  are aware  of the growing unemployment  in the  country. We  will   only  arrest  the  situation when Kenyans  themselves will be  investors  in their own country.HiS Excellency the President has  said very many times that no  other Person will develop Kenya for Kenyans. But when you look at the gross  fixed capital formation domestic  fixed capital formation in  this  country you will  find that  it  is very low.   This means that Kenyans are  consuming more  than 80 per cent  of what  they produce. They  are not  leaving enough money to be invested in the kind of capital  expenditure  that  we need to  ensure  our increased Production in the years to  come. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  for  sure are  likely to  face increasing inflationpry pressures in the country and in this regard we require  the understanding of our general population;  that prices may rise:  Our people  must understand that prices may rise;  that  there  may be  inflation as  a result  of what may be forced on us:But  in terms  of policy,  we  will pursue  a policyof as low an inflation as possible. But  there  is  likely to beinevitable  price  increases because  of imported inflation.   We do not want  anybody  or any  of the  dissidents  or  subversives to  start using legitimate price  increases to discredit  the  Government. This  is because  a lot  of inflation is  imported  into this country: We  still Import virtually  all machinery and  components and raw materials for our  industries. These will necessarily rise in price as  our foreign exchange reserves  go down and  as the  Shilling gets weakened: It will not  be  legitimate  opposition to come  and  say this is happening because  somebody  in Government has directed or has called for those price  increases. I  assure you that  the price  increases will bereasonable  because  the policy we  are pursuing is  a policy  ofminim inflation.We  will try  as  much ma as  we  can to keepthe  inflation figures as low as possible.    But where  the inflation is  imported into this country,  the public should not  be  gullible  as to feel that  it  is Government policy to raise prices; It  is  only the  necessary increases that  may be  experienced. Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  in a situation that  calls for self-reliance."  You mast  feel within yourself that  you want to continue  to  be  a Kenyan;  a proud Kenyan and not  a Kenyan that  at pry time may want  to be  on sale  to anybody  else;  at  eitherretail  or wholesale price.It  is  the  issue  of unity  of purpose thatwe need to underline at  this  time. I want  to mention that ourstrength will continue  to rely  on a strong agricultural base.If atany time,  in whatever crisis we may have  to face  in future, we land in a situation where we  have to import  food,  we  shall be doomed; We  therefore,  would like to  call upon every Kenyan with any piece  of land to  make  use  of that land to   produce  more  food so that we  do not  have to  import  any food;Similarly;  I  appeal to every Kenyan,  as  far  as food  is  concerned,  to consume what we are capable  of producing  in this  country. The issue  of  importing  strange vegetables  and  strange pilipili  and  so  on. Please  be patriotic enough so that  we consume what we  produce;My last point is on parastatals.There is an amount of wastage  which is  experienced  in parastatals;   This  is because they  Are sheltered;  they are  away  from the mainstream ofGovernment  expenditure  controls.Some parastatal executives havebeen rather  extravagant  despite the  losses which theircorporations  are  making.At  this time  of financial constraints,  weshall  be very ruthless with such executives who do not economise  onGovernment resources  in the  hands  of the parastatals. For those who fail to pay  their  debts they  should excuse us and  start looking for  political reasons  for keeping  jobs which they cannot manage.   Agree that if you cannot rum a parastatal;  to look after the resources Placed under your care productively in the national interest,  please do not rush to mhe. Nassir to help you keep your job. Tell your family that  it  is  the nationpi  financial constraints that we have  and  that  it  is  the  situation in which we  find ourselves. Tell your family  "they found me inefficient;  let me  help myself elsewhere". Leave  another person to  take  care  ofGovernment  resources  in the  national interest.I beg to  second. </Newspeech>(Question proposed)<Newspeech>MR.  KILIKU: Thank you very much,  Mr. Speaker, Sir,  for giving thisopportunity. First of all,  I would like to thank the Mover of this Bill, who isHis Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance,  and commend him very much for his economic management. He has told Kenyans the truth and nothing else but the truth. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the situation we are in today is such that nobody should pretend. The cause of the economic problems we are having are as a result of the Gulf crisis. Before I say something on the Gulf crisis,  I would also like to support the Minister for industry when he says that we should not start fresh projects before implementing the already initiated ones. District development committees should be issues with directives that they should not initiate any projdct if there  is another one which has not been finalised. The money released by theTreasury should be used to complete the.already initiated projects. Politiciansshould not initiate projects  if there are other projects already going on.  Even if you did not take part in the  initiation of the laready on going projects,  you should  support them because they are for the people. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while we are making allocations and the Minister for  Industry  is here.  we should tell  the potential  investors to go rural and not concentrate in towns such as Nairobi,  Mombasa,  Kisumu and what-have-you. They should start new factories in towns other than these because when we concentrate factories in thdse towns,  we are going to have the problem of rural/urban immigration  in terms of labour. We should also take into account the fact that in the big towns I have mentioned we lack accommodation and other facilities like schools. So,  when factories are concentrated in the areas I have mentioned,  then we are. going to increase the problem of accommodation and employment. So,  the Minister should encourage potential investors to concentrate in the rural areas because that will help us to solve the problem of accommodation in the big towns.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  no country can develop without having enough foreign markets. Let us find foreign markets for our goods. As we are talking now,we have a lot of mangoes rotting in Malindi, yet the price of one mango in London  is  KShs.60/-.One  mango  in Malindi  costs  about KShs.5/-.So,  it  is  proper  forthe Ministry  concerned with  this matter  to look  into ways and means of selling our  goods  in foreign markets  so that we can earn the very foreign exchange we need. If we  could  sell  horticultural  produce abroad,  that would  be one way  of helping the Government  to earn foregin exchange. As  I  am  talking here,  the Ministry  of Agricuure  should  know  that we have a  lot  of mangoes  and other horticultural. crops rotting  in Malindi. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  think  before we get  any  foreign  loan  there must be some negotiated  terms. But you  find  some politicians  coming here and  telling usto  do  this  and  that. I  think we have the negotiated  terms,  the  loans  are thereand we  pay  them. I  think Kenya  is  among  the very  few African countries which are. able  to  service their  debts.to  tell  us  what we must  do? Why  should we have Britons  and Americans  coming hereWhy  should  they  bring conditions where foreign aid  is  giveh  purely on  commercial  basis  and we service our debts accordingly? I  thinksince Kenya  is  one of the very  few African countries with political  stability,the foreigners are jealous about our stability and of what we are doing right now.So,  we  should  not  listen  to them but  to realities of fordign borrOwing. We  shouldnot  listen  to  people who  come with  their horns  to please the few stooges we havein Kenya and others  living abroad. we are not in a position to kneel down to any-body  because we are able to service our debts and manage our economy without anyproblems. Of course,  the problem we are having today is not Kenya's problem only;it  is  a problem facing the whole world and which no country can control. We shouldnot  be told that we are having problems because of this and that.I  think  everycountry  is facing the same economic-problem following the Guld crisis.Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  1992 we are going  to have the single market formedby  the members  of the European Economic Commission. Let us  be told  what adjustmentsthe Government has done to counter that force:We may  be tremendously  affectedand  we may  not know where to  sell  our coffee,  tea and other exports. So,  theMinistry  of Planning and National Development should tell us what adjustments we   are making so  as not to be affected by the formation of the singld market in 1992 by  the European countries. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, we have followed the policy of free market in our economy  and  the communist countries have of late realised that the policies they were  following were very  wrong. That  is  why we have had the unification of East and West German and the unification of South and East Yemen and that one of the Kordas. The communist countries have realised that the economic plicies they were folldwing  were wrong and,  hence,  the unifications. We have been following the policies  of  free market-economy which is being supported by every country of the world.That is why I support the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for tellingKenyans  the  truth  and  nothing  else but  the truth.It  is  all  right  to  tell  thepeople the truth. For instance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we tell our Kenyans to buy goods produced  in Kenya,  we are telling them the truth because we are supporting our economy.   It is only a few educated Kenyans who bring problems to this contry because  they  are the one's who know what  is  sold  in London,  America and  other countries. The  ordinary  Kenyan cannot go  and  do  shopping in London. It  is  only the  very  education Kenyans who have access  to resources who can go and shop in London or Paris. Why  should  they  go  to  London  for  shopping? Why  can  they  not accept  our  goods,  whatever quality  they are,  since they are our products?   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, we must all realise that whenever we go to shop in London, we are depleting the meagre foreign exchange earnings we have and,  at the same time,  supporting the economy of the United Kingdom, or any other country you may be importing from.   You would, also, be supporting the employment in those other countries, while destroying the employment opportunities in your own country. Sir, there is some conflict between statements made by the Vice-President and the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Commerce. Hon.Saitoti  urged us to "Buy Kenyan" and hon. Magugu told us two weeks ago that there would be liberalisation of imports.   Yes, we support our indigenous firms so that they can produce goods of high quality but, when we have this liberalisation,  it means that we may end up importing everything we need.   When that happens, we are not going to"Buy Kenyan". This is because when you go to the markets, you will  be finding three-quarters of the products there being from outside the country. I,  therefore, go by what His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance has said,  that we should "Buy Kenyan."   This liberalisation of imports should be checked by the Treasury so that we do not have to import everything we need from other countries. I  support what the Minister for Industry said,  that in order to develop,  it would be better for us to be investors   in our own country. However,  while I  support that idea,  are the local  investors given support by the very indigenous financial  institutions?   When an African approaches the financial  institutions,  he is given a very rough time because of his background. It would be better for indigenous African institutions to prioritize the financial  assistance to indigenous investors.   No  loan can be granted without conditions;that is obvious,  but the indigenous investors should be encouraged to carry out business by being given priority on loan request.   After they have satisfied the conditions  laid down by the financial  institutions, they should be given that priority to enable them to invest locally. If we say we are supporting them in the country and we do not.give them financial assistance, they cannot invest. We have the Gulf Crisis today for which we should not blame the Government when there are price adjustments.   The crisis is beyond the Govern-ment's control. It was written in the newspapers yesterday that in future we may have to pay some US$75 per barrel  of oil.   That will be too expensive for us,  considering that the current price is US$40.It is only God who knows 'what-we are going to do when the oil  prices shoot that far.I believe Godis going to help us.   However, in view of what is happening, we pray that we will  strike our oil  one day.   The oil  crisis is going to paralyse theeconomies of many developing countries.   The prices of all  commodities will be very high. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at the same time, we should not take the oil crisis as a cover-up for other things.   We know that there is a problem in that respect but,  at the same time,  there could be an element of corruption involved. Those people who are involved in shady deals of siphoning money from this country to other foreign countries are more dancerous to our economy than the Gulf Crisis itself. When businessmen are exporting their goods, the Treasury and the Ministry of Commerce should be on the look out to ensure that there is no under-invoicing.   The money derived from such trade should be brought back to this country without delay. If we can really have people repartriating money from this country then such people are robbers.  Sir,  although we have been very good, there are those of our non-indigenous brothers who are here to make money, not for the development of this country.   The Vice-President and Minister for Finance should be checking to ensure that there is no illegal repartriation of foreign currency so that we can develop. I can see my colleagues indicating that they would,  also,  like to   contribute on this Bill  and, therefore,  I will not speak for long.   Let me just add that we have a big unemployment problem in this country.   Now that the Ministries are going to have the money recently voted for them,  I appeal to the Ministers to ensure that all  those vacancies in their Ministries are filled immediately.   This is because the unemployment problem,  irrespective of the Gulf Crisis,  is affecting this country very much. It is the right of the people to be employed.   Let us also address ourselves to self-employment. The Jua Kali  people should be assisted because if we have so many people who are self-employed, they will;  in turn,  employ others. With those few remarks,  I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  WABUGE:   Thank you very much, Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, for allowing me to make a few remarks on this Bill.   As the Mover and Seconder said,  the country is facing very difficult situation which requires everybody.in the country,including those in the House, to stand up and face the situation squarely. I say so because,  in my own interpretation, the situation which is now facing the country is one that is similarly facing the rest of the world.   As  I said sometimes, it is what we may call  a political  and economic war. Sir,  the  situation we have  in this country is  brought  about  by outside forces.   That being so, we must unite in order to fight it.   Let me say that energy is something which serves the developed countries when they want to squeeze the developing countries.   They normally begin with oil.   The situatio is such that developed countries begin to quarrel  and the developing countries are affected because the developed countries want to see them disintegrating. I  say so because right now in the Middle East,  Iraq has a problem. The developed   countries have all come together.   This is what I sometimes refer to as hypocrisy.   They have come together to apply economic sanctions. In other words,  they have put embargoes so that .any oil coming from that country cannot have any market at all.   Of course, Kenya gets oil from that source. So,  these countries, which have applied economic sanctions are hypocrites because when  _ African countries have been trying to seek economic sanctions against South Africa,  or any other country, the developed countries,  especially the Western ones, have always said that economic sanctions are not the answer and that they cannot improve any situation. Therefore,  whatever we do, we must make sure that food production is given the  first priority so that we can be able to match forward majestically without any problems.  At  the moment,  we are already experiencing the problem of energy crisis which  is affect  our foreign exchange and if we are not  able to produce  enough food for our people,  we  shall not be able to stand in this House and  talk about patriotism in this country. In order to  step up food production  in this country,  we must create certain incentives to farmers.   Perhaps we could give them a subsidity in fertilizers so that they are  able to produce  enough food for this country. I am  saying this because at the rate things are now going,  farmers are going to find it  increasingly difficult to produce food. I am sure hon.  Members here will agree with me when I say that  farmers,  whether in Mericho, Uasin Gishu,  western Province, Muranglator Othaya cannot move. These farmers are finding it very difficult to by inputs for food production.  For example,  a tractor which used to cost Shs.250,000/-or Shs.350,000/- is now costing Shs.650,000/- Similarly,a plough which used to  cost Shs.28,000 is now costing  Shs.55,000/- No one  should tell us that we  Should now go back to using oxen for ploughing as we used to do  in the past. We, cannot  do this,  particularly with the large scale farming. If we go back   to  the  old methods of  ploughing,  shall   weable to produce  enough  to  feed  the peolnle  in  towns  and elsewhere? Therefore we must have these tractors and ploughs.  We must also have the fertilizers but unless  something is done to  subsidize these things,  farmers are going to be  strangled. Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  what  I am  seeing in my constituency is that  the peoplehave   completed harvesting, but nobody is ploughing their land. This is because the price of diesel has gone very high while the repair of tractors cannot be afforded due to the high increase in  the price  of spare parts. Now the a farmers are just  waiting helplessly and something must be done immediately to assist them.  I am personally a very worried man as I  speak here in this   House because I know without food,  there  is  nothing we can  do to keep our people alive and we shall be deceiving ourselves by coming to this  House to talk about other things, because without food, nobody is going to listen to what we are saying. If we had enough food,  we would be able  to avoid some of the doreign doncrs who want to give us loans with  some  strings attached to these loans. If we had enough to feed our people  and to export,  we would be able to have enough foreign exchange in which case we would be able to  tell these people off. However,  if we do not have  enough food,  these people will come and say,  "We would like to give you so many bags of maize",  but unfortunately,  this would not he white maize, but yellow maize.They will also  say that they want to give us wheat   but theunfortunate thing is that  they will be doing these things with a lot of strings attached to them,  but we shall have no choice but to accept  since we do not have  the food. If  today, your family had nothing  to  eat and then somebody comes around and offers you something to feed your family,  you would always accent his assistance. However,  Perhaps  this person will come up with Certain conditions before he can give you the assistance. He may even say that  he would like you to give him accommodation in your house and I think this would just be asking for too much,  and I do not think any man worth of his own salt would accept such a conditicn. Mr.Speaker,  Sir,  I am giving this example because  this is likely to haPpen if we do  not assist our farmers to produce enough food to feed our people  in this country. I  know foreign donor will  continue  to pester us when they  discover we  do not have  enough food to feed ourselves.  These people will come here  and  set conditions for us before  they can give us  food. Th ey  will first of all talk to the Vice-President because he is also the Minister for finance and tell  him,  "Your Excellency  the Vice-President,  before  we give your pecple  this wheat,  maize or rice,  first  of all, you Should allow my sons to settle in Kenya and assist  then to get  employment". I know  this means a 1ot an d  I know   His Excellency  the Vice-President would not  accept such  a condition. however,  what  would be  the consequence?   Our people  are going  to perish  since we do not  have  the food to feed them. Mr.  Speaker,  sir,  I am saying this because there are certain countries which use food as a weapon to fight other weaker countries and we know these things are happening in the world today. These countries do not useweapons   that kill immediately, but they use their food policy to,conquer other countries.  In fact,  if you adopt a food policy and stick toit,  you can rule this world throughout without any problem at all. You willnot need to use tankers or machine guns; you just need to approach countries where people are dying due to famine and talk to the leaders and they will accept your assistance. However, before you can give them the food, you wi ll give them conditions that they must accept, and they will perhaps have no choice cut  to accept the conditions. Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  let us in Kenya not make that mistake. We  should start now and maximize our food production by giving incentives to farmers so that   they can grow more and more food.We do not want what has beenhappening in other countries happening here in Kenya.As the Vice-Presidentand the Minister for Finance said, what was written in the Press today, Should  be a warning to us.   Somebody comes up and says,  "Unless you accept theseconditions,  we are not going to give you aid". I think the time that Africancountries will  stop kneeling for meagre foreign donors, then theywill be able to keep their dignity and sovereignty.Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it is very shameful to see certain things happeningin a democratic country where there is a very enlightened leadership.Today,the 25 million people in this country are proud of their sovereignty forafter fighting for their independence and having established a democraticsystem with its on institution. However,  having achieved all this,  thenwe  find somebody coming and telling us,  “Unless you change your politicalstand,  we are not going to withdraw our aid". ,   Let  it be  known that whatever is  in  this country  has passed through  this   _ .,. . House  and  the  House  has  legisiated,on  it just as much  as  the House  of Commons  in Britain  and  the  Congress  in the  United States  of America  does. We  do not  question their  laws  or  systems  although  when you  study  the  matter  carefully,  you  find  that some  of  the  things  done  there  are  not  acceptable  to  this  country. The  House  of Commons  passes  laws  in  order to  ensure  a  firm and effective  Government  in the United  Kingdom.People  there  fight  day  and night and people  die  like  rats.Thisis  something  that  does not occur  in  this  country.However,  we have nevercriticised this  country's  laws. Instead,  we  defend  them.Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,   it  is  not  long  ago  when  the  United  States  of America  invaded  Grenada and  its bishop  was  killed.  Grenada is  an  independent state,  and  it  is  not  long  since  its  President was  hooked up.If  Kenya had  donethat,  where  would we  now be? I  wish  everybody  had  the  same  feelings  as  I  do.The  moment one  rises  above  our  system  in  order to give  us  aid,  we  should tell him,   "To  hell  with your  aid.  Go  away."  I  am  sorry  to  His  Excellency  the  Vice-President and Minister  for Finance,  who works hard to balance his Budget,  but this  had better  be  done  in  our  own  poverty  rather  than with  aid  in  which we  are told  to  match  left,  right,  forwards  and backwards. We  are  not  prepared to  do  that. The  other  thing I  would  like  to say is  that with our economy, Kenyans  are  obviously going to suffer most because we have been used to certain standards  of living. Some-African countries have not been used to similarstandards  of  living,  and they will  not  feel  the pinch as much as we will. So,we  should go out and tell our people  it is  because our standards of living have been  so  high  that we  are  going to  feel  the  pinch more. I  say  so because  when you look  at  our  foreign  exchange  rates, you find  that in  order to get a dollar for the purchase  of crude  oil,  we need about Shs.23/- or Shs.24/-. In  Uganda,  you need  about Shs.340/-  to  the  dollar,  whereas  in Tanzania you need about Shs.170/-. So,  our  foreign  exchange  rate  is  higher,  and it is because of this  that our people are  going  to  feel  the  pinch. Our  people  have  to accept to  tighten  their belts  in order  to  survive.   Lastly,  Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  I  would like  to mention another  epidemic that has  come  about which people  may  be  taking lightly. This  disease  started  in His  Excellency  the  Vice-President  and  Minister  for Finance's  constituency  and  is destroying our  trees. We  want  our  researchers  to go  deep  into  finding the  case  ofthis  disease  and  how  to  control  it. I  am  told  that  in  order  to  control  it,  wehave  to use  aerial  spray  or get  an  animal  from overseas  which will eat up the insects  that  spread  this  disease. One  is  left  to wonder whether  somebody brought this  disease  here  or not? This  matter  is  interesting  and we  should not  treat  itlightly. We  are  fighting  invisible  forces  in  this  world,  and we  must  be  verycareful. If all  our  trees  are  destroyed,_ what will come next? Therefore,  I  appeal__ to  the  Government  to  go  very  deep  into  the  matter  and  find  out  how  this  disease came  about. We  never  used  to have  this  kind of  disease  in  the  country. We  have several  foreigners here  trying  to help us  to plant trees,  and we  accept what they are  doing,  but who would know who  is  feeding you with  one  and  taking that food out  with  the  other hand? With  these  few  remarks,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  beg to  support. </Newspeech> <Newspeech> THE  ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR  INFORMATION  AND BROADCASTING  (Mr.  Nassir): Bw.

MALEBE: Thank you,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  for givingme this. opportunity to contribute to this Bill.First of  all,  I  will  congratulate the  Vice-President  and Minister for Finance for having tabled this very  important Bill. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  we know that this  is a time of difficulties because of the scarcity  in fordign-exchanged. Since we understand thd problem of darning foreign  exchange today,  it is a pointer to the Government  officers entrusted with the control of public funds.   The controlling of public funds should be a prerequisite to our development.   we have officers sho should by now under stand the implications of misuse or misappropriation of public funds. This has been of the past, and today wherever these officers are, should know that the year 1990/91 is a very difficult one for this country.   We know that there is the Gulf crisis and that the cost of oil is going up every day.   As I understood it from previous speakers,  the price of fuel will go up soon again. This is going to make things even more difficult, and I wonder whether our budget will at all be realistic.  We had budgeted for this fiscal year but, due to these increases in oil   prices, our budget is not going to be either effective or realistic.   The value of our money is depreciating every day and even thd cost of the various development projects will rise.   If we had budgeted for a certain project to be completed within the year,  it will of be finalised by the end of June, 1991.That is why,  Sir,  I feel that our project implementors should be careful   not to misuse funds.   The Treasury too, must work very fast and release funds  to the district development committees because if the funds ar not released to the committees the money will become expensive and when it is released it will not be able to procure the required materials for   projects.   So,  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I would like to request the Treasury to release the funds to the district development committees immediately so that the on-going projects can be completed and new ones commenced and completed within this fiscal year. Due to the economic crisis we are facing,  arising from the Gulf conflict, we must also conserve our fuel. I find vehicles moving more than is necessary during week-ends.   The same applies during working days so that the traffic in the City is too much.   We should now find a method of encouraging a family to be using one car,  instead of using two or three cars at a time.   This will  be one useful way of conserving our little fuel.  Another way of conserving this fuel, which is very expensive, will be to limit the opening hours of the petrol  stations.   These stations can be made to operate only during the day and close operations at night.  By so doing we shall  be able to reduce the high fuel  consumption we are currently having.   At the same time, we could restrict the services of the petrol stations during the week-ends so that people can do more useful work in their shambas,  for example,  and avoid leisure rides in their vehicles. This is a period within which Kenyans must realise that they must reflect on their domestic salvation.   The people must be requested to go back and cultivate the land,  do livestock husbandry and all  sorts of farm activities.  Due to this Gulf Crisis, we should be able to explain to everybody through chiefs  barazas and so on that there are problems that the country is really faced with.   We are facing this economic crisis because our main foreign exchange earner, coffee or tea, is not fetching much to be able to maintain our high standards.   Coffee farmers now, due to lack of payments, are unable to cultivate their coffee plantations and, sometimes, they even ignore harvesting their coffee crop.   This is because they are not being paid for their produce. I would urge the Government,  since there is a Presidential  Commission on coffee industry, to ensure that the said Commission  finalises  its report on time. Let us know exactly what to do with out coffee plants.   Mwananchi  is now being forced to uproot the coffee trees and plant other crops like maize and beans which he considers better since,  if he cannot sell  them,  he can consume them. This is one area which should be looked into very seriously because farmers are now moving away from growing cash crops and opting to grow food crops due to non-payment for produce delivered, especially indigenous cash crops  like coffee.  Most of them are now uprooting the coffee trees.   This is Where we should introduce the-seriousness that is required-in agriculture. I would like to urge the Minister for Agriculture to grow the indigenous food crops  like bananas,  in the face of non-payment for coffee produce delivered. Bananas do not require fertiliser, which has to be procured with foreign exchange and,  if we can get the Ministry of Agriculture to encourage our farmers to start concentrating on banana growth,  we will  be able to feed the nation from that crop alone.   From the same banana crop, we can be able to start small wine industries which will  be earning the country a lot of income. We should also think of opening up those areas that are arable and under utilised so that we can produce more foodstuffs to feed the nation. The other point  I would like to touch on is on promoting tourism.  I believe we should promote our tourism through the improvement of our tourist roads and regular maintenance so that we can have more tourists coming in to visit our country. In that way we shall  earn more foreign exchange. In order to achieve this,  the Ministry should,  also, have incentives that will  attract more tourists, especially at this time when we have an economic crisis.   The more tourists we get,  the more we will  earn.   At the same time, we should also conserve our wild life and national  parks to ensure that those tourists have something to come and enjoy. In so doing we shall  have more tourists and,  in . the end,  we shall  be able to minimise our balance of payments.  The other thing  I would like to touch on is on the release of funds.   As  I mentioned earlier on,  the Treasury should release funds immediately so that projects can be completed. In particular, we should be very cautious on our funds because most of the voted amounts is for the payment of already accrued debts. This is something which should be looked at seriously because there are some contractors who have never been paid,  although they have completed their contracts. If they are paid,  then it will  encourage those same contractors to go on and complete other projects. Let me also touch on tenders. I know that at this time moneywill  be availed to our Ministries. I would like to request that the fundsbe sent to the district development committees so that tenders are awarded to those within the districts. This is because when you have contractors in the districts being awarded tenders,  less money is normally spent. At the same time,  since there could be nscrupulous firms that may apply for tenders,  get money and disappear,  it would be easier for the relevant district development committees to track down the local contractor who has disappeared, as they will have come from the local areas. As a matter of policy, we should stick to the indigenous contractors within the relevant areas to allow for ease of supervision.  When you award tenders to some contractors from far outside the relevant districts, when they receive payments and disappear, they cannot be easily traced.  On the issue of foreign exchange, we have some foreign joint ventures in which some investors would like to bring in some agricultural equipment into this country. Others may wish to import other things like mining equipment.   Where foreign exchange is not required, these investors of agricultural or mining equipment should be able to receive their letters of release quickly.   This is because there is no foreign exchange required. The sooner they have the letters of release the better so that we can also  venture into the various unexplored disciplines,  like mining,  and also earn more foreign exchange for this country. The issue of Government officers travelling to the various parts of the country is important.  This will  assist them in knowing the problems facing the wananchi  first-hand.   We have heard that some Ministers,  Assistant Ministers,  Permanent Secretaries and heads of some parastatal  bodies just sit in their offices. You may be surprised to ask a Permanent Secretary, or a Minister for that matter, where Igembe area, or the Igembe Constituency,  is and find out that he does not know.     Mr.Temporary Detuty Speaker,  Sir,  the  idea of Ministersand  chief executives  of  state  corporations and permanent secretaries  of that sitting in offices should cease  forthwith.  They Should travel around  the  country to  see  the  Problems  facing the  country and monitor project progress in various  places. If  they do  not  do  not do this, they will be misled by their  field  officers  just in the  same way Ministers have been given  wrong answers  to Parliamentary Questions  and they have  to  ask for more  time  to  get  the right  information. If an  officer forms  the habits of giving wrong  answers to Parliamentary Questions, then the Minister  should  tour the  part  of the  country covered by that officer  and  see  for himself the  problems affecting it. I  am  sure  there  are  Government  officers who have  a habit of misleading the  headcuarters. For  example, in  Igembe  we havewaited for  title  deeds for  the  last 25  years  land  adjudicationin  that  area started in 1965. I wonder  what  the  Ministry  of Landsand  Housing is doing. We have  continued to  wait  for title  deedsfor  all  these  years  and yet we have  officers  stationed in  Igembe who  are  supposed to report  their monthly performarce  and  progress  to theMinistry’s headquarters on a continuous  basis. Why  can  the Ministrysee  that  somebody  somewhere  is  asleep? Either  the  officer  concernedhas been  giving false  information regarding his  performance  or something is  wrong somewhere. So, I urge  the Ministry of Lands  and Settlement to find out what the problems in lands adjudication are. Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  from experience  I have also  come  to realise  that  keeping an  of ficer in  one  station for over  five  years makes  him inefficient. An  officer  should be  in  astation for up to three  years.In  land  adjudication  we have  thatprooblem of keeping officers  in  one station  for a long time, particiaarly in Meru District  where  some  officers have been intheir  stations  for Few Years,but you cannot see what they have  done. So,  in  orderTo accelerate land  adjudication in Meru District in general and inIgembe  in  Particular,  there must an  overhaul of the adjudication officers  in  that area.. This will  bring in  new enthusiastic bloodthat  will  help wananchi. Meru District  also has  numerousland  cases  because,  again,  one  officer has been stationed there for 10 years. I  think the  adjudication  officers have  a feeling that if they complete  the  land  adjudication they will have no more work to  do. So,  they work  slowly  so  that they can be  assured of jobs inthe Civil  Service. So,  the Minister  for Tends  and SettDmentshould  look into  thCse Problems in land adjudication.I  am happythat  a Bill. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONALCO-OPERATION (Mr.  Munyi):On  a point  of  information,  Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir. I want  to inform  my good friend,hon. Malebe,  that we  have  no Ministry of Lands  and  Settlement,  but have  a Kinistry of Lands,  Housing and Physical Planning. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MALEBE: Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I thankthe  hon.  Member  for  that  information. But  since  the  Departmentof  Settlement  is  in  that Ministry,  I  am  sure  that  I  am not very wrong. The  other  issue  I  would  like  to  raise regards  the distribution  of road maintenance  equipment. We  all know how bad our roads  are  and that  all our  agricultural is produce has to be transported  on  these  same roads.Although the Ministry uses washing away  of roads  by rains  an  excuse for  not maintaining roads  properly, I  am sure  if it formulated a policy  of  distributing road maintenance  equipment  on the  basis  of area population,  I am sure "Meru Province"  would have  enough  equipment. As  of now,  “Meru Province"  does not have  ever  a tipper. </Newspeech><Newspeech>DR.MISOI: On  a  point  of  order,  Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker,Sir.  I have  never heard of  "Meru Province"  in my life. Is  the  hon. Member to talk of a "Meru Province". </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MALEBE: Temporary Deputy SPeaker,  Sir,  "MeruProvince" is  in the making and  I am sure I meant that the large Meru District.So,  you find that Meru District has very many roads, butonly very few are  tarmacked. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MANG’OLI: 0n a point  of  order, Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is  the hon.Member  in  order  in  insisting that“Meru Province"  is in the making when there  is no  such a thing? Canhe  withdraw the  words  "Meru Province"?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MALEBE:  Mr. Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I do  not think that hon. Mang’oli understood my English:  I meant  that  the larger Meru District  would be. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MANG’OLI: On  a point  of order,  Mr.  Temporary DeputySpeaker,  Sir.It  seems  the hon.  thinks  that  we  are  doing drillingwork. He  said that  "Meru Province  is  in  the  making",  which means creation  of the  province  is  in  the  process,  but  we  know that  there is  nothing like  that  on record. So,  which language  is he  sayinghon.Mang’oli  is  not understanding? Is there. Meru English,  which I  cannot understand?  Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir, there is no Meru English, but what I was saying is that Meru District is so large that it deserves to be changed  into Meru Province. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  coming back to the road maitenance  equipment,  I would like to say that if the Ministry of Public   works would be able to distribute the road maitenance equipment as and vheicles by population,  this would assist us a Great deal. I am saying this because the population of a given district and the kilometres of untarmacked roads, should be taken into consideration. In Meru District,  for example, we have many areas where there are no roads. This is the case particularly in Igembe constituency which is my constituency. This  area is classified within the security zone due to the fact that this area is borderings the national 7 park. For this reason,  we require new roads to be opened up in this areabecause  I am sure there is enough money in the minor-road programme whichwould be used. This would mean that  if there  is a security problem withinIgembe,  Tharaka or Ntonyiri, which borders Isiolo District, then the policewould be able  to act quicly and arrest the situation. I am saying this becausewe cannot be able  to improve security in the lower areas of Meru,unless we have new reads opened Up in this area.Therefore, Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir, Meru District wouldresquire more  than ten Graders,  five tippers, which means we shall have atipper per division and rollers to assist in the construction of these roads.If we have to equally distribute cur development efforts within the country,we must come up with a new policy of trying to distribute the developmentlands by potulation as well as by considering the infrastructuresthat might or might not be existing in each district. In particular,  wemust make sure that there is a urban/rural balance of population   by tryingto establish more  and more factories in the rural areas.In fact, thereare factories which could be started in the rural areas and create employmentopportunities for our people out  here. As hon.Nassir said, we have a lot  grauates who are unemtioed and we are now going to have very many  8-4-4 school leavers unemployed this year.  Therefore,  if we could establish small-scale industries in  the rural areas,  we would be able to absorb these people in employment within the  rural area. In particular,  we should be able  to concentrateon one factory per division. The  funds that are issued under the rural development programmes,  should be able to put up small-scale industries per division. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  in Asian countries, particularly in India, you find small-scale factories in people's backyards and these factories are run by the families themselves.You may find a small-scale cosmetic factorbehind  somebody's house just to creat employment for the  family. Similarly,we in Kenya would be able to set up these  smallscale industries in therural  areas to create employment opportunities for our people. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  the other problem that I would like  to address myself to is the issue of tied loans. We have had problems from donors because  they come here and give us conditions which seem to imply a policy of give and take. This  is why you find that most of the foreign donors in this country,  repatriate 30 per cent of the loans they give to us into  their country. These people come here and sort of dictate to us onwhat  to do before they can give us the loans. This is where the Ministryof finance  should heep away from the idea of receiving tied loans. I am saying this because once a loan is tied, definitely, the donor then becomes your master and will dictate to you what he wants. At  the  sametime,  you wi11 find that some of the clauses in the agreements for theseloane,  are normally entered into between the donors and the Treasury. However,you will  find that the implementing Ministry is not  invited at the panel  whichsigns the bilateral agreement. This is why you find an infrux ofexpatriates in this country as a result of which we have a lot of imported vehicles coming into  this country using the same money. This is why  I said that  nearly 80 per cent of the donor money finds its way back to the donor country. We must  therefore reconsider the whole position of these tied loans because  they do not  seem to assist us in any way.  - Furthermore, Mr.Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  we have countries the world today;  with whom we have never entered into any trade agreements. For an example,  we could easily get loans from countries like Thailand,  Korea,and  other countries in the far fast, Without any strins attached to them.These countries started their development in the same way we have started and and they are today getting about 93 unemployment relief. For this reason,  I feel  that if we use their past exerience,  I am sure we would be able to make tremendous Progress in our development. If we did this,  we would be able to solve  our unemployment problems in this country. Finally,  Mr. Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sirl.I would like to request the  Ministry of Energy to look into the issue of oil exploration in this country. The only way we can come out of this fuel crisis is by concentrating in oil exploration and by trying to understand the attitude of theforeign oil  exploration company which has been exploring oil in Northen Kenya. I am saying  this because this foreign company has brought aid money here and they are  just pumping this money into the ground and yielding nothing. When this money is finished,  they will find they are not benefiting any more from us and then they will pack up and go. So,  we must be able  to monitor foreign oil  exploration companies to find out whether they are really doing a genuine  job or not . I am saying this because oil exploration has been going on in this country since 1965 and up to this day,  no oil company has told us that they have found any oil. I am  sure when  they are just  about to  strike the oil,  they Possibly block the hole and say,  "The oil deposits here are just to uneconomic  to extract". So,  we must be able to monitor the activities of these companies and I think the time has now come when we ought really  to have our own  local  experts attached to these, companies so that they can  interprete the oil  data to us.  At the moment most of the oil data from Kenya is being interpreted in America and when they find, some positive results in this data,  they may as well report to us and say that they were negative. So,  we  must be  able  to monitor oil-exploration companies and give them a target of the  period within which  they  should discover oil. After  that  period,  they  should call  it  a  day;  otherwise,  they will  continue  to go round and round expecting to strike  oil  any  day. In  conclusion,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I wish  to thank the Mover  of  the  Bill  for  having brought  it up. I  beg  to  support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MIRUKA-OWUOR: Thank you very  much,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,Sir,  for  giving  an  an  opportunity  to  join my  colleagues  firstly  in  congratulating His  Excellency  the  Vice-President  and  Minister  for  Finance,  on having bringing this Bill  here. Secondly,   I  also  wish  to  join  my  colleagues  in  commending the Vice- ._  President  and Minister for Finance  for  the  competent way  in which he has managed the  finances  of this  country  in  the  face  of many problems  in the  international economic  situation. He  has  steered the  country  competently  for many years.  There  are  only  one  or  two  observations  that  I  would like  to make  on the  Bill. First  of  all,  I  would  like  to  comment  on  the  control,  management  andadministration  of Government  finances. We  appreciate  that  at present,  we  arefacing  a  difficult  situation  arising  out  of the  Gulf crisis,  which has  pushed oil prices  upwards,  thereby  causing  untold  difficulties  in  the  management  of the economy. This  crisis  notwithstanding,  I  would  like  to  tell  the hon.  Vice-President  and  Minister  for  Finance  that  there  is  a  feature  that  has  been  taking root  in  his  budgetary  control  even  before  the  Gulf  crisis  started. There  have been  frequent  increases  in the prices  of consumer goods nearly  every month by very big  amounts. This  puts  the  ordinary  mwananchi  into  a  lot  of difficulties  anddestablises  them. So,  I  appeal  to  the  Vice-President  and Minister  for Finance  toconsider removing  this  question  of price  increases  after  the  Budget  in future. He  has very  competent  economists,  such as hon.  Keah. Why  is  it  not  possible  to  anticipatd  some  problems  so  as  to  take  care  of them  in  the  Budget and  avoid frequent  increases  in  the prices  of consumer goods?  Such. increases  make  wananchi face  a  lot  of difficulties,  consdering the  other burdens  they bear. Transportcharges  and  the  prices  of sugarand  soap  are  always  being  increased. When  the  Vice-President  and  Minister  for Finance  comes  to present his  Budget  in  future, he  should  anticipate  the  necessity  of  the  prices  to  increase  so  that once  presented, the  Budget  carries  us  through  the  year;  otherwise,  as-one  hon.  Member  said before, the  meaning  of  the  Budget will  get  lost before  the year  ends,  a situation  that  can be  avoided. Apart  from  that,  we  appreciate  the  problems  brought  about  by  the Gulf crisis,  which  have  reduced  the  value  of the  money  we  have.  I  appeal  to  the Vice-President  and Minister  for Finance  to  see  that  the  money  we  have,  little  as  it is,  is  properly  administered. It  often  happens  that  in-the-course  of  the  year,hospitals  run  out  of medicine,  and  this  should  not happen at  all. Many  Governmentdepartments  cannot  operate  because  they  say  that  they  do not  have  fuel. Agricultural  estension  officers,  for  instance,  cannot go round visiting wananchi because  they  do  not  have  fuel  for their vehicles. The  police have  occasionallybeen  unable  to  assist  the  public  because  they  say  they  do not have  fuel. Even  inthe  court,  you  sometimes  find  that  the  magistrate  lacks  stationery  in the  course of  the  year.  This  situation  falls  under  the  administration  of funds.  Funds  should be  spread out  so  that  services  run  smoothly  throughout  the  year. There  is  another  element  regarding  the  maintenance  of  Government buildings.  Our  Government has  done  very  well  in putting up very prestigious buildings,  but you  will  find  that  some  of them re not maintained  in a proper way  as they  should be. I  do not know  whether funds are  allocated for  this work or not, but  I  think  this  is  a matter  that  requires  attention. In  the  Vote  of  the  Office  of the  President,  there  is provision for disaster  relief. I  happen  to  come  from  an  area  that  is  prone  to  disaster  everyyear  due  to  flooding. I  have  said  to  the  Government  on  several  occasions  thatthere  are  times  when  the  causes  of  flooding can  be  removed. It  is  a  question  ofopening up  the mouths  of rivers,  which work would require-the use of a little amount of money.  This  work  can  be  done  at  a  time  like  this  when there  is  drought. We  should not wait until people are confronted with floods before relief is taken to  them.   . You  must  have  read of an  incident where  somebody who threw some toxic  chemical  into Lake  Victoria. Consequently  fish  are now  dying  in  the  lake  asis  the  vegetation  there. The  water  in  this  lake  is used  for  human  consumption andvery  soon  there  will be  an  epidemic which might kill people. Luckily,  the, MinisterforHealth  is  here,  although he  engaged in  a conversation with hon.  Thuo.   The Ministry  of Health  should  have  taken  some  emergency  action. I  cannot  understandwhy  this  person  chose  to  dump  a  toxic  chemical  in  the  lake. Since  it  has  beenseen  that  this  action  is  causing  death  to  life  in the  lake,  the Ministry  should move in  and  act  quickly. We  do  not have  to  wait until  there.is  an  epidemic  and  then spend  huge  amounts  of money  to  save  the  people. With regard to  flooding,  Kisumu District Development Committee  proposed  that,  because  during  the  time  of floods,  the  affected people  and villages are  cut  off  from  the  rest  of the  world,  some  bridges  be  built  to  connect  the affected  people  with  the  rest  of the world so  that in  the  event of floods  the people  can  escape. In  this  case,  the  Government would not have to  send relief foodto  them. The  construction  of  such bridges  would  be  very  cheap. Some  would  costabout  Shs.50,000/- or  Shs.100,000/-.  When  there  is  drought,  as is  the  case  now, these  bridges  should  be built.  Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I  say this because it  is not necessary to wait  until an epidemic  occurs  so that wemay  spend  the  funds. There is money provided to the Lake BasinDevelopment   Authority to  serve  a certain area in WesternKernra;   People  who do  not  come  from Western Kenya think that  theL.B.D.A.  is  not working well  but  I would like  to assure them thattrle  L.B.D.A.  is working very well; It as several projects invarious places  in Western Kenya but  it  is handicapped due to lackof  finance. I would  appeal to  the  Minister to consider makingfunds  available  to the L.B.D.A.  to it  a viable authority.I would  also like  to mention the necessity  to produce more food  in this  country with a view to making the  country self-reliant  in food production. This is  one way  of combating the problem facing us now,  namely  adverse world economic situations. Our  people  should be  encouraged to grow more  food and  our people  are  always ready to work harder to produce more food. But  there  are  certain frustrating  problems that  should belooked  into. I will  cite  the Miwani  Sugar Factory. Peoplein Miwani  are  in dire  need  of help.  We have appealed to the Government  to revive Lawani  Sugar Mills  so that  it can start to  crush  sugar-cane.  It is not good to make empty promises to  the  people,  that Miwani  Sugar hills will be revived when  in fact nothing is  being done; I  say  this  because people there have  spent  thousands upon thousands of shillings to grow sugar-cane  but  this  sugar-cane is now rotting in the plantations; all over Kisumu District  and Nandi District. Instead  of importing sugar we should  be producing our own sugar.   Currently,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir, there is talk about reviving Miwani Sugar Factory but nothing has been done so  far  and people  there  continue to suffer.  What  I  am saying is that agriculture  is the mainstay of the this country’ s  economy  andtherefore  efforts  should be made to expand agriculture. We must  also  congratulate His Excellency the President for creating the  Ministry  or Reclamation and Developmentof Arid,  Semi-Arid and Wastelands.We should expandagriculture through irrigation system. But the  wananchiwho produce  crops like rice,   coffee and so on need help.They  should be provided with all-weather roads that will enable them to reach their  farms and to take their produce to the markets. They should be  given soft  loans. We have horticultural products which also  earn this country a lot  of foreign exchange for this country. But  today we read  in the papers that there  is a transportation problem facing those who produce this  crop. The  foreign airlines discriminate  against  African producers and the  Kenya Airways is inefficient;  goods  get lost  or get  damaged while  in transit; So, these  are  the  things which discourage our people from putting more efforts in agricultural production. As  often as possible  increases in the  producer prices  of horticultural  crops  and  other  crops  should be  made  in order to  encourage  our people  to produce  more.      Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  many contributors have urgdd the Minister  to make sure that once development funds are allocated they should be taken to the district with speed. I  think this  is  important because,  otherwise:, the value of the project appreciates,  the money becomes insufficient and,  consequently,  you cannot implement the intended plan. Thiis something which should be given much attention,  and  those officers charged with project implementation should move fast with a view to avoiding the ever-increasing inflation. Sir,  as  I have pointed out,  the problem arises  in the administration of Government fus. At the moment many schools are complaining because they havenot been given the trants for this year. I do not know where the problem is,but  in Western Kenya there are may schools which have not go their grants. Ido not know whether that is also due to the Gulf crisis,  but it is causing difficulties. Thdse are matters which should be attended to to save the situation Where the people end up complaining. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  the process of land adjudication and  land registration has been very slow in Nyanza Province, with the result that the people are unable to benefit from the loans made available by the Government for development. This  is something which requires urgent attention so that the people can be able to obtain loans,  develop their land and help in strengthening the economy of the country. Otherwise,  as I said,  the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance has done well in spite of the difficulties facing the. world. However,  it should tighten its belt in control, manageement and administration of public funds to the better interest of the wananchi. With those few remarks, Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I bdg to support the Bill. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION (Mr.  Munyi): Thank you,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me thisopportunity to comment on this very important Bill. As His Excellency the  Vice-President and Minister for Finance has exaplained some of thd points which have  also  been touched  on by hon.  Members,  I would like to appeal to the various Ministries,  espeically the Minisry of Public Works, to take-action and release all  funds which are due to the district development committees. There are funds which were given to the Ministry of Public Works so that they could be used to repair  impassable roads. Last week  I  went personally  to the Ministry  of Public Works because   therd wdrd  somd which were allocatdd for some roads in Embu, and I found that the  funds  had  not been released to be used in thd district.  Therefore,  I  would like  to  appeal  to  the various  Ministries  to ensure that  funds are sent to the respective districts so that they can bd put to the proper use.  Moving away from that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,  I would like to mention something which was touched on by hon. Malebe, on land adjudication.Although he mentioned the problems they have in Meru,  I would like to inform the Minister for Lands and Housing that in the lower parts of Embu, there are areas  I used to represent where the people do not have any title deeds.   A promise had been made that the land owners there would be issued with those title deeds but, to-date, they have not been issued.  All matters connected to land are very sensitive.  Even-in the daily newspapers, you see the number of people who are injured, and some killed because of land disputes. If you leave an area to stay for so long without land adjudication so as to issue title deeds to the owners of the land, there will  be more serious cases of injuries and deaths.   This applies to all  such areas, be they in Kwale, Kisii, Embu and so on. If action is not taken now,  it will  become more difficult to adjudicate on land where there are disputes. The Minister should see to it that those who had been charged with the adjudication exercise,  since they have just been sitting and doing nothing, should be removed and we have a fresh team of officers who will  be capable and who will complete the good work that wananchi  are very keen about.   Some of the officers who are there now have involved themselves in the affairs they are supposed to adjudicate over so that they have already allocated some land to some people so that they can also be given some pieces of the sarae land.   This is very wrong.  All such offiCers should stand up and be counted as Nyayo followers by being mindful of the welfare of other wananchi.   This is because there are very many land owners who want to get their title deeds in order to secure bank loans but, without such title deeds, they cannot be granted any loans.   Sir,  I would now like to turn to another very important matter connected with tourism industry. I must take this opportunity to thank His Excellency the President for the action he has already taken while in Tokyo,  Japan on a state visit.   We have been told that His Excellency the President announced that Kenya Airways Corporation will  now be operating a flight from Nairobi  to Bangkok so that the tourists from Japah,  Korea and other Far East countries will  now be connecting to the Kenyan flights at Bangkok.   This is because we have been having that problem of tourists from the Far East not being able to easily connect to our country.  However, that problem has been solved by our great President.   His Excellency the President knows the problems that people,  and the whole world is facing. As a result he has directed that Kenya Airways will  start flights from Bombay to Bangkok.   From Bangkok, the travellers can use Japan Airlines to travel  from Bangkok to Hong Kong and so on.   Ths now means that with the new extension of flights,  all  the tourists from the Far East will  only be using different flights to connect with Kenya Airways flights which will be reaching Bangkok.  it 1. 13 .11. 90With that arrangement I am sure that many tourists from Japan will be visiting our country because we have very many hotels, touristresorts  and attrations.Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir, we have small countries  like C:Fcrus whose Population is less one million people. Eventhough this small country has no tourist attration it receives more than  two million tourists in a year.  Given that Kenya is the most advanced country in the whole of black Africa, with Proper arrangements by Kenya Airways Corporation and publicity by our embassies abroad  I am  sure  that  we  can  achieve  a target of five millions  tourists in a year before  the  end  of this  century.  At  the  moment we  are  deriving about  Shs.7 billion from less than 700,000 tourist in a year.   This shows that if we achieve the target of five million                          tourists in a year,  we will receive a lot more  in foreignexchange  earnings.It is also good that we started the Nyayo Tea Zones.   I amhappy that  the  Chairman  of Nyayo  Tea Zones  Corporation,  hon.  Mahihu,is  here  he  has been very keen  on  the development o this  veryimportant  industry.

MWAMZANDI: Mr.   Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,  with  regard  tothe  chief  who  is  going  to  be  appointed  this  year;   I  would  like  toknow  whether  he  will  be  among  the  chiefs  who  are  going  to  beappointed  in  the  country  as  the  Ministry  had  promised sometimeback. Will  he  be  appointed  during  the  same  exercise? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.   KYALO: Mr.   Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,   the  appointmentof  assistant  chiefs  for  the  sub-locations mentioned  by  the  hon.Member  cannot  be  done  since  the  sub-locations  have  not  yet  beenestablished. However,   a  chief  will  be  appointed  during  the  nation-wide  exercise  referred  to  by  the  hon.  Member. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.   EKIDOR: Mr.   Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,   the  chiefs  andthe  assistant  chiefs  are  the  chairmen  of  locational  or  sub-locationaldevelopment  committes. Whey  you  delay  the  appointment  a  chief  or  an   assistant  chief,   do  you  not  think  that  you  are  delaying  thedevelopment  of  this  country?  Can  the  Minister  tell  the  House  why he  is  holding  back  the  development  of  this  country  by  delaying  the appointment  of  chiefs  and  assistant  chiefs? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.   KYALO:  Mr.   Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,   there  is  no  delay. The  location  was recently  created  and  steps  are  being  taken  to  fill the  post  and  a  chief  will  be  available  before  the  end  of  the  year. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR.   EKIDOR: Mr,   Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,   I  am  not  talking about  the  new  location  or  sub-locations  referred-to  in  the  Question because  they  are  not  the  only  ones  which  have  been  affected  in  the country.  For  example,   in  Turkana District,  chiefs  and  assistant chiefs  have  not  been  appointed  in  Various  locations  and  sub-locations, although  they  are  the  chairmen  of  locational  and  sub-locational development  committees. The Minister  has  refused  to  tell  the  House whey  he  is  holding  back  the  development  of this  country by  delaying the  appointment  of  chairmen  of  development  committees. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.   KYALO: Mr. Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,   that  is  a  differentquestion. If  he  is  asking  about  the  appointment  of  chiefs  all  overthe  country,   that  is  a  different  question. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.   FALANA:  Mr.   Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,   I  do  not  agree  that it  is  a  different  question, it  is  a  very  relevant  question.Does the  Minister  not  agree  that  chiefs  and  assistant  chiefs  are  chairmen of  locational  and  sub-locational  development  committee. Does  he, therefore,   not  agree  that  these  are  the  people  who  sit  in  development committee  meetings? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.   KYALO: Mr.   Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,   it  appears  as  ifthere  is  an  assumption  regarding  the  appointment  of  chiefs.

However,  will  he  tell  this  House. when  the assistant  chiefs  for  the  sub-locations  specified  in  the  Question  are going  to  be  appointed  since  they  are  the  main  instrument  of  all development  activities  in  their  areas  in  that  they  have  to  sit  in the  sub-locational  development  committees?

MWAMZANDI: Mr.   Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,   the  question  isspecific. A  plot  has  been  surrendered  by  Mr.  Kiplagat  for  theexpansion  of   Iten  Township but the  Assistant  Minister  is  saying  that is  not  the case. To  whom  does   the  plot that Mr.Kiplagat surrenderedbelong? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.   MUTISO: Mr.   Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,   there  are  variousinstitutions  which  actually  handle   lands  and  not necessarily  theMinistry  of  Lands  of  Housing. For   the benefit of  the  hon.Member,   I  would   like  to  give  him further  information  that  my Ministry  is  not  aware  of  the   surrender  of  the 10   acreplot  by  Mr. Kiplagat  Chepkiyeng  for  the  expansion  of  the  Iten Township.  No  records  are  available   in  the  Ministry  to  that  effect. The  Ministry  can  only  acquire   land  through  the  application,of  the Land  Acquisation  Act,   during  which  the  intended  acquisition  is gazetted   in  the  official  Kenya  Gazette  after  which  the   land  is valued  and  compensation  is  paid  in  the  normal  way.  What  must  have happened  in  this  particular  case,   is  that  the  Town  County  Council made   the  expansion  arrangements   locally  with  the  hope  that Mr.   Chepkiyeng, would  get  a  plot   in  one  of  the  settlement  schemes. This practice is   very  common   and  does  not  involve  the  Ministryat  all. Therefore,   Mr.   Deputy   Speaker,   Sir,   Mr.   Chepkiyengi, maybe advised  to  contact  the  district  commissioner, in  his  area  as  the chairman  of  the  district  plot  allocation  selection  committee  for possible   assistance. </Newspeech><Newspeech>DR.   MISOI: Mr.   Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,   it  appears  as  ifthis   Question  was directed  to  the  Ministry  of  Lands  and Housing hon.Mutiso was   not  competent  to  answer it. He  is saying that  this   gentleman   should  get   intouch  with   the   district  commissioner.  If  that  is  the  case,  Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  why  did  the  Assistant Minister  attempt  to  answer  a  Question  which  he  felt  did  not  fall under  his  ambit. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MUTISO:  Mr.   Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,   as  I  said,  when the  Question  was  directed  to  us,  we  looked  at  our  records  and  we did  not  find  anything  to  that  effect. Through  you,  Mr.   Deputy Speaker,   Sir,   I  would  like  to  advise  the  hon.  Member  to  check with  the  district  commissioner. This  is  a  local  affair  and  hecould  get  help  there. <Newspeech>MR.  MWAMZANDI: On a point  of order,  Mr. Deputy Spaker,  Sir.Eon.  Misoi's supplementary question is very relevant. The  hon.  AssistantMinister is asking the hon. Member to lock for the answer himself and this Shows that he was not competent to answer the Question.  The Assistant Minister could have  said earlier that that Question does not fall under his Ministry but  the Ministry of Local Government. I  suggest that this Question be deferred so that the Assistant Minister can look for a proper answer or it be transferred to the Ministry of Local Government. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MUTISO:   Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  it is not fair for thehon.  Member to say that the Sanistry of Lands And Housing is incompentent:We  are competent and we  shall continue answering Questions relevant to myMinistry. We have answered this Question according to the informationcontained in our records. Therefore,  those who directed this Question tomy Ministry are the ones who are wrong but not the Ministry. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MWAMANDI: On a point of order, Sir. The Assistant Ministerhas made another blunder here by saying that those who directed thiS'Questionto His Ministry are the ones who are wrong.

Why did he reply in the first place? </Newspeech><Newspeech> AN EON.  MEMBER: He  could have done  that  earlier instead of wasting a lot of time. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MUTISO:  Sir,  the reply I gave   indicated clearly that this Question ought not  to have been dealt with by the Ministry of Lands and Housing. I made  it very clear that  this matter can be checked with the district commissioner. But  if it  is the wish of the House  that we,  as a Ministry, redirect the Question to the Ministry of Local Government,  we shall  do So. </Newspeech><Newspeech>DR.

Now that the AssistantMinister has agreed to redirect this Question to the relevant Ministry,  canbe withdraw  the answer he gave because it is not adequate? <Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MUTISO:  Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  there  is nothing   to withdraw because I  have   indicated firmly that   this Question can best be handled by the Ministry of Local Government. <Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  FALANA:  On a point  of order,  Sir.  The Assistant Minister has purposely taken up the time of this House without leading us anywhere. Can he be told that from now henceforth he should mind the affairs of his Ministry and not to touch those matters which he may not handle adequately. Can he,  therefore, withdraw the reply he gave and apologise to the House? <Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER:   Mr.Mutiso, you said   in   your reply: "According to the  available records, my Ministry has never acquired and land for the expansion of Iten Township from Mr.  Kiplagat Chepkiyeng." Factually,  that does not  seem to be right because there is reference madeto a Minute of the Settlement Committee held at Iten Township.  This indeed was an attempt  to reply and on the face of it, it  appears misleading since you  have accepted that you would rather transfer the Question to the relevant Ministry. It would,  therefore,  be in order for you to withdraw this answer so that the relevant Ministry can give a proper answer. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO:  Mr.  Deputy Sneaker,  Sir,  the Minute quoted is   in reference to a county council meeting and if-</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order!  I  am positive hon.

Is the Assistant Minister in order to challenge the ruling of the  Chair? Why is he trying to raise a point  of argument with the Chair? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Mr.Mutiso, you have permission to complete your sentence. <Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO:  Sir,  that Minute refers to a acting of the iten County Council and the fact that there is reference to the effect that land was acquired,  it did not fall under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Lands and Housing but the Ministry of Local Government. That  is why I an saying  that if that  land was acquired,  then it was done through the Ministry of Local Government. <Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER:   Mr.  Mutiso,  the answer that you gave makes it  absolutely clear that there was no land aquired by the Ministry.

DEPUTY  SPEAKER: Order! I will  overrule Mr.  Bidu. Let us  haveMr.  Okondo's Question. </Newspeech>Question  No. 585<Header> Building of Osieku-Mabinzu Road </Header> MR.  OKONDO  asked  the Minister for Public Works whether,  since the feasibility  studies of the OsiekuMabinzu road have been completed,  he  could  indicate when  the said  road  is  likely  to be opened. <Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT  MINISTER FOR PUBLIC  WORKS  (Mr.  Maiyani):  Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I  beg to reply. The  feasibility  studies  for  the Osieko-Mabinzu road we're carried out by  the Ministry  to completion  in June,  1988,  but  it  is  regretted  that the Ministry is  not  in  a position to  indicate when the road  is  likely  to be opened because funds  are not  available. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  OKONDO: Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  it is  true that funds  are hardto  come by  for any  project that is of the first  incidence of this kind. But,surely,  we also have the National Youth Service which could bd used to open up this  kind  of road without too much commitments   This is an area where the National Youth Service could do  its work very satisfactorily without costing a lot of money  as  estimated  in the feasibility study. Could  the  Assistant Minister comment on  the point of using the National  Youth Service to open this road? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  MAIYANI: Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I appreciate thd suggestiononly if it could work. The reason why this road has not been done is that theestimated cost is about KShs.60 million. The Govdrnment is,  however,  puttingout fedlers to look for donors in order that we may be able to do some good job. As the hon.  Member is suggesting,  however,  we will explord thd possibility of the National Youth Service doing something there. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  OKONDO:  Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I am pleased with the Assistant Minister's reply that hd will  try to employ the National Youth Service,  and I would suggest that he goes ahead very quickly and consult theM so that we.can see what they can do.  In addition,  it is my opinion  that this  is a kind of project which a country like Japan would be very interested in because it is in an area that would develop rice production. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order,  hon.  Okondo. Are you making a statementor asking a supplemdntary qudstion? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  OKONDO: Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  if you could bear with me,  Iam putting a supplementary question. Could the Assistant Minister also,  in approaching the National Youth Service,  link  it with the possibility of assistance from Japan?   That is my question and I had to preface it for the Assistant Minister. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MAIYANI: Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I have already expressed ourMinistry's concern,  and we are looking round for a donor. Before we get oneand before we get any commitment,  we cannot mention any country here. I havealso promised to explore thd possibility of using the National Youth Service to improve this road. Our plan,  however,  is to tarmack the road and that is why ,we are looking for KShs.60 million. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER: Very well. Mr.  Mwacharo Kubo's Question. I notice that the Attorney-General is just at the corner and,  therefore,  I suppose hewill be able to deal with the Question in a few moments. </Newspeech> Question No.  583 <Header> Modern Court House at Taveta </Header> MR.  KUBO asked the Attorney-General what plans he has to construct a modern law courts building in Taveta. <Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr.  Muli):  Mr.  Deputy Speaker, Sir,  I apologise for being a little bit late,  but I managed to get here in time. Having said that,  Sir,  I beg to reply. Taveta court is housed in the old building which consists of one large room used as an open court and an adjucent small room serving as a registry as well  as the magistrate's chambers. The general condition of the court is pathetic and the department appreciates the great need to construct a modern court house there. However,  this has not been possible because the department's financialallocations over the years have been meagre. If the department's allocationcan be improved,  Taveta court would be in the priority list. I  can assure thehon.  Member that Taveta has not been forgotten and will be placed on the priority list. As soon as our financial allocation improves,  a new modern court will be constructed. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  KUBO:  Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  while thanking the Attorney-General could he be kind enough to inform the House within which financial year they have planned to forward this proposal to the Treasury since this is an urgent matter due to the fact that the current court is very congested and the magistrate has no privacy at all? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MULI:  Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I have said that over the years the allocation   of funds for the Judicial Department has been very much below the department's requirement.  I  can only hope that finances will be made available so that Tavdta may be placed on priority to be considered along with the other areas where the conditions of courts are not adequate.  So,  it is very difficult for me to say whether the finances will be made available during this financial year or next financial year.  However,  I  can assure the House that since the hon. Member has sounded the warning by asking this Question,  the Treasury  may be titivated to agree to increase our financial allocations in order to enable Taveta and many other areas to construct modern law court buildings. <./Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER: Very well. Mr.  Chdpkok's Question for the second time. </Newspeech> Question No.  534 <Header> Loss of Funds by  Income Tax Department - Nakuru </Header> MR.  MIUAMZANDI,  on behalf of Mr.  arap Chepkok,  asked the Vice-President and Minister for Finance what urgent steps he is taking to recover over KShs.200,000/-,  due to the Income Tax Department,  lost through fraudulent and corrupt practices by tax officers as per Income Tax File No.  6/60639, Nakuru. <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER,  OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr.  Keah): Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I am sorry that I arrived fractionallya few minutes late after the Qudstion was called the first time. I apologisefor that.Sir,  having said that,  I beg to reply.Available records related to the company allocated File No. 6/6063, Nakuru,  do not indicate any loss of over KShs.200,000/- in tax dud to the incomeTax Department. That being the case,  no steps are being contemplated or needbe taken  in order to recover the amount as it is not recoverable. The companyhas,  in fact,  submitted audited accounts for the years it has been in operation in accordancd with the requirements of the companies Act (Cap 486) These auditedaccounts have been examined and my Ministry has established that the companyhas,  in fact,  incurred a cumulative loss of K£225,717 against a ddclared cumulativelosses of only K£11,600. There is still a carry-forward loss of K£214,117 tobe offset against future profits.Under these circumstances, therefore,  there is no liability to tax arising under File No. 6/60639 nor is there any evidence of fraudulent and corrupt practice by  tax officers.   I  would  like  to  add that to the best of my Ministry's knowledge and belief,  we  have  honest  tax officers,  but  if any  such officer is  found corrupt or fraudulent,  he  is  dealt with in accordance with the law. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY  SPEAKER: Let us  go back to Mr.  Mukuna's Question. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

The  late Mr.  Ebule  Likokhe  did not  qualify  for  death  gratuity  due  to  the  fact  that he  was working as subordinate  staff,  which  is non—pensionable. He  was,  however,  entitled to  N.S.S.F.  benefits,  for  which  his  family can contact the  Director directly.  Action  has  been  taken  and  a  total  sum  of Shs.6,641/= has  already been  forwarded  to  the  Director  of N.S.S.F.  as  survivor's  benefits. At  the  time  of his  death,  the  late Mr.  Ebule  Likokhe had worked for  23-days,  for which  his  dependants will be paid through the District Commissioner,  Kakamega.

MALEBE: Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to ask the Minister of  State, Office  of the President the  following Question by Private Notice:Could the Minister,  as a matter of urgency,  provide transport and filmsto  the  District  Registrar of Persons,  Meru,  in order to  facilitate the  issuance ofidentity  cards  to all  school-leavers  those others who have attained  18 years  of age? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  MINISTER OF STATE,  OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  (Mr.  Nabwera):Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to reply.The  District  Commissioner,  Meru,  has been asked to help as much aspossible  so  that the Registrar of Persons can carry on registering of young peoplein  that  district. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  EKIDOR: Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  a very vague answerfrom the  hon.  Minister. Why has  he  asked the District Commissioner,  Meru,  tohelp the  Registrar of Persons  there when we know that there are no films in thecountry. Could he  tell the House what  is wrong? Is  there  sabotage  in  the  lackof photographic  films  in the  country? What happened to the  tenderer who was givena  contract  to  supply these  films? Has  he  been paid what  is  due to him? If  so,what has  happened  to  the  films  in  the  country? </Newspeech>(Applause)<Newspeech>MR.  NABWERA:   Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  if I may  answer  this supplementaryquestion  in  two parts,  firstly  with regard to Meru  in particular,  we have beenregistering people  there  every  month up to  date,  and we  are still  doing so.Secondly,  I  partly  agree  with  the hon.  Member that there is a general shortageof  films  in  the  country,  but  corrective  measures have  been  taken. We  are  stillcarrying out  registration  of people  in  all the  districts. We  have  ordered  somemore  photographic  films  and  they  should be  arriving here  in a week's  time. <Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MALEBE: Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  registration of persons  in  MeruDistrict  has  been  at  a standstill  because  of lack  of films. The  Registrar  ofPersons  there  does  not  even have  a vehicle  to  enable him to travel around and findout  what  problems  are  being experienced  in our  divisions. Could  the  Minister say  whether he  has  instructed the District Commissioner,  Meru,  to provide the Registrar  with  a motor-vehicle  to  enable  him  to  travel  around our  divisions? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  NABWERA: Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  the  registration  of personsin  Meru has  not been at a standstill because  from July, 1990  up  to  date, 4,259young people  have been  issued with  identity cards. I  even  have  a breakdown of.this  registration month by month  and  division  by  division. If my good friend,the  hon.  Member  for  Igembe,  listened  to  my  earlier  reply,  he  heard me  say  that instructions  have  been given  to  the  District  Commissioner,  Meru,  to  do  everything in  his  power  to  help  the  Registrar of Persons  to  move  around the  district. Thatis  why  the  latter  is  able tb  register people. The  particular  vehicle  that  hewas  using broke  down,  but  it is now being repaired. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  EKIDOR:  Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  there  is  a  lot  of politics  in the  Office  of the  President with  regard  to  issuing  identity  cards  in  the  country.  Firstly,  there  is  no  transport  and,  secondly,  there  are  no  films. The  registrationthat  the  Minister  is  referring  to  is  done  only  in  district headquarters  whereasnothing happens  in divisions. People have  to travel  long distances  to  districtheadquarters  for registration. Could we  be  assured that  transport will beavailable,  whether  films  there  are  films  or not? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  NABWERA: Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I  said  that registration ofpersons  is  going on  normally  throughout the  country. The  instructions  that  thedistrict  registrar has are  that he  should move his team from division to division.In  some  cases,  arrangements are made  for him to move from  location to  location  ina  division. So,  it  is  not  fair  to  imply  that registration  of persons  is  beingdone  in  district headquarters  alone;  it  is being  done  in  all  divisional  headquarters.In  the  specific  case  of Meru,  the  fact  that a vehicle  has  broken  down  and  is  underrepair  does  not mean that the  vehicle  in Turkana has  also broken  down. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MALEBE: On  a  point  of order,  Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir. Is  theMinister  in  order to insist that the District Registrar of Persons  in Meru hadbeen  provided with  a vehicle  that has now broken  down whereas,  as  far  as  I  amaware,  he has never been provided with  a vehicle? Could  the  Minister  give  thespecific  registration number of the  vehicle he claims to be under repair? </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR.

WAMBUA:  Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to ask the Minister for Health the  following, Question by Private Notice. Why was  the vehicle  G.K.  973T,  formerly  stationed at Mwala Health Centre,  taken to Wachakos  General Hospital and when will it be returned to Mwala Health Centre? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH  (Mr.  Ogur):  Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to reply. The  vehicle  G.K.  973T,  was not taken to Machakos General Hospital at  all.  Towards  the  end  of September,  1990,  this very vehicle was taken from MWala Health Centre to collect drugs from the Embu Provincial Drugs  Stores  but  on 3rd  October, 1990,  it was taken back to Mwala to distribute drugs to dispensaries and health centres inMWala Division. However,  on   25th October, 1990, the vehicle developed  gear box problems  and  it was taken to Wamumyu Garage within Machakos Town. When the  gear box was opened,  it wasfound that the  whole  gear  box required  a complete  overhaul.  The vehicle isstill undergoing repairs at this very  garage. After it is ready for use  it will be  taken back to MWala where it  came  from. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA:  Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I do not appreciate the  answer  given by the  Assistant Minister.  I  say this because beforethis vehicle  was taken away  from Mwala it used to  serve three boarding secondary schools. The people there are really suffering. The vehicle was taken to Machakos Hospital to serve that hospital. Therefore the question of this vehicle having been sent to Embu to collect drugs and subsequently to a garage for repairs does not arise.The vehicle is in x Machakos Hospital. If it was taken to the garage I am sure that that happened ust the other day. Why was the vehicle taken away leaving the people of Mwala with no vehicle to serve them?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, after this vehicle is repaired it will he taken hack to Mwala Health Centre.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.Another vehicle "belonging to. Masii Health Centre was taken to the same garage for repairs and when I asked when it will "be taken back to Masii I was told that it would be taken back to Masii after repairs. But you will find that the vehicle is still at that particular garage a up to this day. What are these wananchi goingto do? For how long will these vehicles continue to be at the garage? When will they be taken back to their respective Health Centres?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. OGUR:  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am very sorry about that we vehicles. It is unfortunate that the two vehicles have had to be taken to the garage for repairs. The hon. Members should realise that the only place where vehicles are taken when they break down is a garage, Once these two vehicles are repaired they will be taken back to their original stations. These vehicles break down because they are in constant use.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. J.N. MUNGAI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the Assistant Minister is trying to take the House for a ride. I say this" because this vehicle has been in that garage for a long time and it has not been repaired. Could the Assistant Minister tell the House what is causing this long delay? Is it lack of the necessary spare parts? Human life is precious and this vehicle should be taken back to Mwala to continue serving the People there.</newspeech><newspeech>Mr. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is aware that the people of Mwala Division need this vehicle urgently. I will therefore go and urge the garage owners to repair this vehiclequickly. so that it can be released to Mwala Health Centre.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker,Sir These vehicles stay for so long at the garage because there is nobody to supervise the repair works. It is not a good thing to keep vehicles in a garage for five months while people are suffering when are these vehicles going to be taken back to their original stations?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: That was not really a point of order.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not aware that when other Ministries take vehicles to a garage for repairs an officer from each Ministry is sent to the garage to supervise repair work. But what I know is that we have to be given the work ticket telling us how soon the vehicle will be ready. I will make sure that the vehicles are repaired and taken back to their original stations.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. J.N. MUNGAI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for the Assistant Minister to just talk about a garage without telling us the name of the garage? He should tell us the name of the garage so that the hon.

Next Question.</newspeech><newspeech>MR, KIRWA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Agriculture the following Question by Private Notice.(a)	) Is the Minister aware that the A.F.C. has seized mobile assets of a Mr. David Tarus and other farmers in Cherangany Division in an effort to recover loans owed to the Corporation?(b)	 What urgent measures will the Minister take to release the said assets to the farmers to facilitate harvesting?THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Ngaruro): Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.I am aware that on 4th October, 1990, the A.F.C. attached and removed one tractor and a plough and a Datsun saloon car from Mr. David Kipkorir Tarus's farm in an effort to recover money owed to the Corporation. However, Mr. Tarus's saloon car was later released to him for use in an agreement that he would report at the A.F.C. Kitale Branch, by 13th November, 1990, to present his payment proposals. Mr. Tarus is among the biggest debtors in the Corporation with a staggering sum of, KShs.696,755.70 in arrears as at 30th September, 1990. We are convinced that he has the ability to pay ana that he should be asked to pay the money for on-lending"to other deserving farmers. However, I am hot aware of any other assets which have been seized from other farmers in Cherangany Division which could increase harvest in the Division.Should there be such cases the Ministry has instructed the A.F.C. management to be as humane as possible in dealing with the cases.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KIRWA: Mr. Semporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the Assistant Minister ought to have been more thorough. Right here the Agricultural. Finance Corporation assists seven farmers in my constituency. The Assistant Minister ought to understand, too, that this is harvesting time. I am not disputing the seizure of the property but that the exercise is being done at the wrong time. Can the Assistant Minister direct the AFC at Kitale to release the assets of these farmers to facilitate their harvesting? There are seven farmers involved.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I have said, if there are such cases, we have instructed the AFC to deal with this matter as humanely as possible, bearing in mind that the AFC has been instructed to collect all the money that is outstanding on their loan portfolio.</newspeech><newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, while we thank the Assistant Minister for that answer, and while in agreement with him that the AFC should recover its loans, I would like to inform him that more than three farmers in my constituency have had their assets seized by the AFC and yet they are due to harvest their maize and wheat, through which proceeds they could pay their outstanding loans to the AFC. Could the Assistant Minister, therefore, direct the AFC offices, in Trans Nzoia, Uasin Gishu and Nandi Districts not to seize farmers' assets when they are preparing to harvest their crops to facilitate them to repay the AFC. loans?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member should tell us where these farmers are who are in arrears. A farmer like the one referred to in the Question had borrowed the money in 1981 and others onwards to 1985 and have deliberately refused to repay it. However, bearing in mind that this is harvesting season, I have directed the AFC to deal with these cases humanely and be very sympathetic.</newspeech><newspeech>DR. MISOI: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The hon. Assistant Minister is avoiding answering the question I put to him.I sought the assurance that for the next three months or so, the AFC will be directed not to seize any farmers' assets but, rather, recover from the; farmers from the proceeds of their harvests. This is because the tractors, lorries and other farm implements are needed for the harvesting exercise as well as transportation of the harvest to the Kenya Grain Growers Co-Operative Union stores. When such assets are seized and farmeres have to pay back AFC loans, then you render that impossible and the farmers will have to definitely default in their repayments.</newspeech>	<newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, "Sir, some of these farmers have been owing the AFC money for very many years. They have been harvesting and delivering their crops to the relevant authorities without repaying their loans to the AFC. There is no guarantee that when they deliver their crop this year they will repay the loans. However, I have directed the AFC to be sympathetic to them, bearing in mind that the AFC must recover all the outstanding loans.</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): I think, Mr. Ngaruro, the point is that after the fanners have harvested their crops, they will be in a better position to repay their loans. That being so, you are being asked whether the Ministry could give instructions to the AFC to the effect that the farmers' assets should not be seized at this particular harvesting time.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, some of these farmers we are talking about harvested last year but did not pay anything to the AFC. They harvested three years ago but still refused to pay anything. Therefore, the conviction that they will be able to repay after harvesting this year does not hold any strength. I have, however, directed the AFC' to deal with the farmers sympathetically, bearing in mind that this is harvesting season. However, you will recall that our Chairman "of the Public Investments Committee insisted in his report that he tabled last week that the AFC must vigorously pursue these farmers who are deliberately refusing to repay loans.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. J.N. MUNGAI: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the Assistant Minister is trying to avoid the question. He was informed that the farmers are just harvesting now and, if they are denied the means to harvest and transport their crops, then the crops will be destroyed and they will not be able to repay their loans. Is it not in order for the I Assistant Minister to give instructions to the AFC to have the seized vehicles released immediately so that they can assist the farmers in harvesting their crops? The AFC can then see the reaction of the farmer.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. NGARURO:- Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have already said that the question of the farmers paying their loans after being allowed to go ahead with their harvesting does not arise because they harvested last year but did not remit anything. We have therefore asked the AFC to apply its own merit as some of the farmers have been owing money for very many years while they are able to repay. They normally harvest crops but refuse to repay the loans.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell the House whether the mobile assets which were seized were part of the security given during the granting of the loans?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is the case.</newspeech><newspeech>DR. MISOI: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to quote me as the Chairman of the Public Investments Committee having made a comment in a report that we are as yet to discuss here? Is that in order?</newspeech><newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: It has been tabled. That is all right.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is a public document that has already been tabled here and, actually, Dr. Misoi is the current Chairman of the Public Investments Committee.</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): I think we should not anticipate as the debate on the Report is as yet to come.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KIRWA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think it would be better for the Assistant Minister to be clearer here. Some of these farmers have not defaulted in repaying their loans. For example, Mr. Cheptum Chesire has been repaying his loan every month at the rate of Ksh.2,500/-. For the last two months, he was able to pay a deposit of Ksh.25,000/-. Many of these farmers have put over 100 acres under maize cultivation. Can the Assistant Minister tell us what his Ministry is going to, particularly about the leasing of tractors, since these are very important components for harvesting?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speakeer, Sir, I do not think I have anything to add onto what I have already said. We have asked the AFC to deal with the farmers individually. As I said, the AFC has been very sympathetic to those farmers who have been paying. However, for those who have not been making any efforts to repay their loans, and they have been owing such monies, to the AFC for a very long period, the AFC has a right to do something about it. However, the AFC has been asked to be as humane as possible when dealing with these farmers.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KIRWA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we do not need any sympathy in Cherangani. What we need is fairness because, what the AFC Loans Manager has been doing is quite unethical; he has brought a court broker from Kakamega and yet we have so many brokers in Trans Nzoia. He has stored most of the agricultural implements far from Cherangani, instead of taking them to the nearest police station. That means that at the end of the case, the farmers are going to be asked to pay a lot of money. There is some conspiracy there and the Assistant Minister ought to be very clear about this, because there is apparent frustration to the farmers.</newspeech><newspeech>Mr. NGARURO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, since thehon. Member says that he some extra x information, I am willing todiscuss this matter with him privately so that fairness and justice can be done to all the fanners in Cherangany Division.</newspeech><newspeech>DR. MISOI: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant Minister's reply that he is willing, to discuss this natter privately with  the hon. Questioner, would he not agree with me that since this Question is now the proper of this House, he should undertake to report back to the House to tell us whether or not he has been able to find a solution to the problems affecting farmers in Cherangany Division? This information that the hon. Questioner has given to the House is related to the Question and therefore I do not think it is fair, for the Assistant Minister to say that he is willing to discuss this matter privately with the hon. Questioner outside this I think that is entirely wrong!</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): The hon. Member has said  that there is some kind of conspiracy in the whole affair and the Assistant Minister has agreed to discuss with the hon. Member with a view to finding out whether there is any possibility of solving the problem, that I would like to advice the hon. Questioner and the Assistant Minister is to get together immediately and try to find out the best solution to this problem. They could do this in the office and if the hon. Member feels he is not happy with the discussion, he is still free to come back here and report the matter to the House.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. J.K. MUKGAI: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The information that has been given by ghe hon. Questioner is rather serious in that he alleged that an auctioneer was brought from Kakamega to Trans Nzcia instead of getting an auctioneer from Trans Nzoia to deal with the people there. The hon. Member went further and alleged that this was a conspiracy and I think this is a very serious matter. Could the Assistant Minister then tell us why this auctioneer was brought all the way from Kakamega to Trans Nzoia?</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND EOUSING (Mr. Mutiso): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir,</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. wabuge): Order sir, Mutisol.

He shall sit down together and if needs be, I shall report back to this House.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. ZIDU: On a point of order, Mr, Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, It is true as hon. Mr. Misoi stated earlier, that whenever a Question is brought to this House, it becomes the property of this House. In this parti¬cular Question, we have been told that a certain auctioneer was brought all the way from Kakamega to Trans 17zoia he would like to know why this auctioneer was brought from all that way?</newspeech><newspeech>Mr. MGARURO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have said quite clearly that I am not aware of this and this is why I as willing to receive further information from the hon. Questioner and if needs be, I will report back to this House.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MWAMZANBI:- On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. After hon. Mugai as raised a point of order, Mr. Mutiso stood up and attempted to raise another point of order and even after ruling him out since we were dealing with another point of order, he kept on standing. It was at this point that hon. kidor held his by the shoulders and pulled him down, has this really in order? As far as I know, if hon. Kutiso insisted on raising the point of order, perhaps you, Sir, could have asked the Serjeant-at Arms to effect your oders by forcing Mr. Kutiso to sit down or leave the Chamber. However, in this case, we noticed hon. Kidor playing the role of the Serjeart-at-Arms by pulling Mr. Kutiso down.I think hon. Ekidor was very much out of order and should therefore apologize to the House. We expect him to he have like an hon.

KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister, in the course of replying to one of the supplementary questions, stated that he had issued some sympathetic directives to the Agricultural Finance Corporation regarding the case of these farmers. Could he tell us what kind of sympathetic directives these were.</newspeech> <newspeech>ME. NGAEURO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I said that after receiving information from hon. Kirwa, I instructed the A.F.C. to take the necessary action only yesterday. That point of order does not therefore arise.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister then tell this House whether that sympathy will go a long way to assist these farmers by having their seised assets returned to them?</newspeech><newspeech>ME.

I rise on a point of order to draw the attention of the House to a mistake in today' Daily Kation on page five where my photograph appear, with name, Mr. Keya. I was very much embarrassed when hon. Members started addressing me as Mr. Key as I was entering the Chamber and I wondered what they were up to. I would like to ask this particular newspaper to correct this name and stop calling me names that do not relate to me. By name is spelt K-e-a-h and I am sure that the Daily Nation has taken note of that. However, I would like to thank them for printing what I said here in the House yesterday, but although they put the correct photograph, but unfortunately, they attributed the wrong name to the right photograph. Please, could they take note of this. I merely brought this matter to the House simply because it related to an answer I gave to this House, otherwise, I would have dealt with them outside the House.</newspeech><newspeech>THE  TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): I hope that the Daily Nation has taken note of that.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. FALAKA: On a point of order, Kr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.I rise on a point of order in connexion with a Question I had asked in this Eouse on the 31st October, 1950 regarding the settlement of refugees in Karsabit Town. I am glad to report to the Eouse that I have seen action being taken by the Ministry of Home Affairs and National Heritage and I would like to take this opportunity to thank and commend the Assistant Kiniste who a handled this issue hon. Job Lalampaa for his immediate action on this matter. I had asked this Question on the 31st October, and on 2nd November, the Ministry's officials and others from the office of the Commissioner for Refugees and from the Immigration Department visited the area and took the necessary action. For this, I am really grateful to the Government.</newspeech><newspeech>MR.KISOI: On a point of order, Tor. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, by point of order relates to Question No: 408 that I raised in the House on 9th October, 1990. The Question was on a company that bought the 800-acre land in Uasin Gishu District from Mr. Pravin Singh and when the agreement was reached. An Assistant Minister for Lands, Housing and Physical Planning gave a partly correct answer, that Lamauni farmers Company bought the land at a cost of Shs.6.4 million. When I requested to be given the names of the people who bought the land and their share contributions, the Assistant Minister promised to give such a list. On 30th October, 1990, the Assistant Minister read out a list of 27 purported members of Lamauni Farmers Company Ltd, but he did not give their contribution towards the purchase of the land.I protested that the list of the 27 members included people who had not contributed a single cent, Now I have the original list I will lay it on the Table of 74 shareholders; each one of them contributed a substantial amount of money to make him get relevant acreage and the total contribution was Shs.6.4 million. Now the question is why the Ministry gave a wrong answer which left out a large number of member of this company. I would request the Ministry to give a proper answer as to who paid this money, when it was paid and the reason why non-members have been included in the membership of the company. If these people paid that money, the Ministry should give the date when the money was paid to the owner of the land and documents to prove that they paid it.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this goes a long way to prove to the House that sometimes we get wrong, or inadequate answers from the Minister or unresearched answers whose information is scanty and the same information goes out to the public.I believe the Ministry should give & proper answer and, if necessary, also apologise for its previous inadequate answer. Thank you, Sir.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICALPLANING (Mr. Mutiso): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, first ofall I would like to ask the hon. Member to lay that list on theTable so that we can study it. Secondly, I want to correct theimpression that the Ministry always, as the hon. Member puts it,gives inadequate, or false, information to this House wheneverhon. Members request it. If I recall	wildly  when I was answering that Question I said that the list the Ministry had had come from the Registrar of Companies; the names I gave are the ones recorded there as being the shareholders of that particular company and we can never go wrong when we get information from the" actual body which keeps the records. If the Registrar of Companies' record is not the proper one, then the blame does not lie with the Ministry. Therefore. I want to say that we will investigate this list in conduction with the District Commissioner, Uasin Gishu, and the Registrar of Companies and as and when we get the correct answer, if we are wrong, then we will have no idfficulty in apologising. But if we find that the hon. Member's list is fictitious, then we shall also call upon him to apoligise. Thank you, Sir.</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. wabuge): Hon. Dr. Misoi lay the list on the Table; the Assistant Minister will go throuh it and verify it.(Dr. Misoi walked to the Front-bench without bowing to the Chair)</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Omido): On a point of order, Mr, Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.

MAKAU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, allow me start my contribution by paying special to his Excellency the sident, Hon. Daniel arap Moi, for the role he has played in the mansion of education in this country. He is the pillar of precational development in this country because now we have over 40,000 riversity students: his contribution to the 8-4-4 system of location is enormous. In fact, it was for his foresight that this stem of education was introduced. In fact, his contribution to a development of  education has been recognised the world or and one of the things cited by Soka University when it awarded a President an honorary degree yesterday  was this contribution the development of education.Having said that, I would like to say that the success of 8-4-4 system of education depends entirely on proper implementation, wananchi responded very postively to this system of education and so to cost-sharing in education. This has been of much benefit to Ministry of Education.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the role that the wananchi have played, I feel that the Ministry of Education should encourage wananchi. The supply of science equipment is very crucial to the success of 8-4-4. Out of the 2,7 00 secondary schools, that are now public schools now, majority of them were Harambee schools. These schools do not have science laboratories. Just only a few Government schools which have these facilities, as pointed out by the Mover of this Motion. The Majority of secondary schools in the country lack science laboratories The Minister for Education, made it very clear that those who contribute through Harambee to construct science laboratories will be provided with science equipment. This was said in the House and the DDC all over this country were asked to select schools that will receive the science equipments that the Ministry was supposed to supply to 600 secondary schools. This was said before students sat for the KCEE. Up to now we are waiting to hear more about this from the Ministry of Education. For example, in Machakos district we were asked to select schools that would receive the science equipment from the Ministry; we, indeed, did select those schools. We said that those schools should be given science? equipment by the Ministry.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, although we have been told time and again that tenders for science equipment are being processed, for two years now the students have been sitting for examinations without these equipment. For example, in Mbooni Constituency, we constructed science laboratories, almost in all secondary schools. I, therefore, would like to thank wananchi in Mbooni Constituency, for their contributions. However, the Ministry of Education keeps on telling us that the equipment is coming. Wewould like when the Minister for Education when replying to this Motion, to tell us what happened to these science equipment that were suppossed to be sent to 600 secondary schools. Several leaders have told wananchi that they will be provided with these equipment. The Minister has also done the same. We also in Machakos DDC told the people that equipment would be given to these schools. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is something that is actually becoming a problem. it is very difficult for a school to conduct or organise practicals without science equipment. It is better for the Ministry to say that they do not nave funds. Some people say that the British Council or somebody else promised to provide the equipment. I would like that to be clarified so that wananchi could know whether the science equipment would be coming or whether it came silently and sent to other schools. In Machakos District we are still waiting for it. We as the Members of Parliament, are Members of various board of governors which run these secondary schools.Another problem that is facing former Harambee schools which are now public schools now is lack of qualified teachers, I would, therefore, like to urge the Minister for Education to distribute evenly teachers who were teaching 'A' level classes. Previously, there was a need for qualified teachers to teach the 'A' level classes. Now, that we do not have 'A' level classes and every school goes up to form IV those teachers should be distributed evenly. All public schools should have qualified teacherThe Ministry of Education should now make use of the young people who graduate from our public universities, but they have not yet got jobs. Most of them have Bachelor of Arts degrees. Others did veterinary medicine and commerce. It is time that the Ministryof Education deviced scheme for them so that they get jobs immediately after graduating. The Ministry of Education should send them to secondary schools to teach because they are qualified. For example, those who did veterinary medicine, they can teach agriculture in secondary schools. The. Ministry of Education can institute an in- service course for them so that they can improve the quality of teaching in secondary schools especially the Harambee schools. In Harambee schools children are taught by those who failed in their 'A' level examinations. It looks awkward, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for somebody who has already failed an examination to go and prepare one to sit for a similar examination. So, I would like to urge the Minister for Education to look into that factor.Another area, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, that should be looked into by the Ministry of Education is the question of workshops.         On the question of workshops, the model of construction given to parents should be checked, workshops do not necessary have to be constructed using bricks and so on. we need jua kali sheds for woodwork and metal work which can be constructed with less than Kshs. 50,000.00. what a we need is a jua kali shed and a store for equipment. I went round my constituency and wondered why we should put up a beautiful classroom and make it a workshop for woodwork and metal work. The Ministry should take such jua kali models to all schools so that parents can construct workshops cheaply.Another area that the Ministry should look into is with regard toRDF. Since there are no laboratory equipment in Harambee schools,the Ministry should ask district Education officers to provide RDF money, for the purchase of equipment. In my constituency,parents have responded and have put up science laboratories.There is no point in giving funds for the construction of science laboratories without taking into account the availability of equipment.The Ministry should also encourage the construction of model schools in each constituency. If there are two well equipped schools in every constituency, many students will be able to qualify for university admission. This is because there seems to be some imbalance in this respect since those areas with 'A' level equipped schools will be able to send students to the university while' those with none will continue to lag behind.With those few remarks, I beg to support the Motion.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): Thank you, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to talk on this Motion, and to enlighten the House on the Ministry's feelings on this matter.There were 272 Government maintained schools with a total of 745 Form 5 and Form 6 classes in the former system of education which wasphased out at the end of 1989 and replaced by the 8-4-4 system. The 'A' level classes were attached to national, provincial and district schools. The majority of these 'A' level classes were smaller because there used to be 35 students in the Arts classes and 30 students in science classes. This is a smaller number compared to a class of 40 students in the 8-4-4 system of education.I am saying this because I am confident that hon. Members will understand the fact that the facilities which were left behind by the 'A' level classes are fully utilized by the 8-4-4 classes: which are bigger than those of the 'A' level-classes. The 8-4-4 curriculum is broad based and it includes technical and commercial subjects. Science has also become compulsory for all schools. This means that more physical facilities had to be constructed, that is, laboratories, home science rooms, workshops, music rooms and so on.The 'A' level classrooms are fully utilised as additional physical facilities for the effective implementation of the 8-4-4 curriculum. If hon. Members visit 'A' level schools in their constituencies, they will realise that those facilities that we used during the old system of education are not sufficient for the 8-4-4 classes because of the broad based curriculum Currently, the Ministry's policy is that of consolidation and excellence ana not expansion.Further, budgetary constraints have made it necessary for the  Ministry to employ cost-effective measures to reduce the budget allocation. The Ministry is working hard to uplift all public schools to the same standard through equal distribution of qualified teachers, professional services and available funds. The Ministry is doing this in conjunction with the Parents and Teachers Associations, board of governors and the district development committes;National schools were established to foster national unity bybringing together Kenyans from all corners of the Republic. Most of themhave also proved to be centres of excellence. It is important to note thatnational schools are not necessarily better in performance than otherschools. For instance, Ngandu Girl School in Central Province is not anational school but it is doing very well. There are so many examples ofschools that have excelled in national examinations which are not nationalschools. For the benefit of the House, we have 16 national schools whichwe consider sufficient for the time being. These are: Alliance Boys HighSchool; Alliance Girls High School; Limuru Girls; Loreto Limuru; Mangu High  School; Mary Hill Girls High School: Kenya High School; Nairobi School; Lenana School; Moi Forces Academy; Starehe Boys; Maseno School; Moi Girls Eldoret; Nakuru High School and Garba High School. In addition, we have Kabarak High School in its own special way. This school draws students from all over the Republic.National schools select students to Form One from all over the country using the quota system for all students depending on the district population and merit within each district. May I take this opportunity to also clarify what appeared in the local Press as having kind: been uttered by the Deputy Speaker to the effect that universities were operating on a quota system. That is not true. Universities are strictly operating on merit and, in fact, the intake is computerised.In keeping with the district focus for rural development, pro¬vincial schools select their Form One students using the 85 per cent and 15 rule per cent rule from the district where the school is and from the districts in that province respectively.This ensures that the Harambee spirit will continue to thrive and that people will benefit from the schools they have constructed. That is why, in qualifying to go to the university, schools which are properly constructed are given proper equipment.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, every district has an equal opportunity to send children to our universities. Therefore, if we were to make the former 'A' Level schools national schools, that would mean that some districts would lose the opportunity of taking their children to school. An example of a district which had two 'A' Level schools could serve here. If these two 'A' Level schools were to be converted to national schools, a quarter system would be applied for taking those children to those schools and that would mean that that district that has struggled to build a school would eventually not benefit from its efforts: We will avoid that situation because we would like to see people having their efforts rewarded. We want people to see their efforts being regarded by their children qualifying for higher education. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, district day schools select 100 per cent of their students from their respective districts. To ensure equitable distribution of the available resource's, the Ministry of Education has laid out clear guidelines in Sessional Paper No. 6 of 1988 on Education and Manpower Train¬ing for the Next Decade and Beyond. This ensures that provincial and district schools are' elevated quality wise to the level of national schools to benefit more students. In fact, it has been observed that some of the provincial and district schools perform extremely well in national examinations and compete quite favourably with national schools. Provincial and district schools formerly with 'A' Level classes cater for the communities within the respective provinces and districts. If all these schools were to be converted to national schools without creating other similar institutions, the respective province's and districts would lose in that they would have less students from within them being admitted.However, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is committed to the development of centres of excellence in every district. Through the district development committees and the district education boards, the Ministry of Education is urging every district to identify one school that should be a model of excellence in that district. That school should be properly equipped, assisted by the district development committee, local leaders and the Ministry of Education so that we have a model school of excellence' in each district that looks more or less than the 16 national schools that we have today.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the fact that we are not converting all former 'A' Levei schools into national schools does not kill the national unity the hon. Member is talking about. We are all aware that although we are talking about 85 per cent of students being admitted from a particular district and 15 per cent intake from that particular province, there are officers from all over the country working in those province's and districts, and no school includes 100 per cent students from that locality. Schools include students from all tribe's in this country. Go and investigate in any school which students are there and, although we are talking about the 85 per cent and 15 per cent from the district and province respectively, you will find that all Kenyans are represented in any school however remote it may be.Therefore, Sir, the Ministry of Education wishes to oppose this Motion for the reasons I have given, and I also wish to oppose it. Thank you very much.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Mutiso): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to oppose this Motion.</newspeech><newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Are you opposing?</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Mutiso): Yes First of all, this Motion lacks foresightedness and forward plan¬ning because when you consider the position of education in this country, you will see' that some areas of Kenya are more foturnate and more educationally developed than others. A national class means that that particular school has the rightto admit children from all over the country on merit. If this Motion were to be passed, then it would mean that a less fortunate area like Machakos District, for instance, would be forced to admit children from other areas on their personal ability and qualification, such that our number of children who qualify to go to those schools is reduced by 15 per cent. As it is with the quota system, 85 per cent of the children admitted to district and provincial schools must be from the locality and 15 per cent of the children are admitted from all over the country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I cannot understand how a good friend of mine like hon. Kyonda could not realise this, that we shall be losing. Even his own Makueni are a would be losing considerably if we were to make the few 'A' Level schools in Machakso District national schools. We would be accepting other children from other area who, by virtue of qualification, cannot be denied vacancies in those schools. At the moment we are crying and asking the Government to improve education and create more better schools in less developed areas of this country. Even now when we apply the quota system, you find that if a district like Machakos has about four 'A' Level classes and Machakos District has the highest number of school-going children were to retain the 'A' Level schools, we would benefit more. But when we are faced with the issue of quota system, the local people have the right to send their children who have qualified locally to school in a great number. That is why I am saying that this particular Motion misses the point. Therefore, as much as I would have liked to support hon. Kyonda, I will not support him in this particular issue.  I feel that if we pass this Motion, we will lose something important, not only in Machakos but also in many other areas in the country. There some areas that have many former A-Level schools. These areas are also fortunate in the sense that they had had better educational facilities for many years than other areas. We are now trying to kill this kind of imbalance, but this Motion is actually encouraging it by asking that these former A-Level schools be made national schools. If this happens, these schools will submerge the few schools in those areas to such an extent that the areas that became developed before continue to develop even further while other areas a left behind all the time. This is why I said earlier that this Motion lacks foresight. The hon. Mover should have seen the danger that would be brought about by the Motion if it were passed.              I am sure, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, that many hon. Members feel the same as I do because each of them wants to see his own areas being educationally developed. We do not want to encourage an influx of students from more educationally developed areas into less educationally developed areas. Instead, we want to raise the standard of education in the latter areas, and the only way in which we can do this is to maintain the status quo. As hon. Karauri said, there is the quota system that is applied when admitting students to national schools. If we were allowed a second thought, we would feel that this system should be reconsidered in such a manner that students who qualify for admission to national schools, irrespective of where they come from, are admitted. The quota system stipulates that 85 per cent of students admitted to a national school must be from the local area. Economically, we are not the same because people in some areas are able to put up better schools than others because of their advanced economic status. We do not want to create a situation where those places that are rather backward remain backward forever. If we accept the views expressed in this Motion, this is exactly what is going to happen.As much as I would have liked to support my friend over there, I urge the House to reject this Motion in to encourage the Ministry of Education to continue to implement the policy that it has considered to be the right thing.     In this case, we will maintain a good level of education in all areas according to the ability of the people there. With these few words, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I oppose the Motion.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MATE: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to air my views in respect of this Motion. Right from the onset, the Motion itself is not clear and we fail to understand what the Mover has in mind because whatever the Motion is requesting for has already been catered for by the Ministry of Education. The Motion talks about national schools, and we already know that these schools exist. We also know that the existing national schools take care of our national unity. There are teachers in all these schools, and the question of creating more national schools does, therefore, not arise. The Motion is unfortunate and unclear. We would have liked to support the Motion, but it does not indicate what the Mover really has in mind. We know that there are national, provincial and district schools. So, the question of making the former A—Level schools national schools does not arise at all. All we need to do is to ask the Ministry of Education and parents and teachers associations to improve all the existing public schools by providing them with enough equipment and laboratories so that they attain a standard that is equitable in the whole Republic. The parents in some districts have worked very hard. We should now call upon the Ministry of Education and parents and teachers associations to make sure that schools that are not properly equipped are taken care of. The Ministry has a lot of problems and consumes quite a big part of our Budget. The Ministry should, of course, take care of unfortunate areas where schools are not really up-to-date, such as Turkana, North-Eastern Province and Coast Province. A child in these less developed schools requires more care than one in areas such as Central Province and Eastern Province. So, the Ministry should improve schools in the former areas to the level of those in the latter areas.The Ministry should also take of school fees in some areas where they are rather too high. These fees should, where possible, be standardized so that all schools may be able to provide the same physical facilities. I know that these fees are too high in some areas for the ordinary farmer or parent to pay.</newspeech>   <newspeech>MR. ARTE: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I beg to move that the Mover be now called upon to reply.</newspeech> (Applause)<newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Let Mr. Mate say a few more words before I put the Question.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MATE: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. As I said, the Motion lacks direction and the Ministry of Education faces some bottlenecks, which we have been promised to be looked into with a view to rectifying them one after the other as finances allow.We know that the issue of auditing of accounts in schools needs to be brought up—to—date. In most areas, the public is not very happy with the audit units of the Ministry of Education. We know that money is pumped into schools, but the audit units leave a lot to be desired. Public money should be audited, if possible, every year and not only when there is a quarrel or the board—of—governors is in disarray.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Members who have spoken before me have said that the distribution of teachers is another factor which should be looked into, The well to do schools are favoured with highly qualified teachers. The Ministry should take care of all schools even if some of the schools are in the bush. Let us have a fair distribution of teachers in the country. The schools in the so-called remote areas in Kenya should also be given highly qualified teachers. These schools should be treated in just the same way schools in other parts of the country are treated.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sorry to say that I must oppose this Motion very strongly because it lacks direction. It is not clear and we do not know really what the Mover wants to say. All that I have to say is that let us develop all the schools in the Republic.With those few remarks, I beg to oppose the Motion.</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): One hon. Member has moved closure to the debate on this Motion. But according to our Standing Orders the debate on a Motion should take two hours unless otherwise If hon. "Members are not willing to speak on a notion then the Mover can be called upon to reply. But I can see that some hon. Members are interested in contributing to the debate on this Motion. I will therefore allow some Members to speak until the time comes for the Mover to reply.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MAKAU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. It is not my wish to challenge your ruling.

It is not my wish to challenge the Chair but I think you should put the question before we proceed any further,</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): But I have explained clearly that the debate on each Motion should take a maximum of two hours unless hon. Members are not willing to speak. In this particular respect there are hon. Members who are willing to speak on the Motion. I will call upon Professor Ongeri to speak.</newspeech><newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TEMPORARY TRAINING AND APPLIED TECHNOLOGY (Prof. Ongeri): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to state quite categorically that Sessional Paper No.6 of 1988, which was a subject of discussion by this august House and which was passed, clearly spelt out the direction in which educational matters of this country will be adjudicated upon. It was quite clean in that particular Sessional Paper No.6 of 19S8, that we as a Government should spell out the centres of excellence, model schools, at the provincial or at the district level. Therefore I find this Motion superfluous in that context. This is because the Government has clearly spelt out its objectives and line of action in terms of quality of education that has to be offered in this country. I would therefore urge the Mover of this Motion to have a second thought on it because the Government is clear on what must happen regarding education int he country. The Government is also quite clear on what must happen on technical training. I think there could not have been a better enunciation of Government policy than what is contained in Session Paper No.6 of 1988. I would urge the Never of this Motionto have a second and a thorough look at that document because it contains every objective on matters of education in this country, for this decade and beyond. I am sure that the hon. Member must have been present when the matter was being discussed in this House,"Secondly, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is important that when this country is spending 40 per cent of the national Budget on education It is important that we educate thepublic to know that there must be an element of cost-sharing. The only effective way of getting the public to appreciate and understand this element of cost-sharing is to be able to move these" schools, at the provincial level and the district level rather than the other way round as is being suggested. I think the national schools we have at the moment are serving the need of national integration. It is also equally important that we look at the provincial level and have an integration at that level. We should also look at the district level and see what integration can be done at that level.It is quite obvious that a number of schools at the district level have, been able to improve their performance because of a direct relationship between the parents and the schools within the locality where these schools are. Some of them which never used to perform well are now beginning to adequately perform well because of the input of the Parents/Teachers Associations and the communities. We should now allow District Development Committees to vote funds to some of the schools in the districts so that we can create modle schools and centres of excellence that can attract students to perform well at the district level.On matters of education, we cannot go on changing every now and then. The mere fact that this was a decision emanating from a Commission that was set up to look into matters of education How that we have "been able to deliberate on this matter and a document produced and it is hardly even a year after that that this Motion is being presented to the House I would suggest that in the best interest of continuity and reality that exist in the educational system, the Mover should withdraw this Motion so that we can be able to proceed with other matters before us. With those few remarks, I beg to oppose this Motion.</newspeech><newspeech>DR. MISOI: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it in order to ask the Mover to withdraw this Motion? Is he in order to do that after speaking on the Motion?</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge) : He is in order He has expressed his views.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. This Motion is a terrible one and I stand to oppose. The Motion is terrible because it is calling for the exploitation of minority tribes by the majority tribes. For instance if a national school is established in Turkana District, you will find that we in Turkana will have no access to the Board of Governors to sit in the Board to select those who will join that national school.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. This House has resolved that debate on each Private Members. Motion will take a maximum of two hours. But in view of the fact the this Motion is being opposed and that no action is going to be taken shall I be in order to propose that the Mover be now called upon to reply?</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): First of all let us hear what the hon. Member on the Floor has to say AN HON. MEMBER: Maliza Mabisa!</newspeech><newspeech>MR. EKIDOR : These national schools are only for the exploitation of the minority by the majority tribes; it is calling for descrimination in the Ministry of Education of those pupils in the remote areas. It is at the same time calling for the killing of the morale of the parents and even parents and teachers associations who are working very hard to put up schools.The question of having national schools in all districts does not arise because, if you take the national schools we now have in the Republic, you will find that in Alliance School, there could be only one Turkana student, or none at all. Is it then economical to the Turkana people to have any such national school? It is not. What the Motion should have called for is for modern schools in all the 188 constituencies in the country, and not in all the districts.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also think that the Ministryshould have appointed a committee to review the 8-4-4 system of education in the whole Republic in order to have central or standard education in the Republic, instead of having national schools in 42 districts in the Republic. Why can we not have standard education in the Republic all the way from the sub-locations to the other national levels? Calling for national schools in all the districts is descriminatory against some of the country's children.So, Sir, this Motion should be highly opposed and with those few remarks, I oppose it.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CO-OPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Ejore): Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda. Ningependa kusema kwamba sijui Hoja hii iliwasilishwa hapa kwa sababu gani. Ni wazi kwamba mpaka sasa kama ingekuwa kwamba ile quota ya kila wilaya bado iko, tungeona kwamba shule fulani ambazo ziliachwa nyuma wakati wa ukoloni zingekuwa hazina watoto wa kutoka sehemu hizo wakizisomea. Sitaki kumaanisha kwamba ni ukabila uliokuweko, ama kuwa na nia mbaya. lakini kule kuweka shule zote za nchiyetu kuwa katika kiwango kimoja kungekuwa hivi kwamba hatungekuwa na vijana wa kutosha kusomea katika shule fulani katika wilaya hizo.Kama alivyosema mhe. Mbunge fulani hapa, ukiangalia shule nyingi za kitaifa kama vile Alliance, utaona kwamba imekuwa ni taabu kubwa sana kwa mwanafunzi wa kutoka Samburu ama Pokot kuingia humo. Hata kama unge- hitimu kwa njia gani, hungeweza, hata hapo zamani, kuingia katika shule kama hizo zilizokuweko hata hapo awali. Sijui uchaguzi wa wanafunzi uli kuwa ukifanywa namna gani. Wakati huo kulikuwa hakuna ile quota system ya kuwachukua wanafunzi idadi ya 85 asilimia kutoka kwenye wilaya kunako shule. - Hikuwa kwamba katika wilaya fulani, badala ya hiyo 85 asilimia kuwa ni idadi ya wanafunzi wa sehemu hizo, wanafunzi walikuwa wakitoka wilaya nyingine za nje, na hivyo kuwakosesha nafasi za masomo wale wanafunzi wa sehemu hizo. Jambo hilo halikuwa likisawazisha elimu, bali lilikuwa ni la kuwafanya watu wengine kuendelea kupanda juu na wengine kurudi nyuma. Hiyo ilikuwa ni akili ya ujanja mkubwa sana na ilipogunduliwa na Serikali hivi karibuni, Serikali sasa imehakikisha kwamba 85 asilimia ni wanafunzi wanaotoka katika wilaya inayohusika. Hi 1i si jambo la ukabila kwa sababu mtu yeyote akihamia mahali fulani, kwa sababu ya .kazi ama biashara, basi watoto wake wanaweza kuhesabiwa kama watoto wengine wa wilaya hiyo na kuchukuliwa. katika shule hizo za wakaazi Jambo lisilofaa ni kuwa "tukiwaokota" watu kutoka Mikoa ya Pwani, Kati na kuwajazia wanafunzi huko Lodwar. Je, wanafunzi wetu watakuwa wakienda wapi?Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, naona kama kwamba mwenye kuiwasilisha Hoja hii alikuwa ametafuta njia ya kuurudisha tena ule ugandamizi wa elimu katika wilaya nyingine zilizo nyuma ili ziendelee kuwa kama zilivyokuwa wakati wa enzi ya mkoloni. Kwa sababu hiyo ningependekeza kuwa Hoja. hii itupiliwe mbali kabisa, kama kule baharini ambako kunaishi samaki wakubwa wakubwa kama vile nyamngumi. Tangu tulipoanza. mfumo wa 8-4-4-wa. elimu, na pia kuwa na . quota ya kila wilaya katika shule za kitaifa, basi utawakuta wanafunzi wa makabila kama vile Waturkana, ama Wapokot wakiwa katika shule kama AllianceMang'u na shule nyingine ambazo hawangezijua kamwe. Hata wengine hawangejua Nairobi ni upande gani. Tulianzisha quota system katika uchaguzi wa wanafunzi ili kuhakikisha kuwa kila kabila la Kenya liko ndani ya shule zetu za kitaifa. Hi i ndiyo njia ya kumaliza ukabila kwa sababu kuna mchanganyiko wa wananchi wote. Hatutaki mambo ya zamani ambapo, kwa mfano, ungepata shule nzima ikiwa ni ya Waturkana peke yao. Hayo ni maajabu.Kwa sasa ambapo tuna quota system, tuna wanafunzi wengi kutoka kwenye makabila madogo madogo wakiwa kwenye vyuo vikuu, na haii hapo awali walikuwa tu wakisikia kuwa kuna chuo kikuu. Hii ni kwa sababu nifumo ulitengenezwa wa maana wa kuhakikisha kwamba makabila yote yana nafasi sawa. Sijui ni bahari gani duniani ambalo ni kubwa zaidi, kwa kuwa huko ndiko Hoja hi i inafaa kupelekwa izamishwe huko. Kama mwenye kuiwasilisha Hoja hii angependa kuanzisha .shule yake jinsi anavyopendekeza, ili iwe ni ya watu wake peke yake, basi na afanye hivyo.Kwa hayo machache, napinga Hoja hii.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KITELE: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the Mover of this Motion has heard the views expressed by the hon. Members. Firstly I would like to thank the Ministry because it has also done a good job in providing a lot of teachers to even Harambee secondary schools. I congratulate the Ministry for that effort. I could only make an appeal for the consideration of those other schools that still require more teachers.Coming to the Motion itself and, as I said, the Mover of the Motion has heard the feelings of the House, I request him to go back and re-draft~it afresh, if he wants it to be debated upon in the House again. This is because we do not have the 'A' level students as we now have students reaching the Form IV level of education under the 8-4-4 system. From that secondary stage, we all know that a student goes on tothe university level." We also know that there is the quota system for, say, Baringo, Kiambu or Kericho for the school entries and that balances the opportunities as laid down by the Government.Sir, at the same time, I think the Ministry should check on the Assistant Primary School Inspectors, as well as the Assistant Education Officers who are covering the divisions as some of them have no transport. I think that is a special request for the Ministry to consider. I know it is expensive to equip all these officers with motor-cars, but even scooters could easen their job in covering the various distances to do their jobs.With those few remarks, "I have given my views" on this Motion.DR. MISOI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also rise to oppose this Motion because it is a descriminative one. First of all, in my consti¬tuency, we do not have any vacancy for 'A' level students. As soon as those 'A' levels did their examinations, the facilities were converted into the 8-4-4 system. So, we cannot turn the clock backwards and create spaces that are nonexistent. The only thing we need to do is to support the contents of the Sessional Paper on education for the decade and beyond. That paper does outline the steps this country will have to take to develop the education right from nursery, primary, secondary and on to the university level.</newspeech><newspeech>DR. MISOI: Therefore, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, I oppose this Motion very strongly on the ground that we as hon. Members should, in fact, be trying to develop these schools in cur locations and divisions so that the majority of our Children can get places in these schools. I am saying this because as seen as the Government turns these schools into national schools, the district with the highest number of national schools, will stand to lose disregarding the fact that the parents in that district have developed those school through Earambee and so on. This kind of arrangement would be a disincentive and therefore, the Mover of this Motion should withdrawal this Motion completely so that we do not spend too much time debating it.With those few remarks, I oppose the motion.</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER: (Mr. Wabuge): Since there does not seem to be any hon. Member wishing to speak, I will now call upon the Hover to reply.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MYOEDA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, having listened to what hon. Members have said regarding this Motion, I feel rather surprised.I am saying this because the people who are supposed to benefit mainly by this Motion, are the people who have been opposing it. As I did say earlier on when I was moving this Motion, these A level schools were doing very well and new that we no longer have these A level schools, there are facilities that have been left behindhand they could be used as national schools.These facilities are very good and the teachers who used to teach the A level students were highly qualified, While we thank the Government for posting teachers in smaller schools which previously did not have enough teachers, it must be noted that these schools are not going to change overnight. I am saying this because most of these schools do not have the facilities as some hon. Members have already said. For example, you will find that some of these schools do not have laboratories or even laboratory equipment, teachers houses and so on. If a teacher has been teaching in a Government school for the last ten years and has been given a good house with water and electricity, you cannot decide to transfer him or her to a remote secondly school where there no teachers houses and the teachers these rent accommodation behind the in a shopping centre.Here, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am talking about, sharing the national cake. If you look at these schools, you will, find that they are concentrated in certain areas, We also knew that there are certain closes which, do very well and often send a lot of students to the University. While we are telling at out sharing the national cake, I wonder why some hon. Members stand here and oppose such a Motion. Some of them do not seem to have thought about what this Motion is talking about. There was on hon. Member who stood up and said that this Motion lack's consideration. I fell almost sure that that hon. Member does not know how many students have gone ± to the University from his own local schools. That is why he said he is happy with the situation just because Government sends teachers in these schools. I would like to inform hon. Members that this Motion is looking at the facilities that we have. It is also considering the facilities that we shall be able to lay our hands on in some years to come. We have been talking about having modern, schools, and I think this is a new concept which will take time to be implemented.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in this Motion, I am talking about the utilization of the immediate facilities that we have. If this Motion is not going to be passed, then it means that those areas that have benefited and will continue to benefit from the Government in so nary ways, will always continue to take the majority of students to the University at the expense of those schools in the most remote areas of this country. I am saying this because these less fortunate schools do not have the proper facilities and it appears that their position is not going to improve. I gave an example of one such school in my constituency which used to have A level students,which had more students going into the university than 24 other schools put together, What does this mean? There were schools in this same area which did not send even one students to the University.At the moment, we are looking for donations from foreign countries and I think it would only be fair to use seme of this money to uplift schools in the most backward areas of this country. We should think of these areasthat have been left behind in development and look for ways and means of uplifting the living standards of people in these areas.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION:  (Mr. Karauri): On a point of information, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I would like to inform the hon. Member that if a national school is built in a particular district, the quota for that district does not change just because the nationals school is there. So, whether the national school is in the district or outside the district, the. quota for the university intake remains the same. Therefore, all the districts benefit equally.</newspeech>       <newspeech>MR. KYONDA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we know that, but the point I am trying to make is that the plight of secondary school in the most remote areas of this country must be considered by the Ministry. I have many secondary schools in my areas which do not even have Government teachers I went to the Teachers Service Commission last week to ask them if they could some of send teachers to some of these schools. In other schools, you may find two, three or four Government teachers, while all the other teachers are untrained A level school leavers. Now are these schools expected to do well enough to send students to the university? We would like to see school in these areas being given enough attention by the Government so that they to can be able to send students to the University. At the moment, these schools have not sent any students to the university over the years and one wonders what they are there for. These are the type of schools I would like the Government to come out and assist, particularly in sending teachers there.	            However, if hon. Members think that this Motion is not worth its salt, I am prepared to go back to my drawing board and rephrase the Motion so that the whole country can benefit from this Motion. We would like the whole country to move together leaving any parts behind. Seme of these areas, are the same ones that were neglected by the is colonial Government and the Hyayo Government should not be seen to be perpetuating this kind of trend. So, the areas that have lagged behind educationally,should be given first priority in our development activities. We would liketo see the Government providing the  necessary facilities in these schools otherwise, they are going to remain behind forever. We would like these schools to be assisted so that they are able to complete with the other schools in the Republic.As I said here in 1980/81 hon. M Kamotho, who was the Minister for Higher Education, said "A" Levels schools were national schools "because most of them were built with Government funds.With those few words, I beg to move.</newspeech>(Question put and negatived)<header>MOTION</header>Streamlining of the Tendering System in Mombasa Municipality <newspeech>MR.KILIKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,Sir, I beg to move:- THAT, in view of the fact that Mombasa Municipal Council has failed to abide by its by laws governing the procedure of awarding tenders of recarpeting and construction of Mombasa Town Planning roads and noting with great concern that the Municipal books of accounts have not been audited for the last eight years; this House calls upon the Government to order the council to take the following measures without delay:-(c)	that the council .must be inviting tenders for recarpeting/construction of town planning roads to enable it to be awarding to the lowest tenderer provided that the lowest tenderer complies with all other conditions of the council.(d)	that the council must audit its books of accounts immediately and up-date them accordingly.(e)	that the service charges collected by the council must be accounted for accordingly.  When we talk of corruption, I think we should take the Mombasa Municipal Council as a very good example because in this council corruption is practiced openly. It is the policy of the Government, be it local or central, that all tenders must be warded through the tender system so that all these interested can tender. How, this is not case in the Mombasa Municipality As of now, we nave 34 town planning roads in the Mombasa Municipality. I have been told that the Minister himself instructed the Mombasa Municipal Council to be giving all the construction and recarpeting of the town's roads to one contractor, which is contrary to the council by laws and, I think, also to the views of the hon. Members of this House.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when a tender is given to one particular contractor the pricing of the contract is questionable. Since there is only one contractor, he will quote according to terms he has negotiated with, a few corrupt officers. Therefore, in Mombasa we are spending a lot of money which should not have been spent if the tender system was followed. The work¬manship of that contractor is also very poor because he is not supervised, there" is no competition and also because there is no specification you cannot give a specification when there is no competition. This is an abuse to Government procedure and policy. If this House cannot fight against corruption, then it is quite unfortunate; but I believe that this House will always fight corruption.I have raised this Motion because of what is happening in Mombasa today. That contractor was given work on a the road in Bomu, but now he has been given work on another road in Spaki before finishing work on the Bomu road, just because he is the only one to be giver work by the council. I am not against any contractor being given a job, but he should be given that job through the public tender system. Other people should be allowed to tender and the council's tender committee should sit down and look at the lowest tendered who meets other conditions of the council. How can we allow a public institution to be used in this way? If the Mombasa Municipal collapses, I think the Minister will be held responsible, unless he proves is that he is not behind what is happening in that council.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Wagura):On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir. If I heard the hon. Member well, he said that the Minister is behind the corruption in the Mombasa Municipality. Could he elaborate thatallegation or withdraw it because it is very serious?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I said that if the Mombasa Municipal Council collapses due to misuse of public funds, the Minister will be responsible. I said this because the Minister instructed the council to give work to only that contractor, which is contrary to the council's procedure. There are minutes showing that some councillors opposed that procedure because they do not want public money to be misused, but up to now the Minister has not taken any action on this matter: this is why I have raised this Motion.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Wagura): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I am not amused by what the hon. Member is saying. Can he substantiate his first allegation that the Minister is behind whatever is going on in the Mombasa Municipality because it is not true?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will substantiate by bringing the council minutes here, I said that when the Minister instructed the council to award tenders to only that one contractor some councillors opposed that move because they said that procedure will result in misuse of public funds and because that was contrary to the procedure of the council. The Minister has so far not responded to that opposition and that is why I deemed it fit to raise this Motion here; had the Minister taken some action I would not have raised this Motion.	' •So if the Ministry makes mistakes the Ministry should take the responsibility.</newspeech>       <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL G0VERNMENT (Mr. Wagura): On a point of order, Sir. The hon. Member is mailing the situation more worse. He is continuing to talk about the Minister as if he sits on the Mombasa Municipal Tender Board Committee. Can he give us more facts because by dragging in the Minister's name shows clearly that he is biased? I would like him to substantiate the allegation he made.</newspeech>     <newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Let us not waste time on this. Mr. Kiliku is saying that the Council made a resolution and certain members objected. Mr. Kiliku is assuming that the Minister must have read the Minutes and should have, therefore, taken action. It may be that the Minister did not read the Minutes. But if he means that the objection was registered with the Minister and he did not take action, then he is in order. Which is which Mr. Kiliku?</newspeech>     <newspeech> MR. KILIKU: I think it is the last remark you have just made, Sir. That is what I meant. I meant that the Minister did not take action with regard to the objection of the resolution made by the Council.</newspeech>          <newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Was that objection registered with the Minister in form of a letter or otherwise?</newspeech>       <newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Yes, Sir. It was minuted that that move was not good and the Council wanted to follow the laid down procedures of the Council. There must be a tender system in all councils in the country, and not only Mombasa The Assistant Minister should net take my time since he will have his time to reply If he wants me to substantiate, let him make a decision first and that is why I brought this Motion. I will bring minutes here showing where the opposition was recorded by some councillors with regard to that move. I did not say that the Minister is corrupt. I said that the Minister delayed the decision. I, therefore, beg to continue.</newspeech>     <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Wagura): On a point of order Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir. I wonder whether the Chair is satisfied with the explanation of the hon. Member. The hon. Member had been requested to prove whether the Minister was notified in the form of a letter. If he was, can we have a copy of that letter?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KILIKU: I will bring the Minutes here showing where the Minister What is wrong with the Assistant Minister?</newspeech><newspeech> THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Mr. Kiliku, you said that the objection by certain councillors was recorded and according to you the Ministry should have taken action. My argument is that the Ministry might not have read the Minutes. I wanted you to tell the House whether that objection was followed by a letter drawing the attention of the Minister to what had happened. If not, we should leave the matter there and continue.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Sir, I continue</newspeech><newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: Withdraw.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KILIKU: I cannot withdraw that</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Mr. Kiliku, there are two things here. Was that objection registered and brought to the attention of the Minister in the form of a letter?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KILIKU: It is for the Minister to say that he did not get the Minutes and not myself. If he did not get the Minutes, I will bring them. I am fighting corruption.</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): There are two clear things here. You said that the council made a resolution and awarded a tender to a certain contractor. On the other hand, there were members who objected to that resolution. The Assistant Minister wants to know whether that objection was brought to the attention of the Minister in the form of a letter. If you go by Minutes alone, then we might not get anywhere.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Let me put it right, Sir. This matter was minuted and some councillors wrote to the Minister I will bring a copy of that letter listing eight corrupt practices and urging him to take action. This one was among them and the Minister has not taken action. If the Minister has not received that letter. I will bring a copy of it on Tuesday so as to substantiate what I have just said. I said that I am fighting corruption. If the Assistant Minister is not fighting corruption, he should not be elected to this House. This is because there is no need of electing people who cannot fight corruption, we should not support this practice in a developing country. Ministers should not be corrupt.</newspeech>         <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Wagura): On a point of order, Sir. who is corrupt and who is not fighting corruption in this Government? We would like to know that.</newspeech>          <newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Order I had given you the opportunity to continue with your speech, Mr. Kiliku, but you are running yourself into a problem.</newspeech>        <newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Sir, part (b)</newspeech>         <newspeech>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Nabwera): On a point of order, Sir. The hon. Member for Changamwe has made a very serious allegation. He did not even bother to speak through the Chair. He has addressed the Assistant Minister directly to the effect that he was corrupt. Can he substantiate that?</newspeech>       <newspeech>MR. KILIKU: I said through the Chair that the Minister should not be seen to support corruption.</newspeech>      <newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: No. No. Withdraw.</newspeech>        <newspeech>MR. KILIKU: You should wait until I substantiate. If I fail to do so, it is when I can be told to withdraw. Since I have not failed to do so</newspeech>         <newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Order; I will make a ruling on this one. Mr. Kiliku has agreed to bring a letter here to substantiate the allegation he has made. We are, therefore, giving him the opportunity to do that on Tuesday. Mr. Kiliku, you can continue with your speech.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Mwenje): On a point of order. Sir. With due respect to your ruling, the latest that the hon. Member for Changamwe has said is that hoc. Ministers are corrupt. Is he prepared to substantiate and bring evidence to that effect?</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): I did not hear that. but Mr. Kiliku, did you say that the Assistant Minister is corrupt?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KILIKU: The Chair normally orders an hon. Member to substantiate or withdraw after hearing a certain allegation. Sir, if you did not hear, it means that I did not say that.</newspeech>(laughter)<newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): He has denied. We will read the HANSARD tomorrow and see what he said.</newspeech>     <newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will continue. The Mombasa Municipal Council books of account have not been audited for the last eight years now. So, I was calling upon the Ministry and the Government in general to order that the Mombasa Municipal Council books of account be audited so that we may know whether the Council has been doing a good job. We cannot know whether the Council has been doing we'll or not when the books of account have not been audited for the last eight years. Even annual reports and accounts of the council have not been presented to the Public Accounts Committee as is the requirement.</newspeech>      <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I heard the hon. Kiliku say that the Mombasa Municipal Council has not audited its books for eight years. Is that really fighting corruption? The Council cannot audit its accounts; the accounts have to be audited by somebody else Can he correct that aspect?</newspeech>        <newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is not a point of order but rather a point of information. The Assistant Minister should attend one of the seminars where points of order are taught. I said that the books of the Council have not been audited for the last eight years and we cannot know whether it has been doing a good job or not. So, I was calling upon the Minister for Local Government to order the Council</newspeech>         <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Mwenje): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I agree with the Assistant Minister, Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance's point of order. In fact, even the Motion itself is defective. If you look at part (b) of the Motion, what the hon. Member for Changamwe is now arguing against is, in fact, in writing, that the Council must audit its books. So, if what hon. Kiliku is therefore saying is correct and what is written here is correct, then the Motion is totally defective and I call for it to be disbanded.</newspeech>           <newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: Hear, Hear!</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when a Motion is put on the' Order Paper, it is for the Assistant Minister for move an amendment to it if he is not satisfied with its terms. He can amend the Motion but he cannot demand its withdrawal.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, since1 most of my time has been taken by unnecessary points of order, I will continue next time. Therefore, with those few remarks, I beg to move the Motion and request my friend, hon. Bidu, to second it. I know it will go through.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. BIDU: Ahsante' sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda. Narashukuru sana mhe. Mbunge mwenzangu kwa kunipatia nafasi hii ili niiunge Hoja hii mkono.   Bw. Naibu Spika, Hoja hii si rabaya. Kwanza nataka kumshukuru Mtukufu Rais kwa nyongeza ya marupurupu ya madiwani mara tatu hivi majuzi. Kwa sababu hii ya nyongeza ya marupurupu ya madiwani, nafikiri konseli zote' zitafanya kazi. na kutekeleza wajibu wao na kuendelea kuwahudumia wananchi vilivyo. Kwa sababu pia Hoja hii imekuja wakati unaofaa, ambapo tume elezwa kwamba vitabu vya hesabu vya Manispaa ya Mombasa havijakaguliwa kwa miaka minane, ni muhimu kufikiria ni kwa sababu gani jambo kama hilo liir.eruhusiwa kute ndeka. Nafikiri vitabu hivi havijakaguliwa kwa muda wa miaka minane kwa sababu madiwani walikuwa wakipata marupurupu kidgo. Ninaamini kwamba kwa sababu marupurupu ya madiwani yameonge'zwa mara tatu, mchafuko kama huu wa kukaa miaka minane' bila vitabu vya he'sabau kugagu liwa utakoma.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kila Wizara huwa na vitabu vyake vikikaguliwa na tukalete we ripoti hapa kuisoma. Hiyo ndiyo sababu kila mwaka fcunasoma ripoti za Wizara mbali mbali. Ni ajabu sana kuona kwamba manispaa kama ya Mombasa inaweza kukaa miaka minane bila kukagua vitabu vyake na hesabu yake: karaili kujulikana  Hili si jambo la kututia nguvu kwa sababu tunataka kila konseli iwe ikifanyiwa hesabu kila mwaka.Pia, utaona kwamba kila konseli ina wajibu wa kuhakikisha kwamba tenda zinatole'wa kulingana na she ria iliyowekwa.</newspeech>    <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL HERITAGE' (Mr. Lalampaa) On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir Did you hear hon. Kiliku telling hon. Boy, Umenunuliwa na meya wewe" and is he in order to say that?</newspeech>      <newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kweli ume'nisikia nikisema kwamba nhe. Boy amenunuliwa na Meya wa Mombasa?</newspeech>       <newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Sisi tume sikia.</newspeech>      <newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Aaaah! Labaa alikuwa akiota ndoto.         THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Order, hon. Members. We must take the House seriously. Did you say that, hon. Kiliku?</newspeech>      <newspeech>MR. KILIKU: La, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, sikuse'ma hivyo.</newspeech>       <newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge;): Proceed, hon. Bidu.</newspeech>      <newspeech>MR. BIDU: Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ningepewa nafasi niongee juu ya Hoja hii. Nilikuwa nikisema hapa kwamba ni vibaya ikionekana kwamba Manispaa ya Mombasa haifanyi kazi yake vizuri kwa. vile huchukua muda mrefu kuhakikisha kwamba vitabu vyake vya hesabu vinakaguliwa wakati unaofaa. Ninafikiri jambo hili lilitokea kwa sababu kulikuwa hakuna usimamizi mzuri. Ni wajibu wa kila konseli kuhakikisha kwamba vitabu vyake vya hesabu vinakaguliwa kila mwaka. Lakini vile ilivyo sana inaonekana hakuna yeyote' aliyekuwa akijali masilahi ya Manispaa ya Mombasa. Kwa hivyo, ninaiomba Vizara inayohusika itafute mbinu za kuhakikisha kwamba vitabu vya he'sabu vya Manispaa ya Mombasa vya miaka rainane iliyopita vimekaguliwa vifaavyo.Nikiongea juu ya tenca, nataka kusema kwamb ni lazima tenda zifikiriwW kwa makini sana kwa sababu zime'leta taabu. Tenda hazitole'wi wakati unaotakikana. Pia, kuna mambo meVigine ambayo hufanyika. Utakuta kwamba tenda zikitangazwa na maombi yameHnjmwa, mara nyingi zinakuwa ni tenda za watu maalumu na she'ria hazi fuatwi.Kwa hivyo, mambo haya hutokea kila mahali hata kule Kwale. Utaona kwamba tender fulani hukubaliva kwa sababu ni mtu fulani. Kwanza, ningeomba kuwepo na mpango maalum wa kuchagua tenders. Wizara ya Serikali za Wilaya inafaa kuhakikisha kwamba inapojadili mambo ya tenders, waheshimiwa V/abunge wa sehemu inayohusika wamehudhuria mkutano na kutoa ushuhuda kuhusu wenye tenders.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, tukiangalia Mji wa Mombasa, utaona kwamba barabara zake ni mbaya sana, na hatujui ni kwa nini barabara za mji huu, ambao tunadai ndio wa pili kwa ukubwa katika Kenya, ziwe katika hali mbaya hivi? Ni kwa sababu hakuna uangalizi mzuri wala watu wanaojali maslahi wa watu wetu wanaoishi humo. Barabara hizi sio za watu wanaoishi kisiwani peke yake, bali ni za watu wote wa Kenya. Wengi wa v/ale wanaotembelea Mombasa huona kwamba barabara kubwa ya mji huo, yaani Jomo Kenyatta Avenue, ndiyo pekee hutengenezwa mara kwa mara, lakini barabara nyingi nyingine za Mombasa ni mbovu. Jambo hili linatokana utaratibu wa tenders. Inafaa kuwe na mpango maalum wa kuhakikisha kwamba tenders zinatolewa kwa watu wanaoweza kazi, wala sio watu wenye tamaa ya pesa peke yake kwa sababu hawa ndio wanaowaumiza wakazi wa mji huu. Ikiwa Mombasa itakuwa jiji la pili la nchi hii, ingefaa tuhakikishe kuwa barabara zake ni za kiwango cha jijiTungetaka mji huu uwe ukiangaliwa kwa njia ifaayo. Ninaiunga mkono Hoja hii kwa sababu, kama nilivyosema, mji huu ni wa manufaa kwa kila mtu aliyeko Pwani. Ningeomba Hoja hii ipitishwe bila marekebisho yo yote kwa sababu Hoja yenyewe ni wazi kabisa.Kwa hayo machache, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, naomba kuunga mkono.</newspeech>(Question proposed)<newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me an opportunity to contribute to this Motion, which I take with mixed feelings. I think the Motion is highly politically—charged and, whereas there are certain good points in it, I would like the hon. Member either to take it back to the drawing board or to amend it such that we do not bring Changamwe politics into this House. 				(Applause)I see this Motion as a result of a fight between the Mayor of Mombasa and the hon. Kember for Changamwe. Those of us who come from the Coast know Mombasa politics and what is happening there. Whereas this Motion has certain merits I will support the auditing of the accounts of Mombasa Municipal Council, for example but to say that the Council's by-laws are not abided by is incorrect because we know that every local authority has a tender committee which has tendering procedures, and tenders are approved by the Minister for Local Government.In any case, this Motion is highly politically-charged and I oppose it. I request the hon. Member to try to re-draft it and bring it afresh so that we may fight the corruption that he intends to fight. I agree to the fact that corruption must be fought and that local authorities must adhere to strict standards of competence in awarding contracts, recarpeting of roads, et cetera. I also agree that the Government must urge these authorities to continue to do excellent jobs, but I do not want to see this House being brought into a political battle between the hon. Mover, who is my good friend and neighbour and the Mayor of Mombasa. I would hate to see politics coming into a Motion that would otherwise be very good if it was properly drafted and the intention</newspeech>     <newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I have been listening carefully to the hon. speaker on the Floor. He has mentioned the words "mayor" and "Changamwe politics", but these words are not in the Motion. If he is opposing the Motion he should just do so without having to bring in words that are not in the Motion. The words "mayor" and "Changamwe politics" are the assumption of the hon. Assistant Minister uttered with a motive best known to him. So, he should either support the Motion as it is or oppose it without putting his own assumption into it.</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (MR. wabuge): I think the Motion does not mention the Mayer anywhere. But you will find that the I lay or of Mombasa is the head of the Municipal Council of ombasa. Although the Motion does not mention the Mayor one would understand what it means; it means that the Mayor is the head of the Municipal Council and he should know whatever is happening,</newspeech>            <newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, does it now mean that we are no longer going to be allowed to move Motions touching on municipal councils in this country for fear of touching the mayors?</newspeech>       <newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Continue, hon. Keah!</newspeech>                 <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah): I thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for your ruling. I mentioned His Worship the Mayor of Mombasa, because he specifically comes from Changamwe, hon. Kiliku's constituency. I am talking with the hind sight of Mombasa politics. This Motion has a hidden agenda in it; quite apart from fighting corruption. It has got a hidden agenda and it is that hidden agenda which I say is highly politically charged. I know that I can propose amendments to this Motion but I feel that because of that hidden agenda I should not in fact make any amendments. I also want to make it known that I do not in any way condone corruption. It is a fact that the accounts of the Mombasa Municipal Council have not been audited for the last eight years and that is not good accounting practice and certainly the Municipal Council must take heed. It must ensure that its accounts are prepared promptly and audited promptly. I subscribe to that.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MAZAU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Without engaging in the politics that has been mention in view of the fact that when a Motion is drafted it is forwarded to the Clerk's Chambers for onward transmission to the Sessional Committee</newspeech><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge) : What is your point of order, Mr. Makau?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MAZAU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, my point of order is that by saying there is a hidden agenda in this Motion is the hon. Keah not implying that the Motion did not go through the Sessional Committee who 'should have detected that hidden agenda? It is not fair to say that the Motion has a hidden agenda and that it is bad. I say this because this Motion went to the Sessional Committee who approved it; it has gone through the necessary stages before finally arriving in the House. We there-fore should not start saying that the Motion has a hidden agenda.</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr.Wabuge): As you have rightly put it hon. Makau, this Motion passed through all the stages before coming to this House. The Motion has been moved, seconded and question proposed and therefore the Motion has become a property of this House. So, we must speak, on the Motion as it is. Whoever wants to propose amendments to the Motion let him do so and whoever wants to oppose or support the Motion let him do so.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. BOY: On a point of order. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Then hon. Keah was contributing to the Motion and he comes from the Coast he made a very valid Motion, that this Motion has hidden agenda. Was that out of order? Was he out of order to say what he said?</newspeech>   <newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Order. When anybody is debating on a Motion, he must have his own views and opinions to air. So, I take it that what hon. Keah is advancing is his opinion. Therefore, he is not saying that this Motion, as it stands, has no meaning. Through his read¬ing, he may have visualized it in that light but, as far as I am concerned, it is a straightforward Motion.</newspeech>   <newspeech>MR. BOY: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I would not like to go against your ruling but the Motion specifically talks about the Mombasa Municipal Council in which we have the mayor and the other councillors. So, when you tell the House that there is a "hidden agenda" on this Motion, is there anything wrong with that? Is that out of order?</newspeech>   <newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): You are not out of order.</newspeech>   <newspeech>MR. KYONDA: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. We have a Motion before the House and, as you have rightly put it, it is now the property of the House. The Motion is not a Mombasa Municipal Council property. I get lost when hon. Keah, who was contributing, goes on to say that there is a "hidden agenda". That does' not help those of us who are not from the Coast Province. I think the hon. Member who made that claim has to be clearer and tell us what he means by the "hidden agenda."</newspeech>   <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, in view of the short time remaining, I wi11 make my final contribution. I would like to urge the Ministry of Local Government to look very critically at this Motion and either support me in opposing it totally, or amending it. My time is up, but I wanted, with your permission, to explain what I meant by the "hidden agenda" aspect and the political ramifications. When I said there was a "hidden agenda" I meant</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Order. You cannot do that.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Mwenje): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to say a few things on this Motion, although we would have been glad to hear hon. Keah's substantiation of the "hidden agenda." I am, however, almost of the same view. This is because if you look at the Motion, with due respect to hon. Kiliku</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KILIKU: I do not want your respect.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Mwenje): Clearly, we would want to see the books of accounts of;the Mombasa Municipal Council, or for any other council or parastatal body, audited properly. But I think there is a mix-up in the Motion. The fact that it has gone through all the necessary stages does not mean that it cannot be defective. We have also seen vehicles which have gone through the manufacturing plants but, when they come out, they are discovered to be defective. Equally, whether the Motion has gone through the Sessional Committee, or whatever stage, as far as I am concerned, it is a defective Motion.</subheader><newspeech>MR. MAKAU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. My point of order, with due respect to hon. Mwenje, is that despite the politics we are talking about, we should respect the institutions through which the hon. Members Motions pass before they are brought to the House for discussion. We cannot just come here and say that because there is a claim of a "hidden agenda" the Motion is defective.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Mwenje): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have respect for all the bodies, including the Sessional Committee, through which such a Motion passes before it is brought to be debated in the House. I am not saying that the Motion was passed on by angels because anybody among those who passed the Motion could have erred; the error could have passed unnoticed, but we have noticed it here. Two wrongs do not make a right and by ignoring the error, that does not make it right. I have been an accountant and what I am saying<newspeech>MR. A.K. KINYANJUI: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Could hon. Mwenje categorically state what he is terming "defective" in the Motion?</newspeech> <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Mwenje): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will precisely do that. I am not inter¬ested in Mombasa politics, as I do not even come from there, anyway. I am specifically talking on the Motion before the House. I have even said it before that when you read through the Motion, for those who are accountants for that is what I am you will notice that there is auditing mentioned thee and it is one of the subjects that I did in school</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Kwenje):	Mr. TEMPORARY Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am dealing with a point of order.I Know there is a deliberate move in this House to waste my time just because I am opposing the Motion. I was saying that if you look at section (b) of the Motion, it says,"The Council must audit its books of accounts"I would like hon. Kinyarjui look at what the Motion is talking about. I am saying this because he does not appear to know what the Motion is talking about. He is simply saying that the Council must audit its own books, but we know that you cannot audit your own books of accounts. If you did' that, then that is not auditing. This is why I am saying</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MINISTER: Of a point of order of order, Mr Temporary Deputy "Speaker, Sir,</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Mwenje):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am still responding to the point of order raised by hon. Kinyanjui and I am sure hon. Kiliku knows the Standing Criers of this House cry only too well I third: he should be given a copy of the Standing Orders just to refresh his mind.I am saying that this Motion is defective and the hon. Member, either or leave it to the Ministry to amend it, withdraws it and redrafts it again, We are all in agreement that the sentiment of the Motion are good and we want to support it, but the Motion has certain areas which I feel should be amended. However, the major part of this Motion is defective and ought to be corrected.</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER  (Mr. Eabuge): I think we are tailing the time of the House for nothing notice of this Motion was moved in this House and then the Motion went through the Sessional Committee, and now that it has finally core here and has beer, moved and proposed, it has become the property of the House. It is the right of any hon. Member who has the chance to contribute to debate on this Motion to give his or her opinion. Therefore, if an hon. Members, stands up and says that the motion is of defective, I do not think that should cause problem. If you feel that that point of view is not correct, you can challenge it whenyou have the chance to speak. Therefore, hon. Members should not waste time on unnecessary points or order.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FINANCE AND MARKETING (Mr. Mwenje): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for that guidance. I hope that hon. kiliku will take it from you. In that content, I feel that despite the fact that I am not well versed in Mombasa politics, some of the things mentioned in this Motion as are important enough to be looked into and should not be dismissed. I am saying this because we would like to see tenders being given to people who can carry out the work on time and do it well. This applies to all work or roads in Mombasa, Nairobi, end everywhere else. Therefore, we would like this Motion to also take care of Mombasa," Nairobi. Meru, Thika and all ether town in Kenya. However, we do not want any personal issues to be introduced here. We want to see our roads being properly maintained for the benefit of our people and I would like to appeal to the Ministry concerned, to go back, even before they reply to this Motion, and look at this Motion carefully, and take the good part of this Motion, and bring a clear, and clear amendment which we a can support in this House. I am saying this because we would like to see the maintenance of our roads in Mombasa, Nairobi and elsewhere being done properly. Vie do not want to be using roads which are full of potholes.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we do not want these jobs to be given to contractors who cannot do a road job. Mow that we havecouncillors in Mombasa and  Commissioners in Mairobi, when they are awarding the contracts for the maintenance and repair of our roads, we hope that they will give out the work to people who can do this job properly.We hope it will be awaned to somebody who can do the job. Although it is not always that the lowest tenderer is able to do the job there must be good reasons why a tender is not awarded to the lowest tenderer; technical advice should be available in such a case. Further, when such cases are being handled the Ministry of Local Government should be involved it should not be left; to the local authority, alone.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, sir, we should not conclude that everything happening in the local authorities is political. It should not be assumed that the Front-bench will always oppose what comes from the Back-bench: after all, we are elected by the same people. It should be understood that before I became an Assistant Minister, I had asked for votes from the Embakasi residents and I would want to see them served well. It is thus wrong for somebody to think when some tiling is being corrected, this is being, done in order to oppose so and so. It should be understood that we are here to serve Kenyans, be they in Mombasa, Nairobi or Meru and we would like to see the right thing being done.So, the auditing of the accounts by external auditors. For purposes of making Kiliku understand auditing the auditors within local authorities are for purely internal control, We all agree that the accounts of the Mombasa Municipal Council should be auditied by external auditors in order to establish what is happening. Therefore, my appeal is that the Ministry of Local Government should</newspeech><newspeech>MR.KIRWA: On a point of order, Mir. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. In his contribution I heard hon. Mwenje refer to hon. Kiliku merely as "Kiliku".

Kiliku".</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KIRWA: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir. I think hon. Kwenje is trying to evade the issue.He said that auditing is done both internally and externally and for Kiliku to understand. He then explained further. So, I thinkit is only it is fair hon. Mr. Mwenje to address hon. Kilikuappropriately and withdraw those remarks.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING(Mr.Mwenje): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not know whetheryou heard it, but I am so used to using the word "honourable",particularly" for my friend Kiliku, that I must have used. In anycase, if I did not that word, may I now call him "hon. Kiliku"?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Sneaker, Sir. We do not have to remind hon. Mwenje that what he has done has been reported in the newspapers. So, I forgive him.</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Mr. Kiliku, I did not follow what you said.</newspeech><newspeech>MR.

MISOI asked the Minister of State, Office of the President what the minimum academic qualifications required for employment as a Chief or Assistant Chief <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Qnyancha):Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply We have no minimum academic qualifications for the appointment of chiefs and assistant chiefs but we take into account several factors that would lead the Government to appoint a suitable person. These are: He must be 28 years or above; he must be a resident of the area for which he seeks appointment: he must be of good round character with no criminal record; he must be of proven ability in development matters affecting that particular area; he must be of good personality: mature; respected and respectable and be accepted generally by the populace of the area.</newspeech>        <newspeech>MR. MATE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to what the Assistant Minister has said, that to employ a chief or an assistant chief doe's not require any academic qualification, does he imply that an illiterate person can be appointed to those positions?</newspeech>      <newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said that it depends on what area an appointment is going to be made. The general level of education in that particular area is taken into account. But, generally, and should be literate to be appointed to those positions.</newspeech>      <newspeech>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would like further clarification. The Assistant Minister says that it depends on the area an appointment is going to be made. The area is Kenya. Is there any area that he considers to be so backward that he would not want an educated, chief or assistant chief to be appointed?</newspeech>        <newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the area is not Kenya. We do not appoint chiefs or assistant chiefs to do their duties throughout Kenya. A chief is obviously appointed to look after a location and an assistant chief is appointed to look after a sub-location. So, depending on the level of Education of a particular area, an appointment is made accordingly. For example, if an area's general level of education is lower than others, we cannot fix a higher standard of academic education; we will take' into account the level of education of that particular area. I think that is quite reasonable.</newspeech>       <newspeech>MR. KUBO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister was asked by the hon. P.K. Kinyanjui to explain whether there is any particular area in Kenya where thinks people are not literate enough or properly educated. Can he answer specifically and say what the minimum requirements are?</newspeech>       <newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have not studied the' level of education throughout Kenya to know what variations we may have, but I clearly started by saying that we have no minimum academic qualifications for the appointment of chiefs and assistant chiefs.</newspeech><newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have never heard an answer which, is  not an answer in this House again. The question seeks to know what the minimum educational requirements are needed in the appointment of chiefs and assistant chiefs, and the Assistant Minister says that there are no Educational minimum requirements. He further goes on to say that for one to be appointed a chief or an assistant chief he must have some literacy knowledge, which means academic knowledge. Can he tell us what he means by literacy capability? A chief or an assistant chief is the lowest Government official enhancing development at the grassroots. So, there must be something which is considered in the appointment of a chief or an assistant chief. Can the Assistant Minister tell us what that minimum literacy criteria is and, secondly, what these factors which cannot be influenced by individuals</newspeech><newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: One question at a time.</newspeech><newspeech>DR. MISOI: One question at a time. Thank you. Can the1 Assistant Minister now tell us whether this literacy criteria is Standard IV, Std. II, nursery school, 8-4—4 Standard VIII qualification or university degree? Which is which?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Sir, there is no standardised level of academic education in this respect. For example, in the area of Kisii District where most people have gone to school and have gone beyond certain levels, it is possible to insist that applicants should be Form IV school leavers with Division III and yet, without any prejudice, we may not probably insist on that particular academic level for Turkana District.</newspeech><newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. On a point of order.MR. SPEAKER: Order, hon. Members. What is your point of order, Mr. J.N. Mungai?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. J.N. MUNGAI: My point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that looking at what the hon. Assistant Minister has said in his reply, I thought that chiefs and assistant chiefs are very important officers in implementing Government policies or in advising on developmental matters. At times, these officers will even  go  as far as reading letters for the illiterate's back at home and advise them. When the hon. Assistant Minister says that there cannot be any kind of minimum qualification for.</newspeech>      <newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: What is your point of order?</newspeech>      <newspeech>MR. J.N. MUNGAI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, would it not be in order for the Assistant Minister to set out some qualifications so that these officers can manage to advise the illiterate, especially when it comes to the question of letters?</newspeech>       <newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: That is a supplementary question.</newspeech>      <newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Can the House be made to believe that the Turkanas will continue being illiterate so that they appoint illiterate chiefs for them? That is what the Assistant Minister is imputing. This man is discriminative.</newspeech>                  (Laughter)       <newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: No, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I never said that the Turkanas are illiterate. I said, probably, and that is the word I used, the academic standard of Kisiis may be higher than that of Turkanas. In fact, we are supposed to take into account the' geheral leWl of education of the Turkanas in that particular area. That also happens in areas like Kisii and elsewhere. As long as a person has seme' leadership qualities and has some degree of education, we think we have the right person.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. FALANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, when hon. P.K. Kinyanjui said that the area is Kenya, the hon. Assistant Minister said that the area is not Kenya. I thought that any chief, irrespective of the area he may come form, comes from the Republic of Kenya. Since chiefs are civil servants, the Office of the! President should set up some acceptable standards for their appointments. When the hon. Assistant Minister says that the area is not Kenya, which is the other area he is referring to where chiefs can be got from anywhere and placed in any position?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not very sure that that question is very reasonable under the circumstances, but I will answer it all the same. The areas we are talking about are individual areas, either locations or sub-locations in Kenya. That is very clear. To be even more reasonable, we are saying that if we to go a particular area in Kisii, Turkana or Mombasa districts, we want to take the general level of education there so that whoever we pick would possibly be able to read and write, depending on the level of education of that particular area. In fact, by doing that, we are giving a lot of allowance so that we choose the best person in that particular area.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Mutiso): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Do you not agree with me that hon. Falana is misusing the privilege of the House by standing on a point of order only to raise a point of argument?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MISOI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reason why we ask Questions here is also to inform our constituents and those who are interested in being chiefs or assistant chiefs of what would be required of them. The Assistant Minister has said that a chief or an assistant chief must be acceptable to the people. Can he tell us how he goes around determining this acceptability by the people, especially when the people are not charged with the responsibility of selecting a chief or an assistant chief?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, after the formal interviews are finished the Government uses the available machinery through the special branch and CID departments to pick any other information that is necessary to make the best appointment at the end or the day. In other words, even if somebody may be to forced to attend the interview, Purely on the base of merit after picking this kind of information, he may become the best person for appointment. Because, we have taken into account other information which was not available at the beginning. So, we have a machinery for gathering information.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question, Mr. arap Chepkok.</newspeech>Question No. 535Renewal of Mr. Joshi's Work PermitMR. KUBO, on behalf of Mr. arap Chepkok, asked the Minister of State, Office of the President why he has continued to renew the work permit, No. R 437 603/D/4, for a Mr. V.S. Joshi of Highland Paper Mills Limited, Eldoret since 17th April, 1980.<newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Onyancha): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Highland Paper Mills Limited of Eldoret is a wholly owned kenya firm financed by the Industrial Development Bank (IDB) and the Development Bank of Kenya Limited (DBK). Its assets at present total up to Kshs.16 million and it employs about 54 Kenyans and only one expatriate, who is the subject of this Question.Mr. Joshi was first issued with an entry work permit number 93997 on -4th September, 1980 which authorised him to take up employement with the above company as the production manager. At the same time the company employed a suitable Kenyan by the name of Eliud Kakai to understudy this expatriate. In 1982,</newspeech>         <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Onyancha): Mr. Joshi was appointed Company Factory Manager at the same time Mr. Kakai was substantively appointed Assistant Production Manager and thereafter he was sponsored for overseas training in paper technology for six months. In 1984, Mr. Speaker, the company ran into financial and technical problems which necessitated a major rehabilitation of the factory which had to involve the external agencies. The Board of Directors considered Mr. Joshi's technical knowledge to be essential and not only for the rehabilitation process, but also for the company continued operation. Major rehabilitations of the company were completed last year. In 1989, the Board of Directors decided upon the expiry of Mr. Joshi's present entry work permit that it should not be renewed and that the Kenyan understudying him, Mr. Kakai, should appointed to replace him. However, towards the end of that year Mr. Joshi went on an overseas leave and the company decided to appoint Mr. Kakai to act as Generals-Manager. Unfortunately, during the period when he was acting as such, he misconducted himself and as a result he was considered unsuitable for the company as a senior man.  Accordingly and very reluctantly, Mr. Speaker, the management was forced to seek for the renewal of Mr. Joshi's work permit. With Mr. Kakai's departure there was a big gap left. The management has undertaken now not to seek for renewal of the expatriate's entry work permit the expiry of the present</newspeech>         <newspeech>MR. CEESIRE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.The Highland Paper Mills Limited is in my constitutency, Eldoret North. I am wondering whether it is order for an hon. Member from another constituency to are a question relating to another constituency without the courtesy of informing the Member form that particular area. In this case, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I should have been informed about the Question.</newspeech>    <newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order! Order, hon. Members. The hon. Member is very much in order.</newspeech>	      <newspeech>MR ONYANCHA: So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the management has now undertaken not to seek for renewal of the expatriates entry work permit at the expiry of the present one which is going to take place in September, 1991.</newspeech>       <newspeech>MR. KUBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not unusual for these type of people to go on manoeuvring issues so that they can get their word permits. Can the Assistant Minister inform the House as to whether this particular gentleman did not manoeuvre issues to make it appear, as if the Kenyan who was appointed had misconducted himself? There is a possibility that he is the one who colluded with others and claimed that the Kenyan was misconducting himself.</newspeech>        <newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, a very good opportunity availed itself for Mr. Kakai to take over when Mr. Joshi went overseas for a long leave. He took over as the head of the management of that company, but unfortunately, he mismanaged himself in the absence of Mr. Joshi. So, it was not planned by Mr. Joshi.</newspeech>      <newspeech> MR. MATE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the Assistant Minister is using a very general statement that Mr. Kakai misconducted, himself, can he, tell us exactly what happened because we have very strong feelings that there might have been an element of collusion to undermine Mr. Kakai so that he does not take over the post?</newspeech>         <newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have the information here about mismanagement. I am also thinking about Mr. Kakai. Could it be fair for him if I were to release the information. If the House insists, I will do that. However, is it fair for me to do that knowing very well that the man is not here to defend himself?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order! Order! I am also of the opinion that it will not be fair for Mr. Kakai to be mentioned here. If he is interested in finding out whether he was fairly or unfarily dismissed he can probably go to the Industrial Court. Next Question.</newspeech>Question No. 584Construction of Taveta Police LinesMR. KUBO asked the Minister of State, Office of the President, when the Taveta Police lines will be constructed.<newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Onyancha): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. The construction of Taveta Police lines is projected to commence during the 1992/93 financial year but to program as usual will be regulated by the availability of funds.</newspeech>      <newspeech>MR. KUBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the information I have is that these police lines were supposed to have been constructed about 10 years ago when Taveta Police Station itself was built, but the land on which the lines were to be built was wrongly allocated to somebody. There is now an alternative site and, in view of the fact that no police lines exist in Taveta at the moment because the old lines were demolished after having become unserviceable, could the Assistant Minister find out how he can help the policemen in Taveta?</newspeech>       <newspeech>MR.

OKONDO asked the Minister for Regional Development what plans the Ministry has to harness the Yala River delta for human settlement, a sugar factory and rice farming.      <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FRO REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Okwara): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.      The Ministry is already taking appropriate measures to harness the Yala River delta by making arrangements for reclamation of the swamp to make available approximately .9,200 hectares of land suitable for agriculture which will be used for settling about 2,000 families. They will use the " available land not only for their own benefit, but also contribute very positively to the national economy through promotion of self—suffiency in food production and sale of their farm produce, such as sugarcane and rice.         The Yala Swamp Reclamation and Development Project, under the Lake Basin Development Authority, is the implementing agency for the reclamation of the swamp, agricultural development and construction of other development infrastructure in the area. The project covers an area of approximately 17,500 hectares in Siaya and Busia Districts. Area No.l, which comprises of 2,300 hectares, was reclaimed in 1970 under a United Nations special fund at a total cost of Shs.7.8 million and is currently utilised as a demonstration farm.       The Yala Swamp Reclamation and Development Project will reclaim Area II, which is about 9,200 hectares. This will entail the continuation of Yala River diversion canal over a distance of 14 kilometres, diversion of Wiru (?) River on the northern boundary of the swamp, construction of the main drainage canals, irrigation infrastructure, dredging four kilometres of Lake Sare and construction of a bridge at Usenge Causeway.        The reclaimed land under Area II, approximately 9,200 hectares, will be utilised to settle about 2,000 landless families who will use the available land to positively contribute to self-suffiency in food production and the national economy through the sale of their farm produce, such as rice and sugar.</newspeech>         The reclaimed land will make it possible for farmers to produce enough food for themselves and other market needs in other parts of the country. Agriculture in the reclaimed land will play an important role in feeding the population, generating employment and income and contributing foreign earning and inducing gwoth of agro—based industries, such as sugar factories, rice mills and other sectors of the economy.      The Ministry has already started contacting possible foreign donors in order to finance the implementation of Area II of the project, which will cost approximately Shs.l billion. However, to date, the Ministry has not yet received any positive reply from any donor.</newspeech>         <newspeech>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</newspeech>         <newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Is it truly a point of order?</newspeech>          <newspeech>MR. BIDU: Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is nothing but a true point of order. Is the Assistant Minister in order to read out such a lengthy answer when he can summarise it?</newspeech>          <newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: It is very much in order to od so.</newspeech>          <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Okwara): Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. For information, hon. Bidu pledged to "roast" me this afternoon.           The Ministry has already started contacting possible foreign donors in order to finance the implementation of Area II of the project, which will cost approximately Shs.l billion. However, to date, the Ministry has not yet received any positive reply from any donor. When the swamp land under Area II has been reclaimed, another 2,000 families will be settled in the area, and the will grow crops such as sugarcane, rice, robusta coffee, citrus fruits, maize, beans and sorghun.</newspeech>       <newspeech>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a sugar factory will be constructed in the area when the land under Phase II has been reclaimed and. farmers have grown adequate sugar-cane for the factory. Also when the swamp land under Phase II has been reclaimed, farmers will grow rice in the irrigated land. The Yala Swamp Reclamation and Development Project, will promote rice farming by assisting farmers with support facilities such as transport and farm machinery, establishment of  rain-fed rice farm; construction of rice mill's, rural access roads and to organize seminars and courses for rice farmers. A demonstration plot will be established and offices will be constructed.       Thank you, Mr." Speaker, Sir.</newspeech>       <newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Assistant Minister for that long answer which has gone a long way to answer some of the questions I had raised. But he has raised a number of issues which require clarification by way of answers to supplementary questions. He has also talked about millions and also billions of shillings. Has he considered diverting the Yala River through Nyamonye by the use of National Youth Service?   This will cost about KShs.10 million and this is better than borrowing billions and billions which we may never be able to pay</newspeech>      <newspeech>MR. OKWARA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said that we are looking for a donor to finance Phase II. of the Project .and cost will be onlyEShs.l billion. We have, however, not considered the use of National Youth Service.</newspeech>      <newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, KShs.l billion in ordinary language is one thousand million shillings! will the Ministry consider using the N.Y.S. to divert the flow of the Yala River through Nyamonye Stream? This has been, estimated to cost not more than KShs.lO million.</newspeech>        <newspeech>MR. OKWARA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, with due respect to the hon. member, it appears as if the entire National Youth Service will be directed to Bunyala Constituency. This because this morning we were talking about the same thing and now the hoN. Member is asking for the services of the National Youth Services.</newspeech>        <newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: But what is wrong with that?</newspeech>       <newspeech>MR. OKWARA: With due respect, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we shall look into this matter; the possibility of making use of the N.Y.S.</newspeech>        <newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr, Speaker, Sir, I thank the Assistant Minister for promising to look into the possibility of making use of the N.Y.S. to implement that project. Would the Assistant Minister also look into the possibility of diverting the River so that the whole Yala Delta not just Phase I and Phase II is rendered usable for human settlement and production of crops? I say this because Kenya does not have enough land and some of the land is under water. Will the Assistant Minister use the N.Y.S. to reclaim more land?</newspeech>       <newspeech>MR. OKAWARA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, x I said that we are in the process of implementing Phase II of the project; We are in the process of reclaiming the land. The exercise will cost money and I would request the Member for Bunyala to bear with us.</newspeech>        <newspeech>DR.

SPEAKER: Mr, Mate's Question."</newspeech> Question No.5-30Expansion of Siakago Law CourtsMR. MATE asked the Attorney-General since the sitting and office facilities at Siakago Law Courts are inadequate, what arrangements he is making to expand these law courts.     <newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Mull): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.It is true that Siakago Law Court is not only congested but also quite old. Nothing has been done to expand or modernise the court due to financial constraints. However, the Judicial Department is making arrangements to expand and renovate the building, we have already written to the Magistrate there to give us the court's requirements.</newspeech>         <newspeech>MR. MATE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me start by thanking the Attorney-General for sending a magistrate to Siakago." At one time we did not have a magistrate and the. Attorney-General was kind enough to post one there after I had put my request to him through this House.   I would also like to thank the Attorney-General for the reply he has given to me. Would he tell the House when these people are going to enjoy the facilities of a mondern law court?I ask this question "because the Attorney-General has only said that arrangements are being made to renovate and expand the court and we appreciate that. But could he be more specific and tell the House when the people of Siakago will enjoy the facilities of a modern law court?</newspeech>          <newspeech>MR. MULI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not know whether my friend, hon. Mate, is right to say that people should enjoy the facilities of a modem court. I have always thought that we go to court to deal with offenders and for that matter there is very little to enjoy there„ If he was talking about those who work in the court I would have agreed with him. However, it is very difficult for me to say when this work will be completed is not easy for me to say whether it is during this financial year or during the next financial year. This morning I answered another Question by hon. KUBO about Taveta Law Court and I told him that Taveta Law Court will be given priority, ana little did I know that this afternoon I was going to answer another Question dealing with an old court. All that I can say is that Siakago Law Court will be given priority; perhaps next to Taveta Law Court.</newspeech>         <newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Let us go back to Mr. Kipkorir's Question.</newspeech>Question No.588Livestock Field Officers for Embutut LocationMR. KIPKORIR asked the Minister for Livestock Development why the Ministry has not posted field officers to advise farmers on zero-grazing methods in Embotut Location and when they will be posted.</newspeech><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (MR. Chesire): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Ministry will post a field officer to every location as soon as the Ministry has been given enough of such officers in the staff establishment as has been requested for.</newspeech>     <newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could we know from the Assistant Minister who is supposed to be asking for the officers? Is it the Ministry or the wananchi?</newspeech>        <newspeech>MR. CHESIRE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have made a request to the Directorate of Personnel Management for an increased establishment and we have not been allocated any. As soon as that allocation is made, the nece¬ssary arrangements will be carried out. As we all know, the funding of salaries to every Ministry is approved in this august House and, as far as I know, we do not yet have the additional funds for the extra staff that we require.</newspeech>	      <newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Speaker, sir, while thanking the Assistant Mini¬ster for a positive reply, recently there was an outcry of unemployed officers, like the ones being requested. The policy of the government is to absorb these people. Could the Assistant Minister assure the House that after such officers have been absorbed one will be sent where the hon. Member sought to have such an officer? It is only the other day were discussing the Ministries allocations and, therefore, it should not take so long to do that. Could the Assistant Minister give that assurance?</newspeech>         <newspeech>MR. CHESIRE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did specifically say that it is our intention to have, at least, one officer at every location to do the work that the hon. Member wishes to be done. That posting of the officers will be done as and when they are allocated. We have actually requested that for Embobut Location, in particular, some of the officers in Tot Loca¬tion will be serving that location so that no area stays without any such attendance.</newspeech>         <newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Speaker, sir, can the Assistant Minister agree with me that there is poor planning in his Ministry since we are always missing these vital officers? Every, year Egerton produces a lot of vete¬rinary officers and they are not giver, any work. So, now we have a short¬age of those officers in very many areas in the Republic. Could he agreewith me that there is poor planning in his Ministry and so they should even resign from their posts?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. CHESIRE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do net know whether the hon. Member claimed that there is poor planning, or funding in the Ministry. If he means there is poor planning, then I do not agree with that suggestion.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is true that there is poor plan¬ning, as has been claimed by hon. Ekidor. If we can have so many veterinary graduates and they are not despatched to assist people where they are required, then the reason must be poor planning by the Ministry.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. CHESIRE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member made a statement, but I want to make it clear that as soon as we get the necessary funding, the graduates he is talking about will be employed. However, they cannot be employed without the necessary funds.</newspeech><newspeech>MR.KUBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to return to the question raised by hon. Ekidor that the Ministry was fully aware that the veterinary services would be required all over the country and that there are sufficient veteri¬nary officers to do the job who are just roaming about because they have not been employed. So, the question is why the Ministry, and Government, did not plan for these people so that at the completion of their courses they could be despatched to the different areas of the country where they are needed, instead of just dumping people who are very highly qualified. I think the Assistant Minister should agree that it is the collective responsibility of the Govern¬ment and that this matter should not be taken lightly.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. CHESIRE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me say that the hon. Member, equally must have that collective responsibility just as much as is expected of Ministers and Assistant Ministers. This is because all Government funding of our Ministries is done in this House. He should, during the discussion on the Budget, have raised these issues and asked for an additional allocation to be made, but I am afraid, he did not do that.</newspeech><header>QUESTIONS BY PRIVATE NOTICE</header>Payment of Gratuity to Mr. Chemweno<newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister of State, Office of the President the following Question by Private Notice.Why has Mr. Yego Chemweno, P/No. 141023/5, former Assistant Chief of Nerkwo Kilima Sub-Location, who retired on 19th July, 1980, not been paid his gratuity and other retirement benefits?THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Natswera): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.According, to records in my Ministry, Mr. Yego Chemweno P/No.141023 was paid his gratuity and other retirement benefits through the Treasury cheque No. 008303 of 15th January, 1981.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, how much money was paid to the an?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, Mr. Chemweno had been overpaid and, therefore, part of the money was deducted from the total amount. He had been overpaid by Ksh.1,701.50 and that was deducted from his dues so that he was left with Ksh.8,804.75.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr: Speaker, Sir, is that gratuity or pension?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. NABWERA:' Mr. Speaker, Sir, the officer in question was on temporary terms and, therefore, was not entitled to any pension.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, is it in order for somebody like the Assistant Chief in question to have worked up to the attainment of that old age to be still on temporary terms of employment? Why would he not be considerd for permanent basis of employment?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is true that we have had some officers working on temporary terms for very long periods of time. That is why as an Assistant Chief in those days he qualified for nearly Ksh.10,000/- which was quite some money.</newspeech><newspeech> MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Speaker, Sir; if the officer was working on tempo¬rary terms of employment, how did the Minister arrive at the Ksh.8,804.00?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. NABWERA: That was his entitlement, taking into consideration the period he had worked for the Government. If you have been working for the Government for a given period and you are not entitled to pension", the Government normally pays you a gratuity and other benefits, but you are not entitled to any pension.	Admission of Master Mutembei: Machakos Approved School</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Home Affairs and National Heritage the following Question by Private Notice.Could the Minister confirm the presence of Master John Mutembei reportedly admitted at Machakos Approved School as inmate No. 10151?</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL HERITAGE (Mr. Nooru): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.I confirm that Mr. John Mutembei was admitted at Machakos Approved School on 11th October, 1988 as inmate No. 10151. However, Master Mutembei escaped from the Machakos Approved School on 26th March, 1990. The disappear¬ance of Mr. Mutembei was reported to the Machakos Police Station and to the Children's Officer, Meru with instructions to contact the parents. The parents were duly informed of the incident. Since then the police, my officers and the parents are still searching for Master Mutembei. I am happy to note that the parents of the inmate are in constant touch with my Meru office and have promised to notify us as soon as Master Mutembei's whereabouts are known.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS All NATIONAL HERITAGE (Mr. Kooru)(Ctd.; Mr. Speaker, Sir, I -could like to appeal to the hon. Member for Igembe, hon. Malebe who has brought this Question to the House, to encourage the parents to continue co-operating with the police and my department in Meru, to trace the boy. This is not the first time for a child or an inmate to escape from our institutions, but whenever such cases come to light, we have always sought and received co-operation and assistance from the police, the parents and the community which has proved very useful in most cases.</newspeech>   <newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell this Souse, the means they have been using in this case to trade the lost child from the approved school. If they do not use the police machinery, how are they going to trace the boy?. The parents of this boy are complaining about the way this case has been handled and the Ministry should now take full responsibility of looking for the child.</newspeech>         <newspeech>MR. NOORU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the search for this child is a collective responsibility of ray Ministry, the police and the parents. As I have already informed the hon. Member and the House, we have already set the machinery to work and the search still continues with the hope that the findings will be positive in the near future.</newspeech>    <newspeech>MR. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fact that' this child was admitted in this particular school means that he was a delinquent and therefore trouble¬some. This means z the boy neded to be under constance eye of the authorities at the school. Could the Assistant Minister deny or accept that there was negligence on part of the school and this resulted into the disappearance of the child?</newspeech>  <newspeech>MR. NOORU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not accept that there was any negligence on part of the school administration. I am saying this because the child was admitted into this school for the first time in October 1985 in class II and for a period of three years, he had not shown any arrogance, or disobedience and his conduct had improved, a great deal according to the school assessments He had not shown any signs of wanting to disappear at any one time while he was in the institution.</newspeech>         <newspeech>Mr. MALEBE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the Ministry is taking the disappearance of this child very lightly indeed. I am saying this because the parents were informed that their child had disappeared only in July, vhile he had actually disappeared in March. Here is a case where child just disappears and the parents are not informed until after four months. Even as of today, the parents of this boy do not know the whereabouts of the child. Therefore, would the Ministry undertake a much more serious search for the child since the child was under their custody when he disappeared?</newspeech>      <newspeech>MR. NOOKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is the responsibility of my Ministry, hon. Kalebe and every Kenyan to make sure that this child is found. As I have already said, we have already set our machinery through the Kenya police in motion and we hope to trace this child in the near future.</newspeech>    <newspeech>MR. KALZRE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister really in order to arrogantly refuse to tell this House what arrangements they have been making to trace this child. I am saying this because we have recently heard of cases where children have been murdered and this is a very serious issue. Therefore, could the Assistant Minister at least tell us what they have so far done to trace the child? I an asking this because it appears that the Ministry is not bothered by this matter and they are just sitting and waiting for miracles to happen.</newspeech>     <newspeech>MR. NOOKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already informed the hon. Member that the child escaped under circumstances that could not have been avoided. The fact that we have put the search machinery in motion is a clear indication that we have done something about it and if the hon. Member is not satisfied with the action we have already taken, I would take the risk of accompanying him on a iy bicycle oi in a motor vehicle to look for the child.</newspeech>       <newspeech>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is it really in order for the Assistant Minister to still refuse to tell this House how far they have gone in their attempt to look for this child. The way the Ministry is treating this case seems to give one the impression that the child.will never be found alive. Why has it taken too long for the police to respond? The parents of this child keep going to check for reports at the Police Stationalmost every day without any hope How long is the Ministry going to take to tell us what is happening to this Child. We  would like to know whether he is dead of alive.</newspeech>       <newspeech>MR. NOORU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think that is more of a point of argument than a point of order. Nevertheless, I would like to repeat that we axe still looking for this child because we value the life of human beings.  The life of a 12-year child is very precious ana therefore, we are doing verything possible to search for the boy and we shall report back to the parents as soon as we get any positive results.</newspeech>                <newspeech>MR. PALANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is the responsibility of this particular Ministry to look for this child and what this House would like to know is from the day that this child got lost up to date what progress report can the Ministry give to this House? We know they are looking for the child and we appreciate their efforts, but could the Assistant Minister give us the progress report of what they have done. It is now eight months since this boy got lost and they cannot say that they still do not know anything about his whereabouts.</newspeech>         <newspeech>MR. NOORU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the truth of the matter is that this information has been passed onto every police station in Kenya we have also informed all the chiefs and assistant chiefs in the locality and we are waiting for information from these people. Perhaps the child has gone to a place where he cannot be identified but we are sure that he is going to resurface somewhere somehow.</newspeech>         <newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question.</newspeech>	<newspeech>MR. ICEPKORI: asked the Minister for Cc-operative Development why the management of the Kenya Planters W Co-operative Union terminated the services of Mr. William K. Tanui, C.Ho.2292, on 6th July, 1990.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTS MINISTER FOR CO-OPERATIVE- DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Ejore): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.On 8th June, 1990, Mr. William Tanui was offered employment by the Kenya Planters Co-operative Union as a watchman. He was given a salary of K.Shs.l,980.90 and a house allowance of K.Shs.700/- per month. However, the management found that after receiving his salary at the end of every month, Mr. Tanui goes drinking and does not report on duty ana when he finally decides to come to work, he does not clock in or out. Therefore, the K.P.C.U decided to terminate his services.</newspeech><newspeech>MR.KIPKORIE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not think what the Assistant Minister has said i6 true because Mr. Tanui himself has been complaining bittery about the decision that the management took to sack him. Could the Ministry try to have this man reistated because he did not make any mistake.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. EJORE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sorry to say that this man cannot be reinstated. In fact, he was lucky to have received one months salary and in lieu of notice all amounting to Shs.2,472.90. He was under probation for six months but unfortunately, he had not completed this probation period. For the period of three months that he was in employment, most of the time, he was found drunk.</newspeech><newspeech>Mr. SPEAKER: Next Order.</newspeech>Second Heading<header>The Appropriation Bill</header>(The vice rresndeno and Minister for Finance on l3.11.90)(Besmnption of Debate interrupted on 13.11.90)           <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION. (Mr. Munyi): Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the House adjourned yesterday I had touched on the tea industry. I am happy that when the Minister for Agriculture came to Embu on 29.10.90 he announced that tea factories will he built in Emeu, Meru, Kakamega and in two other places. May I take, this opportunity to, on behalf of the people of Embu and my constituents, thank the Minister for having taken that action at the right time. Now we are only waiting for the construction of these tea factories to be started. Our very dynamic Minister for Public Works, hon. Mibei, who also represents tea growers in Kericho, was present during that occasion.In fact, we have another tea factory at Rukurire,whose foundation was laid by his Excellency the President in 1981, soon after the OAU Heads of State and Government Summit, This factory has produced the best tea not only in Kenya but also in the world. Next to this factory we have the Rakoririe Mixed Secondary School and I am happy that we have been assured that the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education, will present science equipment to this school at the beginning of next year. Yesterday hon. Mate raised the issue of the toll station, which is actually not at Ens. "but at Kivwe in Embu. Our IDC rejected the siting of the toll station at En a but the Ministry of Public. Works cunningly sited it at Kivwe. I am, therefore, asking the Ministry of Public Works to comply with the resolution of the DDC, Embu and remove the toll station from where it is now because is inconveniencing farmers and other wananchi a lot, The Ministry,	after removing the toll station from where it is, can approach our DDC and it will he told where to site the toll station.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to comment on the railway line extension from Sagana through Emhu to Meru. Recently the Executive Chairman of the Kenya Railways Corporation talked about some railway line extension but he seemed to have forgotten that the Embu DDC and the Provincial Planning and Monitoring Committee had approved many years back that a railway line be extended from Sagana through to Meru. I would like to ask the Ministry of Transport and Communications to remind the corporation that there are plans and survey maps which were prepared by officers from both the corporation ana the Ministry and that we would like this project to be implemented so that railway line can be used to transport agricultural products like tea, coffee and horticultural crops.This is because the area is quite flat and, therefore, it will be very easy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for transportation of goods to be carried out between Sagana, Embu and Meru.I would like to come to another very important point which was raised by His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance, hon. Prof. Saitoti about the meeting which he held with Congress men; senators from United States of America. He told them very clearly that Kenya policy is this was expounded when the Kanu Review Committee was going around throughout the country that nobody from outside should come and tell us how we can uphold the security of our own country because we know it better. For example, in the United States of America, they know better about the security of their own country. I know Americans very well. You can discuss anything with them, but when it comes to security matters either effecting the Federal Bureau of Investi¬gations or the Central Intel legence Agency, the matintain. that is their own concern. Mr. Speaker Sir. They will never compromise with you. Why should they tell us that we should compromise as far as the security' matters are concerned. We know how to maintain our security. They have been laughing at Africans or telling us that we do not know how to maintain our security and that there is no peace in our country. As we all know, Kenya has peace. Why do they not tell others that they should come to Kenya to learn about the democrary. Is there any other country which is as democratic ay Kenya, Mr. Speaker, Sir, having visited all those countries? No, there is no other country. Everyone in Kenya is free. If there are some shortcomings being done by individuals, those are individual matters. As far as democracy is concerned, is there any other country in Africa which is as free as Kenya? There isno other country. In Kenya you can move day and night freely and nobody will follow you; you are free to critizise; and you are also free to write anything in newspapers. For example, the Financial Times is written by people who have been told what to write by their masters. What they wrote the other day was nonsensical and we are not going to accept that. They are told by their masters what they should write since they are not patriotic. I would like Mr. Speaker, Sir, courses to be organized for Kenyan lawyers and journalists so that they can learn what is patriotism.        Mr. Speaker, Sir, hon. Keah recently visited Germany, and other countries. He is aware of the fact that whenever you go somewhere they must know what you are doing and where you are going. Even Britain, Japan and those countries do the same. Here in Kenya you are free to do anything which you want. Therefore, I would like to congratulate His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for having made it very clear to those Congress men that we strongly support our President, and the ruling part, KANU. He shall never be given conditions by outsiders. For example, Cuba, is next to the United States of America ana the latter tried to interfere with their internal affairs, but they did not succeed because Cubans were united. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we should all be united in Kenya and that should start here in Parliament. Recently councillors were given something which made them very happy and they are now ready to protect our country wherever they are in the rural areas, Mr. Speaker, Sir. For example, those who live in Mandera, Webuye, Kakamega, Kwale, Turkana or elsewhere should be ready to protect the interest of our country. I am therefore, inviting journalists to join us so that we can build one united nation devoid any type of discrimination.Our President has done wonders. Yesderday, he was been presented with a doctorate degree in. Japan because people in Japan know what he has done. He has raised the number of universities from one to four. Which other country in Africa has done even a quarter of what Kenya has achieved? There is no other country. It is only Kenya which has done that, Mr. Speaker, Sir. His Excellency the President invited tourists from Japan and Korea to visit Kenya. Kenya Airways the other day was given money by the Vice-President ana Minister for Finance so that it can boost its operations. They are operating very good airbuses.        His Excellency the President that tourists will be travelling from Japan to Bangkok from where they will be brought to Kenya by Kenya Airways. We wish them success whenever they come to Kenya. We can increase the number of tourists who come to Kenya. At present we get about 800,000 tourists. If we can get at least 5 million tourists, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure, our country will earn about Kshs.5 0 billion per year from tourism. This would only be possible if the number of tourists could be raised from 800,000 to 5 million per year. I am sure, if that happens the money which tourism brings to Kenya can increase within one year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we shall be getting at least Kshs.50 billion and many people will He employed in the tourist industry.       Mr. Speaker, Sir, a country like Seychelles, which you have visited is a small country, I think, with about 200,000 people. However, about 2 million tourists visit that country.       I therefore, co not see the reason why we cannot attract more tourists from other countries to visit our country. We have got very many tourist attractions in Kenys. For example, we have good hotels at the Coast, Nairobi, Turkana, Lake Baringo, Lake Bagoria and many others. The other day I went to Lake Bagoria and I saw flamingoes in billions. They are wonderful birds.When we went to Turkana, we saw a number of hotels there and I am sure a lot can be done. Since there are other hon. Members who want to contribute to this Bill. I would only say that I support it and urge the Vice-President and Minister for Finance to go ahead and implement it. I am also appealing to Ministries to release the funds which were given by the Office of the Vice- President and Ministry of Finance so that they can be used to help our people in the rural areas. I would like to emphasize that in future our country will not accept assistance with strings attached. I beg to support the Bill.</newspeech>        <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND HOUSING (Mr. Mutiso): Thank you Sir, for giving me this opportunity to air views on this important Bill.First of all, I would like to congratulate the Vice-President and Minister far Finance for the manner in which he moved this Bill. This Bill caters for most of our needs as far development is concerned. I would like to highlight some points which I urge the Government to take into consideration.     When the American Senators came here, they had discussions with our Vice-President and Minister for Finance but the interview they held with which was and/reported in the local Press, gave a totally different picture. It also gives a different impression with respect to what said by the BBC when they went back. This is a very sad thing for a Government worth its salt to say that unless this and that is done, no aid would be forthcoming. This is the first time we have heard this kind of thing being said openly. We have been receiving aid in the past and even if there were strings attached, they were very invisible that the public did not even know about them. The public and not know what was contained in those agreements. To give conditions is, in my opinion, going too far. Kenya is an independent country and it shouldnot be assumed that we cannot survive without receiving aid from developed countries.I would like to congratulate the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for the stand he took to the effect that Kenya is not a dictatorial country and that it cannot accept dictatorship because of aid it gets from a foreign power. We want to remain what we are; we want to continue running this  country like we have done in the past. If any country wishes to give Kenya aid it should not attach, strings to it. This is because it is upon us to decide how we want to use that aid and for what purpose. In other words, such countries want to make Kenya a puppet Government. cannot accept this. We will survive whether they give us aid or not. We want to run Kenya by ourselves according to our own policies.     For the last 27 years, Kenya has been run under a one party system of Government, we know how we can mould the feelings of Kenyans together under one party. This was proved in 1965 when all other political parties dissolved themselves voluntarily and decided to join hands with Kanu. From that moment, Sir, you have seen the kind of development that Kenya has achieved. We are now being told that unless we do this and that, we will not get foreign aid. We cannot accept this kind of dictation.           The Government of President Moi has united Kenyans more than ever before. The President has toured all the provinces of this country and members of all ethnic groups feel that they are part and parcel of the Kenya Government. This is the first time this kind of thing has been felt. Some of us seen the running of this Government and the past Government and we can tell the difference. It is folly for anybody to think or to believe that the present Government is not democractio or is not representing the views of the majority in this country.        The President has visited all provincial headquarters and held big rallies where wananchi have expressed full support for the Government the ruling party Kanu and to the President himself. Some people still hold the feelings that this is not enough. I do not know what kind of Government they would like this country to have. This is the choice of our people: They would like to be led under one political party because they have the experience of multi-party system of Government.when we had Kadu, A?? and so on, we saw wars and battles and theirs hatred that was brewed within the ranks as far as various tribes were concerned.</newspeech>          <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Mutiso): We do not want to go back to that kind of thing. We are satisfied and we are prepared to defend our rights to choose our own political destiny. We' shall never be dictated by the money of the developed nations. Let them be told that we will go ahead with what we have and that we will run our country without their support. It is really surprising to see some body saying in the: newspapers that unless we do A, B, C and D we will not get aid and even saying that unless we change to pluralism we' cannot get aid. They want to put us into chaos.</newspeech>        <newspeech>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the problem is that the white man has never understood the African. When an African says that he hate's you, he really means it and there is no joke about it. Therefore, we want to hold Kenya the way we are holding it under one Kanu umbrella because we' know that by creating more political parties we are creating room for more differences and more hatred and also give chance for reviving tribal feelings which were enhanced during the dissolved tribal societies, some of which were grooming Government under their umbrella of tribalism.     I want to say that we can never have' a better government than the one we have today. We can not have a better leader than the one we have today. President Moi is a unique person. God has said that he' always works miracle's with the humble people, those who seem to be ignored or those who are not higly valued or who do not raise themselves high up. God says that he will elevate those who lower themselves. Kenya is satisfied with the leadership of His Excellency the President and we have? no comparison or substitute to him. This must be known by those who aspire and collude with foreign powers to stir trouble in this country.         We have seen it for all the period that His Excellency has lead this nation. Kenya has made great stride's in development, end we will continue' pursuing that line.             As His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance said yesterday Kenya is a democratic country. We have chosen our own way of democracy and even where there are mistake's we know that the Kanu Review Committee will corse up with some recommendations to change' the' situation. Anything that is growing must have some mistakes. We accept that if there have been some mistakes they will be corrected, but we will remain under one party. That is the point I wanted to emphasise and tell those who want to see Kenya being dragged into chaos by many political parties that they are' dreaming because the majority of Kenyans support one? political party.      With those few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Bill.</newspeech>       <newspeech>MR. JALANG'O: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to speak on this very important Appropriations Bill. Firstly, I would like to give very spacious support to the stand taken yesterday by His Excellency the Vice-president and Minister for Finance? on what Kenya considers to be its position in so far as its acceptance and processing of foreign aid is concerned.               Mr. Speaker, Sir, Kenya is a sovereign state and its sovereignty cannot be compromised by any means or from whatever quarter. It becomes very unusual and unheard of for anybody, whether a friend of Kenya or not, to lay down unacceptable conditions for the giving of aid. It is like giving one item to you and, at the same time, it is doctored with poison. This is the tupe of aid which Kenya does not accept, and we said no to conditions. So, I fully support the santd taken by the Vice-President and Minister for Finance yesterday. All of us do so and will continue to support that stand, that our sovereignty is not to be compromised by aid. We would say to hell with that type of aid if it is so conditional as it is.             Mr. Speaker, Sir, only recently we had the opportunity to debate the conduct of what used to be, or so called, a friendly country in this House and we told the Government of Norway, in no uncertain terms, that Kenya is not going to be dictated to by any country. Kenyans are' mature and know who their friends are. Kenyans have decided on a route to follow and nobody is going to tell Kenya to leave the route of Nyayoism. We will continue with that route until the end of the world.Turning to the Appropriations Bill itself, Sir I would like to echo or to support the sentiments expressed by its Mover yesterday and also talk about wastage. We are in a situation whereby we have to economise; we have to tighten our belts, and I would like to call upon all Ministries and parastatals and anybody touching public finds to ensure that we tighten our belts and economise Prior to the Guld crisis, the cost of crude oil was US$18 per barrel. The projections for November and early December are US$45 per barrel. As the situation in the Guld worsens, the projects might even hit the US$50 mark to the barrel. Most of our manufacturing concern, transport industry, agriculture' and tourism are related to fuel, and every time there is a rise in the fuel bill all these are affected. Kenya presently relies very heavily on tourism and agriculture' because these are the mainstay of our economy. Once these are affected by the escalating oil bill, obviously they will affect the end result. This is why it is important that we try to economise. "This is why it is important that we try to economise the use of the little fuelwe have. Ministry personnel should be the first people to demonstrate how to economise on the use of fuel. It is high time that Government vehicles were used only on very essential services.</newspeech (Hon. Nassir crossed the Floor without bowing to the Chair)' <newspeech>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I saw hon. Nassir crosses the Floor without bowing to the Chair.</newspeech> <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Nassir): Bw. Spike, naomba-msamaha. Ningependa kusema pia kwamba ninafurahi kujua kwamba kuna mhe. Mbunge anayeangalia vile ninavyofanya hata ninapotembea.</newspeech>"	<newspeech>MR. MANG’OLI:	On a point of information, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Hori.Male be did not see well what hon. Nassir did, but I saw it because I am very close to the door. </newspeech><newspeech>MR. JALANG’O: 	Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was saying that at a time-like this we would like our various Government Ministries and parastatal bodies to demonstrate to wananchi that there is likely to be a crisis over fuel shortage. All Government and parastatal vehicles should be used only in the provision of very essential services. Whenever there is a crisis, we should demonstrate and show the common man that we are trying to save the meagre resources that we have. If we continue to be wasteful, this will not help. When we talk about discipline, we should remember that we can only discipline others when we ourselves are disciplined.	It is high time Ministries curbed wasteful use of Government vehicles."Presently, it is becoming more and more essential services of theGovernment to be rendered. In the case of the Ministry of Information andBroadcasting, for example, there is already a cry due to lack of fuel. Whenyou ask agricultural extension officers why they do not move-about, they say that it is due to lack of fuel. The same applies to administration staff. Solack of sufficient fuel is already a biting problem and this situation islikely to continue. I would like to make a very special appeal that we try to tighten our belts now and not wait until the situation get out control:  Westill have up to 30th June, 1991 before the money allocated to various Ministries gets exhausted, but there is always a very disheartening tendency where you find that when it comes to around February or March of a financial year, various arms of the Government are not able to move because of lack of funds. Is it not high time that various Ministries started a systematic approach to "expenditure, particularly Recurrent Expenditure? If a Vote is allocated for 12months we would like to assume that this money will take the Ministry concerned up to 30th June of the financial year in question. It is very disheartening to find that around February or March various Ministries already stranded simply due to lack of adequate funds. Can we not plan to make funds available up to 30th June of a given financial year? The situation is even worse when you look at Development funds. You find that a lot of development projects that have already been carried forward from one financial year being carried forward to the next financial year. When funds are approved for a new financial year, you find that nearly half of the previous year's bills have to be settled first before the present year's bills can be considered. I think it is high time the planners in various Ministries started to reconsider the best approach to the use of funds in such a way that the funds they have take them to the next financial year. Coronary to this is the question of revenue collection. It is very easy to spend money, but it becomes extremely difficult for most Ministries to collect revenue. I would like us to become more serious in revenue collection because without revenue, this country cannot run even very essential services. I would further recommend that in cases where Ministries fail to collect revenue, they be surcharged just as much as when they over-expend because the two issues go together. There is no need of surcharging an officer for over-spending whenanother officer who under-collects revenue is not surcharged. I would like tosee intensification of collection of revenue in all Government Ministries and parastatal bodies.  Touching very briefly on my Constituency Rarieda I would like to make a very special appeal to the Ministry of Transport and Communications to implement the District Development Committee's recommendations in respect of the Rural Electrification Programme in Rarieda Division. This project wasapproved in	1988 and reappraised in 1989. To date, we have been waiting, butno such project has been started. I would like to find out why such recommendations are not implemented even after funds have been made available for this purpose. This also goes for telephone services in my division. Such services and other infrastructure facilities are the only way in which a rural area can develop. Without telephone services, passable roads and electrification, no area can develop. I would also like to appeal to the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources too to implement the afforestation programme in my division. This project was approved two years ago, and every year we-appeal for its .	implementation the answer we get is that it will be done when funds becomeavailable. Occasionally, one wonders when these funds will ever become available.If the words "when funds become available” has become a song a time comes when you begin to wonder as to why these projects should even discussed at the district development committee level. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to appeal to the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance to avail funds only as per the Appropriations Programme. I believe that in certain cases, it is thisMinistry that encourages various other Ministries to over-expend. Once theBudget for a financial year has been read, how come that year in, year out, virtually all Ministries over-expend? Mr. Speaker, Sir, why do we allow "Ministries to overdrawtheir cash books? I do not see how one can spend what one does,not have. This is a perpetual problem. As a Member of the Public Accounts Committee, I see this every year; there are heavy over-expenditures by Ministries.	I think it is high time that we Put a stop to this practice if we have to cut Our coat according to the cloth that we have. With those few remarks, I beg to support.</newspeech> <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL HERITAGE (Mr. Lalampaa): Ahsante sera Bw.

Kwa upande mmoja kuna mifugo ya kutosha lakini hakuna nji-a miftigo hiyo, na huko kwenye kichinjio cha Kenya Meat Commission kunasemekana kuna ukosefu wa mifugo na, kwa hivyo, hakuna nyama. Ni lazimajambo hili mara moja lirekebishwe ili kuwe na utaratibu maalum wa kuuza na kunua mifugo kati ya wafugaji na Kenya Meat Commission. Nashukuru kwa sababu hivi majuzi Mtukufu Rais alitoa mwongozo kuwe na kichinjio huko Mkoa wa Mashariki Kaskazini iii wananchi walio katika sehemu hizo.waweze pia.kufaidika."" Ni jukumu la Wizara ya- Ustawiwa_Mifugo kuhakikisha kwamba kuna vichinjio zaidi katika sehemu zote ambako kuna zile zinazojulikana kama livestock catchment areas.'

Inakuwa ni hasara  kubwa sana kwa mfugaji anapotakikana.kumsafirisha ng'ombe.wake kutoka huko  Turkana mpaka Nairobi. Kutakapokuwa na vichinjio katika sehemu hizo zote,  ni lazima kutakuwa na magari maalum, yenye barafu ndani, na ambako yatakuwa  yakisafirisha nyama bila uharibifu ama hasara. Kwa njia hiyo tutakuwa na  nyama ya kutosha kuliwa hapa nchini na hata kuuzwa katika nchi za nje.  Siamini msemo unaosemwa na watu fulani kwamba katika miaka kadha  ijayo tutakuwa na ukosefu wa nyama katika nchi hii. Si ukweli Ukweli ni kwamba tuna mifugo ya kutosha hapa nchini. Jambo ambalo halijafanyika ni kUrahisisha njia za wafugaji kuwawakifikisha nyama katika Kenya Meat Commission. Tukifanya hivyo, basi, kwa kuwa wanyama wetu wanazaana sana-"kila siku nchini, tutakuwa tukipata nyama nyingi sana kula hapa nchini na hata kuuza nchiza,nje Kuna.mahitaji ya nyama-katika-sehemu nyingi'sanaza ulimwengu na Kenya Meat Commission ina nafasi ya kuweza kuzipeleka nyama zetu katika nchi hizo za nje, na si Ulaya peke yake; hata Mashariki ya Kati.   Vile vile najua kwamba tunaweza kuuza nyama.zetu kwenye muungano wahchi za Ulaya unaojulikana kama European EcOnomic"Commission, ambako nyama hizo zina-weza kuwa zikigawiwa wale wanaozihitaji katika mataifa yenye njaa. Kwa hivyo, ni juu yetu kuhakikisha kwamba tumeichunguza kila kona ya uchumi wa nchi hii iii kuzalisha kila aina ya mimea, mifugo na kadhalika. Tusiwe tu tunaangalia masoko ya hapa nchini tu, bali tuwe tukichunguza na kuhakikisha tuna mapato ambayo yanatokana na biasharaya kuuza bidhaa nje ya nchi hii.

Spika, nafikiri pia uliweza kusoma kwenye ukurasa wa mbele wa Kenya Times 	jinsi Ngugi wa Thiong'o ameupotosha ulimwengu. Najua kuwa neno "uwongo" halikubaliwi kutumiwa hapa Bungeni, lakini naamini Ngugi wa -	Thiong'o alisema uwongo mtupu. Alidai kwamba tangu Rais Moi achukue usukani 	-wa.uongozi. wa.nchi hii, watu 	6,000 wameuawa na hall, maelfu wengine wamefungwa gerezani. Huo ni uwongo mtupu. Kwanza, Ngugi wa Thiong'o aliondoka.hapa nchini wakati wa utawala wa-Hayati Mzee Kenyatta, si wakati wa Rais Moi. Huo ni ukweli mtupu. Yeye alikorogana na Charles Njonjo, ambaye alikuwa ni Mkuu ra Sheria wakati huo, mpaka akatoroka. Ni jambo la kupotosha kutoa madai kama alivyofanya ya uwongo. Jambo ambalo Ngugi wa Thiong'o hakufanya ni kuthibitisha madai yake kwa kutoa majina ya Wakenya hao. Hakuna mtu ye yote duniani ambaye hana jina na, kwa hivyo, tungeambiwa majina.ya wale. wanaodaiwa kuwa wameuawa tangu Mtukufu Rais auchukue usukani, walivawa lini. na nani. Bw. Spika, nawapongeza waandishi wa Kenya Times na hasa Mhariri Mkuu, Bw. Philip Ochieng' kwa jinsi aliyadondoa mambo y Ngugi wa Thiong'o. Alifanya hivyo mpaka Ngugi wa Thiong'o akaonekana ni bure kabisa. Ni mtu ambaye amepotoka kwa kuwa amejifunza .kusema uwongo.

MANG'OLI: Thank you very much Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to support this Bill. The votes that we have passed in this House will enable the various Ministries to have enough money for both development and recurrent expenditures. 	It is therefore important for the Ministries to release the money to the various districts for the implementation of the on doing projects.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, having said that I would like to talk about the state of our roads in this country. We are pleased to notethat the money that we voted in this House was released nearly two months ago. However, we have not so far seen any work being done on our roads. Talking about Webuye, I have not seen even one tractor for grading the roads in Webuye and I am wondering what is happening. While the state of roadshave continue to deteriorate we just see road gangs' just camping in Mahesearea in Webuye. The road are completely impassable and yet the people whoare supposed to be working on them are just staying idle. I do not know whythis state of affairs should be allowed to continue. The Ministry concerned should find out why the personnel involved are not doing their work. 	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, with regard-to the Ministry Of Water Development have said many times in this House that there isa serious shortage of water in Webuye town and today, people who would like to invest in this town do not want to do so due to lack of water, despite the fact that we have a lot of water catchment areas in Webuye. I understand that the Ministry of Water Development is going to undertake a water project 	 where they are going to spend over Shs.50 million. 	At the moment, they have spent about Shs.5 million but nothing so far has been done apart from the digging 	 of trenches by the wananchi volunteers. There used to be some old water pipes which have now been removed and no one know where they have been taken to. I think it is a high time that the Ministry of Water Development made sure that the Minister and his Assistant Minister visited the projects that we are talking about. I am saying this because we are almost fed up by the attitude of Ministers. We are saying a lot of things in this House and wananchi just wait out there without seeing us implementing the things we say in this House. We would like the Minister and his Assistant Ministers to start visiting these projects instead of just sitting in their offices and 	hoping that miracles are going to happen. We are fed up with the attitude of the staff of this Ministry in the field because they are not moving. The Minister and his Assistant Ministers are politicians and therefore, they   should move and See these projects for themselves. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the treatment of water is very important but you will find that the Ministry just provides water to people without first treating it. This is why there is a lot of cholera and other diseases and we are calling upon the Ministry of Water Development to adhere strictly to the Water At which clearly compels them to treat water first before supplying it to the people. They should empty and clean storage tanks periodically so that our people do not continue to take bad water. This is what is required of them by the existing Water Act. However, since they put up a water tank in Mt. Elgon, they have not cleaned it up to now. I think we are alive due to the Grace of God and nothing else.</newspeech> <newspeech>ASSISTANT MTNTSTER 'FOR WATER DIVELOPMENT 	(Mr. Kisiero): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The hon. Member says that there is a. tank in Mt. Elgon and that since it was put up there, it has not been cleaned and therefore, it is transmitting diseases to the-wananchi in Webuye. Can he name this tank because as far as I am aware, there is no tank in Mt. Elgon. Could he tell us where the tank is?</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, a tank is a tank and it does not have another name and the water cannot be coming from Mt. Elgon directly without first passing through a tank. I do not know what the Assistant Minister would like me to say. All I am asking him to do is to Make sure that he visits these projects from time to time to see for himself.</newspeech>	<newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMEZ;T (Mr. Kisiero): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. As I said, there is not tank of any description in if Mt. Elgon. Perhaps the hon. Member would be well advised to know that what the past planners did was just to put a pipe inside a river and this pipe went all the way to the boundary of Mt. Elgon and Webuye, and then they built a tank there. So, this tank is not in Mt. Elgon because whoever designed this project did not want Mt. Elgon people to enjoy the water. So, the hon. Member cannot be right in what he is saying because this tank he is talking about is somewhere in Kimilili or somewhere down there.</newspeech> ." <newspeech>'THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Muturia): On a point; of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,</newspeech> 	<newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva): Order! Let us deal with one point of order at a time Hon. Mangoli is responding to a point of order raised by the Assistant Minister.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. MA1G'OLI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Assistant Minister for Regional Development ought to know better having been in this House for many years. He cannot stand on a point of order when I am dealing with another point of order. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was saying that perhaps the Assistant Minister for Water Development has forgotten that Mt. Elgon Covers the whole of Bungoma District and we know that Mf. Elgon is a catchment area. What I am talking about is important because people have died in places like chwele because of using this untreated water. I am therefore asking the Assistant Minister, who comes from that area, to move the tank higher up so that more clean water can come down for the people's use.	It is up to the Assistant Minister to say that the installation of the tank was designed wrongly. 	I believe that the Assistant Minister will do something about this problem so that our people can 	better life.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir,	I would also like the Minister to find out out how much money has been spent on the Muchi/Khalala? Water Project, so that accountability for public funds is adhered to and water given to the people: 	If the funds were to be properly used, the Ministry would construct a reservoir tank at Mount Elgon and Webuye Falls and the water would flow down to Muchi/Khalala freely. The Ministry has signed a contract for Shs.50 million but so far we have only seen tretches.	We also have the Ndivisi/Makuserwa Water Project although thePeople of Ndivisi Location have never seen piped water. Up todaystudents from Ndivisi Secondary School draw water for themselves;In fact, sometime back the students were raped while going for water at night. I do not know why we talk of Projects which are not onthe round. We would not like people to think that water has reached Webuye when there is no drop of water in the pipes in Ndivisi. It is unfair for pipes to run through a village when the people in that village have no water. I want to correct an error committed by the newspapersWhen they reported that I had talked of a rural electrification Project that would cost of Shs.l50,000 and say that the sum is Shs.1.5Million. I do not know why the newspapers save their own figure.  	What I said is that and I want repeat it in this House	 loudly and clearly, since 	I Came to this House Shs.1.5 million has been allocated every year for rural electrification in Webuye but up to now there is no sign of electrification, despite that electricity is vital for the teaching of the 8-4-4 subjects.I am saying that part of this Shs.1.5 million can be used implementing the project in bits. I do not know whether this money is used by somebody in the Kenya Power and Lighting Company.     Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am happy that the Minister for Lands, Housing and physical planning is here. Webuye is being threatened that no more investments will go there for lack of land. The Ministry should look for funds for the webuye Town Council so that it can buy land for investors. The Ministry has done the same for other local authorities and it can it for Webuye Town Council. We would like to have money duringThis 1991/92 Financial Year for investment land. We should not be  voting for only salaries only.	If we do not promote development we	shall have nothing to show as have been achieved during our term in this	use whencomes to an end. Up to now the very important Ministry of Technicaland Applied Technology has not done anything in Webuye. Now thatwe have voted this money we would like to get our share from it. 	Let me turn to the Ministry of Supplies and Marketing. I remember the President had to go out of the country looking for food for this country because the then Minister for Finance refused to release the Guaranteed Minimum Return	(GMR.) money	to farmers' on the ground that they had	a lot of money.During that period, we had famine which almost caused a problem to this nation.We are not managing maize production in this country well enough and if we are not careful, I can foresee the same famine situation in this country. 	-I am s requesting the Minister for Supplies and Marketing to review the prices of maize in the country and to ask the National Cereals and Produce Board to authorize depots to begin drying maize. These depots have refusedto dry maize and the farmers are suffering. The marketing is so poorand I would like the Ministry to move fast before I predict a problem in the year best known to God. The Ministry should review the price of Maize.If the price of maize is not reviewed soon as well as the marketing of maize. I can foresee a problem. A commission should be set up to look into the question of maize similar to that one probing the tea and coffee industries. If this is not done, the future off maize which is a stable food in this country -is at stake. I am saying this in order to correct the mistake which was made in 	1977 when the GMR was denied to the farmers on the pretext that they had more money. We had to spend a lot of money importing maize. This situation may rise again because we have been careless to maize farmers in this country. Maize farmers work hard throughout the year but they do not get any profit. 	They only get back what they spend and at the end of it, it is the financial institutions which benefit from their sweat. There is no patriotic Kenyan in this country other than maize farmers who do not get profits from their produce. As I am speaking now, even the Kenya Seed Company cannot pay the farmers. Why do farmers have to wait for three months before receiving their payment?Which patriotic Kenyans can behave like this? Leave alone Ngugi wa Thiongi’o, the way he talks stupidly outside this country. Maize farmers should be supported so that we can feed this nation adequately.  "I would like to touch on the issue of the American Congressmen.We would like them to respect this nation. According to their Parliamentarysystem, congressmen are the equivalent of Members of Parliament here. I happenedto travel to America and I realized that there is no country in this wouldthat is respected by other-nations especially in Africa than Kenya; Iwould like the Americans to know that Kenya is independent. If they wantto manipulate multi-national companies, we urge them to get away fromKenya. We are prepared to live on our matoke, maize and rice without goinginto all these problems. ""Why should the American Government finance a country like Uganda and leave a stable-country like Kenya? I am wondering why this is so. We aretelling the Americans today and we_shall continue doing so that they shouldrespect Kenya and Kenyans. They should know that we have a Parliamentarysystem which is democratic. What democracy are they talking about? I wasthere and I saw more poor people than there are in this country. They areon the streets. They should, therefore, not try to blackmail Africans fortheir own selfish ends. They should respect an African country that isprogressing like Kenya. If they claim to be civilized, they should supporta stable country; one that is peaceful and with a great leader like PresidentMoi.""We are saddened to see the Americans continuing to perpetratetheir new colonialism in African countries. We have seen it happen inLiberia where they want to change things left and right; it is happening in India where they want to impose pluralism but it has failed totally and wewould like them to live within their American style.  When you look at the American style of Government, you can see clearly that it is a one party system of Government. This is because it has no parties.  When I was there I told them ""You are a one party Government since no party has its own philosophy or documents available."" They do not have laws for parties sothey" "So, they appeal to one central system. They cannot, therefore, keep oncheating. I saw that they operate on one party and I told them so. Theyshould not continue misdirecting other nations simply because they are Americans. They should know that we know them so well; they should not pretend. They should know that Kenya is peaceful and that is why we have multi-national companies in this country. They should understand that Africans are catching up so fast and I predict that very soon, we shall surpass the Japanese as far as development is concerned. I can assure the Americans that that can happen because we are human beings with the same brains if not better like them. Even their education is diluted; it is not like the one we offer here. I want the Americans to rear that. They should also respect this country. Wecannot allow those advocating chaos to come to this country. We must praiseKenyans because they love peace, their country and above all they love their President. We want to be like that until the day when God calls us. We do notwant to be confused. They have their own economic problems and some countrieshave worse financial crises than African countries. They have deficits likeus. They should not pretend that they are better than us. Let them leave Kenyaalone. " "We are peaceful and we respect God. Let them leave us alone. We value our lives.Let them not think that our lives are not human as they have done with otherAfrican states where people are butchering one another left and right. Let themknow that Kenyans respect human life. For one person to be' killed in Kenya wouldbe a curse to the' nation, and that is why the Saba Saba thing could not work. The Saba Saba thing had tribal inclinations and every tribe in Kenya respect human life; they respect the human blood and when they see human blood in the streets they go crazy. That is why this country is respected; and we respect our leadership. We would like other people to leave this country alone'.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I can assure you that there is no better home than Kenya; When you go to America, you find that one bottle ofCoca-Cola costs about US$2 while the price of the same bottle in a kiosk inWebuye is KShs.3.00. Why can they not say that Kenya is better and fairer inall aspects? We want them to know that we have a good system and as I am speakinghere today, there is no African country which has a budgetary system as we have here. Countries like Tanzania just read a budget without any source of income. In Uganda since the' demise of the East African Community has never seen peace. There is no accountability. The money that you invest in Uganda cannot be accounted for documentary. When we produce documents to the effect that Mr. X has eatenthis money, you can trace him. But where you have no system is where they wantto invest. That is why we are saying that they have other reasons than we know.Let them leave this country and his Excellency the President alone. They should"help him because he respects Americans that their country. We want them to respectthis country and respect our head of state. We do not want them to be using his name as if it is just another name. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President is not a congressman; he is the head of this nation. So, let them know that when they are dealing with matters that touch on the instructions set up by our constitution. then they are touching our nerves. We are saying this clearly so that when people want to give money to Kenya they should realise that they are giving money to a country full of love, peace and stability. We have those attributes here because you can see people walking in the streets very well and dating very well. In America a set of one lunch costs KShs.1,000. When you are dealing with money, you must draw that money at par and ask questions, and then you know that Kenya is the Canaan of this world. I am saying it and I know it. That is why in Europe or America people never go to hotels like Hilton. You never see them there. But when they come to Kenya they all go to Hilton because the price of food there is like in a kiosk in America. What a country! Everything here is fair.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when I was in America, I happened to walk into a shop where our girl from Mombasa is married to the owner of the shop and I was grateful that she could talk Kiswahili. Then she said, you can see, these people have never been to Kenya and that is why they confuse the Kenyan situation. I am sure that the Ngugi wa Thiong'o group that has been touring America soliciting funds using the Kenyans situation will know it clearly that the situation they are trying to create for the Americans is not true we have told the Americans time and again and I do not know why they do not want to hear. But in Bukusu we have a saying that even a stone can hear. "Mr. Temporary Deputy. Speaker, Sir, I am sure that when this money is made available by the' Vice-President and Minister for Finance we shall have drugsand medicine will be available in our hospitals. Central items like drugs arevery essential. I say this with due respect to the Minister for Health becausehe has done quite well since he took over the Ministry. Maybe, somehow, it may be that there has not been proper communication network between the rural areas and the urban area, hence the apparent shortage of drugs. However, now that the Minister is going to be' given money, we want medicine to be made available in t Webuye.  When you go to Webuye Hospital and you see all the patients being given Panadol tablets then you wonder whether Panadol is the medicine for every ailment. " . We' want to get various drugs for the various diseases that affect human beings. You cannot understand when all patients who attend a certain health centre are given Panadol tablets. We want the wananchi to have the proper medication now that money is available. We want capsules and injections. Some of our old mothers cannot say they have been treated unless they have been injected. We want those medicines available so that when the mothers are injected they can heal psychologically. We would like to this to be done so that wananchi at home are happy.</newspeech>   <newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Kibaki): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Are you satisfied with the hon. Member misleading this House and the nation that people are to be treated in the manner they diagnosed they should be treated? When people go to see a doctor they do not say that they should be injected; they go and see a doctor and it is the doctor who does the' diagnosis and give prescriptions. But the hon. Member, who is honourable, is saying that we should do what their mothers or somebody else tell  us. That is atrocious.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the Minister did not hear me well and I want him to hear me well now. What I said is that and even wananchi in the Gallery will bear me witness when you go to a dispensary you find 	10 people being given Panadol. What I am trying to express is that sometimes the injections may not be available. That is what I was saying. Otherwise, how can it be that 10 out of 50 patients in a dispensary should be given Panadol tablets? So, we are' saying that all types of medicines should be available. By implication, I am saying that capsules and other forms of medications must be available. I am not saying that the patients should tell the doctor to inject them. In the normal way, and the Minister has been her long enough to know this, is that.</newspeech> . " <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Muturia): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for the hon. Member	to appeal to the wananchi sitting in the Galleries to bear him witnesswhen he is talking about bush medicine'?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI:	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, maybe, I said that when:I wanted to stress the point. However, that should not be the issue. The issuehere is that we want medicine to be availed to the people.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. ANASWA: 	On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.' The hon. Member is creating the impression that when patients go to hospital they are always given "Panadol" tablets. Is it true that this happens? As faras we know, patients are given medicine according to the diseases they sufferfrom.  So, the hon. Member is trying to mislead us to believe that patients are only given "Panadol" tablets. </newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva):	By referring to "Panadol"tablets the hon. Member wants to emphasize there is lack of enough medicine inour hospitals.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI:	 Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.</newspeech><newspeech>THE MINISTEWFOR HEALTH (Mr. Kibaki): On a point of order,_	_	_	_	_	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Although you have made your ruling, it ison record in the HANSARD that the hon. Member said that people should be treated psychologically and otherwise, and that we should do what they say we should do. He said that if they ask for injections, they should be given injections. Maybeyou did not hear that part, but I did and this is in the HANSARD. Records willshow that the hon. Member was pleading to the Galleries. If we ask the peoplein the Galleries, they will prove him right. So, he was not addressing you.According to our Standing Orders hon. Members should address you, but the hon. Member for Webuye was addressing the Galleries, appealing to the people there to come and bear witness.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said here sincerely that	that was not really the issue at hand. It may have seemed like an issue at thattime, but I have said that this is not the case now. I do not want us to betaken away from.</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva):	Mr. Mang'oli, if yousought assistance from the Galleries, you had better withdraw your remarks.</newspeech><newspeech>MR.

Okwara should desist from telling me to aplogise direct to him. What I am trying to say.</newspeech>	<newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Okwara): Onpoint of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I did not ask the hon. Member for Webuye to apologise to me.I simply said, "Apologise". It is a very serious offence professionally for someone to say that someone should be injected so as to feel better.</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER	(Mr. Tuva):	Order, Mr. Okwara! We  have already gone over that. You may carry on, Mr. Mang'oli.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: 	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not know what the problem is with hon. Okwara, but if he chooses to speak the same language in Butere, he will see the heat of voters there. What I am saying here is what is actually happening, and we should not take this matter with a funny illusion. We are speaking out the voice ofwananchi. The voice I speak out here is not mine individually, but that of the people of Webuye and Bungoma. I am capable of producing evidence to prove that what I am saying here is true manner here.	There is nothing more serious than the lives of people seeking treatment because if medicine is not available they die. As I speak here now,  how many patients are dying in Lukulu Hospital? In any case, I would not like to dwell on issues that make me appear as if I am concerned about personalities because when the time of elections comes, we will all account for what we will have said here at home. If the Minister concerned-takes medicine to LukuluHospital because of what I have said here, this will have increased my votes. So, there is no question of threatening me here by saying that this or that is serious. If I am not voted back to this House, this will be very serious. All"I am saying is that medicine should be made available and people treated. Wehave already passed the Vote of the Ministry of Health, but when you go out, you will hear medical personnel telling you that there is no petrol for the ambulance and that there is no doctor on duty. These things happen, and wewould like to impress on the Ministry concerned to correct them. We as hon.Members of Parliament have not come here for window-dressing, but to discuss issues that affect wananchi. "We say things here so that they may be recorded especially in the HANSARD, as the Minister has said, and also implemented. We may talk about certain things as if they are not serious, but when you look at the number of people who die because of what we say here, you wonder why this should happen. 	I said earlier here that I would like the Ministry of Co-operative Development to revoke the commission’s in Bungoma District because we, as leaders of Bungoma, are fed up with them. We do not want to say things here and theMinistry does not take them seriously. Farmers in Bungoma are suffering. AsI now speak, the Co-operative Bank of Kenya branches in Bungoma are closed and yet they still hold farmers' money. Farmers are unable to pay school fees. The money in the bank branches in question does not belong to coffee farmers, but to sugarcane farmers. A man may have had an account in the bank, when he received his cheque for Shs.50,000, banked it in the bank, but when he goes there to withdraw this money, he is told, "You can only withdraw Shs.200=." want the commission there to be closed because we are sick of it. Every day, I receive about 101 farmers lining up to seek school fees and money to settle hospital bills. Their money is in the Co-operative Bank of Kenya whose branches have been closed in Kimilili and Bungoma. The commission in question should be revoked and the bank branches given to us to manage. We have been saying this for a long time now, but nobody seems to be taking an action. I say this witha lot of bitterness because my farmers cannot take their children to school, although their money is in the bank. We want all Ministries to take what we say here as matters of urgency and importance. We want to know when the Ministry of Co-operative Development is going to pay my farmers who innocently banked their money with the Co-operative Bank of Kenya. Why should the farmers and other wananchi of Webuye suffer? Why should I speak here loudly and clearly and yet nobody takes action? This is why we say that Minister are not doing their work. We are fed up with the commission that has been formed to come and spend our money. 	This commission should be revoked because we do not want such commissions in Bungoma. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we do not want that Commission and I am saying so, clearly. I am not talking about imaginary things. When people go to Bungoma hospital they are given Panadol and actol tablets. What vie say here should be taken seriously. I can bring about 10 people here who went to Bungoma Hospital and they were given Panadol tablets. Now those Ministries are going to receive money let them render services to the people.	We do not want to hear that things will be done when funds become available.	I say this because the funds are available now. Why are the co-operatives not paying the farmers?Why is there no water in Webuye? Why are there no Jua kali shedsin Webuye, Elgon, Sirisia and Kanduyi? Services must be takento the people. One wonders why we are here because wananchi are not getting any services. We want to know why things are not moving. We are here to speak on behalf of wananchi. We want wananchi to get services from the Nyayo Government; I say this because there is nobody who is more patriotic and loyal to the Government than the ordinary. We want to protect these Nyayo people. Services must be given to the Nyayo people back at home.	When wevote money here for roads, those roads must be constructed. There is no reason why a G. K. ambulance should spend six months in a garage. Even my personal car cannot be kept in a garage for six months.</newspeech>    <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Mwenje): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir	I agree with what the	Member on the Floor is saying but he appears to be repeating himself.	He has repeated himself very many times. Could speak without repeating himself?	I ask this because if he keeps on repeating himself he will waste a lot of time and other Members will not get a chance to speak: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in view of the fact that many hon. Members have spoken on this Bill, would I be in order to move that the mover be now called upon to reply?</newspeech> (Question.

I seek the guidance of the Chair. Hon. Mwenje rose on a point of order to question my contribution and finally he called upon the Mover to reply. Is that in order?</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva): You cannot challenge the ruling of the Chair! Carry on, hon. keah.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTER OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah): Thank you Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to reply to the comments made by hon. Members. At the very outset, I take the opportunity to thank hon. Members for their most valuable and most supportive and most constructive comments regarding this Bill. I thank them forsupporting the Bill in total. I would like to assure the hon. Members that the comments they have made in this House relating to this Bill have been taken very seriously and will certainly be communicated to all the respective Ministries and Government Departments in so far as the implementation of the projects is concerned and in so far as the funds hereby being appropriated to the various "Ministries are concerned. "Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch on a few points by way of emphasis in order to strengthen and in an attempt to amplify some of the factors that have been presented.  First of all, in moving this Bill, His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance did caution the nation through this House to be watchful of the looming crisis in the Gulf and its consequent ramifications.  His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance did mention that at the time of Budget Preparation the Kenyan economy withinthe background of the entire world economy was far better placed than it is now. This means that the amounts voted for becauseof the looming Gulf Crisis, may not cater for the same volume of activities that were originally envisaged.</newspeech>  "<header>QUORUM</header>  <newspeech>Mr. KUBO: On a point of order. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.</newspeech>  <newspeech>THE TEMPORY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva): What is yourpoint of order?</newspeech><newspeech>Mr. KUBO: There is no Quorum in the House. All the hon.Members appear to have walked out in protest. So, there is noQuorum.</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY	SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva): Ring the Bell.</newspeech>	<newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER 	(Mr. Tuva) There is quorum now. You can continue hon. Keah.</newspeech> <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE 	(Mr. Keah): 	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was saying that following this crisis and the fact that the Budget was prepared at a time when the Kenyan economy was far better situated than it is now, in view of the crisis, this calls for the entire Kenyans, the whole nation, to tighten up our belts and utilize the funds that we are appropriating today most judiciously, economically and effectively so that we can get the maximum services out of them.	Following on that, hon. Members have expressed the desire for us all to be patriotic. 	It is time Kenyans bought Kenyan products;. we should reduce our high appetites and preponderance of reliance on imported goods, particularly foodstuffs, which.wer normally do rather than eating our localFood stuffs.	We should now embark on actually buying Kenyan products.The other point is that we should embark on growing more food in the country, especially wheat, so that we can be self-sufficient in food. The rest of the world can use their aid to try and strangle us but, so long as we have adequate food, we will sail high. This calls for the openingup of the marginal lands; calls for the utilization of modern methods and techniques of farming. I recall that hon. Members were unanimous on this aspect. Hon. Members also emphasized the need to complete the on-goingprojects before starting new ones. This is a very important aspect, particularly in the situation or scenario we find ourselves in today.	It is most important that we see to it that on-going projects are completed. Atthis juncture I would like to request hon. Members, through their respective -DDCs and in their participation in the local areas to assist the Governmentin ensuring that this pertinent point is actually implemented.I would even go a point further and say that hon. Members should, perhaps, when they return to their respective local DDCs, call for all the  .  on-going projects and have a stock of their progress in order to monitor them closely. It was also mentioned that there is looming unemployment and the need for more job creation, particularly through the agricultural and industrial sector. It was also proposed that more financial assistance should be granted to indigenous Kenyans rather than to non-Kenyans. I support that proposal. However, most important is the fact that when funds are released to the respective Ministries by the Treasury, those funds should find their ways as fast-as possible to the DDCs: All I can do here now is to call upon all the Accounting Officers to ensure that these funds have been expedited to the A.I.E. holders in the districts. At the same time, Sir, it is important that the A.I.E holders in the districts do constantly check and chase for the funds, so as to establish all the times where their funds could be. They could do so by starting to search through their Ministries' headquarters. On the issue of sovereignty and aid with strings, it is imperative that Kenya and Kenyans stand up to be counted. Kenya is a sovereign state and we shall not bend or succumb to any whims or pressures of aid with any strings attached.

Member for Ntonyiri, and other hon. Members who have made very good and valid points on this Bill. The Bill has a specific purpose, namely to establish the management boards of our districts hospitals so as to involve the public more in their management. This is because in a democratic system, accountability means that the public themselves are involved in the management of state affairs and those who are chosen to lead report to the people whom they lead.Similarly, we shall have management boards for district hospitals and committees for health centers to which those who manage these institutions will report and will be accountable. Perhaps, more important now is that now we are budgeting - I hope hon. Members have looked at the estimates - institution by institution. so that from the, printed estimates one is able to see what money  will be spend what for	institution or hospital. In this way 2     people will be able to check and inquire as to whether money has gone into  the intended expenditure. I think this will improve our management and, perhaps, more important we shall get our money’s worth in every institution that we will be operating	With those few remarks, I beg to move.</newspeech> (Question put and agreed to)(The Bill was read a Second time and committed to a committee of the whole house tomorrow)Second Reading The Land Disputes Tribunals Bill <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSING PLANING (Mr. Kutiso): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we were not ready to handle this Bill; we could do that next week or tomorrow.</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mureithi): Next Order.</newspeech><header>MOTIONS</header> Adoption of the Public Investments Committee Report.THAT, this House adopts the Report of the Public Investments Committee on the Accounts of the State Corporations laid on the Table of the House on 7th November, 1990.	<newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mureithi): I can seethat Mr. Misoi is not here to move this Motion.

NDZAI: Mr.	Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell this House whether the Ministry 	has any immediate plans to allocate money for this school?</newspeech> <newspeech>Mr. OMAITSI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are no immediate plans to allocate money for this school because the Ministry is following the proposals brought forward by the Taita-Taveta D.D.C. Chala Girls High School was not a priority on thelist from the Talta-Taveta. D.D.C.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MAZEANU:	Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the AssistantMinister should go back and do some research because there isalways some money allocated by the District Education Boards which 	are in essence sub-committees of the D.D.C.s. Could the hon.              Questioner have been referring to the money that might have beenallocated by the District Education Board, from the grants received from the Ministry to school and which was supposed to be confirmed by the D.D.C? If he has any information regarding this matter he should let us know how much has been allocated for that school and haw much, has been disbursed so far.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. M’MAITSI: Mr. Speaker. Sir, monies that are giver by the District Education Boards do not come from the Rural Development Fund; This Question deals specifically with the R.D.F. and that is what we are discussing here now.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: On a point of order, 	Mr.Speaker, Sir. The Question is very specific. It does not refer to the Rural Development' Fund. It is referring to the District Development Committee. The D.D.C. is the overall Committee in the District; the other committees are just sub-committees of the D.D.C. The Question does not refer to the Rural Development Fund.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. M'MAITSI:	Mr. Speaker, Sir, in our records you findthat Chala Girls High School was first funded with Ksh.261,840,00 in the year 1986/87. The DDC recommended supplementary assistance of Ksh.186,500,00 for the same project, which was granted during the year 1989/90. This year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the DDC has not recommended Chala Girls High School for any funding,</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: 	Mr. Speaker, Sir, out of the amount of money that Assistant Minister has mentioned there was a first allocation of Ksh.216,840,00 and a second one of Kshs.186,500,00, is he satisfied that all that money has been used at that school?</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. M'MAITSI: 	Mr. Speaker, Sir, an amount of Ksh.216,840,00 was given to the school and this money was used and a further sum of Kshs.186,500,00 was requested to complete the project. If there is any need for further construction of the project, I think the DDC will give us the necessary approval.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR.

MANGOLI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Question is: 	When will the bridge on this particular river be completed? The AssistantMinister is saying that it is on a access road. He is not evenanswering the Question, when it will be completed? The Question4is not whether it is covered by those other roads that he is talkingabout. When are these roads going to completed? I come from thatarea and we are finding it very difficult, Mr. Speaker, Sir toKitale because of this particular bridge and yet the Assistant Minister is saying that it is on an		access road. We are not concerned about the roads. When will the	 bridge be completed so that it can be used? Very many people are dying because of this bridge.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it seems as if the hon. Member does not understand the difference between Rural Access Road Programme and Ministerial Programme and this road is not.</newspeech> 	<newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the hon. Assistant Minister in order to say that I do not understand the term "Rural Access Roads Programmer. In his original answer, hesaid that the bridges have not been completed and all these accessroads are in his Ministry. How do I fail to understand thedifference? Can he clarify that statement?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I could simplify theanswer, I would say that the road is not under my Ministry and, therefore the Construction of the bridge is not our responsibility; it is the responsibility of another Department.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. NDZAI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Ifthe bridge is not under his Ministry, why is he replying? He wouldhave referred the Question to the relevant department of the 	Ministry concerned. Why is he wasting time answering Questions which do not belong to his Ministry?</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: 	Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wanted to clarify the position and also to advise the Questioner on what he should do if he wants the road to be maintained by my Ministry.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. NDZAI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Heis talking about roads whereas we are talking about a bridge. Heshould talk about the bridge but not about a road.</newspeech>  <newspeech>MR. MAIYANI:	Mr. Speaker, Sir, the bridge is part ofthe road which is not classified.</newspeech> <newspeech>DR. MISOI: 	Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from the answer the Assistant Minister that another Ministry has the responsibility$°" of maintaining that bridge, was it necessary for him to answer a Question belonging to another Ministry? Why did he not transfer the Question to that particular Ministry so that we could get the right answer?</newspeech>  <newspeech>MR. MAIYANI:	 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I answered this Question because itwas brought to our Ministry requesting us to clarify some issue and advise the hon. Member to approach his district development committee, which is responsible for rural access roads.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. WABUGE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The AssistantMinister is trying to avoid answering the Question by saying that he answeredit because he wanted to advise the hon. Questioner to direct the Question to theright Ministry. He went further to say that he also wanted to advise the hon. Member to see his district development committee.	 In view of the fact that the district development committee he is referring to met two weeks ago and discussed this question of the bridge and that it was the view of the district development committee that this bridge should be constructed as soon as possible to assist the people of Top Suwerwa, which is an agricultural area with dairy farmers, because they find it very difficult to transport to get their milk to the factory in Kitale when it rains, could the Assistant Minister undertake to do what is required of him by the hon. Member?</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: 	Mr. Speaker, Sir, from hon. Wabuge's supplementary question it seems as if this district development committee started constructing the said bridge, but later found out that it could not complete this construction. If the district development committee has now decided to throw the problem to my Ministry, we will receive it and go forward to the Treasury to seek money because we do not have ready money for this work right now.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.	We need yourguidance with regard to the Assistant Minister's answer. He should have rungKitale to find out what is happening, but he has not implied anywhere in his answer that this bridge was half way constructed. He is now saying that this Is the case, and this means that he has not bothered to ring Kitale to find out the problem there is in respect of this bridge. He just decided to give the normal answer, that is, that this work will be done when funds are available. Could we have your guidance here because the wananchi in the said areas are suffering milk is going to waste and the economy of the country is being sabetaged by lazy  o. civil servants who do not want to make decisions. Could we be told when theAssistant Minister rang Kitale to get information in respect of this bridge and when he decided that this Question should not have been addressed to his Ministry? If the project comes under the Ministry of Transport and Communications, could you direct the Assistant Minister to communicate the Question to that Ministry rather than to attempt to reply to it? This means that the Assistant Minister has not made any follow-up on this matter.</newspeech> <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Dr. Momanyi):  On a point of information Mr. Speaker Sir. Let me inform hon. Mang'oli that bridges do not fall under the Ministry of Transport and Communications any longer.</newspeech> <newspeech>	MR. MANG'OLI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if bridges do not fail under the Ministry of Transport and Communications any longer, it was the Assistant Minister for Public Works to say which Ministry they fall, but he did not do so in his answer. Hon. Dr. Momanyi should not just stand here on a point of information to say that bridges do not fall under his Ministry because that is not the point at hand. 	The point in issue is whether the Assistant Minister for Public Works communicated this information to the Ministry of Transport and Communications. In his main reply, the Assistant Minister for Public Works should have said that this bridge falls under the district development committee, but he did not do so.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. FALANA: On a point of order Mr. Speaker, Sir 	Is the hon. Assistant Minister in order to cut short hon. Maiyani, who is doing his best in trying to answer this Question?</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. SPEAKER:  He was in order to do so.Hon. Maiyani, what hon. Members are saying is that there is no way in which you can run away from the said bridge because it falls under your 	Ministry, as do all bridges.</newspeech>      <newspeech> MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, with all due respect, the road and bridge in question are the responsibility of the district development, committee, and not our Ministry. However if the district development committee concerned wants us to take over the issue.</newspeech>-	- <newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Maiyani! 	You reply to Questions like this here on behalf of district development committees, which we cannot bring here to reply.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: 	That is true, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but what I am saying is that up to now, my Ministry has no funds allocated to it for the construction of the required bridge because the road concerned is not classified nor has its repair ever been undertaken.by my Ministry. If the relevant district development committee wants us to undertake the construction of this bridge, first of all, it has to make such a recommendation and forward it to the Ministry so that we may start doing the needful.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. WASIKE-NDOMBI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.	Is theAssistant Minister in order to say that his Ministry has no funds to complete the construction of the said bridge when he has actually not told the hon.  Questioner how much more money is required for the work?	The bridge is under construction and the question is in respect of what is delaying the work.	He has not checked with the relevant district development committee to find out the cause of this delay. </newspeech><newspeech>MR. MAIYANI:	 Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry has been in touch withKitale as recently as yesterday. We have confirmed that the construction of thesaid bridge was not started by the Ministry, but by the district development committee concerned through the Rural Access Roads Programme. The money usedin this work did not come from us. If we were to help in this work, the rightprocedure of asking for money from the Treasury has to be followed. Definitely,we do not have any money allocated for this particular work.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: On a point of information, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 	The Assistant Minister should know that even if a project falls under the district 	 development committee, so long as it relates to a road, the implementing officer has to come from the Ministry of Public Works. This is what we know. Whether the construction or repair of a road is undertaken by a local authority or not,  it is the officers of the Ministry of Public Works who are responsible for providing the necessary technical advice and the implementation of the project. So, the Assistant Minister is running away from his responsibility, and he should go back to his office to get more information to satisfy this House.</newspeech> 	<newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very true that our officers in the field supervise the construction or repair of roads no matter who finances the work because they are technical officers, but they have to get money from us.</newspeech>  <newspeech>MR. FALANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very embarrassing for the . Ministers, whenever they stand up to answer questions, to throw blame from one Ministry to the other. A Minister says something is not his responsibility but of another Minister, or that it-is for the local district development committee to implement, and so on. All those institutions are under one Kenya Government. The question of a Minister standing up in the House and trying to evade to reply, or to push the blame onwards, is not only frustrating but embarrassing. Could the Assistant Minister now just tell us what has delayed the completion of the bridge to link up Kapcherop and Top Suwerwa in Cherangany Division? That is a very precise question. He should not just go round talking about district development committees and such other excuses.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it does not matter how many questions are asked. The fact will not be changed that we have a programme for rural access roads. The money funding such programmes does not usually come from the Ministry as such. If the bridge has become a problem and cannot be completed, the relevant action is to introduce that element in the district development committee so that the required funds can be allocated. </newspeech><newspeech> MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 	Is the Assistant Minister in order to use that phrase he has just used, that "it does not matter how many questions are asked here?" Is this the way we are going to run this Government? Does it mean that these Questions are useless? Can we have your guidance on this so that the Assistant Minister could, with your permission, be required to go back and come back with a more appropriate answer? We want to know three things; namely, how much has been spent on the bridge construction, how far the work has progressed and, as the Question seeks to know, what has caused the delay in the completion.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will contact my people in Kitale to find out how much money has been spent and how much is required to complete the bridge. However that will not help us get the required money.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. WABUGE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. In view ofthe fact that Question No. 595 has not had a satisfactory reply in viewof the fact that the Assistant Minister is beating about the bush and at one time, actually, said that it was not his responsibility would I be in order to ask, through the Chair, that the Assistant Minister directs the Question to the relevant Ministry so that the House can get a proper answer?</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: The Assistant Minister had given an undertaking that he will go and look for a proper reply.</newspeech> Let us now proceed to Mr. Malebe's Question No.	593Question No. 593Payment of Death Gratuity to the Late M'Aruanja's Kin <newspeech>AN HON.

The serial numbers should be in six digits while the digits given here are only four.

After we have got that information, we will be too happy to give the correct answer.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: All right, let us move on to Dr. Misoi's Question.</newspeech> (Question deferred)  Question No.	564Importation of Reconditioned Machinery <newspeech>DR. MISOI asked the Minister for Industry:-(a) 	what the Government policy is on importation of reconditioned equipment and machinery; and (b) 	in view of the high costs of new machines and equipment coupled with shortage of foreign exchange, he would liberalize the importation of the said items as long as authenticated quality parameters are in favour of the national economy.</newspeech> <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY (Mr. Kiplagat): 	Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. FALANA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister should have the courtesy to apologise. This Question has been asked twice and he was not in the House to reply.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. SPEAKER:	 I believe he is in the process of apologizing.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY (Mr. Kiplagat):	Thank youvery much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Before I answer this Question, I beg to apologise for the delay in answering the Question when it was called out the first time. 	I now beg to reply. (a) 	At the moment, the Government policy discourages importation of second-hand machinery and equipment to the country. However, special cases are considered on their own merits. Importation of reconditioned machinery and equipment is allowed on a very selective basis, where such machinery and equipment meet the following conditions. The reconditioned equipment, though used, must be of modern technology. This is to ensure that equipment is not just being dumped into the country. Availability of spare parts is also considered. They must still be in production and easily available. That will make the maintenance costs of the machinery to be reason-ably low. The remaining useful life of the Machine has to be long enough, say at least 10 years for it to benefit the economy. The price of the reconditioned  equipment has to be reasonable at its age compared to the price of a similar new equipment. -Some unscrupulous importers tend to use the importation of reconditioned machinery as a way of transferring foreign exchange out of the country by paying prices almost as high as that of new equipment. Valuation of the reconditioned equipment is necessary so that all applications for the reconditioned equipment must have an independent value’s report indicating the efficiency of the equipment. This is because the equipment has to meet quality standards set by the Kenya Bureau of Standards. If these products are not likely to meet the standards, then the machinery will not be allowed for importation. (b) The Government will continue to allow the importation of the reconditioned machinery and equipment if the right procedure is followed and the machines meet the set out conditions. Such importation must not, in any way, work to the detriment of the economy. Applications are made to the Permanent Secretary in my Ministry, who will instruct technical officers to appraise and determine the suitability of the machines or equipment. The appraisal report is then sent to the Foreign Exchange Allocation Committee for consideration and decision-making.</newspeech> <newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Speaker, sir, I thank the Assistant Minister for giving a fully comprehensive answer. However, could he tell us who are the independent values who determine the quality of the machines and the price. Are they based in Kenya, or are they abroad?</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. KIPLAGAT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot give a general 	rule on this because that would depend on the machinery and whether we have local 	experts here. In cases where we do not have the experts, we can rely on  foreign experts.</newspeech>  <header>QUESTIONS BY PRIVATE NOTICE</header> Applications for Importation of Shoes <newspeech>DR. MISOI: 	Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Industry the following Question by Private Notice. How many import applications have been approved for the importation of shoes between 1st January, 1990 and 31st October, 1990?</newspeech>   <newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR COMMERCE (Mr. Magugu): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. The answer is 	16 licenses.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, out of the 16 applications Approved could the Minister give us the breakdown names	 of those applicants?</newspeech> 	 <newspeech>MR. MAGUGU: 	Mr. Speaker, Sir, to save time, I have already said that the number of licences issued is 16, and I do not know if the hon. Member will require the number of names, the purpose for which I do not know because we approve applications according to the requirements of the applicants.</newspeech> <newspeech>DR. MISOI: 	Mr. Speaker, Sir, the answer given by the hon. Minister is comprehensive and, whereas he has not given the names of the 16 approved licencees, I have no quarrel with it. What is important in the answer is whether the importedshoes are for industrial use, sports or whatever other uses. Therefore, theseapprovals tend to prove the current outcry in the shoe industry that shoes have been imported to kill the local industry. At least, this is what I would haveexpected the Minister to tell us the purposes of the imported shoes so thathe can clear the air.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MAGUGU:	Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I ask the hon. Member to repeat hisquestion? There is a little bit of noise here from the Attorney-General andsomebody else.</newspeech> <newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to repeat the question. 	What types of shoes were approved for importation and for what purpose?</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. MAGUGU: 	Mr. Speaker, Sir, the type of shoes we have allowed to be imported are for industrial safety purposes, knee-boots, football, sports, fire-fighting and so on.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR.

SPEAKER: Next Question?</newspeech>   Closure of the Co-operative Union Bank at Webuye.<newspeech>MR. MANG’OLI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Co-operative Development the following Question by private Notice. Is the Minister aware that the Co-operative Union Bank Bungoma and Kimilili have closed up their operations, and if so, what immediate arrangements is the Minister making to pay the coffee and sugarcane farmers who had banked their money with this bank to their dues?</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CO-OPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Karure): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.</newspeech>The Bungoma District Co-operative Union Bank section which served farmers through Bungoma Headquarters, Kimilili and Sirisia, closed its doors to customers on 24th September, 1990. This was prompted by severe liquidity problems. My Ministry has made arrangements for a system whereby farmers will continue receiving their coffee and sugarcane payments without increasing savings in the union banking section, thus ensuring that the loans and deots are recovered fully. Any overdrawn accounts will be regularized in due course. This will enable depositors who banked their money with the Bungoma Union banking section to save withheld dues amounting to Kshs. 26,492,186,30. The Union Bank in Bungoma has received coffee money from KPCU amounting to Kshs. 5 million. The bank intends to make debts recoveries from coffee farmers before payment. The balance will be paid out to the farmers using a mobile bank.     The Bungoma Union banking section has received a loan of Kshs. 1 million from the Co-operative Bank in Kenya, and recoveries will be made from coffee money. This loan will enable the bank to pay sugarcane farmers before the end of this month. In view of the problems which most of the Union banking section have recently experienced in the country, my Ministry has decided, as a policy matter, that arising Union banking section should be transferred into independers co-operative sections known as ‘rural circles’.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MANG’OLI: I thank the Assistant Minister for that lengthyanswer.	As I am speaking now, Kshs.26 million was deposited in that bankand the people are wondering what is happening because they cannot withdrawit. Can the Assistant Minister consider removing commission which isthe co-operative because before its set up, farmers were getting their money?When this commission	was	appointed the Union Bank collapsed. The farmersare bitter and I am speaking in their behalf. Can the Assistant Ministerremove this commission and let the People run the society because we shouldbe the ones to ‘eat’ the money and not the commission?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. .KARUME: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are going to check on theCommissioner who is in Bungoma and if we find that he is not doing his jobproperly, we shall remove him.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: In his main reply, the Assistant Ministermentioned the problem of liouidity that is facing the Union. Can he tell usthe main causes that led to this problem and the action the Ministry is takingagainst those people who brought it about?</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. KARUME: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the main cause of the liquidityproblem mentioned in the first paragraph of my main reply may have beencaused by:(1)	Irregular and delayed coffee Payments to members.  (2)	Poor coffee prices rsulting from very low loans and a debrecoveries estimated at about	5.8 per cent.(3)	Problems related to overlending as elaborated below:Union General Overdraft Kshs.3, 919,323.75Members Society Overdraft Kshs.997, 165.35Produce	Buying Kshs.     4, 354, 141, 35Loan Schemes       Kshs. 16, 353, 630, 55TOTAL	Kshs.26, 129, 761, 10This amount is compared to accumulated savings of Kshs.26, 492, 186 which almost cancels out.</newspeech>                 <newspeech>MR. MANG’OLI: The Assistant Minister has said that if the commission is not manazing well he will remove it. He has also confirmedthat Kshs.26 million of Bungoma people has gone to pieces.	What other evidencedoes he want so as to know that this union is mismanaged? In view of this fact, can he direct that this commission be removed so that members can choose people to run the union? Can he also ensure that those officers who are running Kimilili Union and who were also managers in Bangoma Union be taken to court for eating this money?</newspeech>            <newspeech>MR. KARUME: Sir this money has not left Bangoma District, but has been given to the People as loans. For example, Kshs.16 million loan was given to societies to pay coffee and sugarcane farmers in Bungoma.</newspeech>   	<newspeech>MR. MAKHANU:  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Ministerdid not answer the second Part of my Question. What actionhas the Ministry taken, apart from ordering the commission of inquiry, against those officers who caused those problems?</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. KARUME: Mr. Sneaker, Sir, if we find and officer who has alreadymisappropriated this money, we are goin to take action. We are either going to remove the officer or report him to the police.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI:	Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Ministeris still living in "if" when the matter is very serious.The officers have misappropriated KSh.26 million_ belonging to the farmers, and the bitterect	 part of the story is that the farmers’ children are not going to school.	A farmer is not even able to pay for the wife's maternity fee, and Yet the money is with theunion bank. So, we are saying that the officers must be taken to court, and there are no “ifs” here. Can you therefore, order that the officers who are running kimilili and bungoma Co-operative Union Bank be taken to court to explain where the farmers’money the most recent one from the sale of sugarcane is?</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. KARUME: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have just read outthe figures. I have shown where the KSh.26 million has been taken to.	In fact, the money has not been stolen. It has just been given out as loans to farmers in that area.</newspeech>             <newspeech>MR. MANG’OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Sir I am speaking as a Member for Webuye and also as Vice-Chairman Kanu Bungoma District.	SoI know as a fact, that the money has been stolen or misappropriated. Yet theAssistant Minister is just"covering"the officers.	Can be therefore appoint a team to go and probe that Union-Bank of Kimilili because the money involved is more than KSh.26 million? The Assistant Ministershould not try to justify the situation.</newspeech>  <newspeech>MR. KARUME: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am haPpy to hear that my colleague, Mr.Mang’oli, has got the facts now. It is also good because he comes from that area. He can therefore help us as a Ministry, to either report this matter to the police or maybe he can also lay the papers here.</newspeech><newspeech>MR.

I say so because last weekend we based twopeople who died as a result of night beatings, robberies, break-ins and so on, and I have names of those who died.  As I am talking now eight people are lying in Bungoma District Hospital and they can die any time. The insecurity is so widespread that I think we should either have security reinforcements or total overhaul of the security system in that town. We have never seen such thing before and we do not know its cause, but we believe that the Goverrment can protect.</newspeech>  <newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr.Muli):	On a Point of order,Speaker Sir.

WABUGE: Mr: Temporary Deputy Chairman, Sir, we have     always teen asking the Lake Basin Development Authority to expand its operations to cover Trans-Nzoia and even Uasin-Gishu districts. They have repeatedly told us that the Act does not allowthe Authority to operate in Trans-Nzoia District. We had been toldthat the Act would.be amended in order to_include Trans-Nzoia. Butif you look at the Bill here you will find that Trans-Nzoiaand Uasin-Gishu Districts are not included. The only districts thathave been included are Nancli and Kericho. I would therefore liketo get an assurance from the Yinister regarding this matter. When I talked to the minister a while ago he told me that Trans-Nzoia is going to be included. We do not want to be old by theAuthority’s officials that Trans-Nzoia has been left out again	Could the Minister tell us why Trans-Nzoia and Uasin-Gishudistricts are not included in the Bill? Why were they leftout? </newspeech>    <newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika) Mr.Temporary Deputy Chairman Sir, in the text of the Bill, Trans-Nzoia and Uasin-Gishu	districts are included. I want to inform the House that this is one of the reasons the Prov-incial. Commissioner, Rift Valley, is now being specifically mentioned in the Bill. The hon. Member can tell his D.D.C. that Trans-Nzoia and. Uasin-Gishu districts are duly included in the Bill.</newspeech>	<newspeech>MR. WABUGE: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not want to argue with the Minister over this matter. But I expected the Minister to include the names of Trans-Nzoia and Uasin-Gishu districts in Bill during the Committee Stage. I say this becauseonly Nandi and Kericho districts are mentioned in the Bill.Trans-Nzoia and Uasin-Gishu districts should be included in the Bill at the Committee stage. This is because a mere assurance here may not. Maybe when the Bill is taken to the GovernmentPrinter the Printer may fail to include these two districts in theBill. This will force the Minister to bring another Amendment Billto this House to correct the situation. These two districts arethe main catchment areas. River Nzoia starts from Trans- Nzoia and so the name of Trans-Nzoia District must be mentioned in this Bill.</newspeech> <newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika):	Mr.Temporary Deputy Chairman, Sir, I would like to assure the Housethat before the Bill goes for final drafting and printing I willensure that these two districts are included.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, Sir, theMinister is pretending to be "very ignorant. I because this is the Stage at which an amendment can be made. Any other attempt to include anything In the Bill after this Stage would be illegal. That remains aftert the	Bill has been approved is the Presidential Assent to make the Bill a law.Who were fact that the provincial commissioner, Rift Valley, has been mentioned here does	 not mean that Trans-Nzoia and Uasin-Cishu districts are included inthe Bill. If The Minister agrees that Trans-Nzoia andUasin-Gishu should be included in the Bill, he should amend theBill now and not in the future because the law does notallow him to make any amendments to the Bill after it hasgone through the Committee Stage. We are making laws in thisHouse and not just regulations.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. WABUGE: Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, Sir, Iaccept the Minister’s assurance that the districts will be included	in the Bill. But the truth of the matter is that this House is theonly body that makes laws in this country. No other body is competent even to include the name of Trans-Nzoia in the Bill. Unlessthe Minister is telling us that be will go out and have another"Committee of the Whole House" outside this Chamber this isnot possible. Nobody has any authority to even delete a letter fromthis	Bi11 after it has been passed by this House. Could theMinister tell the House why he included Nandi and Kericho districtsand left out Trans-Nzoia and Uasin-Gishu districts? These	two districts should be included in the Bill now and not later is because unless these two districts are included in the Bill the Authority will not be able to operate in these two districts and that will force the Minister to bring another Amendment Bill here to amend the Act to include these two districts. Therefore, I wouldlike that amendment to be fitted into the Bill right now.</newspeech> 	<newspeech>DR. MISOI:	I would like to support that recommendationthat the two districts should be included in the same way others have been included. The hon. Minister says that can be done duringthe redrafting of the Bill, which is an editorial function. This 2 is where amendments can be done now as we are sitting as a Committeeof the Whole House. The Minister should accept that those twodistricts should be included in the Bill right now so we can becertain that the law covers those two districts.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. TEMPORARY DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr. Tuva): I think theMinister wants to respond. We should, therefore, give him time todo that.</newspeech><newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika):Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, Nandi and Kericho Districts whichthe hon. Members claim to have been mentioned in the Bill were onlymentioned in the Memorandum of Objects and Reasons which is not partof the Bill as such. The Memorandum of Objects and Reasons containsexplanations. Catchment area means an area covering a given area.That is why we have mentioned specifically Lake Victoria catchmentarea and Lake Kioga catchment area that is situated within Kenya.That is beyond Kitale, Trans-Nzoia and all the places that thehon. Members are referring to. If we had mentioned Trans-Nzoiaand Uasin Gishu in the Memorandum of Objects and Reasons it wouldnot make any difference.	The only reasons the hon. Members are saying sois that in the Memorandum of Objectives and Reasons we havementioned Nandi and Kericho. That is only in the Memorandum whichis not part of the Bill.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. WABUGE:	On a point of order, Mr. Temporary DeputyChairman. I think the Minister is now making the matter more worsebecause the Memorandum of Objectives and Reasons includes Nandiand Kericho. That means that the Bill does not include Uasin Gishu  and Trans-Nzoia. If he is just saying that the Memorandum ofObjects and Reasons do not mean anything, why did he mention Nandi and Kericho? Therefore, I think we are only wasting the timeof the House. The Minister should include those two districts inthe Bill at this stage so that we can go ahead.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. TEMPORARY DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr. Tuva)	:	I will tryto explain what the Minister is saying. What is provided for interms of districts under the Memorandum of Objects and Reasons is not part of the Bill. However, the Minister has undertaken to include Trans-Nzoia and Uasin Gishu in the Memorandum of Objects and Reasons, although it is not part of the Bill. Therefore, let us take that the Minister is going to include the two districts which were left out in the Memorandum of Objects and Reasons.</newspeech>     <newspeech>MR. WABUGE:	Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, unless theMinister agrees to include them now, how will he include themafter we have passed the Bill because he will not have anotherCommittee of the whole House?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. TEMPORARY DEPUT CHAIRMAN (Mr. Tuva): I am sayingthat the Memorandum of Objects and Reasons cannot be amended. Weare amending the main part of the Bill and, therefore, the Minister is free to include Trans-Nzoia and Uasin Gishu in the Memorandum of Objects and Reasons without consulting the House.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary DeputyChairman.</newspeech> 	 <newspeech>MR. TEMPORARY DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr. Tuva):	What is your point of order Mr. Mwamzandi?</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: 	I think you will agree with me that the Memorandum of Objects and Reasons of the Bill has already been drawn and the Minister can no longer add anything there. The only  thing required here is for him to extend that project up to those that  the hon. Member is tallang about. The aim of the Bill was to cover onlv those areas which are included in the Memorandum of Objects and Reasons. We are reminding the Minister that his aim should be to cover Trans Nzoia and Uasin Gishu District. He accepted earlier that he was going to include these districts in his plans although it was not proper to make, such a suggestion at that stage because the Bill had already gone past the level of the Committee of the whole House. He should either take the necessary action or, if he needs more time, defer discussion of the Bill so as to enable him to consult his officers and bring up amendments to the Bill later. I propose that we defer further discussion of the Bill until the next sitting of the House to enable the Minister to bring up amendments to the Bill.</newspeech> <newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Mull): Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, Sir, I think the problem here does not relate to any policy or the drafting of the Bill. What is lacking is a map of the geographical area we are describing.  If the geographical catchment areas of Lake Victoria would be deemed to be Nandi and Kericho and the catchment area beginning from Lake Kioga would be Uasin Gishu and Trans Nzoia. However, if hon. Members are not happy with the general description given here and would like to get the specific names of the districts covered  which I suggest may be very limited because the catchment area of, say, Lake Kioga extends quite a lot and does not cover just a little area whereas the catchment area of Lake Victoria runs all the way up to Kericho this might not be useful because it would limit the areas covered. You should just consider whether the catchment area of Lake Victoria covering the areas we inted to cover, that is,Kericho and Nandi. If the answer is in the affirmative, that is all right. If the catchment area of Lake Kioga covers Uasin Gishu and Trans Nzoia, that is also all right. I would have been happy if the hon. Member had brought the geographical map of the areas in question so that we could see these catchment areas. However, I am quite happy to accept an extension of the definition here provided that it is not going to narrow the catchment areas. </newspeech><newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): Mr. Temporary Deputy-Chairman, Sir, the hon. Attorney-General is right in that if we had not mentioned in the Memorandum of Objects and Reasons Kericho and Nandi as an example  this                               issue would not have arisen. All we are saying is that the catchment area of Lake Victoria stretches all the way up to and including Kericho and Nandi Districts. If we had used the catchment area of Lake Kioga as an example and said that it covers Trans Nzoia and Uasin Gishu, maybe somebody would have risen up and asked why Kericho and Nadi were not mentioned. A catchment area cannotbe defined by names of districts because it is extensive. I hope the Houserealises that we have mentioned Lake Kioga, which is in Uganda. The catchmentarea of this lake that we are concerned with is all that part of the area that is in Kenya, which automatically includes Trans Nzoia and Uasin Gishu. We do not, therefore, have to mention the districts covered as such.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. OKONDO: 	On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, Sir. I agree with the hon. Minister's argument which is possible that he merely refers to the catchment areas in question, but he should extent the catchment area of Lake Victoria to include Cherengani, which is in Trans Nzoia. If this is to be effective, it should be in the body of the Bill, and I suggest</newspeech>                                       <newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY CHAIRMAN 	(Mr. Tuva): What is your point of order, Mr. Okondo?</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. OKONDO: 	My point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, Sir, is that the district covered by the catchment areas in question should be specified. There is no reason why they should not be included </newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr. Tuva): Mr. Okondo, that is nota point of order, but a point of argument.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, Sir,fortunately we now have in front of us a map of the area in question.

The Minister has just made an amendment to the Bill toinclude the Rift Valley' Provincial Commissioner. I think the Committee of thewhole House should advise the Minister to leave out the explanation which has just been given by the Attorney-General. The House should have the right to clarify the matter and take care of hon. wabuge's point of view.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. WABUGE: 	Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, Sir, I sympathise with the views expressed by the Attorney-General who, being a lawyer, knows what the law is. Earlier on, when the Lake Basin Development Authority was being established, it was stated that the catchment area of Lake Victoria covered Nyanza and Western Provinces. These catchment areas are now being extendedwithout even mentioning the areas concerned by name. If we go to court with acase relating to the areas covered by the catchment area of Lake Victoria, according to the Memorandum of Reasons and Objects, Trans Nzoia will definitely be left out. So, I appeal to the Minister to specificy the areas covered by name.</newspeech>  	<newspeech>DR. MISOI:	On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman.The hon. Minister has assured us that those two districts will be included in the Bill. 	However, the question is: if you can mention specific districts in the Bill, what reasons militate against mentioning the other two districts? We should not just take things for granted. If do not see the impossible technicality involved in mentioning those two districts. Does the Minister have any specific reasons for not mentioning them in the Bill? </newspeech><newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): 	Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, Sir, I think hon. Misoi is just blaming the Minister unnecessarily when he should be referring his comments to the Attorney-General for-the manner in which the Bill was drafted. From the drafting point of view,'I do not agree because you cannot name catchment areas like you name districts. We are talking about catchment areas and not "catchment districts."</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, Sir, may I make a suggestion that the Minister makes the amendment to the Bill that will give the Authority power to adjust its boundaries from time to time. That will cover the whole of this argument.</newspeech> <newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL  (Mr. Muli): Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, Sir, I am specific about the fact that we do not want to mention districts.by name. We all know of the specifications of a district and a catchment could even go beyond a district. Rivers do not normally originate and terminate in one district. We have to agree that we are dealing with the catchment areas. If we are dealing, for example, with the water emanating from Nyandarua, we do not say it is the whole of the Central Province, but we say the catchment areas starting from a certain point and to include Nyandarua Hills or the mountains. I feel, therefore, that the definition given is sufficient and should not be amended. However, if the House so wishes, we could adjourn the consideration of this Bill now until tomorrow afternoon to give time for hon.

There is a small point which is not being mentioned and maybe it might help if I highlight it here. Where the districts have been mentioned in the original law was because there were two definitions of "area." There was definition of "catchment area" and a definition for "development area" and it is in the definition of the latter that Western and Nyanza Provinces were mentioned and it read as follows:-"Development area means that part of the Lake Victoria Catchment area situate within the Western and Nyanza Provinces..." Now, that particular definition is being deleted in this-Bill we are now considering and it says:-“By deleting the definition of development area..." So, in the law, there will be no reference to Western or Nyanza Provinces. There will be no concept of a development area. It will only be a catchmentarea so that there will be only one definition. I think that is where theconfusion is arising. However, if there is still need for us to look into it further I believe that is where the confusion is arising.</newspeech> 	<newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Chesire): Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, Sir, I think it is important that this issue is given a clear clarification. I know the Attorney-General has tried to mention the catchment areas which, for all intents and purposes is correct. However, there is also an administrative problem where we have the Kerio Valley Development Authority with its headquarters in Eldoret Town of Uasin Gishu District. What will now happen? Where will the demarcation be on the areas of responsibiity between the Kerio Valley Development Authority and the Lake Basin Development Authority?</newspeech> <newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT	(Mr. Midika): Mr. TemporaryDeputy Chairman, Sir that will, in fact help us a great deal. It is themore reason we are talking of a catchment area rather than districts. This is tecause the Lake Basin Development Authority will usurp the powers of the Kerio Valley Development Authority.</newspeech>  <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT 	(Mr. Chesire): Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, Sir, that then brings us to more confusion. Uasin Gishu is within the catchment area of the Lake Basin Development Authority.</newspeech> <newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, Sir, I think this is a matter of semantics. We intend to utilise areas rather than districts. When hon. Kibaki referred to the words catchment areas, he meant the removal of development areas and; hence areas like Nyanza and Western Provinces' names as such. We will deal only with catchment areas, and I would like to be understood in the context that we are bringing it here. We should not consider districts, or tribal boundaries; that will not help us at all. We think of Kenya as one country and when we talk of catchment areas, we think in terms of where there is that pontential for development, but not because of considering the districts, as such. If we were to mention Lake Kiyoga in the way some hon. Members are proposing, then the Uganda people will jump onto us and ask us why we are mentioning their area. That is why we have stuck to the words "catchment areas." There is nothing remaining to be changed, or amended.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: 	On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman. I had earlier on moved that the consideration of this Bill be deferred as apparently, there is a lot of confusion. Even now, you can witness that there is a situation like never before where Ministers and Assistant Ministers are arguing on the same Bill. A few minutes ago an Assistant Minister rose to question the Minister on some parts of the Bill. That proves that there is need to defer the Bill and, if possible, we commit the Bill to a further scrutiny by a committee.	It will then come back to the House beingclear to all of us. I propose that that question be put.</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr. Tuva): Is there anybody supporting that suggestion? </newspeech> .                          <newspeech>MR. WABUGE: Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, the main intention of this Bill is explained in the Memorandum of Objects and Reasons. Once you have the intentions, then you develop the Bill. If the intention was to include Trans Nzoia, it should have been mentioned here. I do not know where the fuss is here. I know that an explanation has been made but I am saying that if Trans Nzoia and Uasin Gishu are going to be covered, they should have been mentioned in the Memorandum of Objects and Reasons. This is because it is written. here and I quote:-"It is proposed to widen the area of operation of the Authority to include that part of Lake Kiyoga catchment area situated within Kenya and the Nandi and Kericho Districts which are presently left out." So, Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, Sir, my question is why the Bill cannot be amended to include Kitale and Trans Nzoia.</newspeech>  <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Muturia): On apoint of order, Mr. Temporary Chaiuman, Sir. First of all, I would like to denythe allegation by hon. Mwamzandi that the Front-Bench is asking the Minister questions. We are just giving clarification and information. 	Mr. Temporary Ghairman, I want to give one very clear clarification. I want to let the hon. Member for Bunyala and the hon. Member for Saboti know what it means when we talk about a catchment area and why we are not talking about a catchment district. A catchment area means where a particular riverstarts, ending into a particular lake. In this case, I want to give an example.There is here the Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority and the Ewaso-Nyiro River North Development Authority.These two authorities are serving one district,namely, Meru.	Meru District is hilly and, therefore, the river which startsfrom Mt. Kenya or from Nyambene Hills going towards north to Ewaso-Nyiro River is the Ewaso-Nyiro North River Development Authority, and it is a catchment area from where the river starts. The rivers which are flowing towards the southern parts, going to Tana River.Wherever this river passes is what we call the catchment area. That is why it will never be a catchment district, because one district can be served by two or three catchment areas. That is the clarification I wish to give and, therefore, there is no point of deferring this Bill. I am sure that all hon. Members know the geography on this country very well. We know that our rivers and Catchment areas are not catchment districts.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. OKONDO: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Chairman. Can theMinister now tell us the new development area in view of the fact that the olddevelopment area has been amended?</newspeech><newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): Mr. Temporary Chairman we have nothing to do with development areas.

JALANG’O:	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would liketo reiterate one area. With the expanded area of the Lake Basin DevelopmentAuthority, it will appropriately reouire financing in order to meet its oblizations. One area which has thwarted the development of this Authority is underfunding. The Present expanded area of this Authority now covers one third of the	country with a population of about 40 per cent of the entirecountry.	This is an extremely big area with a lot of potential for agriculturewhich we have always wanted to develop through irrigation in order   to feed this country. I urge that funds be made available so that theYala Swamp can be reclaimed in order to create additional arable land forirriation. If reclaimed and fully utilized for agriculture this areacan feed this country. At the moment, the country imports wheat, beansand occasionally maize. It is the high 	time we made this Autnority agriculture sector. This can only be done through proper funding.  I urge the Ministry of Regional Development and the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance to look for adequate funds to give to this Authority so that it can start to realize its objectives. I beg to support.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Thank you, Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, forgiving me this opportunity. This Bill is being read the Third Time andwe fully support it so that it becomes law in order for the Authority’sexpanded area to take off as soon as possible. However, if the Authority is to make the impact we expect for the development of this country, it Has to raise its horizons and look at major projects and not Petty little things. It should drop small thingsand deal in major large-scale developments. This is because it is a large-scale development which can attract funds. It would be useful, if theAuthority can, from time to time, tell us one or two of its priorities that are of major developmental value instead of small things. If they do this and I am sure the Ministry under the support of the very active Minister that we now have we can develop this way to bring to life the major developmental operations that can be undertaken within this area. My colleague, hon. Jalang’o, has mentioned the Yala Delta which I support fully. This is an area which can develop tremen±cus amountof economic growth in that place. The Minister has already taker stepsto do something about it. I am encouraging him that with this Bill whichnow gives him	authority to act in a large area, he should urge theAuthority to raise its horizons and get adequate funds to startto develop with the Yala Delta as its first Priority.I would be very pleased and I think the House would also havesomething to go home with if the Minister can reasoure us that this is to be the Authorityts first prioritv and that it will 	raising chicken.</newspeech>                                          (Laugher) 	<newspeech>DR. MISOI:	Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary DeputySpeaker Sir. I would like to support the Bill and say that wein Uasin Gishu District expect a lot from the Lake Basin Development	Authority	(Amendment) Bill.     Sir, we are a district that is very important in food production and the only handicap is water. Water is a problem. We have rivers and dams built since the colonial times but due to dis-use not been rehabilitated. This is an area that the Lake Basin Development Authority should look into.    We need water and we are a district that produces allthat is required in the country. We also export quite a lot of,say, maize, wheat, milk and so on out of of the district. However,during the dry seasons we become net importers of vegetables, potatoes and fruits. Therefore, if the Lake Basin Development Authority can look into that area then the people of Uasin Gishu District would definitely feel that they are also included in the Authority in practical terms. We do not want to say that they are included in the Authority when we do not see any tangible developmentprojects irche district. We would litre to have some tangibledevelopment projects in the area. We require a plan to cover thewhole district which the D.D.C. will look into.Sir, we, as leaders in the district, are readv to sprnadthe message that we have an Authority which ban aid our farmers.Eldoret is a fast growing town. Moi University is alsoin the area. We also have other faculties growing in the areaattracting so many people. People need to be fed, shelter and every thing else. So unless the Authoritv comes up with plans we shall be very disappointed in future. As of now Sir, I am not going to criticize the Authority for what they have done or for what they have not done. But I would like to urge them that immediately this to passed as          an Act, to come to the district. We need services, say in animal        production, animal feeding and so on; animal breedngand so on. The Ministry of Livestock Development can deal inthis area. But the Authority can also have an impact in thisarea because development means a lot of things. I can see theMinister nodding implying "yes” So, with those few remarks, I beg to support the Bill.</newspeech> <newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir I want to thank the hon.

So, with the passing of tbis Bill, I hope and trust that the hon.

I do not want to take a lot of time now, but I just wanted to confirm that the Lake Basin Development Authority 	       has always wished to develop two-thirds of the people of this country living in that area without hesitation. Sir, I am sure that people have made comparisons with any other Authorities, but it was not our intention to compete with any other Authority. Our intention is to ensure that we develop the people of the area. As the hon. Member for Bungoma who is anAssistant Minister was telling me I can assure him that that part of the country is beautiful and ww love it. If we had the funds we would definitely develop it. All I am saying is that as so on as funds are available, we are not only going to do the agricultural development but we are also goirg to develop the whole area in such a way that it make the country the Swissland of Africa.Our aim is to make Kenya the Swissland of Africa. I am sure if we make use of the waters of Lake Victoria which is very valuable to this country we can achieve a lot of development. We know that without the waters of Lake Victoria there would be no Sudan or Egypt.       Sir, I would like to.-theny the whole wouse including the Chair for considering a rather tricky question whose explanation was required.	I am Sure that we are all satisfied that catchment area is not a district area. These are development catchment areas, and not district areas. Hon. Okondo might have been right in saying that we should not raise chicken. But as long as we da not have money, ie Sh la l continue raising chicken because in Dunyala, they have "Omena" and they can continue fishing. With those few remarks, Sir, I beg to move.</newspeech>(Question proposed) (Question put and agreed to) (The Bill was according1y read the Third Time and Passed)   Second ReadingThe Land Disputes Triounals Bill <newspeech>THE ATTRONEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move that the Lands Disputes Triburals Bill be now read a Second Time. As already explained briefly in my memoration of objects and reasons at the end of Bill, the object 	of this Bill first to re-enact the provisions of the Magistrates Jurisdiction Act (Amendment) Act, 1981, which Provided that certain disputes relating to land shoudd be heard by elders instead of subordinate-courts as separate legislation. Secondly, it is to provide for the establishment of a land dispute tribunal in each district. Each tribunal will consist of a chairMan appointed by the district commissioner, and two or four elders selected.from a pannel of elders appinted and gazetted within that district. The administration of land law in this country is scattered. You will, perhaps, agree with the when I say that we have not less than 	21 Acts of Parli ment touching on land in one way or the other. That state of affairs tends to make administration and utility of land a little difficult. Vie have had oaite a lot of difficulties arising out of disputes brought about by complainants who .for one reason or the other, would like courts to hear those disputes. We have found that courier prncedure for determination of land disputes tend to be long. As the hon. Members will recall, in 1931 the Magistrates Jurisdiction Act, 1931, was enacted.	It was aimed at making small-scale farmers, who were particularly dis-satisfied with the handling and determination of their disputes by the courts, have a speadyway of settling of disputes and short cut	to the long procedure that the courts are bound to follow. It was felt that us particularly the District Magistrates. did not properly grasp the issues involved and wrongly, Perhaps for no fault of theirs, recorded the facts of the evidence. This gave rise to numerous appeals to the resident magistrates courts and onward to the High Court the cases went on a point of law. Alltoo often the High Court, faced with incomplete or imprecise records,had not alternative but to remit the cases, much to the detriment of the parties. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the	magistratesJurisdication	(Amendment) Act, 1931, commonly referred to by lawyersas "Kamere’s Act", seems not to have solved the problem. As a matterof fact; that Act brought about complications, more delays and Misadministration of justice coupled with the mischief that hon. Members have from time to time raised in Questions, debates and other matters in this House. One important aspect was that wherea pannel to be presided over by a district of officer (DO) and havetwo members chosen by each party, it came to light immediatelythat the parties chose their friends.  One could see straightawaythat their would be no end to disputes because the elders would be lured to side with the party that called them. In that case the DOwas left with no alternative but to prepare an award and call upon the elders to sign it who immediately refused to do so because they all sought to protect the interests of the Party who chose them. When the award was filed in court for determination; the court tended to refer the matter to the same tribunal or another tribunal and at the end of the day matters tended to move from the elders panels to the courts and back to the panels again. Obviously, if youbuild a dam without a safety valve it is bound to burst. So, when no solution was found to the satisfaction of the parties they tended look for other forms of solution. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in short the Magistrates’ Jurisdiction (Amendment) Act, 1931, became a complete failure: The tribunals became a sort of breeding k place for corruption and fraud because a lot of money had then to change hands between the parties and their elders in order to buy justice; obviously justice could not be obtained from these. tribunals. When I was a judge I looked it and even tried to tut in some, guidelines in a booklet to assist the elders, but I must say with. humility that, in spite of what I did, the Act was a completefailure. I know that it was no fault of the House:The Bill was rushed through the House rather quickly without taking into account the land laws we were dealing with. As I have said we have 21 Acts of Parliament touching on land in one way or the other.  Then we added on that list by way of adjudication of land disputes, the Magistrates Jurisdiction (Amendment) Act which tended to confuse and cause grievous violence to the administration of justice. I am sure that the Minister responsible for these matters will agree with me that he should share the responsibility of dealing with the policy matter when he comes to second the Bill. Just to give you an example, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is what we call the Government Land Act Cap.28 which governs all the entire land that is owned by Government. One would ask straightaway, "Supposing a dispute arose between a person and the Government, where would they go to have the dispute sorted out?" To which court would they go? I am not saying that the Government in this case should not be sued. In fact, the Government has been sued on a number of cases and the Attorney-General is the only person who is sued on behalf of all the Government Ministries and Department. Therefore, the Government can be easily be sued through the Attorney-General This means that Government can be a party to a dispute over land. If a person feels that the Government has taken a portion of lend that belongs to him, where would he go? Would he seek assistance from the Magistrates Jurisdiction (Amendment) Act? Would the Government decide to choose two elderswhile the man would also be given a chance to choose two elders so that thefour elders can first try to settle the case? I can go on putting Questionswhich seem ridiculous.6. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the second aspect is theRegistered Land Act Cap.300. We are all familiar with this legislationbecause most of the land that is owned by wananchi is registered under this Act Cap.300.Where land is registered under this Act, it means that a titleshould there be a disputedeed must be given to the owner of the land but/once this title is issued?Cap.300 of this Act says specifically that no one can detach mytitle to the land I own unless the High Court does so. However, therethere is a conflict and somebody says that the land registered unnecessary namebelongs to him, where would we go to settle the dispute? Would we go to thepanel of elders? If we did that, would we not be completely because by are 	jurisdictional aspect that land registered under the Registered Land Act cannot be subject to any dispute under any tribunal for the purposes of quashing that title deed. However, disputes concerning the Registered Land Act have landed on the panel of elders and one can see the results. There have been serious conflicts and where as one might think that onehas won the case before the panel of elders. Therefore, I feel justifiedin saying that one cannot go to the panel of elders because the land does not fall under the jurisdiction of the panel of elders in which case the High Court may uphold judgement so that the owner of the land retains his land. However, the other party will obviously not be satisfied and the end product will be that the dissatisfied party will take the matter to the Court of Appeal and the matter will never end.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we also have the Registration of Titles At Cap281 which deals mainly with the land in the coastal area and the same thing applies as under the Registered Land Act. Then there is another. portion of land that is covered or held under what we call the Land Consolidation Act followed by the Land Adjudication Act. In the case where land is owned on trust by the county councils to the benefit of the people of a given area, that land is not registered under the Registered Land Act and one cannot really call it Government land. This is a trust land which is held by the county council for the benefit of the peopleof the given area. At some stage, wananchi would like to have the title deedsto that land and in order to have these title deeds, wananchi will have first to subdivide the land whereby each one owns a piece of land here and there. In this way, it becomes uneconomical to hold so many title deed C.P small pieces of o.5 of an acre and so on. So, it was found necessary to have all the pieces of land omed by one person together under one title deed. This idea came up soon after independence and the Pilot scheme was started within Central m Province where the land consolidation was started under the Land Adjudication Act and wananchi in this are received their title deeds earlier  than in other areas. The Point I am trying to make have is that wananchiwithin the trust land would like to have title deeds to and and this .is being done almost daily through the administration under the Ministry of Lands and Housing. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when land is being Surveyed for the purposes of issuing, title deeds or for any other purpose, the Land Consolidation Act is applied. When this is already done, it is followed by the Land Adjudication Act which then demarcates each portion and eventually title deeds are issued when all the disputes have been settled and these titles are issued under the Registered Land Act Cap.300 and in the case of the Coast Province, it is done under the Land Titles Act. The land Adjudication Act and the Land Consolidation Act have lost all their exclusive procedures. I would like to say that if an area is declared an adjudication area, no other court or tribunal is entitled to deal with that land except the tribunal set up under the Act itself. You have the panel of elders already to deal with the disputes of local cases.  	Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, from there we have the tribunal of elders built in by the Land Adjudication Act. From there the Land Adjudication Officer may hear disputes from wananchi who are disputing. Should there still be dissatisfaction the minister for Lands and Housing had the sole power of deciding that dispute. Once he had decided the dispute, that was the end of the matter; you would not be allowed to go elsewhere to challenge that decision. Recently, of course, we realised that the Minister was very busy it became almost an impossible task for him to go all over the country listening to disputes. So, also recently we amended that Section and relieved the Minister of those powers under Section 29 and instead of the Minister we recommended "Special District Commissioners" and they did a very good job and I think we reduced the number of disputes that were pending before the Minister. So, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Magistrates Jurisdiction Act was not supposed to deal with disputes which fall under the Land adjudication act, but yet everybody went to the Magistrates Jurisdiction Act, before the panel of elders, to decide disputes which are governed by the Land Adjudication Act. Obviously that was absolutely wrong and also absolutely unenforceable because the Land Adjudication Act has got its own exclusive procedure which must be followed. You could not get any relief elsewhere or by-pass the stages that are provided under the la Land Adjudication. So, you can see that without seriousness disputes were flooded to the panel of elders some touching on matters under the declared land adjudication areas and this caused a lot of confusion.  	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I did all I could to advise on this but I was overruled many times on this particular matter. It was said that the Magistrates, Jurisdiction Act was the author of the mischief and that it must be removed.	I am therefore moving this Bill in this House hoping that the House will support me to completely remove the Act from our statutes. This is because the continued application of the Act will cause untold harships and confusion. I would also like to mention the Land Control. Act because you all know about it. That is Cap.302 of the Laws of Kenya. Once the land is registered and a title As I said, it was not supposed to be brought under the Magistrates, Jurisdiction Act; under the panel of elders. What happened here was that whenever a dispute arose between a husband and wife, fathers and sons, over a piece of land, which is a registered land, and they went to the Land Control Board and the Board refused to sanction the sub-division or sale or whatever it was, pasties went straight to the panel of elders to Seek relief." You can see a that was a deviation which was bound to bring a lot of difficulties. I can go on citing examples of how disputes can arise	under different Acts of Parliament. A good example is the Land Adjudication Act and the Registered Lands Act; under one there is title and under the other the title has not come up.    We also have the Trust Lands Act, Land Groups RepresentativeAct. The Land Groups Representative Act is an Act which enables our nomadic wananchi like Maasai and others to own land through what we call group presentation; not only one man but so many people together owning a piece of land which eventually they may wish so sub-divide among themselves. However, disputes have arisen wheresome of the group members are not in favour of the sub-division. Although there are procedures under the relevant Act the wananchi went to the panel of elders; again you can see it is impossible. The list is long; we have the Maxrui Lands at the Coast. Those holding land under the Mazrui Lands Trust I myself dealt with a case in Takaungu. But you will find that people would run again, leaving behind what is Provided for under the Land Titles Act, which operates in the Coast, to the panel of elders.     We also have the Trust of Lands, Equitable Mortagages; Way Leaves; Land Acquisition Act; Land Restriction and Survey Act; and Laws and Tenant Shop, Hotels and Catering Establishments Act; the Lard Control Act; the Land planning Act; the Mortages and Special Provisions Act, Cap.304. So, you can see that the list is quite long. So, in short, all disputes, of whatever type, touching on land found their way to the panel of elders regardless of the provisions which are set out there for that matter. This tended to paralyse the operation of the Land Adjudication Act and the Reigstered Land Act. Things became chaotic. At this point, to contrast what we want to do, I would like to submit straightaway In order to enable the House to grasp the idea I was developing ever since we started What does this Land Disputes Tribunal Bill intend to do? Is it going to go across the numerous Acts that I have attempted to show that they are governed by a certain system? Where are we going? Where are the disputes coming from? I would like to refer to the Clause which tells us what sort of land disputes we are talkingabout. If hon. Members will grasp that straightaway it will be easy to deal with the Act.. We have Clause 3 of the Bill which defines the sort of disputes we are talking about. This is because land has got its own administration its own laws. Disputes may vary from one to the other., But what are we going to do because ther are other laws?  We have now to choose special disputes; only those dispute which can go to the Land Disputes Tribunal Bill. Which type of land disputes are these?  Let us start with the case where there is land division among brothers. Woulddisputes arising from this case relate to the Registered Land Act or not? These brothers will be holding that land in common and all of them will be included in the same title deed. In agreeing on how to divide this land that is held in common, there may arise serious disputes between the brothers concerned. 	Before they go to the High Court, however, they will want to clear the way and see whether a solution could be found before going to the land  tribunal in order to avoid waste of money and time. If each of these brothersconsents and signs the relevant documents, sub-division will start.	If there are, however, any disputes over the sub-division, the elders of the tribunal might easily assist in the matter because they know the customs of the area concerned and how the land devolves to beneficiaries. If somebody crosses the boundary and enters your land, where do you go? 	Do you go straightaway to the High Court? We feel that the tribunal might help in such a case because you will not be challening the title deed at all, but only trying to fix the boundary where it should be. The tribunal would easily hear evidence and tell you, "Although we will eventually have beacons, there are some areas where beacons can be had for a long time to come. 	The people who know where the boundary should be are those from the area." 	These . people will give evidence and say, "The boundary between A and M used to be here, but it has been moved." These people will also bring the relevant map so that the case may be determined. We feel that this case does not relate to a title deed, but to the adjudication of a dispute that has arisen over a boundary. So, as I said earlier, a lot of disputes arising out of the division of land among members of a family or a group of people holding it together can be solved this way. As I will be telling you later, should there be any dispute, there will be an appeal tribunal which can easily look at such a matter. If there is still more difficulty, we will allow the aggrieved party to go to the High Court on points of law only. Some people may not had land but they may  	want to lease it for a period in order to carry out agriculture on it. In thiscase, we will know that the land belongs to A, but by agreement he has allowed to work on the land and pay rent for a certain period. Should any dispute arise out of this agreement, it could easily be dealt with locally by the tribunal instead of the case going to the High Court because the title deed will not be under dispute, but the period of lease and whether the lease agreement has been fulfilled or not. Such disputes can be settled even if they relate to very large farming areas which may have been leased for ranching or other activities without having to go to the High Court. Trespassing is more or less crossing the boundary into another's land even if he has not title deed for his land. The aggrieved party will go to the tribunal, which will do the best it can to finalise the dispute.	In short these three categories of disputes over land will only go to the tribunal. These categories are the division of land or determination of boundaries of a land, including land held in common, claims to occupy or work on land and trespass to land. If anybody goes beyond this level, he will be doing so at his own peril because another law may be applied. So, before a tribunal hears any land dispute, it must be quite sure at the beginning that it has jurisdiction to do so. If it does not have this jurisdiction, it must refer the matter to another place where an opinion can be given.	Similarly, members of the public may want to be quite sure that they do not miss the boat and that they go to the right tribunal, with regard to which they will seek legal advice from any quarter. I have been explaining the resulting delays and frustrations which gave rise to many complaints to hon. Members. Many hon. Members have brought letters to my office while others have come in person to discuss such issues with me. Indeed, His Excellency the President himself has on every occasion taken the bull by the horns by saying that all disputes touching on large farming land companies should be referred to the Provincial Administration and must not be entertained in the High Court. The High Court has unlimited jurisdiction. but,  on the other hand, it must not adjudicate in these matters. This might bring a bit of difficulty, but I am not dealing with this aspect. Many disputes arising from large farming land, involving both expatriates and companies whose directors collect money in order to buy such land but invest this money in bank accounts and deny wananchi sub-division of the land or a refund of their money, can be solved this way.  	This is where His Excellency the President came in to save a very awkward situation which was going to burst out at any time. The country was full of hatred amongst directors and beneficiaries who would be entitled. The whole area was agitated because everybody sought to know whether there was any likelihood of getting title deeds for the amounts paid for land. But administratively and using his magnanimity, His Excellency the President directed that those companies be dealt with and, in the end, they were sub-divided and the entitled beneficiaries or shareholders were assisted. Title deeds were given out, as it is still going on, by none other than by His Excellency the President himself. So, I would like that principle to continue, that should there be any dispute concerning these large lands, or farms held in common, or where the beneficiaries feel that they are not happy, or have not got their due share, a tribunal will sit and help them in conjunction with the provincial administration. I think that tribunal will form a good base for administration which will be shorter and the period of adjudication will not be as long as going to the High Court in pursuit of the normal legalistic procedural matters, which tends to drag on for long periods. So, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the complainants strongly complained that-from time immemorial most of the communities, not all, there had been customary machinery for settling disputes by people respected in those communities, and those were usually referred to as elders. We still refer to them as elders, or members of a tribunal. These people had the ultimate knowledge of the communities in which they lived and their views were more respected than those of a magistrate whose remoteness from the issues was a disadvantage. It was felt that it was these elders who would be better suited to look for speedy resolutions to these land disputes. That is how the Act I have been explaining, which was a failure, came to be.  	Sir, let me now turn to the Bill itself and say that it is a (2 very straightforward one. We have tried to make it as short as possible. I mentioned Clause 3 as the cover of the disputes revolving around those subjects I mentioned. I talked of the division of land, determination of land boundaries, tresspass and so on. Clause 1 is just a normal one while Clause 2 defines those elders who are going to be members of the tribunal. We attempted various definitions and we have come with a short one which, I think, represents the type of elder or member we would like to sit atthe tribunal.An elder means a person in the community to which the parties by whom the issue is raised belongs and who are recognised by custom in the community as being, by virtue of age, experience or otherwise competent to resolve issues between parties. You can see that we have eliminated quite a lot of elders who would, by virtue of being around the area, be competent. We have said, for instance, that age matters. We do not want young people but would prefer elderly people who have the knowledge of the areas and how the land held within the area should be. 	I recommend that recommendation which I believe will guide the Minister as well as the district commissioners to arrive at the persons to be appointed and be gazetted. From time to time the list of those persons so gazetted canbe scrutinized so that those who become aged will, on consideration by the Minister, be removed and including those who will have become apparent to him as elders capable of discharging the required duties.That is the definition area and the land we are talking about is wide and is governed by other Acts. However, the disputes are localised within a limited scope, not everywhere. We say that the land we are dealing with is agricultural, which is defined under the controlled lands.As to where the disputes are localised, that will mean the administrative districts in which the land will be situated. We can take the example of  	Kiambu, or Machakas, which are near Nairobi. One will expect that the district commissioners of the relevant areas will forward names of the elders recommended for those appointments to the Minister to the Land Disputes Tribunal and those elders will be gazetted. The list will be as long as the Minister will like, so that there can be choice from time to time. The chairmen of particular dispute tribunals will not be always the same; they will be chosen from time to time and should there be two disputes, two chairmen will be appointed from the gazetted list. If there be as many as five disputes, and the district commissioner has the list of gazetted elders, he will appoint sufficient tribunals so that the hearing of the disputes does not take too long. So, on the recommendations of the provincial administration sufficient numbers of tribunals will be set up with those the administration deem fit to be chairmen with a few elders, as provided for, to deal with the disputes that will have arisen. So, it is not that there will be-restriction of cases to follow one after another, as there could be many sittings under different chairmen. We do not want these disputes to keep on annoying people. The sooner they are dispensed with, the better for wananchi. This will avoid collision. As I said, the list of elders will be subject to review by the Minister from time to time in order to be able to get the right people. The list can be increased as time goes and, I believe, there will not be much travelling by the members of the tribunals, if the disputes are properly, adhered to: Having said that, of course, there is a procedure of bringing these disputes but I do not want to bore hon. Members on that. You can see the said procedure in sub-clause 2 of the Bill, going right to the bottom of the page and across up to sub-clause 9. One way is to try and find the jurisdiction and the other way is the procedure. I was worried perhaps we may come up later on when I have discussed with the Minister about the period which it must take before the case is heard.	You may file a dispute and the other side is served with a notice and then everything goes quiet. As you will see, in one of the clauses I had said it is three months, which is long enough, but I have changed my mind.	I think we have to come down to about 30 days or 60 days, so that the answer is returned immediately within a month or two months and not 90 days.	So, when I have discussed with the Minister, we may be coming back to reduce the period in order not to accumulate a dispute and not to keep too long a dispute which can be disposed of within three or four months. Now, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Clause 3 is very important and hon. Members may want to look at it. If hon. Members have not received their copies or do not have them now with them, I would like them to look at it when they go home. I think the Chair may direct that in order that we do not miss as we did with the one of 1981, that we must be on all forms if we are going to assist our wananchi. Then, Clause 4 is the establishment of the tribunal. So, there shall be established a tribunal to be Called the Land Disputes Tribunal for every registration of disputes. Each tribunal shall consist of a chairman, who shall be appointed from time to time by the district commissioner from the pannel of elders appointed under Section 5. Section 5 gives the Minister the power to appoint and gazette those names. I know that my hon. friend, Mr. Chesire, was not very happy that the district commissioner should-be the chairman; he wanted the Minister perhaps to be doing it. But I think you will saddle quite a lot to the Minister on what you call administrative matters. What happens is that the district chooses, out of the pannel, who would be the chairman. If the contestants happen to know that the chairman is in any way interested in the matter, they have a right to challenge the set up. They may say, "Mr. Chairman,  since we saw you being entertained by our opponents over nyama choma and drinks last night, you should not hear this case". I think there is a safeguard there. However, with what hon. Members say as we go along, we may perhaps bring it up. But it may be quite a bit too much for the Minister to act chairman for the 42 districts we have; I think that is impossible. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I did not want to pre-empt this, but since it was mentioned I might as well raise it, hoping that the Obviously, the district commissioner will perform properly. The Minister will be governing our 42 districts. Those eight districts may send about 10 disputes and the Minister will not know who the chairman is except by name on recommendation of the district commissioner. I can assure you-that the Minister will have no other job to dofor a week; he will be appointing every day. We do not want to bog down, butI do not want to stop hon. Members from contributing. The Minister should beable to see the list of all the elders, including prospective chairmen within the list. The names will be gazetted so that should anybody feel unhappy abouta man, he can make a representation to the Minister. There it is.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, sub-clause 2 says that when an elder of the pannel becomes, in the opinion of the Minister, unfit to serve as a member or is incapable of performing duties as such, the Minister may remove him.	We think that is a loophole which is necessary, that should anyone feel that an elder is becoming a nuisance or unfit, he can be removed.	We are thinking of having these members more or less on a permanent basis.	We would like them, in order to do justic, not to depend on transportation from the money provided by the panel.. We feel that by so doing you are opening the pandora's box for corruption. Why can we not pay these people?	They cannot be paid monthly but they can be paid a certain amount of money per sitting.Sir, what I am trying to drive at at this stage is that there will be rules made by the Minister - and I have assured him and the House that we have started working on the rules and they will come by way of Legal Notices. Should there be any difficulties somewhere, we do not have to come to the House all the time; we can change the Legal Notice in order to suit the circumstances pertaining to a particular area. In order to make this Bill operative, we think quite stringent rules and yet to make things work should he brought. There are two ways, and I will lay on the Table the rules for hon. Members to have a look at them. It is not an Act, but they are rules for notification. If there is nothing there is nothing, but if you would like to raise a point we are doing it collectively. We are dealing with a very difficult subject because, as I have said, the land law in this country is very wide.	The Law Reform Commission, since its inception, has worked hard but has not reached anywhere where I can present anything. We would like codification of the land law to be in one book which you can refer to without contradiction.	But it is an exercise which is being undertaken full time.	I cannot see the completion of this exercise within this year or next year. Give us encouragement and proposals where you feel you would like us to move quickly.	I do not want you to look at this law just in isolation. I want you to presume all the time that this is superimposed on very many laws and it cannot operate by itself. If you want to look at this, you will have to open in a go 21 Acts of Parliament. Even when I used to appear before the court I cannot imangine one day I carried authorities beyond 10.	Now, imagine yourself carrying all these 21 Acts of Parliament to court to present a case. It is impossible. So, we have to work hard. We admit where we are slow and we admit where things have gone wrong. It is not the fault of this House and I do not think there is anybody we can blame. It is only that the exercise is bound to take a little long. Sir, we will move on Straightaway to Clause. 6 (1) which reads as follows:"Subject to this Act, each Tribunal shall havejurisdiction to resolve disputes institutedunder section 3(2)."The reason why we meant to have this section was make quite sure that the achieve that was brought about by the 1391 Act which the lawyers call Kamore’s Act</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: Why?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL(Mr. Muli): They call it so. It is not mine. You can blame me for this one but I am sorry for the other one since I tried to block it but I could not.We do not want this tribunal to assume jurisdiction on other matters than what we have stated under section	3 and those disputes revolving around.ClauseWe will now move on to clause 6(2) and see the guidance given to the Tribunal. It reads as follows:"Whenever a dispute is being dealt with by the Tribunal-(a)	the chairman shall preside at the hearing; and(b) the decision of the Tribunal shall be that of the majority of the members hearing the dispute; and (c) the chairman shall have a casting vote in addition to his deliberative vote." These are part of the regulations but we feel it must be entrenched in the Act of Parliament itself because we do not want anybody to say that he has done this or the other; he is tied up.	The regulation may be a little loose but it is there. Clause 7 lays down what one should do if he is suggested by who decision of the Tribunal. He should not take a range. Range or areas and it is with his contestant. since he has what I call another bite of the Clause 7(1) reads as follows:"Any Party to a dispute under section 3 who is aggrieved by the decision of the Tribunal any. within sixty days (and I think what is correct. There is a place where we shall be talking about ninty days) ofof the decision appeal to the Appeal Committee constituted for the Province in which the subject which is the subject matter of the dispute is situated." This is another Tribunal which is over and above the dispute tribunal which is an appeal committee and I think it is proper that they be given every under cutomary line and within local circumstances. We are told that the appeal shall be in documentary form and shall contain a brief statement to be divided into separate grounds of appeal of the reasons upon which the party appealing wishes to rely. That is quite straightforward as it gives the required evidence. The appeal shall then be laid down for eham±m3 'nearing by the Appeal Committee within the normal manner and at - any time when Papers are ready. The Appeal Committee will Sit and determine the appeal. Clause 3 gives the constitution of this Committee. It reads as follows: "8(1) There shall be constituted a Committee to he known as the Land Disputes Appeals Committee, for each Province." I accept the fact that a Provincial commissioner is a very busy man and. if the House suggests and I consult with the minister we may agree that any other officer in his office can deputize him, for-instance, a district commissioner or any other senior person but I will live it open for discussion. The Clause reads on as follows: "(2) The Committee shall consist of-(a) the Provincial Commissioner of the Province for which the Committee has been constituted, who shall preside: and(b) such Persons, not being less than five, as shall be appointed by the Minister." The Minister will gazette a list of alders where members will	 Section 3 reads as follows:“For the purpose of hearing appeals from tribunals in the Province for which the Committee is constituted the committee shall sit in a panel of three (not five) including the Provincial Commissioner.”The Minister will also have power to make rules which are on the draughtsman table and we will discuss them. Those are the ones to implement and we will into detail to minute areas that we can tie up under the rules which the Minister, no doubt, will be looking forward to rely on in implementing this Bill. Finally, we some to the crucial part of the Bill which is to remove it from the Act of Parliament. This is with respect to Clause 10 which reads as follows: ‘The Magistrates’ Jurisdiction (Amendment) Act 1931 is repealed." We want to repeal it and bring this into effect. I submit that we will reduce a lot of mischieve and help par people to resolve these disputes which have appeared to be many and which have tended to take a long time before a decision is given. They have also proved to be costly as a result of travelling expenses and lawyers fees. I beg to move.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>THE MPITSTER FOR LANDS AND HOUSING (Mr. Mbela): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to second the Land. Disputes Tribunals Bill.Land, as we all know, is one of the Major assets of our economy. We need land for agricultural cultivation; we need lend for industrial production and we also reed land for construction of various development projects, including schools, health centres, roads, trading centres, churches and on on, only to mention a few. 	It will also be recalled, Sir, that land was one of the major issues during, our struggle for Independence for our beloved country. And up to today, land matters still occupy a permanent Position in our daily lives irrespective of our stations in life. 	My Ministry has been charged with responsibility of managing lard and matters. related thereof through formulations of suitable land policies and updating the relevant land laws inour status.	Just recently, Sir, hon. Members will recall the repealing of the out-dated Mazrui Land Act and also the amendment of the Lands Acquisition Act with a view to updating them so as to conform with the prevailing political and economic situation in the country. Sir, before I proceed I would like to express my profound gratitude to His Excellency the President, the longest serving Parliamentarin in this country, for his wise counsel and guidance which has enabled us in the ministry and also as a Government to achieve a lot in the management of our land affairs. It was also due to His Excellency the President's foresight that he directed that certain land disputes be heard and determined by local elders instead of going to the courts to save the wananchi the expenses and complications which obtain in court proceedings.Following his directive, the Magistrates Jurisdictions (Amendment) Act of 1981 which has been referred to as  	was passed by this House and became operational. However, from experience since that Act became operational in 1981, some weaknesses have been noticed which require remedial. action for the interest of justice and speedy arbitration. For example, the present Act stipulates that the parties to the dispute choose their own elders for arbitration. From experience, this arrangement has greatly hagered the smoker administration of justice as the elders, once chosen by the parties, tend to assume and discharge the role of witnesses other than arbitrators to the lard dispute at hand. There. have been stalemates the elders have refused to sign the proceedings in sympathy with the parties who selected them. The arrangement also tends to compromise the Proceedings of the elders who are required for the interest of justice and fair play to be impartial. The other area of weakness which has been noticed is that there is no provision for appeal where one of the parties is not satisfied with the decision of the alders. Sir, it is due to these reasons end others that have been mentioned by the Attorney-General while moving this Bill which mF.de the Government decide to replace the existing Act with the Bill now before the House.  	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, once massed this Bill will cater for some of the loopholea and weaknesses which have been inherent in the present Act. The Bill, like the Present Act, intends to limit jurisdiction of magistrates in cases related to land. 	It also intends to establish land disputes tribunals in every district and to confine their u jurisdication and powers; their members will be appointed by the minister for Lands, Housing and Physical Planning from elders whose qualifications are stated in the Bill. The Bill also intends to put a time unit in the filling and hearing of disputes mf under Sections 5 and 6. Under Section 8 the Bill makes Provision for land disputes appeals committees, which will be consituted in every province under the chairmanship of the provincial commissioner to hear and decide on appeals where parties are not satisfied the decisions of the pannels of elders at the district level. As they debate this issue hon. Members may find that the provincial commissioner with various routine natters and it may be necessary for us to make Provision for some of his assistants to be appointed in writing to preside over some of these anneals committees. It is my belief that the passing of this Bill will greatly enhance our capacity to attend to and to solve land with speed and fairness. Under Section 9 of the Bill, appropriate rules will be made to ensure this. Indeed, I expect that under the rules and regulation, which I, as the Minister responsible for the Bill, will make I will be able to provide for procedures ensure there is no conflict in the administration; I will 	   At least the Bill does not come into conflict with the Registered Land Act, Can 300, the Land Adjucation Act, Cap 234, the Land Consolidation Act, Cap 233 and also the Land Titles Act, which operates within the 10-mile strip in the Coast. 	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I believe what our real interest is to ensure that justice is brought into play. I am sure that by making these changes we will be ensuring that the small man is assisted to have his land without being cheated by the of various complicated procedures, which are necessary if the matter are raised in court.	With those few remarks, I beg to second.</Newspeech>(Question proposed)	<Newspeech>MR.MAKIHU: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to support this Bill. I would like to make certain comments for the Minister to take into account when he comes to respond. This is a very important Bill, especially because it concerns land matters. But in this Bill there is no provision for divisional appeals committees. I would like a Mobil divisional land appeals committees to provided for in this Bill so that complainants from the location can be heard easily in their divisions. 	After the divisional committee has been established, then there should be a district appeals committee to be dealing with matters that have arisenfrom the divisions. It is my belief that the idea of having land disputes dealt with by panel of elders has been introduced so that customary law is taken into account. Looking at the bill, I have a feeling that we are going back to what we used to do some year back-when the administration used to have African courts at the divisional and district levels to deal land matters. There also used to be at that time a Provincial Appeals Board. I have not quarrel with the idea of the district commissioner appointing the panel of elders to deal with land cases in a given district, but I do feel that a Provincial Appeals Board Should be set up and the Provincial Commissioner should be the Chairman of that Appeals Board. However, I would be much happier if the Provincial Commissioner would be in a position to appoint a more responsible elder in the pronvince to be chairman of that appeals body.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mt. Tuve): Order Dr. Mameyo: Although nobody has raised an objection to your crossing between the Chair and the Member sneaking, I think I should warn you not to do that again.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: But he is too short to obstract anybody</Newspeech> (laughter) <Newspeech>MR. MATIHU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was saying that the Bill provides that the Provincial Commissioner will be the chairman of the Appeals Committee, but with the experience we have had in the past, I know there will be so many appeal cases that the Provincial Commissioner personally may not have time to do anything else if he will be required to be the chairman at all these appeal cases. Therefore, I feel to he fair, an amendment should be made so that the chairman of the Provincial Appeals Committee is appointed by the Provincial Commissioner so that the Provincial Commissioner himself is relieved of that responsibility of chairing the appeals body. If this is not done the Provincial Commissioner will be too much overburdened. In the past during the time that the Land Consolidation  Act was enanted, the Minister was going to deal with appeal cases butit was found later that these appeal cases were so many that the Ministerhad not time to deal with them. Consequently, there were so many complaint.due to pending cases and this matter had to be referred back to the administration. I do feel that in order to assist wananchi in their landcases, these cases should first be dealt with at the local level so that land disputes are reduced to the divisional level. Therefore, ifdivisional land committees were established under this Bill, it would assist wananchi in their land cases a great deal. So, what I am recommending. is that there be a divisional land committee under this law which will deal with local issues. The elders who will sit in this committee are mu nearer to the-people than those at the district level and it is important therefore, that</Newspeech><Header>ADJOURNMEIT</Header><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Alva): Hon.

Member that the proposed Letea Dispensary funded through the Turkara Rehabilitation Project has not been completed to the satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health, Turkana District, to be opened as a dispensary. 	The dispensary has no staff houses and no patients' or staff toilets.	However, the project consists of a block of a building with four rooms, which is anticipated would serve as a service block. In the opinion of the District Medical Officer of Health, the building is sub-standard and is unlikely to be approved in its present construction status to serve as a dispensary.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Speaker, Sir; this is a very serious answer! (Laughter)I say this because it is the duty of the Ministry of Health to supervise construction work on the remaining part of this building. The Assistant Ministar should not come to this House to give irrelevant answers to Questions, Why has the Ministry been so reluctant to oversee the construction of this building?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the benefit of this House, the proposed Letea Dispensary which has been funded by the Turkana Rehabilitation Project is in Kakuma Division and is located outside a town where there is a Population of about 200 people. Secondly, the Catholic Diocese of Lodwar has an operational dispensary in Letea which is located barely one kilometre from the proposed Letea Dispensary, funded by the Turkana Rehabilitation Project. The proposed dispensary has been constructed without prior consultation with the District Medical Officer of Health and also without the Prior approval of the Development Committee. If and when the Letea Dispensary is satisfactorily completed, the Ministry will consider opening it taking into account the availability of other health services in the town, the population of the area, the approval of theD.D.C. and the Priorities within that D.D.C. as furnished to us bythe Medical Officer of Health.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

FALANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister'sanswer is very con using. He started by saying that dispensarycannot be opened because it has no toilets and staff houses.	Healso went on and stated that it cannot be taken over because it has no D.D.C. approval and the consent of the Ministry.

The Assistant Minister is ta1king about irrelevant things here. What disciplinary action will he take against the Medical Officer of Health if I bring the Minutes of the D.D.C. to this House next week to show that the D.D.C. approved the construction of that dispensary?

GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, with due respect that is a very ridiculous suggestion. There is no justification for me to withdraw the answer.

It seems as if his Ministry does not follow what happens in the DDC.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B. A. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said earlier the action that we will take. We will take the condition requiring approval of the DDC as having being approved and we will still insist on other conditions being fulfilled.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, why does the Assistant Minister not zero these conditions down to the provisions of toilet facilities? 	As far as this august House is concerned, the most serious condition is the Provision of toilet facilities. The medical staff can stay cut and come and treat the patients there. Among the worst conditions that he has notified the House are the provision of toilet facilities. The Turkanas, as strong as they are can dig the toilets in a day. Could the Assistant Minister zero the condition to the provision of toilet facilities and allow the Turukanas to construct the toilets?	The other things will take off. Could he come down to that?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B. A. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot do away with any of the conditions which are necessary for all our health facilities. We have to meet certain standards which do not only require toilet facilities. We also require a certain population in an area.	Above all, we should follow the priorities established by the Turkana DDC.	We also need to have evidence that it is their priority that this health centre be opened.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

Kile ninachomuuliza Waziri Musaidizi ni kama anaweza kuwasaidia hawa wananchi ambao wamefanya kazi tangu mwaka wa 1974 wengine wamefanya kazi kwa muda mrefu zaidi iii nao walisaidie baraza kukusanya pesa nyingt, zaidi.	Wangekuwa wakikusanya pesa zaidi lakini hawana ule mcyo wa kufanya kazi; wanafaya kazi kwa unyonge.

KIRWA asked the Minister for Public Works what Plans the Ministry has to link up Chematich and Kipsaina by constructing a bridge across Sinyereri river. <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Maiyani): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. The Ministry is responsible for construction, maintenance and improvement of the classified road network and structures therein. The link between Chematich and Kipsaina is not on any classified road. The Ministry, therefore, has no plans to construct a bridge across Sinyereri River to provide this link.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did not understand what the Assistant Minister meant by his reply, because what he has given is a prototype of the reply he gave in response to another similar question yesterday. I think it would be in order for him to carry out enough research so as to enable him to come back with sufficient replies to the House. The same bridge has been described by the Rural Access Roads Programme officers as "beyond their capacity." The Assistant Minister is telling us that it does not fall under the Ministry. So, where does this particular bridge fall?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I appreciate the hon. Member's observations on my yesterday's answer to another related question. The problem actually seems to be the same and the explanation I have here is to the effect that the proposed bridge should, first of all, be discussed and approved by the local district development committee and forwarded to my Ministry which, in turn, will seek the necessary funds from the Treasury for the construction of the said-bridge, since it is not provided for in the current financial year.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. FALANA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. There is a lot of confusion here. The Assistant Minister says that he wants the local district development committee's approval so that the Ministry can taka  	action. However, a short while ago he had said that the road was not a classified one and so his Ministry was not involved. Which is which? He is confusing us.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, my replies are not confusing at all. The road is not classified and the bridge construction plans have not been forwarded to the Ministry by the local district development committee, which is what I am saying should be done. In turn the Ministry will send that request to the Treasury for allocation of funds. Currently there are no funds allocated for that exercise.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR. KUBO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister had earlier on said that if the road is not classified, it cannot be his Ministry's responsibility. He is, himself, also saying that if the construction of the road is approved by the local DDC, irrespective of whether it is classified or not, he will forward the request for funds to the Treasury. I am seeking to know whether he is now changing his original stand that it is not his Ministry's responsibility and it is now immaterial whether it is a classified one or not.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, a road gets classified from the request by a DDC. When such a recommendation has been sent to the Ministry, the road is classified.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the Assistant Minister does not understand what normally goes on in his Ministry. I say so because the local DDC approved the construction of this bridge three years ago. Unless the information has not been relayed to his office, or he has misplaced it, he should tell us what action the Ministry contemplates to take. The local DDC approved that project even before I came to this House.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I precisely agree with the hon. Member that the information has not reached my Ministry.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We believe  _ . 	very strongly that before any replies are brought to this House, proper research between the Ministry's headquarters and the field staff should have been carried out. If it actually can take three years for vital information to come from the field officers to the Ministry of Public Works headquarters, are we really working? is anybody bothered to serve this Government? Can we be told how possible that is really, to have such information taking more than three years to get from the field offices to the Ministry's headquarters? That is sabotage.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry does not have those minutes. If they were mislaid by the local DDC, we do not know.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the hon. Assistant Minister in order to say that the minutes of the DDC did not reach the Ministry's headquarters whereas the Provincial Works Officer attends those DDC meetings?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Provincial Works Officer may have attended that meeting but the minutes have not been forwarded to us up to now; otherwise, I would not be having this answer to the effect that we expect to be informed from the district what the position is. If the hon. Member can get hold of these minutes from the district and bring them to us, we shall start attending on the matter.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. If the Ministry's officer did not attend that particular DDC meeting, then when the minutes are prepared, sufficient copies are circulated to all Government offices. Now, instead of the Assistant Minister trying to dodge the Question, why can he not say that he will go back and check with those other Government offices and come back with an adequate reply?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has checked and that is why we have this answer.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is giving a responsibility that is supposed to be carried out by his officers. When you look at this answer and the one I was given yesterday, it is just a require of the same answer, which means then that the Assistant Minister has not done enough research. Can the Assistant Minister do enough research and bring a proper answer to this House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry has tried very hard to get information from the district, and definitely what we have got is what we have. If there is anything else, I do not know how to get it because the same officer will tell me the same thing.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: Sack them! Sack them!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: If the hon. Member can co-ordinate with his district and bring me the information, we shall certainly take action.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.	I do not understand this and I think we need your guidance. Unless we have been assigned a different role of trying to collect minutes from the district, then that is not our assignment. We need your guidance here because the Assistant Minister ought to liaise with his officers in the field and give proper information. If they are not giving him proper information, he should sack them.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA:	On he should resign!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA:	Yes.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have stated that we have liaised with our officers in the district and what I have is what they gave us. If there isanything wrong in the district, which is natural, I request the hon. Member to assist me also.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. This is becoming rather serious and we need guidance from the Chair. What has been happening with this Ministry is that the answers they bring to this House are scrap papers because nobody even signs the answers. Most of the answers we get do not even bear Ministry letter heads and are not signed. That is why you get replica replies. You ask about a road in Kibwezi Constituency and you get the same reply applying to Kabarnet or some other place and the Ministers do not bear any responsibility. Can we have guidance from the Chair regarding the legality of these documents in this House?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>DR. MISOI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, hon. Ndetei stood on a point of order and I thought I am entitled to reply to it.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: Sit down!	Sit down!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI:	I was asking for guidance from the Chair.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Yesterday, the same Assistant Minister could not give a satisfactory answer to a different Question but which is similar to this one. The contention is this, that the district development committee, whose composition includes officers from the Ministry, sits down and recommends certain things. Now, when an hon. Member asks a Question to the Ministry headquarters and the Assistant Minister comes with an answer which has no relation with what the district development committee has decided, it simply means that nobody bothers to contact the officers in the field. It means that the Assistant Minister is either ignorant, misled or has no faith in the people who are in the grassroots. Why do we have the district focus strategy for rural development?	It is to feed the Ministry headquarters with the right information. Now, is it in order for the Assistant Minister to give such an answer to the House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, he is very right. He is very right.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER:	That you are ignorant?</Newspeech>(Laughter)  <Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: I do agree with him in the way of procedural approach to this matter. However, there is no existence and I have denied that of any minutes of the local district development committee.	We are not aware that the local district development committee did pass anything. All I am asking the hon. Member is to kindly assist us also because now there is an allegation that there was a district development committee recommendations but we do not have any evidence about it. The evidence I have is what I have. I have advised that this road be taken to the district development committee, if it has not been taken there, and then the minutes of the committee be brought to us to facilitate the classification. After that we will approach the Treasury for money. At the moment we do not have money for the road.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order, hon. Members! I hope, Mr. Assistant Minister, you have seen that the House is not very happy with your reply. Could you kindly take trouble to really find out what is happening in this thing. I also appear to habour the fears being expressed by hon. Members.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will take action to ascertain the position.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I wish to draw the attention of the Chair that hon. Ndetei said that there was a paper which contained the reply from the Ministry but had no letter head or signature. Are those the kinds of replies we are going to accept in this House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: I am sure the hon. Assistant Minister has taken note of that advice from the Gracious Lady.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry forwards the reply to the Question on a plain paper but the Permanent Secretary writes to the Clerk of the National Assembly on a headed paper. And that is just what I have here.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order, order, hon. Members!

WAMBUA asked the Minister for Public Works when roads C101 - Wamunyu turn-off to Makutano Market and E713, from Makutano to Kalawa will be repaired. <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Maiyani): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON.

It is my Question.Sir, the District Works Officer, Machakos, has been instructed to arrange to grade the roads	Wamunyu-Makutano (C101) and Makutano-Kalawa (E713) immediately the current rains stop.At present the district is very wet and grading in most areas has been rendered impossible.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: This road is in a terrible mess, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and bus operators have stopped operating there. The bridges have been cut off and the area is now threatened by famine and the people do not have means of communication to enable whom buy food from Machakos. How soon is this road going to be repaited because it is to give instructions without following them? The Ministry does not move to the countryside to see the problems of the people and that is why it is failing. The answers we get from the Ministry are not adequate and serviceable. This road was in a mess even before the rains set in and now the Assistant Minister is using the rains an excuse by saying that it is now very wet and the roads cannot be graded. For how long are the roads going to remain in that state?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we had a problem of graders and presently we have two graders that have been repaired and they are ready to go and service this area. In fact, arrangements have been made to send these graders in the following order:- Grader A is being sent to Mwala. Kilimani and Yatta while grader B is being sent to Makueni, Kangundo and Kathiani. These roads will be graded as soon as the rains stop because if the grader moves there, it will mess up the place more.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KYONDA:	Mr. Speaker, Sir, you can see that we are gettingvery unsatisfactory answers from the Assistant Minister. He said that graderB will be working in Kangundo, but those of us who know the geography of Machakos District, know the distance between Kangungo and Kathiani. In between these two places we have Machakos Central, Mwala, Mbooni and Makueni. I doubt if the Assistant Minister knows what he is talking about.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Sir, I said that grader A is scheduled to work on Mwala, Kilimani and Yatta reads while grader B is going to Makueni, Kangundo and Kathiani to service roads there.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the main Problems facing this country is the maintenance of roads Particularly those that are tarmacked. Now that this particular area is	time with facing  .shops cannot be supplied with food due to impassable roads. That plans does the Ministry have to ensure that these roads are constantly maintained and not just to wait for the mains and use is as an excuse for the poor state of roads. It started raining in that particular area only two weeks ago and the reads have been in that state for the last two years and no action has been taken. What concrete p1ans does the Ministry have to ensure that roads in this country are properly maintained particularly those which are not tarmacked?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is doing its level best to maintain and construct roads all over the Republic and we go by priority. When we get priorities from the districts, we look at our pockets and try to help as possibly as we can. I said recently in this House that we had ordered tippers and we are going to allocate one to each district. These tippers will take murram to where it is needed.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Sir. In view of the powers given to the Chair under Standing Order No.	1 - I am not challenging the Chair but merely seeking your guidance - is there any provision in our Standing Orders where the Chair can bar these Assistant Ministers who do not give satisfactory answers from responding to hon.

WAMBUA:	On a Point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.	I need your  guidance and protection because the answers I am getting from the Assistant Minister are irrelevant to what has been asked in this House.

WAMBUA: Sir, can the Assistant Minister direct that grader A, which is in Mwala, be taken to Road C101 so that when the rains subside, it starts doing this road? That is the confirmation I want and not to be told that it is in Mwala.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, these two zraders are in the district headquarters and as soon as the rains stop, they will be driven there. They cannot be driven there now because it is wet and slipperly.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: On a point of order, Sir, I have a feeling that the Assistant Minister is deviating from his earlier reply. He had said that there two graders, that is, grader A to work in Mwala and grader 3 to work in Makueni, Kangundo and Kathiani, but he is now saying that they are somewhere else. Can we get an assurance that this ‘famous’ grader 3. will be seen working in Makueni when the rains stop? This is because wehave been requesting for a long time that the road from Makueni to Kikumini and Mavindini be graded since bus operators have withdrawn their buses from there? Can we get an assurance because he is changing his answer from time to time.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said that the district received two rehabilitated graders which are going to be used in certain areas. For instance, grader A will be used in Mwala, Kathiani and Yatta. But that does not mean that it is there already. No, it is at the district headquarters. Also, grader B will be used in Makueni, Kangundo and Kathiani.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I need your protection here. Can the Assistant Minister be requested to visit these areas and ascertain where these graders are, if he is there to serve the interests of the public? Can he ascertain that they are there and take them to the appropriate places? It does not serve any useful purposes at all to be told that the graders are there and yet they are not there physically. This is the reason why we bring questions here in the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the graders are in Machakos District. I think they are at the district headquarters. After the rains have stopped they will be taken to the places I have mentioned. This is our plan. The District Works Officer has been instructed to start the operation. But we cannot take those two graders to those areas because they will be stuck in the mud.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIILU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in fact, we have been complaining to the D.D.C. about the works officers within the Machakos District. The way the Assistant Minister is answering the Question is-not correct. He is being fed with wrong information. The graders he is referring to are not there in the area. I would like the Assistant Minister to take stern action with his officers in the district because they are doing absolutely nothing. They should either be transferred or sacked because they are giving us wrong information and every Member from that district has "been complaining.

I beg to apologise and reply.(a)	The Ministry will prepare and issue title deeds to the formerly partner-owned lands in Cherangany Division as soon as the survey of the subdivisions of the lands is completed and the owners surrender the held titles to the Government. (b) The number of farms under this category in Cherangany Constituency will only he known after the held titles have been surrendered to the Government. None has been surrendered so far.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the farmers have already completed the subdivisions of their farms and I do not understand what is affecting the surrender of those title deeds by the former owners.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOMETT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it depends on who has done the survey work.	If it is a private surveyor who has carried out the survey work then it has to be checked by our Ministry officials again before the title deeds are issued. 	Also, it is very important that once the survey work has been completed or while the work is being carried out the owners of the land or the company must surrender the original title deeds to the Government to enable the issuance of individual subtitle deeds to the individual owners. In fact, the whole initiative rests with the owners of plots.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to know from the Assistant Minister who the survbyors of this faam were.</Newspeech><Newspeech>BOMETT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not think that the hon. Member has understood the Question all. We are not talking about an individual farm but about the issuance of title deeds for the former partner-owned land in cherangany Division.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in one of his earlier replies, the Assistant Minister said that these surveyors have to be an constantly checked by the Government. Could we know who in the Government are responsible for checking to see that these Surveyors are doing their job properly.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOMETT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not think that the hon. Member understood the English words that I used.	I did not say that these surveyors are checked.	What is checked is the work they do.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWAT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of this survey work was done five years ago and I do not know what has been causing delay in the issuance of title/deed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOMETT: Mr. Speaker,	Sir, I wish the hen. Member could be specific and ask why although survey work on a Particular farm has been completed the title deed has not been issued. At the moment, 	I cannot say what is delaying the issuance of title deeds general unless a specific question is asked regarding a specific farm. I am saying this because each farm has its own unique Problems and I would therefore like the hon. Member to come to the Ministry so that we can find cut whether there are certain farms where although survey work has been completed, no title deeds have been issued. 	I am ready to co-operate with. him on this matter.</Newspeech>(applause) <Newspeech>THE SPEAKER: Can we move on to Mr. Malebe's Question.</Newspeech>Question No. 594 <Header>Owners of Maccu Motors Company</Header><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Malebe still not here? There we shall have to move on to Questions by Private Notice.</Newspeech>	 QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE<Header>Closure of Motor Mart Company - Eldoret</Header><Newspeech>R. MISOI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Labour the following Question by Private Notice:-What prompted the Motor-Mart Group Limitedto close its Eldoret Office?Could the Minister ensure that the over 40 employeesemployed by the then Motor-Mart Group Limited are reabsorbed by the dealers who will take over this business in Eldoret?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. D. M. Amiri): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. The Motor-Mart Group Limited claims that they had in the first experienced a very low financial turnover in their sales due to increased costs of distributions. In order to overcome this problem, they decided to close their office and appoint a suitable distributor to carry on with the distributorship of their commodity. The company transferred four of its former employees to their sister company and requested the appointed distributors to take as many of the remaining 37 people as possible. Allaffected by the lay-off have been paid their terminal benefits in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement between the Union and the Company.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for that answer, is he certain that the remaining workers will be absorbed by this sister distribution company? If not, could he tell this House what he is doing to assist them?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR .D.M. AMITT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am certain that the remaining employees will be absorbed by the sister company. At the moment, the following people have already been absorbed by this company. Mr. Robert Mwaure, Moses Mundara, David Njeru, Charles biru, while 11 other people were taken East African Distribution Company and four others by Masoba Distribution Company, while five others were absorbed by Global Distributors.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, do I take from the Assistant Minister   that all the ex-employees of the former Motor-Mart Company will finally be employed? Is this the assurance that the Assistant Minister is giving to the House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D. M. AMIN: Obviously that is the assurance that I am giving.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, sir, would the Assistant Minister briefly outline the kind of benefits that th4.- laid-off workers were paid.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. D. M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the kind of benefits that these laid off workers were paid under the agreement provided in Cap.234 of the Laws of Kenya, Clause 15 are as follows:-Notice up to five years, one month's notice - or salary in lieu of notice. Notice five to 15 years, two months notice- or salary in lieuof notice.Notice 15 years and over, three months notice - or salary inlieu of notice. m.ere is then 15 days pay for each completed year plus leave due and travelling allowances.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIIIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, would the Assistant produce a letter of appointment of one of the laid off employees so that this House can confirm whether these People were paid in accordance with their terms and conditions of service?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D. M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is a different question altogether, but if the hon. Member is interested, I can try to trace the letter, but this is likely to take me two weeks.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question.</Newspeech>Payment of Mr. Jawa' Court Award. <Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Water Development, the following Question by Private Notice:-Why has the Ministry not paid a Mr. Kaduni Jawa his dues as ruled by the Senior Resident Magistrate, Mombasa, Civi1 Case No. 773of 1985 and also in accordance with the Ministry's letter Ref.No.MWD/FIN/3/40/27 dated 13th May, 1987 addressed to the Provincial water Engineer, Mombasa?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Kisiero): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. Mr. Kaduni Jawa should collect his dues from his lawyers. I have 	confirmed with his lawyers that his payment from my Ministry has already been received in their office.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister's answervague because this is a very old case and from 1935, the Ministry has not given a proper answer as to when this cheque was handed over to the lawyers of Mr. Jawa. We would like him to tell us when this cheque was i issued and what the number of the cheque was.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KISIERO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have confirmed with Mr. Kibererge on 19th November that he had received the cheque sent by Ministry. The cheque number is ZA 609227 dated 13th September, 190 for a sum of KShs.37,290/-. This cheque was issued by the Attorney-General's Chambers Mombasa.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I thank the Assistant Minister for that information, would he tell this House why it took so long for the cheque to be forwarded to the lawyers?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KISIERO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this matter was settled out of court between the Ministry of Water Development and the lawyers of Mr. Kadund. The delay was caused by the fact that the Ministry Headquarters had to undertake a series of correspondence between itself and the Coast Water Office in Mombasa, and the Attorney General's Chambers in Mombasa and this took quite some amount of time.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE SPEAKER: Question!</Newspeech>  Terms of Employment: Mr. Hilowle Mohamed<Newspeech>MR. GALGALLO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister the Public Works the following Question by Private Notice.What were the terms and conditions of employment for Mr. Abdullahi Hilowle Mohamed, P/No. 915307, who retired on 30th September, 1990, after twenty seven years of service?What benefits is Mr. Mohamed entitled to and when will he be paid?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Maiyari): Mr. Speaker, sir, I beg to reply. The terms and conditions for Mr. Abdullahi Hilowle Mohamed, P/No. 915307, were temporary.MR. Mohamed is entitled to the following benefits. His NSSF benefits under the National Social Security Fund Scheme and his compassionate gratuity under the Pensions Act.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for the Assistant Minister to say that was dues are benefits to the workers when it is their money which they contribute?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GALGALLO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant Minister’s reply, does he remember that in the letter of termination of services Mr. Mohamed was told that he was only entitled to his NSSF dues? But I am glad that now the Assistant Minister has extended Compassionate gratuity to Mr. Mohamed. Could he tell the House how much this compassionate is and when MR. Mohamed will be paid?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as of now I do how much the compassionate gratuity is. However, by way of supplementary information, Mr. Mohamed received a letter dated though our District Works Officer, Garissa requestto the Ministry a certified copy his industry    still being awaited by the Ministry. As soon as the above mentioned  information is received by the Ministry his compassionate gratuity will be duty processed. With regard to his NSSF dues, Mr. Mohamed was advised to apply directly to the fund and we hope that he has done so. I have a copy here of the letter which we wrote to Mr. Mohamed and to which we have not received a reply.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think it is high time our laws were revised, because our people do not understand them. It is very serious for a mwananchi to work for 27 years and be only entitled to NSSF dues instead of getting retirement; or pension, benefits.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I agree that this is aserious matter; so, when the law is revised our Ministry, and any  other Ministry, will comply with the new provisions.	But what we know  moment is that the man has been working for 27 years on temporary terms. The Government has shown its appreciation of his long services by Giving him compassionate gratuity. Mr. Mohamed has been asked to produce his identity card For ascertaining his age so that his compassionate gratuity can be Processed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GALGALLO: While appreciating the Assistant Minister’s reply, could he exactly state why Mr. Mohamed had to remain on temporary terms for 27 years when he had actually had Government  Trade Test III for which he was sponsored by the Ministry to study and which should have qualified him for permanent terms of service?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATYANI: Mr. Speaker Sir, there was nothing I coulddo because Mr. Mohamed was offered employment on temporary terms and he accented it.</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR. KIPKORI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, were there no other terms of service that Mr. Mohamed could have been offered? Why did he remain on temporary for 27 years?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member suggested a while ago that the a law should be amended. I hope he will help as to do that. When tile law comes to this House and we Pass it the things will be all right.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYUNDA:	Speaker, Sir, if Mr. Mohamed’s serviceswere needed for 27 years, why were his terns temporary?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI:	Mr. Speaker, Sir, temporary terms are offeredon renewable contract basis and an employee can choose to renew his contract or go elsewhere. Since each gear. Mr. Mohamed chose to repeatedly renew his contract his years of service accumulated to 27.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GALGOLLO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Since it has been established that Mr. Mohamed worked for the Ministry for 27 years, at what stage did temporary terms become	optional? An employee qualifies for permanent terms to serviceafter three years, service. When did Mr. Mohamed choose to remainon temporary terms?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MAIYANT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we understand that there are temporary permanent and pensionable terms of service. Inthe case Mr. Mohamed. he repeatedly chose to renew his employment on temporary terms because there ,was no establishment on Permanent terms for him. He was lucky to have been able to work in one place rather than moving from place to place still on temporary terms.  That is how many years of service accumulated to 27 and the Government has shown appreciation by giving him compassionate gratuity.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR:	On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister said that the man</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: 	Order, Mr. Kipkorir! You should not raise a point of order on the same issue. Let us move on to the next Order.</Newspeech> 	<Header>MOTION</Header>THAT, in view of the fact that Mombasa Municipal Council has failed to abide by its by-laws governing the procedure of awarding tenders of recarpeting and construction of Mombasa Town Planning roads and noting with great concern that the municipal books of accounts have not been audited for the last eight years; this House calls upon the Government to order the Council to take the following measures without delay:-(a) 	that the Council must be inviting tenders for recarpeting/construction of twon planning roads to enable it to be awarding to the lowest tenderer provided that the lowest tenderer complies with all other conditions of the Council. (b) 	that the Council must audit its books of accounts immediately and up-date them accordingly. (c) 	that the service charges collected by the Council must be accounted for accordingly. (Mr. Kiliku on 14.11.90) (Resumption of Debate interrupted on 14.11.90) <Newspeech>MR. KUBO: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute my views in respect of this Motion. I know that the Minister for Local Government is here. I also know that there has been a expression of opinion to the effect that this is a purely political Motion, but I am looking at it as it is drafted without caring about the Mombasa politics because the Motion raises national issues. The first thing in note in the Motion is that it is stated as a matter of fact that the Municipal Council of Mombasa has failed to abide by its by-laws governing the procedure of awarding tenders. This problem affects the whole country. You will find that some people in all our organisations want to avoid the procedure of tendering that is laid down.The tendency everywhere is that people are given tenders behind the door.	So, this Motion urges therelevant Ministry to do what is already provided for. It is a fact that tendersare not being properly awarded, and this is wrong. Everything that is	must always be condemned. This House must condemn such a system.	We know that the laid down tendering procedure requires that tenders notices are placed in our local newspapers and then tenderers invited to come forward in the presence of a contractor.Tender documents are then opened in the presence of the relevant officials and representatives of the tenderers. If this is not being done, we must condemn the system. Another problem that has been stated here is that the books of accounts of the Council have not been audited for the last eight years.	If tnisis the case, we have the right to ask why this has not been done.	I know that: some hon. Members spoke here before me claiming that there is a problem with part (b) of the Motion which says that the Council must audit its books of accounts.	However, after reading through the Motion, I know that this is merely a technical mistake in drafting the Motion.	I know that the spirit of the Motion is to urge the Council to have its books audited.	It has been stated that the Council must audit its books of accounts, but we know very well that the Council does not audit its books of accounts.	All that is being requested is that the Council facilitate the auditing of its books of accounts. If these books are not being audited, how can we know that money is not being misused? 	Auditing of books of accounts is a part of our system of accountability, and this is why we have the Public Accounts Committee in this House for the purpose of looking into the audited accounts of Government Ministries. We also have the books of accounts of parastatal bodies audited as a part of our system. So, I do not see why we should not have a procedure of ensuring that all local authorities produce their audited accounts every year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must not look behind this Motion and say that certain people in Mombasa are being victimised, such as councillors. I would even say that although this matter is still under discussion, we have read in  the Press of a meeting that was supposed to discuss the issue, but it aborted. We are not party to whatever happened in Mombasa at that time because that is an internal matter of the Council but, as a matter of principle, we must condemn such meetings taking place when the matter is still before the House. When we are discussing any national issue here, this should not be made parochial.	I know that some people look at this Motion as a matter being raised by hon. Kiliku, the Member for Changamwe, as an individual. Since it is known that the Member for Changamwe has had some problem with the Chairman of Kanu in Mombasa, some people see this Motion in that light, but this should not be the case. We look at this issue as a national problem in that the books of accounts of the Council are not being audited nor are tenders being awarded according to the laid down procedure. Let us support the Motion and forget our own internal politics since the matters that are brought to this House are national issues. We are the leaders of this country and if we allow things to deteriorate just because if we discuss them here we might be told that we are against certain people or systems, we will be misleading ourselves. All I am saying is that even if the hon. Mover was a bit emotional when moving the Motion and said that there was corruption in the said Council, we should ignore these statements and look at the Motion as touching on a national problem. We should stop the awarding of tenders illegally not only by Mombasa Municipal Council but also by any other local authority or institution in this country, including parastatal bodies. If we use the right path, we are sure that we will save our country from a lot of problems. Right now, a lot of money is being wasted in irregular tendering and in not having books of accounts audited. With these remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Mbori):On a pointof order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.	When this Motion was being moved last week, thehon. Mover, the Member for Changamwe, promised to bring here not only a letter addressed to the Minister for Local Government, but also minutes of the Municipal Council of Mombasa. Could he now lay these documents on the Table?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KILIKU:	Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have all the documents_ that Imentioned last week, and I cannot say anything in this House that I cannot substantiate. 	I am going to lay these documents on the Table. when I am called upon to reply to my Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Mbori): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. With due respect, the hon. Mover said in his statement that the Council minutes and the letter addressed to the Minister for Local Government would be brought here the following Tuesday, which was yesterday. Could he now lay these documents on the Table?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister did not come to this House yesterday afternoon when you ruled that I should lay these documents on the Table in the course of replying to my Motion today. So, he should apologise to the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. ole Kaparo): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I support the point of order raised by the hon. Assistant Minister for Local Government, which is valid at this time to. because if he is supposed to respond to issues in the documents upon which hon. Kiliku relies, it is incumbent upon hon. Kiliku to lay the documents on the Table now in order to avail the hon. Assistant Minister an opportunity to respond; otherwise, he will be taking the Assistant Minister by surprise. I suppose the rules of this House do not allow an hon. Member to lay an ambush and get an Assistant Minister unawares. So, I think hon. Kiliku should lay those documents on the Table now.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: I am sure that it will not be possible anybody to lay an ambush for Minister ole Ntimama, who has withstood such move for many years before. I am sure he will withstand such a move even now. In spite of that, and for the benefit of hon. Minister, I think you, Mr. Kiliku, must be having enough of the documents you are going to use in replying to your Motion. Pass these copies over to the Minister.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Hakuna mmcja wetu hapa anawaza kuunga rakono hor.go iendelee kwa sababu itavunja msimamo wa Serikali na nchi yetu na na mwishowe itailetea nchi yetu taabu kubwa sana. Kwa hivyo, mtu nimoja akiandika barua, bila kupata najibu hiyo si kuonyesha kunaufisadi. Unaweza kunindikia barua, naniarie kuyachunguza vale inalalamiko yalio katika barua yako, siwezi kujibu barua yako kabla sijamaliza kufanya uchunguzi au sijafikia mwisho wa uchunguzi wangu. Lakini hiyo si kyonyeshi kwamba ni naunga mkono ufisaoi. Ikiwa kuna barua ambayo Waziri ameandika kusema kwamba nilazima kandarasi maalum apawe kandarasi pekee yake, basi ni heri iwekwe kwa meza ili tuione. Lakini kusema maneno pekee yake, bila kutoa barua ambayo itaonyesha kwamba Waziri wa Serikali za Wilaya aliilazimisha-- Manispaa ya Mombasa impatie fulani kandarasi hiyo bila kufuata sheria hakutoshelezi. Tungetaka kujua mambo yote.Bw. Spika, baraza huwa na ukaguzi wa vitabu bya hesabu. Books of accounts of the municipality have not been updated. Makampuni ya inje ya meulizwa yaombe yapewe kandarasi ya kukagua vitabu za hesabu. Already a firm of accountants has been appointed or given the contract to up-date the accounts of the council.Kwa hayo machache naomba kupinga.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Bw. Spika, tunaunga Hoja hii mkono kabisa. Hoja hii imeletwa hapa ile uongozi wetu uwe na msimamo. Hatutaki mtu yeyote ataje mambo ya Mombasa au, aserae kwamba tunanshambulia Wasiri. Waziri anaweza kushanbuliwa ukiwa kuna haki za kutosha. Tungetaka sheria zetu zisazishgw na Bunge hili. Hakuna haja kusema kwamba tuna mshambulia Waziri. Mara kwa mara, sisi husema tungetaka hata pesa za Harambee ziew zikikaguliwa. Kila mwaka Public Accounts Committee huleta ripoti yake hapa lakini hakuna mtu anaifuata. Sasa Hoja hii ingetaka mambo yote yawekwe kwa lain na Waziri achikue hatua mara moja. Kuna konseli au manispaa ainbayo huendelea vizuri bila vitabu vyake vya hesabu kukaguliwa? Kuna sheria yoyote inasema hivyo? Ikiwa Manispaa ya Mombasa imekaa miaxa mitatu bila vitabu vya hesabu kukaguliwa tunajuaje kama kuna urisadi   Hatutaki ukaguzi wa vitabu vya hesabu ufanyike katika Mombasa pekeeyake;	tungetaka ufanyike katika Jamhuri nzima. Wakuu wa wilava	ndiowenyeviti wa	kamati	za kutoa maploti,	kandarasi,	DDC na	kila	kitu.Ni kitu gani Ofautihao wasu wa wilaya wanacho?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. Said-Hemed) :	Bw.

Ana haki ya kusema hivyo?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR:	Bw.	Spika, mimi ninatoa maoni yangu. Ukisema ukweL,	mtu mwingine analeta maneno mengine au kuuliza kama una haki ya kufanya hivyo.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESORUCES (Mr. Said-Hemed) :	Jambo	la nidhamu,	Bw.	Spika. Mhe. Mbunge Ekidor analipotosha Bunge hili	kwa	sababu	si kweli	kwamba Waziri wa Serikali za wilaya ndiye anayewateua wakuu wa wilava kuchukua kazi hizo	zote. Ningetaka ahakikishe kama hiyo ni kweli.	Hiyo ni kazi ya Serikalikuu. Ni kwa nini analipotosha Bunge hill?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR:	I am talking about the Government Policy. Bw.	Spika,	sizungumzii maneno yangu au ya mhe. Said-Hemed. Ninazumg-umzia mwongozo wa Serikali.	Waziri Msaidizi anasikia hayo? Tungetaka kofia ya utawala	igawanywe.	AAt	jana wakati Mtukufu Rais alipokuwa akianzisha mwaka mpya aiisema kwamba hakuna mtu mmoja	anaweza kuwa mwenyekiti wa makampuni kathalika.	Alismea ni lazima kila mtu asimamie kazi moja.	Lakini ukimfanyd'mtu mmoja kuwa mwenyekiti wa makampuni mengi,	kazii itaharibika.	Sasa	unapata kwamba mkuu wa wilaya ndiye mwenyekiti wa kamati ya kutoa kandarasi, maploti na kadhalika.	Ni kwa Waziri hawezi kuya-ekebisha mambo hayo? Tungetaka watu wengine wateulie kusimamia kamati nvingine.sababu hii mambo mengine vanafanyika vibaya. Wakati fulani utapata kwamba utoaji wa tenda unaingiliwa na watu wakubwa wakubwa, hivi kwamba ofisa anayehusika anaambiwa, "Toa tenda hiyo kwa yule mtu wetu." Sasa hata.maofisa wa konseli wanaweza kushindwa kufanya kazi kwa sababu ya kuwa wakishurutishwa na watu wakubwa wakubwa.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Wankatwa chini.</Newspeech> (laughter) <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. Said-Hemed): Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Spika. Je, mhe. Mbunge anayesema 	sasa anaweza kuthibitisha ni mahali gani ofisa wa konseli amepigiwa simu ama kuamrishwa na mkubwa yeyote yule atoe tenda kwa mtu fulani?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: 	Bw. Spika, ningemwomba mhe. Said-Hemed asiniingilie ninapoyatoa maoni yangu. He cannot substantiate in this House if we ask him whether the Mombasa Municipal Council awards tenders openly. Mimi ninayatoa maoni yangu hapa.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. Said-Hemed): Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Spika. Litakuwa ni jambe baya na litakaloleta farakano hapa nchini ikiwa mtu ataweza tu kutoa madai na asiyathibitishe katika Bunge hill. Kumedaiwa kwamba kuna maofisa wa konseli ambao wanalazimishwa na watu wengine wenye vyeo vya juu mahali fulani kutoa kandarasi ama tenda kwa watu maalum. Mambo kama haya yakisemwa hapa hivyo na magazeti yayatangaze hivyo, basi tutakuwa na kutoelewana. Ni lazima mhe. Mbunge athibitishe kuwa ofisa fulani alipigiwa simu na mtu mkuba fulani na Akalazimishwa kutoa tenda kwa mfanyakandarasi fulani. La si hivyo, basi anapaswa kuyaohdoa maneno hayo na kuomba msamaha.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I like that argument. Lakini mimi ninazungumza kulingana na jinsi Hoja imewasilishwa hapa. Sikudai kuwa mtu fulani alifanya hivyo, bali niliyatoa tu maoni yangu kulingana na jinsi Hoja hii imewasilishwa hapa. Hoja hii ni wazi kabisa.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Bw. Ekidor, tafadhali, kama unasema kwamba kuna mtu  mkubwa fulani aliyepiga simu na kumshurutisha ofisa wa konseli kutoa tenda ama kandarasi, basi unafaa kuthibitisha mara moja, ama uyaondoe maneno hayo. You understand what.you exactly said, and you now know what hon. Hemed wants you to do.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Bw. Spika, sikutoa madai kama hayo, bali nilisema kuwa pengine huenda jambo kama hilo likatendeka.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. Said-Hemed): Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Spika. Mhe. Ekidor amedai hivyo na, kama anakana kwamba hakuyatoa madai hayo, tunaweza baadaye kwenda na kuthibitisha alivyosema kwenye HANSARD iii.tuweze kujua saa nane ni nani anayeserna ukweli. Ikigunduliwa alitoa madai hayo, na ashindwe kuthibitisha, basi, kama kawaida atabidiika kuyaondoa maneno hayo na kuomba msamaha.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Bw. Spika, Hoja yenyewe hapa ina maandishi kuwa utoaji wa tenda hautangazwi na, kwa hivyo, sifikirii nina chochote cha kuondoa hapa.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Bw. Ekidor, toa maneno yako kwa ufasaha; usiseme kwa lugha ya Kiswahili nusu na lugha ya Kiingereza nusu. Kama uiitoa madai ya aina hiyo, natoa uamuzi uyaondoe na kuomba msamaha, na uendelee kuyatoa maoni yako.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Bw. Spika, kama weave mwenyewe ulisikia nikitoa madai kama hayo, basi niambie niyaondoe kwa kuwa kweli sikumbuki nikidai hivyo.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Bw. Ekidor, nimefahamishwa hapa kwamba uliyatoa madai hayo kwamba kuna maofisa fulani wakubwa wakubwa'ambao, kwa ufupi, wanaweza kuwa Mawaziri na kadhalika, ambao wanapiga simu katika Mombasa Municipal Council kuwashurutisha maofisa huko kufanya mambo yasiyo ya kisheria. Hayo ndiyo mambo ambayo rasa ningependa uyaondoe.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: 	Bw. Spika, kufuatana na uamuzi wako, ninayaondoa maneno hayo.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Onyancha): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. In view of the fact that the hon. Member has only withdrawn that statement, which should not have been made in the context that he did, could he also be asked to apologise?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: I thought he had done that, too.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR:	Mr. Speaker, Sir, I withdraw and apologise.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Let us have the Government responder now.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Ntimama): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to comment briefly on this Motion by the hon. Member for Changamwe, hon. Kiliku. What worries me is the fact that corruption is the main theme of the Motion. This is a serious allegation and I do not think the hon. Member can really put a whole blanket on the Municipal Council of Mombasa. I think the hon. Member knows that what has allegedly been tabled here are just copies of confidential minutes of the committees of the Council, and I do not know how hon. Kiliku got them. The others are copies of a letter with allegations made by a group of four or five councillors incriminating the Mombasa Municipal Council and highlighting some of the Council's activities. The letter is signed by those counci-ilors. These are only allegations, as I said, by some councillors who are known very well to be opposed to the Mayor of Mombasa Municipal Council as well as to some hon. Members of this House who represent constituencies in that area. I do not think that these claims can be taken as true claims of corruption in the Council. I think this is their internal politics and they are done in very bad taste. 	Now, Sir, I am coming back to say that if hon. Kiliku has real proof that there is corruption in the i4ombasa Municipal Council, he should come out and give out the names of the people who are involved, the actual figures and deeds. When we come to this House and make "sweeping statements, especially concerning corruption and we cannot substantiate them, that is very unfortunate. If hon. Kiliku will give us the names of those involved, the actual amounts involved and so on, we will then take his evidence to court and, probably, prosecute those concerned. However, to come to this House and make sweeping statements that the whole Council is corrupt is wrong and very unfair for the Council. It is in very bad taste, too. I do not want to take much time, but I was going to make a Ministerial statement later on this.	However, let me highlight a few things here. It is very unfortunate for the hon. Member for Changasnwe to say that I, as the Minister for Local Government, condone corruption, or that I am part of that corruption. That is what will be reported by the HANSARD. I must say that the hon. Member has to withdraw that corruption allegation or substantiate the claim thoroughly. Definitely, these papers do not at all substantiate anything; they are just concoctions by a few people who are enemies of other people politically in the Council. For the benefit of hon. Members, I want to say that the Municipal Council of Mombasa is one of the councils in this country that has spent services charge very well for the benefit of the residents of Mombasa. If I could give you a list of the things they have done</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KUBO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 	The Motion talks about irregular tendering of the tender for recarpeting of the road, and we expected to hear the Minmister on that, but he is now talking on the issue of the money collected instead of talking about the council's auditing of the books and awarding the-tender of recarpeting the road.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. old Ntimama): Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the hon. Member would be a little bit patient, I am just coming down to that immediately. I am saying that the Municipal Council has spent about KShs.84 million for carpeting of roads and repairing houses, including houses in hon. Kiliku's Changamwe Constituency. Mombasa Municipal Council is one of the councils that have really done will with its service charge, and I am satisfied that they have really done their job very well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, turning to the question of contracts, definitely it is one or two contractors that have done the roads in Mombasa. Legally, this has been done very well. The Council has recommended to us that some contractor is on the site and, because of the urgency of repairing the roads and because of the urgency of filling the potholes on the roads, the Council would request the Ministry to go on awarding the tender to the same contractor on site at the same rates. That saves time and facilitates quicker repair of the roads. A good example is one time when the Mombasa Agricultural Show was going to take place and the council'requestdd us to approve the contract so that the Contractor Could go on at the same rates betause the job had to be done fast. If the hon. Member reads the Local Government Act, Cap 265 of.the Laws of Kenya, the Minister is</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Can the Minister also explain how the contractor went to the site before he was asked by the council to re-award the contract to him?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. ole Ntimama): Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the hon. Member would listen very carefully to what I am saying, the contractor was already on site. As I eas saying before that interruption, if the hon. Member for Changamwe could read the Local Government Act, Cap 265 of the Laws of Kenya, he would see that the Minister has power to waive the normal tendering procedure if he thinks it is right. In this case, I waived the normal tendering procedure because I knew it was important for this road to be done. We had our engineers on the job and they agreed that the rating was right and that the contractor was doing the right job. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as far as the auditing of the accounts is concerned, we, as a Ministry, always make sure that the books are audited. If the hon. Member for Changamwe wishes to know, we have sent several teams down to Mombasa and we are satisfied that the normal procedure which I could read if I had the time has been followed. Maybe, what we are lacking is what we call external auditing, which has probably not been done in Mombasa. But the books of the Municipal Council of Mombasa are audited. Having said that and it is unfortunate that when this Motion was moved I was outside this country I want to emphasise the fact that this question of corruption must be settled by the hon. Member for Changamwe. We cannot, as a Ministry, agree to sit back and watch the hon. Member making sweeping statements on corruption. He has to give us the names of the people involved and the figures so that we may take action. Without that, he must withdraw that remark and apologise to the House. With those few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I be go oppose the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI: On	a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.	The hon. Minister has said that the Mbmbasa Municipal Council has spent KShs.84 milion and, according to him, the money has been well spent.	The Motion talks about the maintenance of the roads in Mombasa. It is easy to speak in this House but when you go to the site you find things are different. Can the Minister explain why the roads, particularly in the Industrial Area of Mombasa, have been neglected for such a long time? And when I talk of a long time, I can go as far back as three years.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. old Ntimama):	Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think.the hon. Member should realise tht this is a continuing exercise. We will be probably be moving to the Industrial Area after doing the town centre. The roads in Mombasa have definitely improved.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROAD CASTING (Mr. Nassir): Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Spika.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am going to talk as per the Motion and I am not going to introduce anything to do with Mombasa politics. I would like to challenge the Minister to prove whether or not the accounts of Mombasa Municipal Council have been audited for the last eight years. I am very happy that he has taken action</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY (Mr. Kipiagat): On a point of order, Sir. I thought the Minister asked specifically for substantiating of the allegations contained in the Mover's contribution as the time of moving his Motion. I thought that that should precede his reply to the Motion.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: I said that I will bring a copy of that letter on Tuesday so as to substantiate what I have just said. If the Minister has dismissed the letter as my allegation, then I have nothing to say because he is entitled to his opinion.	I have already laid the paper on the Table.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY	(Mr. Kiplagat): That is not specific. We want the names of the contractors and the amounts involved.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Onyancha): On a point of order, Sir. In addition to that, the hon. Member has imputed corruption on the part of the Minister and the officials of the Mombasa Municipal Council. At this stage, he should substantiate with the so-called documents that he has. If the matter is left hanging like that, it would be very unfair. </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are governed by the Chair's ruling and I go by that but not by what any other hon. Member says. This is because we must go by Standing Order of this House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY (Mr. Kiplagar): Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the hon. Member refusing to substantiate his allegations because the Chair has not asked him to do so?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order! Hon. Members, why do you not allow hon. Kiliku to organise his wau of replying to the Motion? Way are you giving him conditions?</Newspeech>(applause)<Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: I am going to talke on the Motion as it is. The papers I have produced are copies from the Mombasa Municipal Council Minutes or proceedings. This is a public document released in May 1989. This was under confidential Minutes which were not circulated. I do not have the Confidential Minutes with me but I have extracts from the Minutes of the Council which is a public document. I am entitled to have public document.   Perhaps, hon. Nassir was moved because he is quoted in the letter.  Item 13 reads as follows:“The Council under the pressure of the Mayor lased the Old Town Fish Market (which is a public institution) to hon. Shariff Nassir." This is the more reason he should have declared his interest. He is quoted in this letter as having been given a public institution. If it is an allegation then it is an allegation.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Ntimama): On a point of Order, Sir. I said  in my statement a while ago that the evidence that hon. Kiliku submitted isa letter by four or five councillors who have been known by this country, especially Mombasa redidents to oppose the Mayer, the Council and, maybe, hon. Nassir himself. These are things said are as general and sweeping. What we want to go down to is the corruption</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Hon. Kililai. I hope you understand what the hon. Minister has just said. You cannot use a letter from some of those councilors as evidence of what you are saying.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Does the hon. Member for Changamwe insist that the Council was not appointed and established under the laws of this land? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.SPEAKER: Can you repeat? I did not hear you well.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (MR. ole Ntimama):Mr. Speaker, Sir, what hon. Kiliku said is a question of confidential minutes.	Just to elaborate further. The committaes are allowed to discuss a few things in the council confidentipliy. What is not confidential are the minutes of the full council meeting. Therefore, hon. Riliku should stop reading the minutes of the committees of the council because they are, supposed to be confidential. He can read and refer to hon. 	But what he is now saying is that hehas the right of producing the confidential mlnutes of the council because the House is supreme. However, what I am now saying is that those councils have also been appointed under the laws of this lend and there is a procedure to be followed. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, ther is nowhere you can appoint a contractor	confidential minutes. That is the work of councillors. It is public. You cannot issue tenders through confidential minutes. It is wrong and corrupt. I think we have to speak "loudly" now. I now quote the adnutes of the Roads Construction Programme."The Town Clerk to report the discussions and the minutes on undertaking the work on emergency basis extra to contain the situation and subject to Ministerial approva1". Sir, when you award a tender to a contractor under a confidential minute, surely the pricing, the workmanship and the supervision is poor. It is the policy of the Government toinvite public tenders for any public institution.   Sir, we should not be seen as if we are opposing this Motion simply because it affects Mombasa area only. We, as hon. Members, Should address ourselves: to the main issue at hand. We should be seen discouraging corruption in public places. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Onyancha): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The hon. Member is afresh beginning to make allegations of corruption on the part of the Minister. The Minister himself has explained that he is entitled under the law to do exactly that. Following the provisions of the law, he gave authority, as tha law permits, and he gave the reasons, the urgency, because the A.S.K. Show, Mombasa, was going to take place. Now, the hon is saying that is corruption. Is that in order? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.SPEAKER: Well, that is also part of argument you are all raising.

Members are allowed to bring in any form of information, whether confidential or in whatever form, to the House. That is why they are hon.

Kiliku has already moved his Motion, but he has to lay on the Table all the paper he has been referring to. </Newspeech>(Hon. Kiliku laid the papers on the Table)<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Onyancha): Mr. Speaker, sir my point of order is that the hon.

I need guidance here and also the House needs guidance. Even if he was entitled to produce these documents, can he be allowed to escape with such allegations imputing corruption on the part of the Minister while there is no corruption according to records? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr.Ole Ntimama): On a point of order, Mr.Speaker , Sir, I think we do not argue completely that a Member is free to bring any information to the House. But I think it is important that some of the information that touches on other people organizations must be substantiated. If they are not substantiated, it is wrong to bring them in the House and we must not let such Members go out scot free when they have laid a whole carpet or a wole cloud of corruption on the Municipal Council of Mombasa and my Ministry. Even this letter by a councilor also refers by name to other hon.Members from Mombasa. Therefore, I still insist that hon.KIliku must withdraw this Motion and apologise to the House. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr.Speaker, Sir. Mine is just a point of procedure. When a Motion has been moved, seconded, the Government Responder has also responded and the Mover has replied, I think what remains is for the question to be put. So can we have the question put, Sir, to dispose of the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.SPEAKER: Oredr! Mr.Mwamzandi, you are very well versed with our standing orders. Hon.Members are allowed at any stage of our discussion to raise a point of order. Dis you have anything else to add to your Motion, Mr.Kiliku? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.KILIKU: No,Sir.

Today, we find that more and more a women have been given the chance to participate in our economic development. Women groups in Kenya have become a viable economic organ in thiscountry. Mr.Speaker, Sir, hon. Members are really making a lot of noise and I wonder whether what I am saying is being heard. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.SPEAKER: Order hon. Kiliku. Members of Parliament do not make noise; they are merely consulting each other. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to have plots given to women groups because these plots are an important factor in our development. There is no form of development, be it economic or otherwise, that can take place without the availability of land which is one of the three main important factors in our development.You may have capital, but without land, you cannot utilize that capital and therefore, I am calling upon the Ministry of Culture and Social Services to make arrangements to make plots available to women groups in Changamwe so that they are able to continue with their projects. I know that the Minister for Culture and Social Services has been assisting women groups a great deal. I also know that the Government is very much concerned in the  development of women groups throughout the country, which is evident in the way the Government has given women the chance to play a leading role in our economic development. For this reason, when the 	Minister applies for allocations for his Ministry, when he gets loans, 	grants or aid from foreign donors, he should not forget the women groups in Ghangamwe constituency.These women groups are Playing a very important role in our development and therefere, I appeal to the Minister to support this Motion so that women groups in my constituency can benefit. I am saying this because there are more women groups in Changamwe than any other constituency in Mombasa.At the moment, thereare between 60 and 70 women.I am very pleased with some of the local leadersin Mombasa who have recently been assisting these women groups through Harambee constributions. These women groups must be given their rightful share by the Ministry of Culture and Social Services to enable them to develop. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one way by which we can assist these women groups, not only in Mombasa, but also in the entire Republic, is by looking for external market where they can sell the products that they manufacture. We all know that no country in the world today can prosper eccnomically without external market for selling the locally manufactured goods. For this reason, I am calling upon the Ministry address himself to the problem of lack of external market for products from these women groups. We also have the jua kali products in this country andeewe also need external market for all these foods. We have now Proved beyond any reasonable doubt that women groups can do a very good job, Particularly in the export processing zone which is going to be established, maybe next year. In my constituency, those women groups which can manufacture products for export should be considered for assistance. We have for examp1e, the Utaratibu Women Group in my a constituency, which manufacture traditional pots. No other women group in the country that makes these Pots and I have been made to a understand that these earthen pots should fetch a Iot of money in the mxa external market.Therfore, we would exchange by selling these pots outside the country.  Mr.Speaker, Sir, we should try to invest in our own country in order to develop ourselves. The benefits that are obtained from an indigenous investor are more advantageous that those obtained from foreign investors. I m saying this because a foreign investor must be given the chance to repatriate hi profits, as opposed to an indigenous investor because all his profits remain in the country. I know it is the policy of the Government to encourage foreign investors to invest in this country, but I think it is also important to encourage our indigenous investors so that they can participate fully in the economic development of our country.	When the economy of a country is fully controlled by the indigenouspeople, economic probles are minimized.	At the moment, we have the Gulf crisiswhich is going to affect us economically, but this crisis has come about for no fault of our own, but I would like to call apon our policy makers not to it ignore other very important factors that would contribute to problems that could affect our-economy. We do not want certain people to take this Gulf crisis as a cover-up for increasing the price of petroleum products. 	Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are also other things that we should discourage because these things also affect our economy. For example, there is corruption and illegal importation and exportation of goods, and I feel Government should come out to wipe out these malpractices. I know that the Minister for Culture and Social Services has a provision of Shs. 1.6 million for the women groups, but unfortunately, this provision is too small. In fact, it is like a drop of sand in the ocean and I am saying this because we have very many women groupsa and therefore, I f feel that this provision is far from adequate. Most of these women groups in my constituency do not make losses in their projects and I have given a very goci example of one of these RTOUDS that manufacture traditional earthen pots. Mr. Sneaker left the Chair? The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kagwima) took the Chair  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I am talkinh now,   the Mombasa Municipal Council is planning to sub-divide some of the plots Chaani and Mikindani. This is why I am appealing to Ministry to a-vornach the council when this allocation</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIUAL SERVICES (Mrs. Ogot):	on a point of order,	Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. While the hon. Member is making very important points on this Motion he knows a very well that the Ministry of Culture and Social Services would not get the land; he knows that	his DEC is in a better position to do that. Is he in order to mislead the House in the process of making other important points?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the DEC and the Ministry fall within one Government and not two Governments. There is nothing with me appealing to the Minister to approach the Mombasa Municipal Council and see whether it is possible for women groups in Chaani and Mikindani to be allocated plots. Even those women get small plots I know they will initiate projects. I appeal to the gracious lady, hon. Ogot, to be the first to support me because I now she knows women problems better than any other hon. Member in this House. I hope she will support so that women groups, including those in here area, can get plots so that they can initiate development projects. Projects like residential houses are good for women croups because even if they disagree, the Project still stands; but if they have liouid money, when they diseigree they will divide among themselves. 	As person representing an urban area, I know there is acute scarcity of plots in towns.	There may be a lot of land in hon. Ogot's Constituency, but in Changamwe we have no land. This is why I am appealing to the Minister to Changamwe to get plots.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKDER (Mr. Kagwima): Mr, Kiliku, what hon. Ogot said is that the Ministry is	not in charge of allocation of plots. But I also agree with that you were only requesting the Ministry to liaive with the Mombasa Municipality to see whether the women group can be considered for plots allocation.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. With those remarks, I beg to move and request hon. Ndetei to second this Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Nassir): Mr. Temporary Deputy speaker, Sir, why not me and I come from Mombasa?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. It was my wish for hon. Kassir to second the Motion but he cannot that since he an Assistant Minister.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Magwima): Will hon. Ndetei second the Motion?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI: Thank you. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to second this very important Motion, which has been raised by hon. Kiliku. Women groups have made quite a big contribution towards the development of this country. In fact, women are important participants in the buidling of school and hospitals You will Find that the majority of the people  turning up for school or clinics construction work are women.	Thishappens for various reasons sometimes husbands work in far places and so women have to contribute labour to development projects. I would like to thank the Government. Particularly his Excellency the President, for making it possible for women in this country to be organised and be assisted througth the Ministry of Culuture and Social Services and the Office of Vice Presideny and Ministry of Finance to start economicaly    will improve their economic status.	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, sir, Sir, in the past women were not regarded as income earners for the family. Therefore, married  women were regarded as part of the husbands property. But now things are changing and as continue to catch with life styles inthe. western world we are	moving towards a stage where everybody would like to be economically independent so that a woman doesnot have to ask for Shs.5/- from here husband every day forsalt and other small domestic things. Again, single mothers wouldbe able to have income to support here children and do other things. So, this Motion is	very important because it seeks to assist women not only in hon. Kilikats Constituency but also all over the country. You wil1 find since Changamwe is in town the women’s problem there will, perhaps, be to get a plot in order to start a project, whereas in my Kibweai Constituency women will need to be started of on another income generating project like goat keeping, bee-keeping and many other projects which are relevant to that constituency. This is to say that each have its own relevant income-generating a Projects.I would be surprised if I found that hon. Nassir wasstanding to oppose this Motion.	This is because even in his constituency with all due respect to him, the majority of the voters are women. It would thus be a shame if he stood up and opposed this; he might even be looking for his way out of this House if he did that. I agree that the Ministry of Culture and Social Services should liaise closely with the relevant organisations to get expiry advice for women group in this country. This will enable the group to know the kind of relevant Projects to their environment.We Know that women are very	enthusing  ideas and starting	Projects, but, to a very large extent, their projects normally do not take off. After this, women tend to go for meetings where they chat and, perhaps, take tea with buns. These projects fail because export advice that should have been given to these women before they started the Project was lacking.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir, I know the Ministry has done a lot: It has posted officers to the field; it has co-ordinated the activities being financed by Non-Governmental Organisations, but still we find a lot of areas that are wanting  We need more expert advice for women.We know that two-thirds of Kenya are either arid or semi-arid areas and income-generating activities are very difficult in these areas. It is important for the Ministry to facilitate these activities and advice women groups in order to motivate the women of Kenya. Our women are very enthusiastic; thanks to their husbands who have been willing to let their wives go out. and meet other women for the purpose of forming women groups. This upgrades the welfare of the family especially when there is some income to be realised from the formation of these groups. It is important that the Ministry does everything possible to ensure that it reaches those areas where women groups have been formed and where women have an objective with regard to what they really want. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, women are generally economically disadvantaged, especially those who do not earn some income. That is why it is important for those who have formed a group should be assisted to identify available Project.	The Government, through	this Ministry, should make available some capital	which the women can borrow as soft loans.	Bank interests have gone up so much high up that I wonder whether most of the project that women undertake will be able to service loans at normal bank rates. If the Ministry looks for soft loans for these women and get its officers to assist them in ensuring that their projects take off and managed in the same way as businesses without powerful politicians interference, this will be very good. Political interference is one of the things that has been killing women initiative. A big politician comes forward and says, "That woman does not support So-and-so. So, let us kills her project." This project may be good and beneficial to the community in the area concerned. What we are saying is that the Ministry shouuld intensify women group activities and ensure that these activities are evenly spread in the country. If we go out today and examine in detail women activities, we will only find that women are heavily assisted in a few pockets whereas in other areas, only a few women are assisted. This assistance should be evenly spread among all  the women in the country.	There should be more close supervision and assistance both technically and financially in women groups so that they undertake only those projects that will generate income. The management committees of these groups should be properly trained in management and given practical assistance by the Ministry's personnel in order to ensure that women groups achieve their goals. I know that in the past there was a haphazard way of assisting wome by non-governmental organisations. Someone in the United States of America might say, "I am assisting a small group in this area" and be given money, but we now know that the Government has managed to bring all such money through the Treasury for co-ordination purposes. This is good. The other thing that the Government should address itself to is ensuring that this money is not use for subversive activities and that the morale of those who donate this money to women groups is not tampered with. When you look at the roots of non-governmental organisations, you find that they are just individuals like you and me. 	If they know that their money is being usefully spent, they will continue to donate more money. So, donors' spirits must be kept high. With these few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I really second the Motion.</Newspeech>(Question proposed) <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah):	Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving an opportunity to speak on this Motion. I support the Motion and, in giving my support, I would like, first of all, to thank the women of Kenya for the tremendous work they are doing in ithe economic and political development of this country. Women play a very important key role in this country's progress, whether in the public or the private sector of our economic environment'.	It is in recognition of this very important role that women play that I support not only this Motion but also any other which goes towards uplifting the standard of living and the status of women.    I only have about three points to make, and I will make them very briefly. First cf all, I do not limit this Motion to the women of Chanpamwe alone.	I appeal to the Minister to extend what he is going to give the women of Changamwe to all the women groups in Kenya. I appreciate the fact that by supporting women groups, we are, in fact, helping in the alleviation of unemployment in this country. The women groups' projects that are strewn throughout the countryside have a low capital input for the creation of one particular job as opposed to the huge sums of money involved in establishing large industries. So, by giving women groups small sums of money, such as Shs.2,000/=, Shs.3,000/=, Shs.10,000/= or Shs.50,000/=, we will create many jobs for Kenyans than will be the case when we establish a large industrial project that requires Shs.200 million or Shs.300 million. I like this Motion because it seeks, in one way or another, to alleviate the unemployment problem that we have in Kenya. Secondly, I would like to urge the Ministry when allocating funds to various women groups, to look for ways and means of allocating these funds to districts, which, in turn, will allocate them on the basis of the number of women groups there in every division. In this way, we will ensure that every women group that exists, being registered by the Ministry of Culture and Social Services, is actually helped.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, sir, in Kaloloeni Constituency I have about 97 women groups at the moment with varied Projects. These include farming, bee keeping, poultry and so on. I approached the Ministry for assistance but only one or two women groups have been given some KShs.2,000/- or KShs.3,000/-. I would therefore like to urge the Ministry, while they seek the limited funds that there are and while they seek funds from donors outside, to ensure that Pla the women groups that have been registered with the Ministry do got some measure of the funds that are available. I would even suggest that the Ministry of Culture and. Social Services tries as much as possible to rationalise the aspect of non-Governmental assistance from outside so that this is spread uniformly throughout the Republic. With regard to technical assistance,	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,	it is important that women groups are in fact assisted in the keeping of proper books of accounts for their Projects. I know of women groups that have disintegrated simply because one woman kept the funds in her house; the fire gutted that house and	there has been a dispute as to whether the money was actually destroyed by the fire or whether she actually did something else with it.	This has created problems	within that group.	I would like to urge the idinistry that when giving certificates to women groups, they should makr, it a condition that books of accounts will be maintained and that those groups are in fact kept in bank accounts mandatory.  This condition must be fulfilled before the Ministry gives certificates to those women groups. I see a problem here because there are very many areas that are very remote indeed and there are no banking facilities in those areas. I feel that a way to assist these areas-should be found. I am sure the Ministry is capable of looking for ways and means of overcoming this particular situation. But many women groups would, by and large, have either a mobile bank visiting their areas or something of that nature. What I am saying is that they should be urged, as a condition, that it is for their own good that bank accounts are opened. They should be assisted to keep simple books of accounts. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I myself have taken sometime to teach accounting and I know how difficult it is. In fact one of the projects that the Ministry could carry out is to Perhaps start a project of setting up simple	books of accounts for all the women groups in Kenya and have a uniform Cash Book for that matter. I know that would be a	Cash Book of Beat importance. This is because many of these women groups do not deal on credit; they mainly transact their businesses on	 a cash basis; so it is cash coming and cash going out. So long as these cash transactions are r ecorded	correctly you will in fact make improvaments,      Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other point that I would like to mention, and one that kills the morale of women, is the fact that these groups are formed and offer voluntary services. One lady volunteer comes in and works for a given time and then passes on and another takes over and so for very many years there are no dividends paid cut to the members. This tends to kill the morale of the women groups and we all know that they are the development catalysts in the country. In my view, there should be closer supervision by the Ministry. I appreciate the constraints being faced by the Ministry In that it does not have sufficient social workers to cater for this. However, a way must be worked out so that there is close supervision and these women are made to ensure that as they do whatever worthwhile work in their groups, they also work on some capital accumulation from which they will distribute some dividends to the participants. Sir, if they are rearing goats, or cattle, for that matter, they should ensure that the other members get some dividends from the operations at the end of every year. It could be in form of, say, one goat per member, or something like that. However, if the current situation continues the way it is, it will kill the morale of-the members. I know of several women groups that have disintegrated simply because they argue that they have been members for so long a period and they only put in investments, but do not get anything back for a change. 	So, we must introduce that dividends element in order to perfect this very good groups, which are a useful development catalyst. With those few remarks, I beg to support this Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): 	Hon. Members, it has been brought to my notice that the Minister for culture and Social Services would like to move some amendments to the Motion and, I think I would rather allow him that opportunity now, so that the amendment can be discussed by the House.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mr. Njiru):	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is a very good Motion and one that I can term of national importance. My Ministry is really in support of it. As a result of that, I would like to make a minor amendment here. I would like to make the following amendment. That the words "non-availability of capital" in the third line be deleted and in place thereof we insert the words, "inadequate funds." I call upon hon. Ali Bidu to second the amendment.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU:	I rise to second the amendment. I am sure what has been brought into the Motion will help in giving a broad meaning to the Motion. The phrase "inadequate funds" is proper to this Motion because when you talk of non-availability of capital, you mean that there are no funds at all. When however, you talk of inads.quate you mean that whatever little there is, it will support the Motion.	I quite agree with the amendmen as introduced by the Minister, as that makes it conducive to development. 	With those few remarks, I beg to second.</Newspeech>(Question of the first part of the amendment, that the words to 	be deleted be deleted, proposed) (Question of the second part of the amendment, that the words to 	be inserted in place thereof be inserted, proposed)  <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. Said-Hemed): 	Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to air my views in support of this very important Motion. Sir, I would like to call upon the Minister, when implementing the contents and motives of this Motion, to take into account the fact that these do not Cover Changamwe Constituency alone; they cover Mombasa and the whole country in general. Therefore, the sentiments conveyed in this Motion should cover all the constituencies of this Republic. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to congratulate the hon. Mover of this Motion for having taken the trouble to bring it to the House. As it has been said by other hon. Members, women in this country have played a very important role in both the social and economic welfare of this country. Women are the major supporters of Members of Parliament as far as bringing them into this august House is concerned. A lot of the women groups, Mr. Chairman</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDO: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for the hon. Assistant Minister to refer to you as Mr. Chairman?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Well, he is not in order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. Said-Hemed):	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, most of the women groups in Mombasa District and the Coast Province in general lack the initiative and funds. They try as much as they can to initiate projects and we, as Members of Parliament, try as much as we can to organize Harames and raise funds for them, but that is not enough. We have seen elsewhere in the Republic that women groups have largely been assisted by the various non-governmental organizations and the Ministry concerned, and we call upon the Ministry to try their level best to assist women groups in Mombasa District and the Coast Province in general so that they can come up and play their rightful part in the economic growth of this country. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, our women need our assistance.	Most of them have not gone to school but they are very progressive. They want to enhance their welfare and ensure that they have assisted themselves in one way or the other by initiating projects of various kinds within their locations. They need assistance and we call upon the Ministry to render that assistance. I am told that last year the Ministry had budgeted something to the tune of KShs.3 mil¬lion for the assistance of women groups. We do not want to look into where that money has gone and who was assisted with that money last year. What we are geared to is that during the next financial year every hon. Member should point at various women groups that have been assisted by the Ministry. That way, hon. Members can easily organise Harambee fundraisings for those groups which could not be assisted by the Ministry or by non-governmental organisations.The following year we can organise financial assistance from the Ministry for those groups which have not been assisted. We do not organize Harambees for them but we take those who have not been taken care of. we know from</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER CULTURE SOCIAL SERVICEs (Mrs. Ogot): On a point of order, Sir I am sure that the hon. Member  who is making very important comments  is aware that it is him who is supposed to recommend those women groups that need assistance from the Ministry. This should be done through development committees where our Ministry officials sit. It is, there¬fore, upon him to advice the Ministry those groups which were assisted, say, this year and to recommend those that should be assisted.Thank you.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. Hemed): Sir, I am very glad to hear from my hon. colleague that that is the practice but unfortunately, that is not the case in Mombasa. "Members of Parliament do not make any recommendation neither are their views sought in as far as funding the women groups is concerned. With this information in mind, we will make sure that this procedure is followed in accordance with the laid down regulations with respect women groups funding.with regard to part (b) of the Motion, I agree with the Mover that these women groups need assistance in order to secure pieces of land where they can put up their projects. Land is not a problem is some areas unlike others. This is because some groups cannot afford to buy land. 'These are voluntary organisations which should be assisted by the Ministry through recommendations and liaison with local authorities so that they can acquire land where they can put up projects.As far as Mombasa is concerned. Changamwe has vast lands either Government or Municipal owned in which these women groups were doing a very important job. These groups should be recommended for allocation of these plots for the development of their projects. These plots will go to a number of women group? composing of 100 or 200 members. If this is done, we will have served, at one go, about 200 or 300 people rather allocating such a plot to an individual.This is an important Motion and once it is passed. The  Ministryshould do its best to make sure that it supports the sentiments expressed inthis notion. It should also ensure that all women groups in the country areassisted by the Ministry arid the various non-governmental organisations (NGOs)NGOs do not know the various women groups that exist in this country. Theseorganisations should be advised through the Ministry and it is the onus ofthe Ministry to re commend those worthwhile women group or objects that should be assisted by the NGO funds which I am told are channelled through the Ministry, with those few remarks, I Beg TO support.</Newspeech> (Question of the first part of the amendment that the words to he left out be left out, proposed)(Question of the first part of the amendment, that the words to be left out be left out put and agreed to)(The second part of the amendment. that the words to be inserted in place thereof be inserted, proposed)<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. K'Ombudo): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to say a few words in if this Motion.First of all, I wish to congratulate the Mover of the Motion. It is a good Motion and worthy of support. I wish also to congratulate the Minister for Culture and Social Services for accepting the Motion.Now, having said that, I wish to say that the women of this country have made tremendous efforts in the march for our economic development. Women, as we all know, are the majority in this country and, as such, they cannot be left behind if we were to make significant steps towards economic development.I would like the Ministry to do all it can to encourage the various women groups in the country to do better. I would also like to appeal to the Ministry to encourage the groups to be composed of a few women in number as possible because if a particular group is very large, it becomes armophous, and for business purposes it is not manageable. The various women groups should be of sizes that can make impact economically on whatever enterprise they choose.I would like the Ministry to consider making it possible for the various women groups to be incorporated into limited liability companies. At the moment, the grouping isinformal, and for business purposes it is not serving the women'sinterests. So, they should either be made a business partnershipof the individual concerned or a limited liability company. TheMinistry, through its various officers in the field, can. facilitatethe incorporation of these limited liability companies for the women. This movewould enable the various Women groups to have access to commercialfunds from banks. They should not only rely on Government funds.Once they have been registered as business partnerships or Unitedliability companies, they can have access to funds from the normalcommercial banks in the field.Today Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if you travelled from New York to a West African destination, you would generally see the plane full of very highly enterprising Nigerian ladies and I would like cur women to copy this example. They need not confined themselves domestically here in chickenraising and So forth. I do not want to be misunderstood here because do notwant to say that rearing chicken is not good business, but what I mean to say that  our women are equally doing import and export business They too can be just as enterprising as the Nigerian women who are nowadays very gigantic tycoons and are competing quite favourably with in international business.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like the Ministry to consider looking for ways and means of increasing the budgetary allocations aimed at aiding the various women groups in the country. I think it was hon. Said-Earned who talked about a provision Shs.3 million a year, but I do not think this is enough. Of course,2 the sky is not the limit as far as funds 	are concerned in Kenya, but the area of aiding women so that they can play	their role in our economic development is very important. Therefore, we couldforego some of our budgetary heads in favour of increasing this particular headto assist women groups in this country. If Government would come out to assistthese women groups, they would be able to undertake viable economic projectsand we would then be able to make great a strides in our economic development.I as yet to read in the press of women swindling millions of shillings as hasbeen the case with men.

KUBO asked the Minister for Agriculture whether in view of the fact that the valuationof tree and seasonal crops payable to farmers in cases of destruction or compulsory acquisition,	.	particularly in. Coast Province, is very low,steps he is taking to review the guidelines, governing such valuations.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Ngaruro):Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.My Ministry is in the process of reviewing the guidelinesgoverning the valuation of perennial and seasonal crops payable,to farmers all over the country in case of destruction andcompulsory acquisition. This exercise is expected to be completedby April, 1991.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the guideline has beenthere for quite a number of years. For example, treesparticularly in Coast Province used to be valued differently say as	Kshs.50/=  some trees and of Kshs. 100/= for coconuts mangoes and so on.Since the Assistant Minister is saying that he is going to review the process  next year, what has the Ministry been doing for all thistime? This matter has been  pending for a very long time.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has realised that there is a need to review these payments. This exercise started this year and we are hoping when everything is done, the farmers will get fair compensations for their crops.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, will the Assistant Minister elaborate or give us further information whether that review will include a review of the prices particularly for trees? These prices have remained stagnant for a long time. Will that review also include prices structure?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would not like to preempt the outcome of this particular exercise. When the valuation is completed consideration will be given to the condition of the tree, the age, the yields, returns to the farmer based on the up-to-date market prices, loss in income to the farmer and the cost of establishing similar crops besides other considerations. The whole exercise is meant to give the farmer a fair compensation when his crop is destroyed or the land is compulsorily acquired.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

EKIDOR, on behalf of Mr. Kipkorir, asked the Minister for Agriculture, why his Ministry has not posted agricultural field officers to assist farmers in Embobut Location and when will they be posted.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINSITER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Ngaguro): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.My Ministry has already posted Mr. J. Kibor to Embobut Location to take over from Mr. Ndembangei, who has been transferred elsewhere.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: What delayed the posting of the officer to Embobut? Was the delay due to shortage of officers in the country or what was the cause of the delay?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was no delay. The  officer who was posted their left on 14th August, 1989, and the new officer was posted in November this year. There is a problem of housing in that area and, therefore, there was a delay in posting this new officer. At the moment, the officer is there and it is hoped that he will take care of the farmers.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Speaker Sir, if we follow what the Assistant Minister has said, it is not a delay. Between September 1990, and November this year, it is over a year and you do not call that one a delay?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is not a major delay. It was a slight delay.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister confirm to this House that there are a lot of graduates who aredle without employment? Can he confirm to this house, that these graduates are going to be employed so that these cases of delaying taking services to the farmers can be avoided?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I cannot confirm that because I do not know where they are lying.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said that they have not been employed. After graduating they start tarmacking looking for employment. Can he assure us that these graduates are going to be employed and taken to the districts?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry will employ' as many graduates as possible. I would like to appeal to the hon. Members to encouragethe graduates to be self-employed. After all since the Ministry gavethem the training they should be able to be self employed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEPKOK: Can the Assistant Minister	to the House whether that it is true that there was not: house in Embobut Location for an agricultural officer?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. NGAGURO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said that there was a housing problem. I did not say that there was no house.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEPKOK: Then why did he mislead the Housethat there was a problem of housing whilethere are two houses for agricultural officers in Embobut Location?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did not mislead the House. I said that there was a housing problem.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEPKOK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, what problem was there since there was house for the officer to occupy? Why was the posting delayed?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr. Sneaker, Sir, you can have a house and still have housing problems. As I said, there was a housing problem	and that is why this particular officer left. We have made every effortsto make sure that another officer has been posted.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEPKOK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need your guidanceThe Assistant Minister told the House that was a housing problemin Embobut Location which caused the delay. Can he tellthe House where this man is staying up to this Moment? He has not beenthere up to right this time. He is not there, Why?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGAGURO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been assured that this officer reported. I am not quite sure whether he is there now because he could be out in the field. It was confirmed to me that this new officer has been posted and has moved in. Should there be any further information, I am prepared to investigate.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEPKOK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to tell the Assistant Minister that it is true that the officer is not there. Can he go back and confirm that the officer has, indeed, been posted to Embobut, and maybe come back to report to us either tomorrow or the next day, because he is not there right now. I was there yesterday with the Minister for Environment and Natural Resources and this officer was not there. Can he go there and bring the proper answer to the House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

I come from the area, but the Assistant Minister does not come from that area, although he is still insisting that he has confirmed that the officer has reported there, while I am telling him that the officer has notbeen posted there. Can he, therefore, go back and get the proper answer and bring it back to the House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not going to go back. All I said is that I have been assured that the officer has been posted and if the Member now confirms that he is not there, I am prepared to investigate and take the corrective measure.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEPKOK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said the officer has not been posted. Can he go and confirm? He has not been posted; he is not there; he is nowhere; and maybe he is in the bush where nobody knows. If there is agricultural activity taking place in the bush, maybe he is in the bush; but he is not at the sation.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said that I am prepared to investigate and if the officer is riot there, I will take the corrective measures.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member saysthat the officer is not there which is the truth. The Assistant Minister says that he will investigate. Would he confirm to the House when he will give the answer, since he is saying that he is going to investigate?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said, having got this information, I am prepared to investigate and take corrective measures. That is what I said.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Chair satisfied with the behaviour of the Assistant Minister because when he was asked to say when his investigations will be over, he stood up and just started throwing his hands as if he does not care? Was he in order?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not know whether the question was addressed to me or to the Chair. However, Mr. J. Kiboro has beer, posted to that area and, if he has not arrived, as I had been promised, then I am prepared to take corrective measures. That is what I had already said.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, when will we start-getting the right answers from the Ministers and Assistant Ministers? What I am telling the Assistant Minister is that the officer he has mentioned is not there. The Assistant Minister is still insisting that the officer is there arid that if he has not gone there he will go and investigate. Who will he be invest¬igating for? The Question is already the property of the House and he should tell the House when exactly the man was posted to the area.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the officer is not there yet, as alleged by the hon. Member, and since the Ministry is determined to have field officers to advise farmers, especially at this time of the year, I will go ahead and make sure that the officer is posted next week.</Newspeech>Question Mo. 607 <Header>Payment of N.S.S.F.

No. 200 925 5Q4 .	will be paid his benefits since he retired on31st December, 1987.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. D.M. Amin): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.According to the N.S.S.F's records, only contributions for the years 1966, 1970, 1975 to 1978 have been posted to his account. His former employer failed to fill in the forms for the years 1971 to 1974 and 1979 to 1987. The original schedule of the contribution forms was sent to the area manager-, Mombasa, by the Fund's Ref. No. SFGA 200 925 504/14 of 12th July, 1990. The area manager was requested to have it signed by the employer who had not signed it and to verify the data against the employer's records. Now we have received the forms and the claimant will be paid on 5th December, 1990.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while appreciating that answer, was it the onus of the claimant to communicate with the officers, or why did the. Ministry not write directly to this gentleman to inform him of the delays on the forms that had not been signed?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the first time, we have requested the claimant, if he has any form which has been filled We could not receive the forms on time and were forced to personally follow up through our area manager Mombasa and he did that together with the former employer and now we have the forms duly completed and awaiting the payments which will be made on 5th December, 1990.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the Assistant Minister talks of the area manager, who does he have in mind? Is it the Mombasa Labour Officer, or is it the Fund's officer?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M.

MISOI asked the Minister for Lands and Housing what action he has taken to remove the cumbersome administrative and legal obstacles encountered in the conversion of leasehold land into freehold status, particularly in respect to company/partnership farms due for sub-division.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND HOUSING (Mr. Bomett): Mr. SpeakerSir, I beg to reply.There are no cumbersome administrative or legal obstacles in theconversion, of leasehold land into freehold status in respect of land-buyingcompanies, partnership farms because, on completion of the sub-division andsurvey processes, the leasehold title is surrendered to the Government andexchanged for freehold titles.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Assistant Minister forthat answer but, from experience, many farmers have been finding it verydifficult to have their land sub-divided. The reasons are either legal or technical Can the Assistant Minister tell us whether there are any other reasons that CAUSE such delays and difficulties?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOMETT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said that there are neithenllegal nor technical obstacles whatsoever. The only delay is if the owners of the farmes, or the companies, for that matter, do not furnish the necessary information to the administration. This is because the administration is the one charged with ascertaining the owners of the farms and, once they have done that, they prepare registers. Once register has been prepared and all the necessary information has been incorporated, then the sub-division is completed and people are allocated the plots by the administration. There¬after, our Ministry does the job of registering and issuing title deeds.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would be very obliged if .the Assistant Minister could tell us what information is needed from these people by the administration.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOMETT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the information required and which normally is very difficult to come by is who are actually the owners of the land. Normally, directors bring in conflicting information and, in fact, sometimes they increase the number of owners of the land from the original lists, and so on. These are the things that case delay and, also, a lot of confusion. However, once that is cleared and a list prepared; the' issuance of title deeds is very simple and is done speedily by our Ministry. So, this is actually administrative rather than legal.</Newspeech>Question Mo. 605 <Header>Delay in Releasing Mr. Ogeto's Examination Results</Header> MR. A.H.O. MOMANYI asked the Minister for Technical Training and Applied Technology what is delaying the release of the examination results for Mr. Orechi Bosire Ogeto, Trade Test Index No. 16963/83, Gilgil Examination Centre.	<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TECHNICAL TRAINING AND APPLIED TECHNOLOGY(Dr. Koech): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.In 1938, Index No. 16963/88 was assigned to a Mr. Zasirao Nonchorogewho applied to take the trade test grade III in upholstery at Kamici MaximunvSecurity Prison, the examination of which he passed and a certificate issuedthereof. Unless Mr. Orechi Bosire Ogeto claims to be otherwise known asZasirao Nonchoroge, which he must prove, the Ministry did not therefore delaythe release of his examination results.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.H.O. MOMMANYI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the candidate did his examination at Gilgil and the Assistant Minister is talking about the kamiti Maximum Security Prison. Who gave the index numbers? Is it not the Ministry? What has the Ministry done since then to try and identify the correct person. who ought to have got the certificate? Has the Ministry carried out a research to actually determine who sat for that examination?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. KOECH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said that the person who used the: Index Number at the Gilgil Examination Station was from the Kamiti Maximum Prison.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.H.O. MOMANYI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not agree with this answer because Mr. Bosire sat for the examination at Gilgil and he was given this Indext Number by the Ministry. If somebody else from the Kamiti Maximu Prison was given the same Index Number, it is the duty of the Ministry to sort out the matter. Why did the Ministry have to wait, since 1988 when this candidate sat for the examination, until this Question was asked in this House so that they could take action?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. KOECH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Index Number referred to by the hon. Member, I have indicated, was given to Mr. Zasirao Nonchoroge. Unless Mr. Bosire can produce documents to prove that he was actually present at Gilgil Examination Centre and that he took the examination, we' cannot be of any help.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell us the identify card No. of the candidate who was issued with the certificate, namely, Mr. Zasirao Nonchoroge?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. KOECH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is a different question altogether.\After all, the Index Number was the only information sought by the Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.H.O. MOMANYI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, here we are talking about two examination centres far apart, namely, Gilgil and Kamiti. It is the duty of the Ministry to rectify any mistake that might have: happened, giving the same: Index Number to two candidates. If they did that, then let the Assistant Minister tell us. If it was not the case, then the Assistant Minister -can go back and come here with the correct answer.DR. KOECH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, Index Numbers are released to all candidates annually in a sequence system. No two candidates will share the same IndextNumber, their distance centres and the nature of the trade test notwithstanding.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know it is traditional for the Ministry  of Education go give Index Numbers in. different places. Mow, this Index Numberthe hon. Questioner is talking about is at Gilgil. Did the Assistant Minister check whether the Index Number which he says was issued from Kamiti Maximum Prison was not also issued at Gilgil?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR.

WAMBUA asked the Minister for Co-operative Development why the; coffee farmers from Muusini Coffee Co-operative Society were paid only two payments in¬stead of the usual quarterly payments.<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR CO-OPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Cheruiyot): Hr. Speaker,Sir, I beg to reply.Muusini Coffee Factory is within Kakuyuni Farmers Co-operative Societyin Machakos District. Coffee from this society was delivered to the Board withinJuly/August and September, 1989, which is part of the late part of 1988/89 coffeecrop year. Coffee from this society received two types of payments namely,«delivery payments and, secondly, payment on classification.For the year 1988/89, the Coffee Board of Kenya received payments whichwere paid to the coffee farmers as follows:-1st Payment	GROSS PAYMENTS	RATE PER KILOon 15.11.89	1,451,614	2.252nd Paymenton 24.4.90	753,101	1.802,204,590	4.25Mr. Speaker, Sir, only two payments were made due to the severe drop in coffee prices as a result of the collapse of the International Coffee Agreement in July, 1989. Hence, no further payments on the 1988/89 crop were possible.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBIJA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am satisfied by the answer given by the hon. Minister. BUT since these farmers were used to being paid for their crop and there has been a change such that they will be paid twice, could the Minister make arrangements to ensure that the farmers are informed as to how many times they should expect to be paid before they make their budgets?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

KIRWA: Mr. Speaker, Sirin view the fact that this road was supposed to have been completed in 1989, what has caused the delay?</Newspeech><Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK: Mr. Speaker, it is the contractor who was not speeding up his work. My people are now on him to ensure that the work is completed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR; Mr. Speaker, Sir, since that read has been there forA long time, why did the Ministry appoint incapable contractors who could notdo the work immediately and finish it up?</Newspeech><Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK: Sir, any contractor appointed is capable of completing his work. However, sometimes workers may slow down their work, and that is why it is our duty to follow them up, which is what we are doing right now.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR.

Can he clarify that?</Newspeech><Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is the roadbetween Eldoret and Ziwa which is 33 km. long.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister thenought to have done his homework because he ought to have considersthe whole length of the road from Eldoret to Kitale which is 83 km.and give us an indication as to when work on the section between Ziwa and Kitale is going to begin?</Newspeech><Newspeech>ARRCHBISHOP ONDIEK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, after the completion of road between Eldoret and Ziwa which is 33 km long, weshall do the rest of the road. So far, we have only done 13.5 km.Therefore, we cannot give a definite date as to when work on the section between Kitale and Eldoret will be started.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WABUGE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell us, whether the contract was to cover the Eldoret- Ziwa-Kitalet or Eldoret to Ziwa? If it was for the whole length of the road, can he us the estimated time when the work on the road would be completed?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reason why we divided that road into two sections is because the contract could not be awarded for the whole road of total length 83.

SPEAKER: Next Question, Mr. Kirwa.</Newspeech>Question No. 613Delay in Paying Mr. Telewa's Court AwardMR. Kirwa asked the Attorney-General what has delayed the payments for Mr. Joseph Muliro Telewa as per the ruling by the Senior Resident Magistrate, Kiambu, in Civil Case No. 28.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT\(Mr. Onyancha): Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Attorney- General, I beg to reply.This case arose out of a road accident involving Mr. Joseph Muliro Telewa who was a passenger in a motor vehicle, G.E. H604, driven by Mr. Mbugua wa Kigondu of the then Ministry of Commerce and Industry along Ruiru-Kiambu road on 17th August,1937.On,4th August, 1939, the case was heard and Judgement delivered in favour of Mr.Joseph Muliro Telewa in the sum of KSh.116,050.00. The delay in paying this money is due to the fact that neither the Plaintiff's Advocate nor Mr. Telawa hasmade the application for the decree to be drawn against the Defendants (Attorney-General and Mr. Mbugua wa Kigondu).I would therefore, advice the hon. Member to tell Mr. Joseph Muliro Telewa to instruct his Advocate to have the decree approved by the High Court and the Certificate of Taxation issued so that the judgement debtor who is the Ministry of Commerce and Industry can be asked to effect the payment.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the procedure which has just been given by learned friend only applies to the High Court, but this is not a High Court case. It is a Senior Resident/Magistrate's case. So, in view of the fact that this was just aconsent judgement .and the parties involved agreed on the amountof money for compensation, would my learned friend agree with methat by now this money should have been paid to the plaintiff?.They do not have to wait for all those formalities.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, even in a case filed inthe lower courts or Magistrate's Courts, the judgement creditoror the decree holder ought to have a decree drawn up, and alsotaxation before execution could be effected.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as it has been explained, the case is two years ago, and before this kind of consent was arrived at the person representing the Government must have known that he was committing the Government in a way. He ought to have realised that this commitment was going to be entertained.  So, I do not see why the hon. Assistant Minister is trying to evade the Question while the position is that this, kind of decree to be, filed is just a mere formality. The principal ought to have been effected by now because the Government was fully represented by that consent.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr.ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is quite interesting because this is a case represented by a qualified lawyer or Advocate who knows or should know what steps to take to have the payments finally made by the Government. Now, if the lawyer has not done his part, I think. I would still excuse him. He should now take steps to get the money.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this compensation that was paid to Mr. Joseph Muliro Tslewa, ISh.116,000.00, is that the value of a human being? How did the Attorney-General arrive at that figure? That is not the value of a human being.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYAJTCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member has no facts concerning this case. We do not know what facts the law took into account so as to arrive at this figure. So, if the hon. Member wishes to find out more about that he can always do so. But we are not in a position now to know or even to question a judgement that was properly delivered by a court of law.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, since hon. Kubo,being a lawyer, has just defined that this is a civil case handled by a Senior Resident Magistrate, how come that the "Acting" Attorney- General is referring that the claimant should have the decree approved by the High Court? Where did he get that information from?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Chesire):On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is it really in order for the hon. Member to refer to the Assistant Minister as the Acting Attorney-General when the Attorney-General is present here in the Chamber?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.BIDU: Mr. Speaker, sir, we all know that whoever takes the responsibility of answering Questions here, on behalf of somebody, is to a certain extent acting on his behalf. That is cordon knowledge.</Newspeech><Newspeech>ME. SPEAKER: That is not common knowledge The Assistant Minister is not acting on behalf the Attorney-General. Would you withdraw that remark!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thought I was giving rank to by hon, friend. Anyway, I withdraw that remark and apologise to the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR, KUBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, with regard to these payment, I think this matter is a1 affecting the credibility. Here is somebody who was involved in an accident in 1937 and. the judgement passed in 1989 and to a common person who is not a lawyer like me or the Assistant Minister, there could be a feeling that justice is not being done. So, would the Assistant Minister try to assist this particular person to approach the Ministry concerned? Our concern here is mainly the credibility of Government which is responsible for the welfare of wananchi. So, would the Assistant Minister agree with me that they could by-pass this procedure and effect payment straightaway?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this case was not settled out of court between the parties involved. The case went to court and we are only saying that all the necessary procedure should be followed so that Government, is able to effect payment. Government has never been unwilling to pay any person who has been able to follow the proper procedure in claiming for his right.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.SPEAKER: Can we go back to DR.

I cannot apologize forsomething that I have not done.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI: On a .point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. You will remember,Sir? that in the morning we protested highly due to the type of answers that some of the Members of the Front Bench were giving to Questions asked here. is another incident this afternoon where an answer to a Question has been brought to Parliamentand the Clerk passed on a copy of the answer to the hon. Questioner, and thenthe Assistant Minister stands up in this House and says that he does not havea copy of the answer. It seems that he did not even bother to find out from the Clerk Whether the answer to this Question had actually beenreceived or not. Worse still, it seems that he was not even aware thathis Ministry was supposed to be answering this Question in thefirst place. Is this the kind of attitude that this House expects of the Assistant Minister? He should be made to apologize for this most unbecoming conduct.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRISIDENT (Mr. Onyancha): Mr. Speaker, Sir. I did indicate quite clearly to the House that by the time I left my Office, the answer to this Question was not ready. Obviously, theanswer was dispatched after I had left the Office and I did not know, that ishad already arrived when I stood up here to say that I did not gaveit here with so. As a result, I begged the House to give me more time to get the answer so that I could answer the Question tomorrow.Having said that, I sat down and it was as I was sitting down that I was given the answer and then stood up immediately and indicated that I had received the answer.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KLBO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. If the Assistant Minister has just received that answer, it is obvious that he has not had the time to read through it. That then meant that he Would not be ill a position to answer to any supplementary questions that would subsequently be raised. This means that he is not ready to answer this Question and for that reason, could he be given more time to study the answer and perhaps answer the question when he is in a position to give proper information to this House?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Onyancha): Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon.

I do not think it is in order for us to work out the technicalities of trying to win an argument. Firstly, it is clear that hon. Onyancha either did not have an answer to this Question or he ignored it. If he had enough information that he was required to answer this Question, this afternoon, regardless of the means by which he got the answer, he ought to apologise to the House for having told us that he did not have the answer.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Onyancha): Mr. Speaker, Sir, with respect, I do not know why the hon. Member is trying to twist the facts. I stood up and asked for permission to answer this Question tomorrow because I did not have the relevant answer then. However, when I sat down, I realised that the answer had been brought to me to enable me to answer this Question. I then stood up and indicated the truth of the matter. Up to that point, I believe that there is nothing wrong for which I should apologise.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS:  Point of order. Point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order, hon. Members! Let us get on with the Business of the day.	Go ahead and reply to the Question, Mr. Onyancha.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Onyancha): Bw. Spika, naomba kujibu.Serikali imechukua h£tua tayari za kudumu kukomesha mashambulizi ya majambazi katika Kanagoni, katika lokesheni ya Fundiissa; Kaniale, katika lokesheni ya Adu na Dakacha, katika lokesheni ya Bungali.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NDZAI: Bw. Spika, tunahusika sa hapa na msasha.ya Wakenyawenzetu. Katika sehemu hizi zilizotajwa, yaani Kamale, Dakacha na Kanagoni,mashambulizi yalianza mwaka wa 1977 na tunapokvenda kule huambiwa kwamba Serikali . haiwezi kuwapeleka askari huko kwa sababu hakuiic sirnu na barabara za huko ni mbaya. Waziri Msaidizi amesema kwamba hatua za kudumu zimechukuliwa. Hizi ni hatua gani? Nilikuwa kule Jumamosi iliyopita na nikakuta kwamba hakukuwa na cho chote kili.chofanywa.ila watu wa huko kuhama tu.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Bw. Spika, wakati wo wote tunapopata habari za vituko karna hivi, Serikali huchukua hatua ya kujaribu kurekebisha mambo haya. Tumepata habari hii na tukavituma vikosi vya askari vya kutosha kule ili kukomesha mashambulizi haya.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NDZAI: Bw. Spika, Waziri Msaidizi anajaribu kulipotosha Bunge. Ninapoelewa ni kwamba kuna askari watatu au watano ambao wamewekwa katika Marafa, lakini hawaendi katika sehemu nilizotaja, yaani Kamale, Dakacha na Kanagoni, ambako mashambulizi yanatokea. Ninapouliza sababu ya kutofan.yika hivi, huambiwa kuwa askari hawawezi kwenda kule kwa sababu barabara za huko ni mbaya na hakuna simu, ambayo si makosa ya wananchi. Waziri Msaidizi anaweza kutwambia ni vikosi vingapi alivyopipeleka kule na ni lini alipovipeleka? Nilikuwa kule Jumapili iliyopita na wikuviona vikosi hivi huko.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Bw. Spika, sababu moja iliyotufanya kutokuwa na jibu la Swali hili hapo mbeleni ni kwamba tulikuwa tukingoja kupata habari kuhusu kile Serikali imefanya kuhusu Swali hili. Sasa hivi, tumepata habari kwamba vikosi vya askari vimetrumwa kule ili kukomesha mashambulizi haya. Kama mhe. Mbunge alitoka kule Jumapili, hii ni kusema kwamba vikosi hivi vilitumwa huko Jumatatu au Jumanne iliyopita.</Newspeech>(Laughter)<Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Bw. Spika, Waziri Msaidizi ameulizwa ni hatua ganiza kudumu zimechukuliwa na akasema kwamba hatua fulani za kudumu zimechukuliwa,lakini sasa anasema labda askari walipelekwa kule jana au juzi. Hii inamaanishakwamb a haelewi ni lini askari hawa walipotumwa kule. Waziri Msaidizi anawezakuwa serious kwa sababu sehemu zilizotajwa hapa haziitaji askari wa kutembea hapa na pale tu, bali vinahitaji kikosi kiwe kule miele ili watu wa huko wawe	salama? Anaweza kutwambia kwa hakika ni lini askari walipocumwa kule au ni vikosi vya airia gani vilivyotumwa kule? Ikiwezekana hata kiDc cha polisikinaiaa kujengwa kule.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Bw. Spika, kujenga kituo cha polir.i cha kudumu kule  ni hatua ambayo inahitaji pesa na mipango kamili kwa kuwa hii si kazi ya haraka; Serikali yetu huenda ikachukua hatua baadaye na leufanya hivi.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ANASWA: Bw. Spika, Waziri Msaj.dizi ameulizwa vizuri sana atueleze kikosi cha askari kilichotumwa kule kina watu wangapi na ni lini kilipotumwa kule.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Bw. Spika, sijui kama siri ya Serikali inaweza kuturuhusu kusema ni askari wangapi waliopelekwa kule kwa sababu tukisema hivyo, tutakuwa tukiwaambia adui zetu siri na watatuingilia.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NDZAI: Bw. Spika, ningetaka Waziri Msaidizi alichukue jambo hili kuwa muhi8mu sana. Katika Swali langu, niinetaja hatua za kudumu, lakini sikusema kwainba Serikali haikuchukua hatua. Mimi na Mkuu wa Wilaya wa sehemi inayohusika tulienda na tukaweka askari 16 kule Dakacha ambako mtoto mmoja alikuwa amepigwarisasi akafa. Baada ya muda, askari hao waliondoka na tulipouliza tupewe askari*wengine, tukaarabiwa kwamba askari wasingepelekwa huko kwa sababu barabara huko ni mbaya na hakuna njia ya mawasiliano. Ninavyoelewa ni kwainba Serikali imefanya juhudi za kutosha na ikaweka askari wa Utawala kama sita hj'.vi pale MaradFa ili wawe wakizunguka kule Kamale na Dakacha, lakini kwa sababu ya upungufu wa barabara nzuri, askari hawaendi huko. Watu wamehama kutoka Dakacha. Kuna shule moja huko iriayoitwa Mlunguni ambayo imetorokwa rta wanafunzi. Ningetaka kujua tu ni hatua garii ya kudumu ambayo Serikali inachukua kuhusu jambo hili, na Waziri Msaidizi anasema kwamba askari walipelekwa huko pengine Jumatatu au Jumanne. Jambo hili ni muihimu sana na ningeiomba Serikali ilieleze Bunge hili ni hatua gani za kudumu ambazo imechukua kuona kwamba wananchi kule hawaishi na wasiwasi? Kama Waziri Msaidizi hana jibu kamili, ingefaa arudi ofisini rawake cikatcifute jibu kamili.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Bw. Spika, ninafikiri nitafanya vivyo hivyo, yaani nitarudi ofisini na kupata habari ya kutosha ili nirudi hapa na kujibu Swali hili.</Newspeech>(Applause)<Newspeech>MR.NDZAI: Bw.Spika, ninashukuru sana kwa sababu Waziri Msaidizi amesema kwamba atarudi ofisini kutafuta jibu kamili. Atajibu Swali hili lini? Ikiwezekana, Bunge lingependa kupata jibu hili kabla halijakwenda likizoni.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.ONYANCHA: Bw. spika, nitajaribu kuiihu Swali hili kabla hatujaenda likizoni.</Newspeech><Header>Preservation of Sugarcane in Msambweni</Header><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Agriculture the following Question by Private Notice.Since the Government has decided to revive sugarcane growing in Ramisi Sugar Zone for the purposes of producing white sugar, could the Minister indicate how the sugarcane currently in the farms will be preserved so that by the time the exercise is in progress there would be enough sugarcane (seeds) for planting?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Ngaruro): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Government is looking into the revival of Ramisi Sugar Industry under the mode of management that it will assume. Also under consideration is the possibility of introducing other crops in the area. Once this is done, the issue of seeds will be addressed to determine whether to continue with the same seed variety or to introduce new ones.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, when does the Assistant Minister think this revival will be effective? I assume that it will be very expensive to transport sugarcane seeds from western Kenya to the south Coast. It would be better to preserve the sugarcane we have than to let it vanish.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will send a team of experts in January, 1991 to visit the area and determine the suitability of the cane that is in the fields</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to Sugar-cane growing the Assistant Minister is Planning to have horticultural crops grown. Will the growing of horticultural and carried out	only in the fields of the former of Associated Company, Ramisi, orboth on this former company's fields and the outgrowers fields?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the exercise v.ill involveboth the state and out growers fields.</Newspeech><Header>Cashewnuts Buying Centres for Bahari</Header><Newspeech>MR. LEWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Ministerfor Supplies and Marketing the following Question by Private Notice.-(a)How many buying centres for raw cashewnuts does the Ministry intend to establish in Bahari Division of Kilifi District this season?(b) Who will be responsible for the payment of the produce from the farmers at these buying centres?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Mwenje): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a)	The Ministry of Supplies and Marketing through the Kenya Cashewnuts Ltd, in consultation with the Provincial Administration, will this season open 43 buying centres for raw cashewnuts in  Bahari Division in Kilifi District.(b)	The Kenya Cashewnuts Ltd is responsible and will still be responsible for the payment for farmers produce through the co-operative societies.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEYA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister indicate when this exercise will he carried out? The season started about a month ago and, as far as I know, there has been selection of agents who will man the buying centres. Previous experience has gone to show that the buying centres are not well equipped to cope with the job because the Kenya Cashewnuts Ltddoes not have enough weighing balances for these places. More seriously, these centres do not have enough funds to cope with the purchase of the produce.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the arrangements are ready. For the information of the hon. Member of the 43 buying centres, 15 are under the Kesoroka Co-operative Society; eight are under the Chonyi Farmers Co-operative Society and 20 are under the KLlifi South-East Co-operative Society. These societies have instructions to get the centres ready. We also have four other appointed agents who are also ready to handle any ready raw cashewnuts.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will back to the issue offunds. How much money has been set aside for this exercise? Couldthe Assistant Minister inform the House whether there will be any element of advances to the co-operative societies for the purchaseof the produce?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have enough money tobuy all the raw cashew nuts which will be available; if the hon. Member would encourage the farmers to grow even more raw cashewnuts,  we would want to buy more of them.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, is it good enough for the Assistant Minister to say he all the money? How much money is involve</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not possible to tell how much money will be involved because we do not know how much, thefarmers will produce. I have said we have enough money to buy all the raw cashewnuts available, even it is worth Shs.100 million.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. TOYA: Mr. Speaker; Sir, how much has been set aside for the purpose?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, enough to buy all the raw cashewnuts.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Mwenje, how much is enough?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, enough is enough; it is well over Shs.30 million.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Mwenje, can you tell the hon. Member the figure?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am serious when I say that we really have enough money. But the amount will really depend on how much raw cashewnuts will be available. At the moment  we have set aside approximately Shs.30 million, which is with the Kenya Cashewnuts Ltd. Even if the farmers have produce worth more than that figure, we are ready to buy it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Shs30 million has become  magic figure. This amount was released four months ago to pay creditors who had supplied cashewnuts before. Every time we ask about funds for purchase of produce the figure is always Shs30 million We want to know how much money has been set aside this season for the purchase of rar nuts in Kilifi, lamu, Ewale and so on. The cashewnuts are now available and ready for purchase.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope the hon. Member is not confusing the earlier figure of Shs30 million, which was to rehabilitate the factory. That was a different amount which wasand we also paid the farmers a similar amount. How I am not talking of that amount but of the amount reserved for buying raw cashewnuts, which will be ready. We have set aside a similar amount to the earlier and we are prepared to set aside more money if the raw cashewnuts  will be available. In fact, I take this opportunity to urge the hon. Member to encourage the farmers in his area; to produce more as we are prepared all the available raw cashewnuts.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEWA: Mr.Speaker, Sir, previous experience has proved that Kenya Cashewnuts Ltd are not capable of ensuring that the agents pay farmers the scheduled price. This has, therefore, encouraged some of the so called agents to buy the produce, at times, at very low prices. Since these agents are properly controlled by the Kenya Cashewnuts Ltd they buy the raw nuts and connive with sumugglers and the produce is exported. What machinery does the Ministry have this year to ensure that the agents, who will be appointed, will be good who will confirm to procedures, pay thescheduled price and deliver the produce to the Kenya cashewnuts factory?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, apart from the four agents, and the co-operative societies, who are authorised by the Kenya Cashewnuts Ltd to handle the raw nuts, nobody else is allowed to deal in raw cashewnuts. The four agents are Shutu Said Mwango, Ahmed Hussein Mohamed, Jabros Kalu Nguya and Dickson Njenga Ealame. The current price of good raw cashewnuts is Shs.7/- per kilogranme. If any agent is paying less than that, we should be informed and he will be prosecuted Any other person dealing in raw cashewnuts  should be reported to the police and he will be immediately arrested and prosecuted.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.KUBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a good thing that the Ministry is making sure that farmers are paid on time. But it is not uncommon in this country for money to he misused. This is	because in most cases the Ministry may pay the Co-Operatives butthe co-operatives fail to pay the farmers on time. What action is the Ministry taking to make sure that this money does actually reach the farmers? What action is the Ministry taking to ensure that farmers are paid upon delivery of their crop?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the co-operatives that act as agents are closely supervised by the Ministry of Supplies and Marketing and the Kenya Cashevmuts Limited. I want to assure the farmers, through this House, that they will be paid on time and that no co-operative will be allowed to delay these payments to farmers.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a fact that the marketing system has been very poor in the sense that farmers are never paid on time. This puts farmers in a difficult situation because they are unable to pay school fees for their children. Also ,farmers have been. swindled by unscrupulous business¬men. This is because the market is not very well organised. Also as a result of this the cashewnut crop has found its way out of  this country. This crop has been smuggled out of this country andthat is the reason why the factory was closed down last time. whatmeasures does the Ministry intend to put into effect so that	 cashewnuts are not smuggled out of this country and to ensure that farmers get their money very early? The Assistant Minister has talked about KShs.30 million but how much money will the Ministry   use to purchase the crop from farmers especially when the season is good?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the provincial administration have received strict instructions that no smuggling  of cashewnuts is to be allowed to take place. It is for this reason that the Chairman of the Board at the moment is the Provincial  Commissioner, Coast; to ensure that no raw nuts are smuggled out of the country.  Smuggling is illegal and whoever will engage in the smuggling of raw nuts will be dealt with in accordance with the law. All the raw nuts must be processed by the Kenya Cashewnuts Plants at Kilifi.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is common knowledge that the Kenya Cashewnut Limited right now has a lot of cashflow problems; they have no money to pay their creditors; they are limping and people are working as casuals. I do not see why the Ministry has thought it sensible to rely on the Company tobuy the raw nuts from agents and co-operative societies. Why can  the Ministry not	enstrust the purchase of the raw nuts tothe national Cereals and Produce Board? I say this because if you give money to somebody who has no money he will divert that money to other uses. These  people will not use the money to purchase the produce; they will use it for other things.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member is now talking about the previous arrangement whereby the H.C.P.B. used to buy on behalf of the Kenya Cashewnuts Limited. BUt the system was found to be a bit cumbersome and it was changed. So, with the new restructuring of the Kenya Cashewnuts Limited, the Kenya Cashewnut and the Minis try of Supplies and Marketing are now capable of purchasing the raw nuts from farmers, I can assure the hon. Member that there will be no problems. If the farmers encounter any problemthe hon. Member is welcome to raise the matter here and we willreview the situation.

"Meru Mps accused of being cowards„" We are certainly not cowards The Editor has shown that sub-headline but the article's contents are different. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the second paragraph of that article reads as follows:"The Reverend Joseph Gichunge of the Church of the Province of Kenya's Kanyiri Parish in Meru	criticised the 	 district'spoliticians for allegedly failing to speak out when the local teachers savings and credit	society's	elections were tampered with." Mr. Speaker, Sir, these elections were conducted by the teachers themselves and we had no reason to interfere. The third paragraph reads as follows:"He accused the local Members of Parliament of being cowardly The churchman charged that the leaders feared speaking out "because of the knowledge that they rigged their way into Parliament."Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is my third term in this Parliament. I have been always very popularly elected;  sometimes with a majority of over 10,000 votes above my nearest rival. I have, never been rigged into this Parliament. I can say this of the other Meru Members of Parliament. There was no rigging of elections inMeru. If the Daily Nation would like to. publish anything I Wouldlike to say here that Members of Parliament from Meru are very disheartened by this article; it is very damaging to our political careers because it portrays us as people who are in Parliament, not having been elected bu having been brought in here by we do not know who.

Last week the Director of Medical Services announced that the Aids drug Kemron  was not available in the country and that arrangements were being made to import 200,000 tablets from overseas. However, on Saturday, a local company by the name of Innovative Serapeutic Limited invited the local Press to confirm that they have adequate stock in their stores of Kemron, but that the Ministry of Health was waiting for samples of a similar drug from Japan. This is a very serious statement, especially knowing the history behind the Kemron drug. I think it would be in the interests of the nation  the public of. Kenya - for us to have a Ministerial statement on Kemron to clarify these confusing issues and to set the records straight as to, firstly, how many types of the Kemron drug are available, if any and secondly, the true facts regarding Kemron and, thirdly, the control, if any by the Ministry of Healthiover the manufacture and distribution of Kemron. Unless this is done, I amsure quacks in this country, will take the opportunity to start supplying any¬thing in the name of Kemron.

SPEAKER: You were to continue, hon. Mahihu.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAHIHU: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing, me to continue making my comments on this very important Bill. Land is a crucial issue in all areas of this Republic; it is even more important that when the Ministry of Lands and Housing publishes a Bill to cater for all the problems affecting the land, all the seriousness should be taken into account. There are so many people who are complaining because of shady land deals. This is more so especially of late when, as you are aware, there have been mushrooming of land-buying companies all over the country. The survival from that kind of problem came in only when His Excellency the President rescued wananchi from those companies. (Mr. Speaker left the Chair)(The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kagwima) took the Chair) Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me now come to the Bill  itself. I have gone through the Bill and would like to make some observ¬ations. I notice that the Minister will gazette a panel of elders and from that panel the district commissioner will appoint a chairman to chair the panel's meetings. I would like to suggest that the case be the other way round. In this country we have .been used to having district commissioners providing information to the Ministries and the Ministers appointing whoeverit is from the panel provided by the district commissioner. Here, the Bill suggests that the Minister will gazette a panel of ciders and from that panel the district commissioner will appoint the chairmen. I feel that that is an anomaly.Sir, let me point out that my suggestion is for divisional land disputes tribunal, before we come to the district level. The reason for that is that people are so much interested in land issues that if you only have one panel for the whole district, it will never cover all the areas. So, my recommendation is that there should be divisional land disputes tribunal. After establishing those, then there should be the district land disputes tribunal.I am suggesting that instead of the district commissioner appointing a chairman for the district tribunal from a panel given to him by the Minister the district commissioner himself should recommend a panel to the Minister for the appointment of a chairman. The reason for so doing is that should there be a problem, say a district commissioner does not appoint a chairman from that panel which he has been given by the Minister, protocol will be embarra¬ssed. We are not used to telling the Ministers, "No", but are used to serving he Ministers from the provincial administration level. We also provide the grass root information to the Minister after gathering it in the districts. However, this Bill provides an issue that can provide embarrassment. I am, therefore, recommending that the Minister reviews the recommendation of the panel so that the panel is done by divisional elders and then onwards to the district level. When it comes to the provinces, the Bill provides that there shall be a provincial appeals committee and that the provincial commi¬ssioner will be the chairman. I am suggesting that, unless the Minister has a very strong reason for that, we know that there will be so many cases that the provincial commissioner of a given province will hardly have any time to deal with them. Take for example a province like the Rift Valley, with 13 districts, with areas that used to be settlement areas. Actually, the wholeProvince used to be a settler area which has now been sub-divided and taken over by wananchi. There are so many cases that will arise so that if you make the Rift Valley Provincial Commissioner the Chairman of the Appeals Committee, he will never be able to sit in his office at all.I am suggesting that there should be more than one appeal committee because that is the quickest way of disposing of these cases.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, today land is a very critical issue, and I notice that in the Bill there is no provision for women being members of the land tribunals. I am recommending that during this time when We are becoming very serious trying to resolve all land issues, the women in this country being the majority, we should provide in the Bill that the pannel to be appointed to hear land disputes should include one or two women at the divisional level, the district level and even at the: provincial level. The reason for that is to ensure democracy in that we will be giving everybody a chance. I also notice that in the Bill</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY—GENERAL (Mr. Muli): On a point of clarification, Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman. I would hate to interrupt my colleague, Eliud Mahihu, who is contributing very well and very constructively indeed. However, so that we do not get wild on the question of chairmen appointed from the pannel, I want to point out that if you read Clause 4(2)(a), you will see that the chairman will not be permanent but will be appointed from time to time for each dispute so that if one day he is chairman for a certain dispute, another chairman will be appointed to deal with another dispute. The other point, which is a small one in legal circles, is that masculine includes feminine.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAHIHU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to argue with the Attorney-General on that point, but while what he explains may be so, it is not stated in the Bill. All that I am saying is that the chairman should be appointed by the Minister so that at any given time the district commissioner will not be accused of being biased or of appointing somebody that he likes and so on. This was the previous experience when the magistrate's court was established to deal with land disputes. The allegation at the time was that the administration was not there and, therefore, the whole system was abolished and the magistrates were invited to deal with land matters as the Attorney-General put it yesterdayvery clearly. That confusion was inherited by Kenyans for nearly 10 years. The point I was trying to make is that the chairman of the district appeals committee should be appointed by the Minister.Having said that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am also saying that the chairman of the provincial appeals committee should not be the provincial, commissioner because he is supposed to administer the province all the time and he has no time to deal with other issues. So, I am suggesting that the provincial commissioner recommends a pannel of elders respected throughout the province, from which the Minister can appoint the chairman of the provincial appeals commit¬tee.Having said that, Sir, I also want to emphasise that the importanceof this Bill, when it comes to operation, is to ensure that all the people are.represented. In the past, there has never been any time when women were appointedelders to participate in land issues. Today it is a very popular move that wasstated recently, that women in this country have the right to inherit land fromtheir fathers. If you have two sons and two daughters, the four of them shouldhave equal shares of your land. This message has gone to our people and womenfeel very strongly that when it comes to the question of land, the old storythat boys are the only ones Who can inherit land should be something of the past.That issue is there and you will find women fighting very strongly on protectingtheir own rights as far as land inheritance is concerned. Therefore, I am recommending that when we are passing this Bill it is very important that the pannel of elders should include women. There is no reason why a woman cannot be an elder in the pannel. Let us provide for that when we come to the operation. of the issue.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I know that the Attorney-General mentioned the question of the remunerations of these elders, and I support him on that so that the elders are not subjected to the old tradition where peopled involved in land dispute's provided chai for them. There should be sufficientpayments to these elders so that there is no reason why they should eat a goat, when they go to listen to a land dispute. There is no time when elders should be given food by the parties involved in a land dispute. Traditionally it was not an illegal act for people involved in land disputes to provide lunch or dinner for elders who had come a long way to arbitrate in land matters. But the elders of today will be dealing with very provocative and important issues and, therefore, should be renumberated sufficiently so that they feel duty-bound and not yield to temptations.Sir, I would even go further and make another point, that the elders should not even be transported by the parties in dispute; they should be provided with sufficient infrastructure so that if they are moving from the divisional headquarters to the locations in the remotest parts of the district, they will go there on Government transport. We know that in the past some people involved in land issues would provide even Mercedes Benz cars or the most comfortable means of transport to go and collect the elders to arbitrate in the issue. I am suggesting that this be something of the past when it comes to dealing with land disputes. There should be sufficient means of transporting the elders where¬ver they are going.		Another point that I would like to make is in connection of the supervision of the elders. Who will supervise them? If I go by past experience, we used to have the officers in charge of African courts being responsible to the Minister concerned for the day-to-day activities of those courts. I am assuming that before we put this Bill into operation all these preparations will have been made because of the great expectations that our people have on the land. Therefore, any possibility of having the elders influenced by the people in dispute should be eliminated.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, another point I wish to raise is that of limitation. Our people are used to land cases going on for years. There should be a provision in this Bill stating clearly up to what time people involvedin land disputes should bring their cases to the tirbunal. After land consolidation and settlement, people have been given land title deeds. Your father has bought  another piece of land from another clan, but you find young people coming and saying, "Oh, this land belonged to us and we must redeem it". There must be in law a limitation after which you cannot redeem the land. If you have sold your land and the party you have sold to has received its title deed, there should be an end to the question of land redemption.Sir, I am saying this so that there could be stabilityin land development. At the moment in some areas, people are notquite sure what her what they have today is theirs for good, or some-body might come and raise the issue on another day.Sir, in areas where land consolidation, has taken placeor been completed, there is one major anomaly. There are thoseyoung people whose land was registered in their names. For instance, you will find that where a family has five girls and one boy, the land is registered in the boy's name. So, during the land conso¬lidation the temptation was to register the land in the name of the boy when he was a minor. But now he is grown up and he wants to kick away the five girls because the land is in his name.But when the land was registered in his name it was not meantthat the land was his. It was just meant that he was to hold the land in trust, in traditional manner. Therefore, now that the youngman has grown up and the parents are dead, the youngman says the land belongs to him and the girls can go away. This iswhere, the traditional customs are very important and the clanmust now protect the five girls against the youngman who held  the land in trust but now he says it belongs to him. Here I agree that the elders must decide in favour of the girls, or there should be a fair distribution of that piece of land.Now, Sir, when this Bill becomes law, it is my wish that there should be a note to that effect: That where such cases, exist, the clan, apart from the panel of elders, should be given  ample time to explain what the traditional customs are. After that, limitation of time must also be taken into account so that that issue is dealt with properly.The other issue, Sir, I want to raise is that this is supposed to be a panel of elders' dealing with land cases at theDistrict and provincial levels. Are the lawyers going to be allowed to appear before the elders? There should be a provision where  we must protect the elders from, the lawyers because the issue of land has been taken away for the magistrates to the elders. But other people will hire the services of lawyers who will appear before the elders. So I would like to see a provision where the elders are protected from harassment by the lawyers. If the lawyers have to appear for this particular issue they should do so in the High Court where another learned friend is in the Chair. This is where the Judge of the High Court is sitting on the final appeal. This is where the lawyer or lawyers should go, and that should be provided for in the Bill. I am suggesting that clearly because if we allow the Bill to pass the way it is now, in fact, the lawyers will continue harassing the wananchi. The elders will find it very difficult to operate. I am not sure whether the Ministry is making a provision that should a lawyer before the elders who should assist the elders in hearing such cases.Sir, I suggest that a provision be made in the Bill as to what stage can a lawyer appear before a panel of elders to hear a land case.	.Sir, this is a very important area and we must continue to protect our people from exploitation, We have seen a lot of people allocated pieces of land and yet they did not buy shares in the land buying companies. Wananchi are aware of that and they are going to raise this matter before the elders, So you can see the importance of these panels. I am appealing very strongly to the Minister to be aware that this will be a very explosive issue. There will be very many cases when the panels of elders are established. 	Sir, I am also raising another issue have. There should  be a minimum standard of education for one to	appointed an elder.	The elders we used to talk about in "1920's are not there anymore. We are now talking of another society. It is important that an elder should be able to read and write, if necessary he should be able to read the law. Although he may not understand it enti¬rely, he should be able to follow what is written in an Act.Sir, the other issue that. I wanted to raise is about the age of an elder. What should be the minimum age? It is very important that when a panel of elders go to the rural areas, they should be seen to be elders. If you bring a youngman to deal with land matters our people will not trust that he is fully conversant with land matters. So an elder should be of mature age.At the same time, an elder should be someone who has held a public office for some time in a locality. He should be respected. He should be known to be a person of integrity. Also, he should be a person of a firm family background, if we follow the African traditions and values. He must also have or own a piece of land because lf you bring someone who does not have a piece of land to listen to land disputes that will not be fair.The other issue, Sir, is that an elder should be dis¬qualified if he is known to be a drunkard. I am, therefore, suggesting that those men and women who qualify to be appointed as elders should be of very high integrity, be accepted by their community, be known to have participated in local committees and so on. But the public should be able to accept them on appoint¬ment by the Minister.	Sir, land consolidation has not taken place in some areas due to land disputes. If I heard the Minister well yesterday, he said that this Bill should not contradict the Land Adjudication Act I suggest that provision be made so that the whole country couldbe demarcated because without a title deed there can never be development.A lot of development has been help us due to lack of land demarcation,but we know that land demarcation cannot take place before land disputes*are settled. So, what I am suggesting is .that where land consolidation has not been done, there should be a panel of elders to settle land disputes before land demarcation can be done. You will find, Sir, that there aredifferent types of land disputes and it would therefore he necessary to have more than one panel of Riders per district depending on the land cases that exist. This Bill provides for one single panel of elders per district</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): .Oh No I There could be morethan one panel.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. MAHIHU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am being corrected by the learned Attorney-General. He says that there could be more than one panel and I have no dispute with that. However, I believe that if the Minister could take care of those areas here land demarcation has notbeen undertaken, we shall be quite happy. I am saying this because land is a very important commodity. It was due to land that our E people fought and struggled for Independence in this country. The battle between our people and the colonialists was due to nothing else but land and therefore, we must take very great interest on all matters pertaining to land.With those few remarks, I beg to support the Bill.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this very important Bill. Before I do so, I would like to ask the Attorney-General who is a very good friend of mine to make sure that in future when a 3ill is being drafted, on the last paragraph showing the Memorandum of fig Objects and Reasons, he provides the House with the actual estimates of the amount that we are likely to incur by enacting that law. As of the moment, this paragraph just says:-"The enactment of this Bill will involve additional expenditure of public funds and the amount involved will be provided for through "the annual estimates"I think the House is entitled to Know how much we are going to spendin the enactment of this Bill.Having said that, I would like to say that this Bill has been broughtto the House at the right time, but my only fear is that what happened whenwe enacted a law here regarding the arbitration of land disputes by thedistrict officers, may also happen in the case of this Bill. When we wereenacting that law, we provided that the district officers would be arbitratorsin land case and that no land cases should go to court. However, caseshave continued to go to court despite the provision in the Act whichsays that this should not happen. I am not a lawyer myself and I would not-know which law that came into conflict with the law that we enacted in thisHouse at that time. I am however asking the Attorney-General to make surethat when a Bill is being drafted with a view to bringing it to this Housefor enactment, he must ensure that there is absolutely no conflictwith any other section of the law. I am saying this because if people keepon taking others to court in land cases, there must be another law that contradicts the law that we passed ± in this House. If ascertain law says that land cases should no longer be taken to court and should be arbitrated upon the district officers and panels of elders, there must be a reason why a magistrate or a judge or a lawyer chooses to have a case heard in court. This kind of conflict must not be there in our laws and the people drafting these bills should be on the look out to make sure that this kind of conflict is removed entirely.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Mahihu who was once a provincial commissioner has argued that the provincial commissioner should h not be made chairman of the provincial tribunal. I am sure hon. Mahihu knows better than most of us having been a provincial commissioner once and therefore, I hope the Minister will accept this point. It has been argued rightly that making the provincial commissioner the chairman of this tribunal, would, overburdening him which means that decisions that ought to be arrived at willnot be made at the right time. This is because a provincial commissioner isa very busy man. In other-cases, people would be colluding to see the provincialcommissioner on before their cases ore heard. I feel that the Attorney-Generalshould take note of this.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Clause 3 sub-section (5) states"Each party upon whom a claim is servedshall, unless the claim is admitted, within ninety days after service, file with the Tribunal an answer containing a reply to the matters stated in the claim and a summary of the facts upon which he wishes to reply".Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am happy that the Attorney-Generalhas mentioned this and I hope that the Minister will bring anamendment so that it does not a take one 90 days to appeal. In most normalcourt cases, the days given for appeal or for summons are not that many.If we want justice to be done or to appear to be done, it must be done fast.Therefore, these cases must be done away with as fast as possible and Ithink SO days are just too many. Why should it not be 14 days? If somebodywants to appeal why be given 60 days as has been mentioned in sub-section6. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Clause 3 subsection 6 says:"Within 60 days after the answer has been filed under subsection (5), the claim-shall be	set down for hearing by the Tribunal.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, these days must be reduced to a minimum.I am saying this because the adjudication process is going on in. my ownconstituency, that is, Tigania Constituency, where people are killing eachother due to these land disputes. It has been provided that the districtofficer shall hear these land cases and the outcome of a case willdepend on who sees the district officer before the other. I am makingthis allegation with full a knowledge that somebody can say that I am making an allegation which deserves substantiation. However, it is a fact that if  you have a land case and you happen to be a rich mail who is able to meet HIMoffice of the district officer to consult with him or even be able to meethim elsewhere outside his office, you are likely to whisper your case, to him	That means the other party who cannot travel to the office of the district officer,or even meet him in a tar or in other social place, will find it very difficultto influence the district officer to decide the case in his favour.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir, personally I am not for thedistrict officer hearing these land dispute case and I feel that thisTribunal will take the place of the district officer in hearing land disputecases as has been prescribed in this Bill, Clause 2 Sub—section (l), namely:-3. (l) Subject to this Act, all cases of a civil nature involving a dispute as to:-(a)	the division of, or the determination of boundaries to land, including land held in common;(b)	a claim to occupy or work land; or(c)	trespass to land,shall be heard by a Tribunal established under Section 4. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, this is where I see smother possibility of a conflict and this is why I am asking the Attorney-General to make sure that we do not pass a Bill what may be in a direct conflict with another law. Here, I have in mind that law that we enacted in this House which gave the district commissioners the authority to hear land cases accompanied by elders from each party in the dispute. This Bill that we are about to pass is not talking about removing this responsibility from the district officers.This Bill does not say whether district officers will hear such cases any more or not, and I do not know who will be hearing them in future. We would like the tribunal at the district level to extend to the divisional level so that it is represented in every division to enable elders there to hear these cases. As  far as I know, this Bill does not say what we will do with the other law in which we say that district officers will be listening to such cases. If there is an indication as to what will happen, maybe the Minister can tell us this later. If the former position continues to exist, it might conflict with this particular Bill. We need to be told whether district officers will continue to do what they have been doing or whether these tribunals are going to take over that responsibility. If this is not made clear, there is going to be a conflict. If we enact laws that conflict with others, we are not doing anything worthwhile, we should not say, "Do this" in a certain law and then say in another law "Do not do this" in reference to the same thing. If we do so, lawyers will find a way of doing what we have said should not be done. Land cases have, for example, been going to court whereas we have said that this should not happen.In any case, I hope that the Attorney-General and the Minister are taking note of this fact.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, on page. 513, clause 4 says: —"(1) There shall be established a tribunal,to be called the Land Disputes Tribunal, for every registration district."</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

This was alsospecifically stated by the Attorney—General when he was moving this amendment.Unless the regulations in question say so specifically, this law is likely tointerfere with the Registered Land Act, the Land Titles Act, the Land AdjudicationAct and the Land Consolidation Act, but we will ensure that this issue is legallycovered.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.

The Minister has assured the House that if there iS any conflict, it will be removed before this Bill is passed.Clause 10, on page 516 of the Bill, says that the Magistrates' Jurisdiction (Amendment) Act of 1981 is repealed and, as I said before, I would like to add that the Attorney—General did not estimate the amount of public expenditure that will be incurred if we pass this Bill. I know that his draughts men are here. When we get Bills similar to this one, we are normally given the provisions of the preceding Act so that the House deliberates on matters with regard to which it is absolutely clear. In this case, when we pass laws, they do not adversely affect our people. It is up to the Attorney- General s Chambers to make this provision very clear in every such Bill. Whenhe says that the Magistrates’ Jurisdiction (Amendment) Act of 1981 is repealed, he should show us on the present Bill what that Act provides no that we may bevery clear. In any case, I am happy that his draughtsman are here and aretaking note of this fact.Clause 4 of the Dill says:-	"(1) There shall be established a tribunal,to be called the Land Disputes Tribunal, for every registration district.(2) Each Tribunal shall consist of:-(a) a chairman who shall be appointed from time to time by the District Commissioner from the panel of elders appointed under section 5"I would like to support the idea that this chairman be appointed by the Minister,but for a specific period, and not from time to time. The Minister should not-appoint this chairman today and then sack him tomorrow only to appoint anotherone for two days before dismissing him. This chairman should be appointed fora specific period of, say, two or three years because if we just say that he willbe appointed from time to time, this might bring a lot of confusion.On page 415, clause 6 (2) (c) says:-"the chairman shall have a casting vote in addition to a deliberative vote."My argument here may be out of ignorance</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Chesire):On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. There is no page 415in this Bill.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): I am sorry, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I am referring to page 514, and I thank hon. Chesire for the correction.I do not know what "deliberative vote" means, but I hope, it not the chairman's power to veto. If it is, however, this is improper. I have not consulted any lawyer to tell me what it means, but if it is the power to veto, this is wrong. We should not have a chairman who can veto the decision of all the other elders. Decisions should be reached by consensus where elders agree on what to do after listening to evidence. If the Chairman can veto the decision of the whole tribunal, there is no need of appointing, the tribunal.	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as this Bill is on land matters before I pit down I wish to urge the Minister for Lands, Housing and physical planning to do something about demarcationin my Tigania Constituency. This is because, to be specific, we, started land adjudication in July 1966 and to date we are still struggling with land matters; we still do not have title deeds. If one wants to benefit from a bank, AFC or any other kind of a loan he has to look for a friend who is willing to give you security for which you pay very dearly.With these few remarks, I beg to support. MR. NDIRANGU (NYERI TOWN): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for according me this chance to join my colleagues in discussing this very important fee Bill. I have realised that it is not very easy to speak in this House: it is a very busy Houseevery time hon. Members are on this fact looking for a chanceto participate in the debates. This is very good and conducive in discussing and passing of Bills, or enacting laws of this country.My name is hon. Isaac Waihenya Ndirangu, the Member for Nyeri Town I was sworn in on7th August, 1990. As required by the Standing Orders, I wasescorted into this august House his hon. KLpruto arap kirwa, theMember of for Cherangani and hon.Boy JurnaBoy, the Member for Matuga Constituency. I would liketo thank these two hon. Parliamentarians and their constituents.I would also like to, through the Press, to thank myconstituents back at home for electing me into this House tocome and represent them for the welfare of society and the  just Government of men. I would like to tell this House and my constituentthat was a victory that God kindly accorded the people ofNYERI and further manifestation of the democracy we have in Kenya.I further want to express my gratitude to the parliament for enacting a Constitution andlaws which allow people as young as 21 years of age to vie for Parliamentary Elections in this He public. I want, to thank: myconstituents for the co-operation and good organisation I havereceived from them for the few months I have been their Member ofParliament. Indeed, if we continue like this I am promising thisHouse and, the entire country that  young men can work hand in hand with Older people and all leaders for better standards and good success in the future.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also want to thank the Government of Kenya for ensuring a just and fair by-election in my constituency. The by-election was fair to the satisfaction of both the constituents and the contenstants. That is clear manifestation of democracy in our Republic. I also wish to appeal to the people who were vying for my seat back at home to comeand join me in developing the area instead of hiding in their house only to appear in the next general elections, I Would also like to appeal to all the people. From within and outside my constituency to come and join me in developing the area I am ready to work hand in hand with all elected leaders from my district and the country at large.As a young legislator, I feel I have a lot to learn in this House and in the country at large. I feel duty-bound to live to the expectations of the Government and our President for his great confidence in the youth; this is undisputable. I would like to assure this House that the young generation have an exalted opinion about his Excellency the President's brilliant leadership.Our President is known the world over as patriotic nationalist; a loving, re conciliatory and long-serving statesman. We the young regeneration are ready to reciprocate his confidence in the youth of this country. I appeal to all Kenyans to protect and nurture our hard-won Uhuru by being supportive of his Excellency the President and our Government. I feel that total loyalty, strong love, devotion and patriotism for our country is our strongest weapon against any kind of subversion. Let me also thank my fellow parliamentarians for their kind co-operation, a orientation and reception, which they have accorded me in this House for the few months I have been here.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in support of this Bill I would like to urge that it be passed in order to hasten determination of land disputes and also ease backlog of pending cases, which have led to land ownership uncertainties and many local vendattas.with those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Chesire); Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to contribute to this Bill, must say that if it were not for his Excellency the President's personal interest in various land issues and disputes that had cropped up many parts of the country, I am sure we would havebeen in a great problem now. But way back in 1930/31 the President himself saw that lawyers had been exploiting the poor wananchi by extracting as much money out of them as possible; by getting them to take sorts of cases to court, which resulted in all sorts of abuses.	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as the hon. Attorney-General told us yesterday, the attempt made in l98l to involve elders in solving land issues was in the right direction. But as time went by, of course, it became clear that that 1981 Act had its shortcomings. Those shortcomings have necessitated theintroduction of this Bill. It is hoped, I am sure, that the suggestion made yesterday and today will result in a law that Will make it possible for lard disputes to be settled once and for allMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, what is disturbing at the moment is the fact that land disputes that have gone beforethe Magistrate's Jurisdiction (Amendment) Act of 1931 Most ofthe land cases that went before the panels of elders under that Act	appear to have been subjects of confirmation by thecourts. This has resulted in a lot of delays; administrative problems and so on for the parties involved.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I come from an area which was formerly a nettled area by the	White Settlersand most of the land owners there are new. I know that land problem there are quite enormous. But what compounds this thing-is the fact where cases have been handled at the district level, successive district commissioners have been unable to conclude such land disputes completely. What happens is that when one district commissioner comes he hears land cases and records his views which may be forwarded to the provincial commissioner; the	Provincialcommissioner is supposed to adjudicate on that case and give the final ruling. But from what I know, in the last 10 years a district commissioner would hear a case up to a certain stage and he is transferred. After that another district commissioner comes and review that case or start hearing it afresh; he Will	carry iton for two or three years and then he is transferred. Anotherdistrict commissioner comes and changes the whole thing and that has created a lot of confusion and a lot of trouble for the parties involved; the resell t has been nothing but complete chaos. I am gladto see here that at least there Will, be limitation of time; fromthe time when the hearing of a case commencesuntil the time when it is concluded. But the important thing that I would like to stress here is that	once a case has gonebefore a tribunal, the tribunal must be allowed to make a decision on that case. If their decision is final, lot them cay it is final. But that decision must be taken to the Land registrar who will record it somewhere to indicate that the case has been finalised and the party involved may now proceed to obtain his title deed without any further reference to anybody else. Let us hope that the situation will not arise again; where these cases will keep coming up on and off forever and ever.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, a lot of efforts have gone to waste because the people who have been given theresponsibility of determining these cases have been unable to comeup with conclusions. So, I sincerely hope that the tribunals that will be set up in every district will make final decisions. If an appeal is to be made let it be made to the provincial commissioner and if the provincial commissioner takes his decision let that decision be recorded somewhere and let that record be known. I say this because up to this day. we do not know what has happened tothe land cases that have been taken to the provincial commissioners.The decisions taken by the provincial commissioners are never relayedback to the parties concerned to tell them "This is the decision.that we have arrived at and you have to abide by it." That hasnever happened. So, as a result of this you will find that people are forever quarreling. In order to avoid these quarrels, it is important that these decisions are actually communicated as expeditiously as possible to all the affected parties so that they stop running around.As a result of this, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,a situation has arisen whereby certain crafty people because of the loopholes that exit in the present laws register or multiple cases in courts. This is where you may find that one case has been registered in the High Court here in Nairobi; another case is in Kakamega, all on the same subject matter, another	similarcase may be registered in Nakuru or in Kitale. So, you will find that if the parties do not find favour in Nairobi they will rushto Kakamega or to Kitale and in the final analysis you will find that land case never gets concluded. Even if the land dispute is concluded in one court of law there are others pending in other courts. So, these parties will always be saying "This matter is sub judice, nothing can be done because there is a case pending before a court of law." As a result of this you will find that transfer of land to its rightful owner takes years or never takesplace at all. These people who have known how go around courts*cause a lot of frustration to innocent wananchi.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do hope that when this particular Bill is passed it is going to eliminate all these land disputes pending in courts. I also hope that after these pending cases have been sorted out, they will move on to the cases pending before the tribunals and have then sorted cut once and for all. We must attach a lot of importance to these tribunals.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I listened to the Attorney-General very	carefully when he moved the Bill. Hehas said that you can have as many tribunals is you want inone district. That is what he said when he was introducing this Bill.	We want a permanent secretariat for every district tribunal GO that When cases are taken there they tire properly registered and recorded and decisions taken. They should be properly recorded as is done in a court of law so that we do not have situations where it is difficult to retrieve files.So, we should not have a situation whereby it is difficult to retrieve files. Right now it is difficult to know how decisions were made. As the case is at the moment, you have various new district officers coming every six months. a new district officer (DO) comes with his ideas and that creates confusion. I would, therefore, like to suggest strongly that in order to make this Bill meaningful to wananchi, we should have that permanent secretariat in every district. The secretariat should operate independently. I support what other hon. Members have said that the chairman of the Land Tribunal, including the members of the panel, should be appointed by the Minister. They should be appointed by the Minister so that the tribunal can assume the responsibility and powers of making its own, decisions. At the moment all the powers are in the hands of the district commissioners. When a DC leaves an area, the powers of the committee or tribunal collapses.So, it is also important that these powers should emanate.from a higher authority such as the Minister so that the committeeknows that when it makes decisions, those decisions will be respected and that the Commissioner of Lands who falls under the jurisdiction of the Minister and the Registrar of Titles will respect the same  decisions of the tribunal and actually register cases that have been, concluded by it. I am sure in doing that, we shall be able, to overcome a lot of problems.	I come from an area where a lot of these problems do ariseand they keep on arising. I think for the sake of sorting out these things once and for all; it is important that the powers of the tribunal are clearly spelt, out I do hope that when the Minister amends the Bill he Will actually take into account every aspect ofof the law. As other hon. Members have said nobody should use any loop-holes found in other laws to defeat what we are trying to achieve through this Bill. It is important for the Minister and the Attorney-General to make sure that every possible loop¬hole in this Bill is removed. Some of my hon. colleagues afterlooking at this Bill have said "This bill looks a bit scanty; it does not look comprehensive enough". I must also say that there is definitely need for the Minister to be more specific when he will be replying. For example, he should have a look at clause three and four also at the composition of the secretariat as I had mentioned.It is important for the members of the committee, including its chairman, to be appropriately remunerated. They should be well paid so that they do not succumb to any temptation. This should be ah office that is respected by wananchi so that its decisions are seen to carry weight. These people ought to be well paid. The chairman ought to receive a monthly remuneration that would enable him to live comfortably without thinking of how he can solicit kick-backs. The chairman should also have an office, means of transports adequate housing and a secretariat to enable him to carry out his own duties and those of the tribunal without asking for bribes.It is important that all the terms and conditions of service are clearly . spelt out so that if it is a contract, it is shown clearly. In that way, when these people sit in their offices, they will be respected all round.I say that because the office will be expected to do a lot of work and have members of staff who will have to be travelling from place to place and, in order to do that, these officers should not have any other jobs. Their only responsibility should be to deal with these land issues. I am glad to note that the Attorney-General has mentioned that additional funds will be needed when this Bill is passed. That is fine. Let the enactment of this law involve additional public funds. However, in the process, let wananchi get good services out of the tribunal; There is no harm in charging a small graduated fee to the parties that will be bringing the dispute cases to the tribunals so that they can also be making their contributions to the tribunals themselves. The members of the tribunals will be paid out of the Exchequer and not such fees. There Will be no question of people with a lot of money using the same to try and influence these independent tribunals which will be supposed to carry out their duties for the benefit of everybody.Sir, while we are on that point; I would like, also, to point out that in 1980/81, His Excellency the President clearly directed that all farms that were in the hands of companies, co-operative societies and in partnerships be sub-divided and the title-deeds registered in the names of the individual members, so that everybody could have his own title deed. I am disappointed to note that the office of the Commissioner of Lands does not accept sub-division in respect of partnership-held farms. We have many cases and, as I said, areas like Uasin Gishu and Trans Nzoia have such casesIn fact, even today there was a Question seeking to know the legality ofgiving wananchi titles on partnership-held farms. From what I know, the position should be very clear. Let us leave cut the legalities of theseissues. What happened is that when wananchi were buying land from the settlers, one or two people registered themselves as the buyers, but behind them there were about 40 or 50 or even 100 members, what you call sleeping partners, who were not recognised in the office of the Commissioner of Lands.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, with the directive of His Excellency the President, that partnership, co-operative societies and companies must give everybody his share of the land, why is it that the Commissioner of Lands refuses to recognise those sleeping partners, if the members all agree on the sub-division of the same? It is only when they come to register their parcels of land with the Commissioner of Lands that they are told they cannot do that. They are told that they cannot surrender their title. This is the very area that I would like to request the Minister to look into. This is because thereis a Presidential Directive that affects partnerships, co-operative societiesand companies, without exception. We do not want to go back on a directive that has already been given. Let the Minister take up that issue and instruct hisofficers to stop using the law After all, that law was drafted by colonialistsI clearly say that if the members who are in partnership are in agreement, what is the point of saying that you cannot accept to register those members? I sincerely hope that the Minister will take this matter seriously as there are numerous cases being referred to his office, particularly from the former schedule areas. Let us not go back and make further petitions on this issue. I am sure the Minister will apply his administrative powers to ensure that that particular issue is resolved.	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to conclude by saying that all decisions of the appeals committee, under Clause 7(viii) which Will be final will be registered immediately they are made. I would like to nowconclude by saying that in the provincial appeals tribunal, there should be somebody chairing the same, and not the provincial commissioner. The same applies to the districts, as there should be independent chairmen in every districtwith permanent secretariats.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.K. KINYANJUI: Thank you. very much, for having given me a chance to speak on this Bill. This Bill has come at the right time. However, I thought that the Minister would have used the same opportunity to clarify the land policy in general. Hon. Chesire has given very good examples, that because of the cubersome position of our law, it is not possible to sub-divide partnership land, for example, so that individuals can have their own titles.Sir, we have a lot of Acts governing the land issue in our country. Hon. Chesire talked of the Adjudication Act that governs the land usage; we have, the Consolidation Act that does the same and we have the general bound¬aries governing the land. When you Sub-divide land, you have the general boundaries to consider. There are so many cumbersome activities dealing with this aspect of land.I am suggesting to the Attorney-General and the Minister for Lands, Housing and. Physical Planning that the time has come for them to sit down and work out a clear land policy for Kenya, thereby repealing all those cumbersome Acts that we have governing land in our country. We have such cumbersome land laws that Kenyans do not want them. It is, therefore, important that the Government, through the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Physical Planning, comes out with a comprehensive, land policy.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as many hon. Members have said, land is a very crucial issue in this country. One, Kenya is an agricultural country and we depend on the land. It is the agricultural land that sustains us both on food and economy. If the Acts we have governing land are not rectified, then they will slow down the use of land in this country. That way, we will not be able to utilise our land for the benefit of our people and, indeed, for the growth of our economcy. Today we have a problem in the countryside such that even if you have your piece of land and you want to sell it there are a lot of things that do not allow you: So, I wish once more to ask the Minister to come up with a clear land policy.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to join my hon. colleagues in thanking the hon. Minister for Lands, Housing and Physical Planning for bring¬ing this Bill. The Act that was passed by this Parliament in 1981 giving the Administration power to hear land cases has messed up the whole thing. I think that is the word hon. Chesire used, and I must also use it in saying that the	Act has created a lot of problems, as has been very rightly expressed. You find that a land case can be heard in Kakamega while at the same time it is being heard in Nairobi. That is because there was that loophole of allowing land cases to be taken to the High Court and be heard by the district commissioners at the same time. People knew that there was that loophole and it became very difficult to clear a land case.	The second problem was that a land case that has been heard by one administrator could be heard by another one, be it a district officer, a district commis¬sioner or a provincial commissioner. So, land cases have become very difficult because people have known how to go round about newly posted administrators. We are in a mess as far as land disputes in Kenya re concerned today. So, it is good that this Bill has been brought in order that we can rectify the position. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I must say that 1 am very grateful to the President because he: saw and directed the: many land buying companies to sub-divide their land. Most of the land buying companies have now sub-divided their land and many disputes that are coming up are as a result of division of land that was held by land buying companies. It is true that there are a lot of land disputes and we need clear and finalized arbitrations.I must agree with hon. Mahihu that it will be very unfortunate if we were to have only one tribunal in a district. I differ with hon. Chesire thatwe should have one tribunal per district. A place like Kiambu, with seven divisions, would be impossible to be managed by one land tribunal. An area like Lari has a lot of land disputes before the district officer such that he has no time to do any other business. So, it will be very difficult for one land tribunal to manage a district like Kiambu, although it is a very small area. We have places like Meru District, although they are lucky the district is being divided into two. But, considering the vastness of some districts, it will be impossible for one' land tribunal to go round.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Bill points at the very poor mwananchi. This is one of the things the President realised because the ordinary ; wananchi do not have money to hire lawyers. We are putting that mwananchi inthe same problem because he will be made to travel to the district headquarters	with his witnesses, and that will be very expensive. Therefore, if land cases	will be arbitrated at the district level, it will cost the ordinary mwananchi unknown cost in form of transport. So, it is important that we have, land tribunalsat the divisional level.Sir, as most hon. Members have rightly said, it is unfortunate that today in Kenya we have a lot of work loaded on the administration. The district commissioner is already overloaded with work. As a consequence, he delegates work to his district officers who, unfortunately, may not be conversant with a lot of matters. Therefore, it is important that we do at overload the administrat¬ion. Therefore, as many hon. Members have said, it is important that the appointment of the pannel be done by the Minister. Again, I think it is important to put in this Bill who is to become an elder so that when the elders are being appointed by the Minister or by the district commissioner, they are appointed according to the specifications of the Bill. With all due respect, as hon. Mahihu said, the Minister could appoint a very young fellow to be an elder and that becomes all. So, I would suggest that in this Bill we should specify who is an elder, and hon. Mahihu did quite clearly recommend what should be looked at when appointing an elder.Sir, the other point, as the hon. Members have said, is that we also a problem when we have either the P.C. or D.C. as the chairman. So I would suggest and agree with those Members who have spoken that we should have the chairman as one of the elders but not the P.C. or the D.C.Sir, the limitation of a dispute must be provided for in the Bill. For instance, in my constituency today we have a land disputes case at the D.O.'s office dating back to 1939! This is in Lari Constituency. In my constituency, part of the people were repatriated from the Tigoni Settlement Area to my area. So some¬body who bought land in Tigoni during that time has to be sub-divided how. So, there must be a limitation of time as to when a dispute can be heard. If land has been registered then there should be no more land disputes. If we do not do that all the districts that are registered will still come up every now and then. So it is important that We should have limitation of time.Sir, I see in the Bill provision that even after thepanel of elders has heard the case it could still go to a court of law, High Court. I am not a lawyer, but I would like us to look at that clause or provision very closely so that-we do not bring back the same land problems that we have today to come back. If we allowed that provision there would be another loophole and the land dispute cases would never end. However, since I am not a lawyer, I am not very competent to speak on that issue.With those few remarks, Sir, I beg to support the Bill.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT (Mr. Ngei): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to contribute to this Land Disputes Tribunal Bill which was moved by the Attorney-General.	First of all, I am glad that His Excellency the Presidentordered that the Administration should hot he involved in Harambeecollections. I wrote to His Excellency the President and toldhim about so many chiefs and assistant chiefs who were collecting Harambeemoney without receipts, and I would like them to be punished. I hope His Excellency the President Will read letter. Let us have some C.I.D. officers or Special Branch officers go there and interrogate those-chiefs and assistant chiefs. I say this because His Excellency the president saw there was something wrong with the Harambee contributions.Sir, there is also something wrong here with the land disputes tribunals. Today I have a society with 13,000 members. The society has a building here worth KSh. 110 million, the Matungulu House. I requested the people to collect money so that they could buy that building which has a title deed. Now, this building belongs to people from Matuhgulu Location. However, an ex-bank man now is trying to sell the building because the members ewe the bank KSh.110 million which we are required to pay KSh. 10 million a yeaIn other words, if we are given, say, 15 years we should be able to clear the loan. It is a very important building which is justnext to Alico Building and Shelter Afrique. It is a very well constructed building. Yet this ex-bank man is selling the building to the Ministry of. Local Government, and it is a. very serious matter. I am a member of the Matunguli farmers Co-operative Society which owns this building. In fact, my membership No. is 972. Therefore I can speak about the Society any time. I am requesting the Minister for Lands and Housing to look into this-matter. In fact. I have told him that I have written to His Excellency the President about this matter. I am also going to write to The Minister for Local Government and tell him to get out of the Sir, I would request the Minister for Local Government to study the Land Disputes Tribunals' Bill very well. The member of the Matungulu farmers Co-operative Society surrendered their title deeds to the bank so that they could, be advanced money to be able to buy the big building, the Matungulu House.Above all, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker we must be sincerely honest.	we have a man in Kangundo Constituency who has had a land buthe found the lawyers handling his case the wrong way This, is why I amsaying that one has to be very careful about these days. I didnot know lawyers the way I know them now. I have now came to know them bytheir true colours. These lawyers did something to this men which he willnever forget in his lifetime. This man had a plot with a title deed and hehad built a shop on this plot but a certain lawyer decided that the shop shouldnot belong to this man and filed ii case in dispute. In themeantime this man from Kangundo held an auction in which he wanted to buyall the shambas, plots, buildings and shops belonging to eight people whohappened to be brothers. This lawyer went to the Registrar of the HighCourt and the uaction was stopped. Then Kanu youth wing from Kangundo went and took cattle from this man because he had been given cattle plus Shs.l,800,000 in the judgement. However, this case was withdrawn by the lawyer. I do not know what is happening to justice these days. The case was withdrawn and therefore this man was not paid Shs.l,300,000/- I am going to write to the President about this, and I mean it I This is a case that was deliberately calculated to paint a very bad picture of our Judiciary. I would like the Minister to know that this man has already sold the land.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me tell you of another case. There are very many cases of lawyers who are obtaining property belonging to certain people and giving it to other people. This practice mustbe stopped and. I would appeal to the Minister for Lands and housing to make sure that he appoints these panels of elders to settle these cases. The provincial commissioner should be told not to come in. we should have somebody who knows something about the law to head this Tribunal and he mustbe appointed by the Minister himself. In doing so, the Minister should consultthe Members of parliament, the public and reporters these are the peoples who know the straightforward elders. There should be no problems about this an.the Minister should be left alone to do his work so that he can do it well.Coming to the question of the appointment of elders, carefulconsideration must ho made here though the word "elder" in Kiswahilimeans Mzee, what would happen if somebody who have no knowledge of the lawis appointed in the panel of elders? We want somebody with the knowledgeof the law. He may be a retired magistrate, judge and so on We want peoplewho can give legal interpretation in some of these things I liked the wayhon. Chesire put it, that these people must he paid. We must make sure thatthese elders axe paid, but apart from that, we should insist that thoseelders should have some knowledge about the law. Although this word elders is literally token to mean wazee, it should not been taken that they are just old men who know nothing else apart from customary laws. These elders must he well versed in our laws.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I said that the provincial commissioner should keep off this Tribunal. We should have somebody else  to be the chairman of this Tribunal and he must also have full knowledge about our laws to be able to head this body. He should be appointed by the Minister here. We have heard enough case regarding provincial commissioners and we do not want to hear more and this is why we are saying that somebody else should be appointed by the Minister to head this tribunal but not the provincial commissioner. The Minister should appointed the Tribunal even at the district level and the appeals committee shall also be appointed by the Minister and we do not want to see the provincial commissioner around. We have heard enough of them.	Mr. Temporary deputy Speaker, Sir, it is my sincere hope that the  Minister will do all the things that ire have asked bin regarding the appointment of the tribunal and the appeals committees. This is a very good Bill, but I feel it is necessary to study other Acts which arc closely related to this Bill. There is, for example, the Land Adjudication Act and the Registered Land Act. Are we really very serious about passing this Bill be we have	studied these other Acts which are closely related to its operations?.I feel that the Minister should have gone through these Acts to make sure that they are in harmony with the Land Tribunal Act.With those few remarks, I beg to second the Bill.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. KIILU: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,for giving me this chance to join my colleagues in the discussion of this very important Bill which relates to land. Land is very important and I would urge the Minister to be very strict when this Bill is passed because the ordinary wananchi have suffered a lot from the actions of his Ministry and staff, especially those of the officers in rural areas.When we establish this tribunal, we need to be careful in appointingelders in order to ensure that we only appoint those who cannot be influenced byanybody. Sometimes, rich people mistreat the poor who rely on their land forsurvival. If these elders are not competent, it will be very easy to influencethem to mess up their work. If a person loses his land due to. these elders being influenced by someone else, this will be harmful. So, we appeal to the Minister to keep a watchful eye on these elders to ensure that if any of them are influenced by other people, he sacks them without any waste of time. Land is a very sensitive issue. These elders will be very important and we will rely on them for justice in land cases. In appointing them, therefore, the Minister should not let the Administration interfere. There must be some local people within a given area whose behaviour and character is well-known. These people will not take anything that does not rightly belong to them nor will they accept bribes, and this is the type of people we need. Some elders may be old enough to be appointed on the tribunal, but their character may not be good. It will be quite unfair for such elders to be appointed on the tribunal as it will be easy to influence them in respect of land cases.When land disputes arise, they should be dealt with quickly because when there is a delay in deciding these cases, there are problems. Some areas have not yet been demarcated or adjudicated. When even as few as two land cases are delayed in these areas, we are told that no title deeds can be prepared. I appeal to the Minister to see that even if there is a case or two in a divisionstill pending decision, the majority of the people in the area are issued with title deeds and suspend the issue of title deeds in respect of the two pieces of land over which there are disputes. It is a sort of punishment not to issue themajority of the people in a division with title deeds just because of two pending land cases. So, I appeal to the Minister to rectify this situation.with regard to the final appeal tribunal, I would request the  Minister to ensure that elders of the tribunal are appointed from each district, and that they are not appointed just from one or two districts. This appointment should be done in consultation between the Minister, local Members of Parliament and local leaders in order to ensure that the elders appointed are competent and can take public orders.We have had instances of land cases arising from areas that have been, demarcated going to the court of law and lawyers interfering in such cases. I have, for example one sub-location that has been declared an adjudication area and demarcation is now going there while there are still some cases going on in court.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in Ikaatini Sub-location there are certain land cases pending in court and I would ask	the Ministry to intervene so that such cases are left to its officer In that sublocation I have seen a rich person who want to interfere with Mathauta Primary School land, which was set aside for the school by the local community. It was surprising that after, the school committee complained about this rich man allocating himself school land, they were arrested, charged in court and fined Shs.12,000/-; the area sub-chief also arrested and the issue is still not yet resolved. I expected the Ministry's officers to intervene but they have just continued to watch the situation.The Ministry's officers should remain unconcerned. We have seen them encouraging people to file land cases in order  to delay land ajdudication. When this happens the officers side with those who have money, which is very bad. This is harmful to the poor, especially widows who have no grown up children to stand up for them. In fact, we should congratulate our President for his advice that the rich be prevented from hurting the poor. The Minister should actually institute a procedure that would enable the poor, who are being oppressed by rich people, to appeal to him.I want to suggest that instead of having only the district land disputes tribunals and the land disputes appeal committee we should also have a divisional land disputes tribunal, which would be in a position to trace the dispute from thegrassroots level. Unless that is done I do not see how thedistrict tribunal will be able to know what has happened in a certain sublocation in Masinga Division. I would suggest thatif instituted, the divisional land disputes tribunal consist of the district officers and elders, or leaders, by wananchi who know them well; in this way wananchi's interestsWill be protected.	, ,' Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in my constituency there are several farms like Manangya which were bought by	igroups of wananchi, which are now benefiting a few members of the committees.I want to appeal to the Ministry to interveneand ensure that members are given their plots. Some of the wananchi have been complaining bitterly but they have threatened with expulsion from the land companies by the management committees.Where plots have been allocated, the committee members have allocated themselves the best plots along the river where they can irrigate and given ordinary members plots in the drier parts of the farms. Let the Ministry intervene here also and ensure that the members are issued with title deeds. The District Commissioner, Machakos has already directed that everything to do with these farms must be completed before the end of this year and I am happy with his directive.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, theMinistry should therefore urge the District Commissioner to speed up the matter so that everybody gets his or her ownshare. Those who have money should not be allowed to enjoy more benefits than those who do not have money, I request the Minister to consider some of these, things so that all people benefit from their own properties. They tried to contribute what was required at the time that land was being bought.With these few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Mvenje) : Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to say a few words about this particular Bill which is very important.	But before I start contributing to the Bill, I would like to take, this opportunity to thank His Excellency the President for visiting the Eastlands area of Nairobi today. He went round in certain areas today. We are lucky to have a President who is prepared to visit the common man where he lives. TodayHis Excellency the President visited my constituency, Embakasi; I found him buying some bananas from some	hawkers who were doing some business. It is a great privilege that His Excellency the President could find time to visit the Eastland’s area of this; City where the common, poor man lives. He went there to see how the common man lives; how the hawkers are doing their businesses and so on. I feel that I should thank His Excellency the President most sincerely for visiting these suburbs today to see for himself how our people are living. It is not easy to find such a president anywhere in Africa or in the world; who would go to such areas to see how the common man is doing.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I saw the Presidenttoday talking with the common men in Eastlandsand I thank him very much. I thank for visiting people in Embakasi Constituency and other parts of Nairobi. I would like to assure His Excellency the President that members of Parliament from Nairobi will continue giving him and his Government all the support that is required so that in turn we can get services from the Government. I thank him and I hope that he will receive our sincere thanks.Turning to the BILL before the House, Mr. TemporaryDeputy Speaker, Sir, I hope that the points that have beenraised by hon. Members in this House will be taken intoconsideration by the minister for Lands and Housing andthe Attorney-General. A lot of suggestions have been made by hon. Members in this House. I listened to hon. Mahihu and other Members who have spoken before me and I can tell you that theyhave given constructive suggestions to the Ministry concerned. So, these are suggestions that the Attorney-General and the Minister for Lands and Housing cannot afford to ignore. Thesepoints are vital and they should be taken into consideration Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is unlikely that this Bill will be passed the way it is now. I hope that the Minister for Lands and Housing and the Attorney-General:will come up with some amendments to this Bill that will cover a wider range of issues. This is because the suggestions made by hon. Members are very important and I feel that they cannot be ignored. I hope that they will be taken into consideration so that when the Minister stands to reply he will have included those suggestions in the Bill.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not want to repeat what has been said by the previous speakers, but it is true that there is no way you can expect a Provincial Commissionerto sit the whole day listening to land disputes; he will never have the time to do that. If that happens it will mean that if those land cases have been taking a year to finalise they will now be taking five to ten years to finalise; that will never work.MR. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it willnot be easy for the tribunals, working from the district headquarter to know what is happening at the locational level. Even if they do not go down to the localtional level, because that may be too, cumbersome, at least they should go down to the divisional level. I say this because ordinary magistrates courts have gone up to the divisional level; we find magistrates' court at the divisional level. So, I do not see why we cannot have tribunals at the divisional level. If a whole district will have to rely on one tribunal those cases will pile up and the elders will beover-worked and the whole tiling will possibly never work. So, I feel that they should go to the divisional level so that they can serve our people more efficiently. At the divisional level you will find people who know the areas well.Mr. Temporary. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not see how thechairman of the tribunal will be appointed by the DistrictCommissioner. If the District Commissioner is biased against one side in a particular dispute, then that means that he Will tellthe Chairman "I want the ruling on this particular case to be thisway." So, the Chairman of the tribunal should be appointed by the Minister because the Minister is not an interested party. I donot know what would happen if the Minister has to appoint one tohandle cases in his particular area. 	I think the Chairman of the tribunal must be appointed by the Minister.  I say this because we have a very honest Minister for Lands and Housing. That the District Commissioner should do is to sake some recommendations if he has to. I know that all this mean a lot of work for the Minister.If the District Commissioner appoints the chairman and the elders reject that appointment then the appointment should be done. by the Minister himself. Even the elders themselves can choose the chairman. Although hon. Karauri said that the chairman will serve for two years or so, what I understood from the Attorney-General is that the chairman will be chosen for a particular case; there will be no permanent chairman. There will be a chairman for each case. If that is the case then the elders should be allowed to decide who will be the chairman of what case. After that the Minister can be told that "Mr. So-and-so was the chairman of this particular case.If we say that the Minister or the district commissioner will appoint the chairman, the whole thing will be very cumbersome. Let the elders elect the chairman for each case.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am in agreement with those who say that this is a timely occasion for us Lo have such tribunals to sort out the many land disputes we have. Those tribunals should now work all over the Republic. There is that general tendency of assuming that there are no agricultural lands in Nairobi that can fall under this particular Bill. Let me in form the House that there is a lot of agricultural land in Nairobi. So, once the Bill passes, we would like to have such tribunals in Nairobi because we have land cases in Nairobi.Let me cite my own constituency where we have 29 agricultural farms. We also have areas like Dagoretti where there are agricultural farms. When these tribunals are being formed, I would appeal to the Minister to bear in mind that we will need similar consideration in Nairobi, as we also have agricultural farms, just like the other areas of the Republic. We also have the good elders that one can think of within the Nairobi City limits. So, I hope that consideration will be made.At the same time, if it were possible, the Minister should extend that coverage not only in respect of agricultural land, but also to cover those plots that are being developed because there are some that still belong to families, while others belong to partnerships and there are many others that have a lot of disputes over them. It is difficult to sort them out and I feel a tribunal would assist in that case. There are people who know Nairobi as their only home and have no other home in Kenya. Therefore we should also have land disputes tribunals looking into their cases in Nairobi not only in, those cases that are in respect of agricultural land but also in respect of plots and even houses, in some cases we have been  trying to arbirtrate for our people who come to us for assistance when they have disputes. When we have the tribunals proposed in the Bill, then wewill be referring such cases to the tribunals and our work will become easier.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker:, Sir, in my Embakasi Constituonoy we have the Embakasi Ranching Company, for which I would like to thank the Minister for Lands and Housing. The Minister appointed a commission to look into the problems facing that company. I have been talking about this company since I was .elected to this House. I am glad that the Minister deemed it fit to appoint a commission which is now doing a very commendable job. Every day the commission is able to give out 300 plots to shareholders of that particular farm Previously, it was taking about a year to allocate 100 plots to the shareholders, while now the allocation is 300' plots per day. You can see the importance of looking into wananchi's problems.I would like to alert the Minister that there are still problems that are recurring. What is happening is that some of the directors are very unscrupulous. I am glad that the commission is now addressing itself very keenly to this issue. They used to prepare title deeds in the name of the Embakasi Ranching company, instead of registering the title deed in the name of the person who was to be allocated a plot. One was told that his title deed was ready and so one had now to go and arrange for the transfer of the plot. After paying all the necessary dues, survey fees, shareholding and so on, one would be told to go and see a certain lawyer. Now, to transfer the title deed that was purposely registered in, the name of the Embakasi Ranching Company to your name, one was compelled to pay Ksh.2,000/- per title deed by the lawyer. 	when we calculated the total amount of money paid that lawyer we go KShs.52 million. This is unscrupulous and a serious robbery without violence. The shareholders who originally bought that land have been paying that money. What reason do I not have to believe that the amount that was being paid to the lawyer must have been shared by the same directors who took that work to the particular lawyer and who had been issuing title deeds in the name of the company instead of doing it direct to the shareholders.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are a lot of unscrupulous affairs going on in particular farms and that is why tribunals are necessary. I do thank the Minister for Lands, Housing and Physical Planning because that commission has saved wananchi a lot of money which, otherwise, they would have been swindled. I hope that the Minister will take this issue seriously and ensure that any title deeds relating to Embakasi Ranching Company are prepared direct in the name of. the shareholder, and not in the name of the company for subsequent transfer. I want the Minister to tell us before this Bill is passed whether this is going to be the case. We have been told by the Ministry that all land-buying companies will be wound up by the end of this year, which means that we now have only a month to go. We hope that the Minister will stand by this directive because most of these companies have been unscruplous and a headache to shareholders. Shareholders in these companies, would like to be given their land, and if there are any surveyors who have not completed their work on such land, I appeal to the Attorney-General and possibly appoint liquidators to liquidate the assets of such company whose land has not yet been surveyed yet or issue the remaining land to the shareholders. This land should not be left in the hands of unscruplous directors who we have know to have been bothering shareholders  and swindling them of their land-and money. I hope that all land-buyingcompanieswill be wound up by the end of this year because no matter how long you give their directors to settle matters, they will never wind up their companies.</Newspeech><Header>ADJOURNMENT</Header><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwiraa): Hon.Members, it is now time for the interruption of business.
