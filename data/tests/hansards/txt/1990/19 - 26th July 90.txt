Next Question, Mr. Mureithi.</Newspeech>(Question deferred)Question No. 376<Header>Rural Power Programme for Mweiga Location</Header>	MR. MUREITHI asked the Minister for Energy what	plans the Ministry has for rural electrificationprogrammes in M\yeiga Location of Kieni West Division.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Moturi): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.There are no plans for Mweiga Location at the moment, as its priority ranking has not yet been communicated to my Ministry by the Nyeri D.D.C. The hon. Member may, therefore, wish to follow up the matter with the D.D.C.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUREITHI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister assure the House that once they receive the recommendation from the Nyeri D.D.C. they will implement the programme?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. MOTURI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is an on-going project currently in the division. As soon as this project is completed and the hon. Member has contacted the Nyeri D.D.C. we shall do it.</Newspeech>Question No. 384N.S.S.P. Payments to Mr. KipkesionDR. MISOI asked the Minister for Labour how much NS.S.F. withdrawal benefits were -oaid to Mr.Malakwen Kipkesion, N.S.S.F. No. 068'-389 291.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. D.M. Amin): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.No payment of withdrawal benefits has been made to Mr. Malakwen Kipkesion, N.S.S.F. No. 068 889 291. Although the claim-ant has a number, the account does not provide adequate information. The hon. Member should request the claimant to come and see the Managing Trustee for further information and assistance.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has not answered the Question and has not even bothered to find out more about this claimant. Could he direct his officers to get the necessary information from this particular person who requires to be paid his benefits?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is a reason why we are requesting the claimant to come to the office of the Managing Trustee so that he can be assisted. Therefore, I would urge the hon. Member to advise the claimant to come there.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell us why this person is wanted personally by the Managing Trustee? Why can the offices in the Eldorst Distrio not get hold of this man and pass over the infomation to so to come to the headquarters,if need be?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: For further information, Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir, the claimant applied for withdrawal benefits on 15th February, 1977. His file was closed on 15th February, 1982, when he failed to produce documentary evidence such as payslip or docket to prove that he was the contributor. If he still claims that he was a contributor, the Fund is prepared to re-open his file if he can produce the above mentioned documentary evidence. It is a rule that all employees are registered by the Fund whether they are contributors or not. The Fund, therefore, has a number of members who have numbers but are not contributors.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister says that the application was made in 1977 and that in 1982 this person failed to provide documentary evidence. How could this person have an N.S.S.F. number if he was not a contributor. Is it possible. If he had this number, then he had contributed some money to the Fund.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.D.M. AMTN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, anybody can have a number but still not be a contributor.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the hon. Assistant Minister is misleading the House. I am sure there is no contributor of N.S.S.F. who can be given a fake number. Can he tell us who gave this fake number to this person?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: This is why we want this claimant to come to the office.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not satisfied with the answer by the Assistant Minister. I would request that he directs the officer in Eldoret to pass, this information or to collect this information from this person. Why should he come to Nairobi while there is an office in Eldoret?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMTN: That is acceptable, Mr. Deputy Speaker. We shall inform the claimant to see our officer in Eldoret.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Very well Next Question, Mr. Arap Chepkok	. </Newspeech>Question No. 404<Header>Delay in Paying Mr. Aboo's N.S.S.F. Dues</Header>MR. Arap CHEPKOK asked the Minister for Labour what has delayed the payment of N.S.S.P. benefits for Mr. Mohamed E. Aboo, No. 3435075, formed employee of Simba Tours Ltd.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. D.M. Amin): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The payment of benefits to Mr. Mohamed Aboo, N.S.S.F No. 3435075, has not been made because his application has been received by the Fund.<Newspeech>Mr. Chepkok: The Assistant Minister is continuing  misleading the House, Sir. Mr. Aboo submitted his claim, but he was told that his deductions have not reached the N.S.S.F. Can he give us the correct answer?</Newspeech><Newspeech>R. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have given the answer I have.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.Arap CHEPKOK: I need your guidance, Sir. As far as I know,  simba tours Limited have not submitted N.S.S.F deductions for all its employees. How can the Assistant Minister mislead the House by saying; that Mr. Aboo has not forwarded his claim when the money is not there? If he does not know, then we can provide him with the information.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Sir, my Ministry cannot know whether there is money or not unless a claim is forwarded to the N.S.S.F. He should apply and we shall pay him.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. Arap CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Sir. I have col. The Assistant Minister that Mr. Aboo forward  his claim  but was told that his name did not appear in the list of documents and that is dues had not been received by his employer. How can he claim when there is no money?</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. D.M. AMIN : I have said that Me. Aboo had not forwarded his claim to us. Therefore, we are not supposed to say anything.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: On a point of order, Sir. There appears to be something missing in this question. This is because normally there are nine digits in N.S.S.F. numbers but here I can only see seven digits. Could there be confusion between the Questioner and the Assistant Minister?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M AMIN: Sir. The number I have is quite delay. I have said that the claimant had not forwarded his claim. If he claims we  shall pay him.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: The hon. Questioner has said that Me.Aboo went to claim his benefits but could not be said because his deductions had not been submitted by Simba Tours Limited. How can the Assistant Minister tell us that Mr. Aboo will be paid upon application if his dues have not been forwarded?</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. D.M AMIN: If the Hon. Member provide us with a copy of Mr. Aboo's claim, we shall obviously pay him.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Arap Chepkok:We need the guidance of the Chair here, this is because when we ask questions in this House, they are not always answered correctly. How, can the Assistant Minister tell us the total amount of money submitted as N.S.S.F, dues for all employees by Simba Tours Limited?</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. D.M. AMIN: Sir, that is a different question all together</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. Arap CHEPKOK: This is a supplementary question, Sir, and not a different question all together. Can he tell us the amount of money submitted by Simba Tours Limited as N.S. S.F dues covering all  employees?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIM: We cannot even Know how many people are working there because that is a different question all together.  If he brings such a question at a later late. we shall to research and I will answer it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. KUBO: on a point of order, Sir. Since this supplement question is about Simba Tours limited, the Assistant Minister.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY Speaker: Order I am in a agreement with that want to know how much money particular company has forwarded the Ministry as N.S.S.F. dues.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIM: Me do not even know where the man was claiming before was working. If the I house requests that information, we shall bring it here.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. Arap CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Sir. Can the Assistant Minister tell this House when he is going to bring that information here?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Next week</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.DeputySpeaker: Next Question.</Newspeech>Question No. 390<HEader>Funds for Makuru Industrial Training institute</Header>MR. A.M. KIMEMIA asked the Minister for Industry how much money has been allocated for the expansion of Kenya industrial Training Institute in Makuru and when it will be completed.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY (Mr.  Kiplagat) : Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Money for expansion of KITI is allocated according to Phases. So far the following allocation has been done:-Phase	"Value/Estimate"Phase I	K£1 ,700,000 - for staff houses -completed in 1985.Phase II	K£350,000	-drainage and water works completed in 1986.Phase 111	K£5.555.903.15 - for workshops, hostels,dining hall, kitchen, common room & laundry. As at the close of last financial year K£3.634,100 had been spent. in the current Financial Year only K £ I . 140,210 has been allocated. This means that there is a short fall of K£781.593.15, which means that the date of completion of this phase is uncertain because of lack of funds.Phase IV	K£4,500,000 - for Administration Block,classrooms, sports facilities, clinic hostels. This phase has not yet started but all the documentation of the project are ready and work can start anytime there is money.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.K.KIEMIA: I thank the Assistant Minister for his reply. Why did the Ministry start this project without Proper plans? This project was implemented in 1985 and it has not been completed up to now?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIPLAGAT: I agree with the hon. Questioner. There was good planning and that is why we solit the project because of its size into phases. Finances will he made available after aking the necessary application to the Treasury. The Ministry is trying its best but it has to do with what is available.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIMEMIA: Sir, can the Assistant Minister tell this House when this project will be completed?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIPLAGAT: Sir, it will be completed when funds for the four phases are made available.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Sir, I thank the Assistant Minister for answering this Question comprehensively and this is how we expect them to answer Questions in this House.Can he tell us whether this construction is proceeding according to plan?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. KIPLAGAT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think this is almost a different question. Our plan runs according to the phases we foresaw at the beginning of the project, and we are now in Phase III. The, question of timing depends on the availability of funds. If money had been available at the time we needed it, we would have" completed the project earlier but, as you can see, we have a shortfall in Phase III.</Newspeech>Question No. 374<Header>Construction of Lokichoggio-Kamathia Road</Header>MR. EKIDOR asked the Minister for Public Works when construction work on Lokichoggio-Kamathia Road will commence since the road has been surveyed and recommended for construction by Turkana District Development Committee (D.D.C.).<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Maiyani): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Lokichoggio-Kamathia Road has not been surveyed for the purpose ofconstruction. The road is also neither classified nor has the Ministryreceived any recommendation by Turkana D.D.C. that this is a priority. TheMinistry does not, therefore, have any plains for the construction of this road.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the road in question joins Kibichi and Lokichoggio Divisions. The District Commissioner there, who is the Chairman of the said D.D.C, was given a plane by the Office of the President to go and survey this road. Could the Assistant Minister tell the House for what purpose the road was surveyed?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the District Commissioner ever flew over that area, he was surveying it for the purpose of seeing how the district is. In any case, road surveyors come from our Ministry. We also have our officers at the district headquarters, and they have never been instructed to survey that road. If the hon. Member has any information contrary to what I have said, we would only be too pleased to receive it. The said District Commissioner has not forwarded any recommendation on this road to our Ministry.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIILU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the hon. Questioner says that this road joins two divisions, why can the Ministry not instruct its officersto do something about the road?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we act the other way round. It is the relevant D.D.C. that should recommend this road for construction and forward this recommendation to the Ministry. We cannot go to the district and tell our officers to work on the road. If we do so, there will be chaos in the country because we do not have enough money to enable us to go and tell our officers to do this and that. We go by priority.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell the House what he will do to survey and classify the road if I bring to him the minutes of the meeting of the D.D.C. next week? Could he promise that he will take action on the road?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, with all due respect, I can make no promises, but when the relevant recommendation comes, it will be considered by my Ministry and forwarded to the Treasury for the provision of the required funds. When we get these funds, we will work on the road. We will do our best when we get the D.D.C.'s recommendation.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister says that his Ministry has not received the D.D.C.'s recommendation on this road, but the hon. Questioner says that the D.D.C. has already submitted this recommendation. How are we going to be guided in this country if every Minister comes here and says that he has not received recommendations from D.D.C.'s when these committees and Members of Parliament are aware that they have already made these recommendations? There is a breakdown of communication somewhere between D.D.C.'s and the Ministry's headquarters.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I agree with the hon. Member that there is a breakdown of communication, but that is not my fault. What did the said District Commissioner do with the document he got?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let us move on to Mr. Kubo's Question.</Newspeech>Question No. 400<Header>Improvement of Radio Reception in Taveta</Header>MR. KUBO asked the Minister for Information and Broadcasting what plans the Ministry has to improve radio reception in Taveta Constituency in view of the fact that the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (K.B.C.) radio reception in this area is poor.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Kimani): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The K.B.C. has now embarked on plans to modernize and improve radio reception countrywide by building five new radio transmitting stations and upgrading five existing ones. The new stations will be constructed in Malindi, Wajir, Marsabit, Maralal and Kitale while the existing stations in Garissa, Voi, Ngong, Yala and Marania will be upgraded. It is hoped that construction and upgrading will be completed by 1992. Once this is done, radio reception countrywide, including Taveta, will be greatly improved.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has talked about the future, saying that new transmitting stations will be constructed and that this construction is expected to be completed by 1992. Has this work been started already or is this mere wishful thinking?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIMANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the work has not been started, but negotiation for money has been completed and the construction of the new stations will be started in September, 1990.</Newspeech>Question No. 356<Header>Maintenance Funds for Modogashe-Habasweni Road</Header>MR. A.I. MOHAMED asked the Minister for Public Works how much money has been allocated for the maintenance of the road between Modogashe and Habasweni.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Maiyani): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.A sum of Shs.24,596/= is allocated for the maintenance of the road between Modogashe and Habasweni.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.I. MOHAMED: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to know from theAssistant Minister when this section of the road was last graded.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, according to the information I have here, there is no date indicating when the road was last graded, but the total amount of money alocated for the maintenance of this road section will cover the following activities: heavy and light grading, gravel patching, cleaning of culverts, ditches and metre drains, repairing and replacement of culverts, road sign manufacturing, maintenance and replacement.The distance covered between Habasweni and Modogashe is 52 kilometres.</Newspeech>we hope that this work will be done fairly soon and the Hon. Member will be happy to travel on that road.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. SALAT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Assistant Minister has talked of Shs.24,596/- for that road. Is he satisfied that this money is sufficient for the amount of work to be done on that road?</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is the amount of money recommended for such a short distance. If it is insufficient, we will only be happy to receive further  recommendations from the district development committee (DDC) concerned.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.I. MOHAMED: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can. the Assistant Minister tell the House under which administrative district this section of the road falls?</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I assume that there is a district where the road is.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.I. MOHAMED: Mr. Deputy Speaker. Sir, could the Assistant Minister be serious and tell us under which district section of the road falls?</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. MAYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker. Sir. can hon. Member repeat his question? I did not get it because there was a bit of noise.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.I. MOMAMED: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, under which administrative district, or district engineer, does the Modogashe Habswein Road fall?</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr.MAYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, sir, the hon. Member  comes from Wajir District. if the road is not in his district what business would he have to ask this Question?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. JALDESA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir we seek your guidance over this interesting reply. Some of us come from that area  and know in which district this road is in; it is interesting to note that the Assistant Minister does not know what he is reply is talking about. Will he tell us whether the over Shs.24,000 he is talking about will be used to repair a road in Wajir District or Isiolo District?</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Questioner represents Wajir West and so the road must be in Wajir West.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SALAT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Assistant Minister is trying to confuse the House and himself too. He is assuming that since the hon. Questioner comes from Wajir District this particular road is in that district, but a Member of Parliament can ask a Question about any part of this country regardles of where he comes from. Could he tell the House under which district engineer this road falls?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is an entirely new question regarding the geographical position of the road. I will be vary happy to answer it if it is raised after finding out from my officer. I am not a geographical genius in which district this road is. If that was the question, I have the answer with me here.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, sir this is an place and I know that that road is in Isiolp District. How the hon. Member wants to know whether the funds for maintaining that is with the District engineer, Isiolo, or the District  Engineer wajir so that he can follow that officer seriously.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: This over Shs.24,000/- is for the Modozashe- Habswein Road irrespective of whether it is in Isiolo or Wajir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Maiyani, I think hon. Me hears to know who the authority to incur expenditure (AID) holder for that road is. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir,	it does not matter whether this road falls under the jurisdiction of the Isiolo or wajir District Commissioner.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. WASIKE-NDOMBI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Here is an Assistant Minister for the sensitive Ministry of Public Works who has been given an answer by his officers, But he fails to tell the House whether his answer came from an officer in Isiolo or Wajir District. Unless the Assistant Minister knows the officer in charge of this section of the road, he will not be able to follow him up and ensure that this road is maintained. Can the Assistant Minister, therefore, with all seriousness, go back to his office, get into his Land Rover go to isiolo and Wajir and find out in which district this section of the road falls so that he will be able to follow up the officer in charge of that road? There is no point in the Assistant Minister sitting in his office and getting answers which he does not courter-check. This is vary serious, and that is why we say we are not satisfied with these kind of Ministers.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not know the kind of an Assistant Minister I am the hon. Member can tell me. However logically the district; commissioner under whom this road fails is the one with this money. If the hon. Member suspects that money is not there, he should tell me.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SAIAT: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think we are not getting anywhere: The Assistant Minister was asked to go back to his office and find out under which district commissioner, or district engineer, this section of the road falls. He can go there himself, as advised by hon. Wasike-Wdombi or find out from his office. Then is he going there?</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, sir, the problem is simply lack of money for this road. I would appreciate if the hon. tells me which district commissioner to contact. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. A.I. MOHAMMED: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, Sir. We kindly need your guidance here. When we ask Questions here, we do so for the welfare of wananchi in this country. When somebody is charged with a responsibility, like the Assistant Minister here, becomes so arrogant, we seem to be lost.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is your point of order?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.I. MOHAMMED: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister be serious, honest and sincere? If he is not aware of anything, let him tell us so, or go back to his Ministry and effect investigations so as to prepare himself for an appropriate answer. How can he tell us that the amount of money he quoted was voted, and he does not know to who?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, with all due respect, I want to say that I am not arrogant. If the hon. Member wants to know which district commissioner is holding the money, I will furnish him with that information next week.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there has been a very interesting discussion. Could the Assistant Minister, therefore, apologise to the House for that misleading statement and withdraw the answer</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Which misleading statement or answer?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister gave an irrelevant answer. How can we, then, assume that he has answered? Could he apologise to the House for giving an answer to a Question he does not know where it belongs?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Equally, Sir, the Question is very misleading because no district was specified; the mention was only of a road. The Question is how much money</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Maiyani. If I were you, I would just stop at the undertaking you have just given the House; namely, to come next week and say where this road falls. I see no reason really why you should apologise for what Dr. Misoi claims.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.KILIKU: 0n a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir; I heard the hon. Member who had raised the Question referring to the Assistant Minister as arrogant, but I think he was actually confused.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is that a fair comment, really, Mr. Kiliku.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: I thought it was unparliamentary to claim that one is arrogant, but to use the word "confused" is allowed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SALAT: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Hon. Kiliku says that the Assistant Minister is confused. What happens when actually an Assist ant Minister is confused? Do we take his replies seriously?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I see hon. Maiyani does not want to respond to that.</Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I cannot take that sitting down. I am neither confused, nor arrogant.<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let us now go on to the Question by Private Notice QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE Disappearance of Mr. Mwinjaa</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Bw.

DEPUTY SPEAKER: Nobody from the Office of the President? Let us move on then.</Newspeech>(Question deferred)POINTS OF ORDER<Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I rise for the second time this week to complain about misreporting by the Press.We were discussing the state of roads in Makueni area yesterday. I do not wantto pick a quarrel with anybody, but the Daily Nation reporter quoted me as follows:-"Moving the Motion on the tarmacking of the Kwale Lungalunga Road..."I did not do that. I did not stand here to move a Motion on the tarmacking of the Kwale-Lungalunga Road. It is a small thing, but I see no reason I should be quoted to have done that.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. From the reports of our contributions in the House yesterday, I am quoted by the Daily Nation, on page four, as having listed and mentioned places where rioting took place, including Eldoret and Kisumu. In my contribution, I made no mention of names of any places. It is, therefore, misleading to have the names of these places associated with what I said in the House. In fact, I recall congratulating the people of Uasin Gishu District, and Eldoret in particular, for not rioting. It would be an abuse of the trust to those people for them to read that I mentioned rioting in that area. With due respect, I would like this impression to be corrected. I was in Eldoret on Saturday, Sunday and Monday and travelled through Burnt Forest and a few other places and observed no signs of rioting, destruction of property of hooliganism. This is misleading information and would like to request the Press to be careful in their coverage of the deliberations in this House, because such misreporting gives a wrong picture of what goes on here.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Omido): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I am rising in support of the point that has just been raised by hon. Misoi. What is our scope of action against the kind of misreporting hon. Misoi has just referred to? These reports go far and wide, even outside the country, and the impression that is created, based on the local reports, has tremendous and serious effects with other countries. What remedy do we have? Can the House not invoke the rules of this House, as far as fair reporting is concerned, especially in view of the situation the country is in?I believe there is no possibility of most of those who read the misleading report to also see the correction that hon. Misoi is seeking.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is your problem. Do you want to raise yet another point of order?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: Yes, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: All right, but make sure it is a different  one.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, my point of order is that last week I asked a Question here concerning the selection of a national sports team that will represent Kenya in an international youth meeting, and the Minister for Culture and Social Services promised this House to bring an answer today, but he does not seem to be here. The reason I am standing here is that we read in the newspapers that, as he indicated, the selection has been reviewed and that there will be another selection at the end of the week.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, my concern is that even when the selection was done at the; end of last month, we had only one province, that is, Rift Valley, represented. Despite the fact that we: want a winning team for Kenya, only primary schools from that province were represented. The Minister did indicate that the whole thing would be reviewed and other provinces would be represented, but, looking at the newspapers, they say that the selection will be on this and the other</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON.

So, Mr. Chepkok, will you stand properly guided?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANGOLI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. My point of order is with regard to Mr. Mandela's visit to this country. When he spoke,the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting did not run his speech live, and we know that when Mr. Bonke was here he was given a whole three days. I am wondering whether the Ministry of Information is serving this nation or it is serving other masters. I am saying this because they do not want to do matters concerning this nation. For example, the other day, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Co—operation was saying, the other day when news was being read there was some talking going on in Luo. It is important that the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting should tell us why they cut this speech of our great son. Nobody saw him when he was speaking; it just came like a video. Is that what the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting is supposed to do? They should be patriotic.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Mang'oli, I think you have already made your point.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Mang'oli has just said.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mrs Ogot): Sir, is it in order for hon. Mang'oli, who is a "medium senior" Member of this House to refer to conversations which did run into the Kenya Broadcasting Corporatio studios as "Luo talk?" Is that not promoting tribalism?</Newspeech>(Laughter)<Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was only quoting what the hon. Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Co—operation said here. If the "Iron Lady", who is a great daughter of this nation, feels disturbed that I am promoting tribalism, let me assure her that I am not doing so. Even when we say that Kikuyus are doing this and that, that is not promoting tribalism. I said it with a light touch.Again, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to inform the Gracious Lady that I am not a "medium senior" Member of this House. I am here by virtue of rights, other than medium. If the hon. Assistant Minister wants to call me by my rights here, she should give me all the rights. I am not medium. I am either full or minus, and I am sure that she knows that I am full here.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Members, we must move on now Next Order.</Newspeech>COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY(Order for Committee read being the 6th Alloted Day)<Header>MOTION</Header>THAT, Mr. Speaker do now leave the Chair (the Minister for Environment and Natural Resources on 18.7.90)Resumption of Debate interrupted on 18.7.90)<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Who was on the' Floor last time?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, when the House rose yesterday, I was at the point of pointing out that looking at the Development Estimates of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, with particular reference to Head 767, Sub-head 910 Bungoma I find that the money allocated for Bungoma under Forestry and Plantation Development totals to K£270,527. Out of that collosal amount of money, only K£4,500 is indicated to be for development. The rest appears to be for recurrent expenditure through maintenance of vehicles, buildings and so on. So, I would like the Ministry to have more allocations for development of their projects instead of having all the money going to recurrent expenditure. Secondly, Sir, under Head 678 Local Afforestation Scheme Bungoma District has not been given anything. When the Minister stands up to reply, I would like him to indicate why Bungoma is not catered for in that scheme. Probably, the Minister may even take time to tell us the difference between local afforestation schemes, rural afforestation extension schemes and forestry development and plantation because these are all vital Sub-heads in the Ministry. Bungoma District, which is fairly potential, should have been catered forMr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would now like to touch, on Rural Afforestation Extension Schemes under Head 679. This is on page 753 of the Estimates "book. I notice that during the 1990/91 Financial Year a net sum of K£151,109 has been allocated to Bungoma District. This is much less than what was allocated last year. This because last year's allocation was K£292,252. I would like to be given an explanation for this because the cost of things keeps on going up all the time. So, there must be adequate explanation for this because some services are going to suffer in Bungoma. You will also find that only K£2,215 has been set aside for development. So, that kind of disparity should be looked into particularly when the Minister stands to reply.While on this Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in my constituency I have an afforestation station at Sang'alo. The Sang'alo Afforestation Station is dying. This is because as I speak here maintenance there is very low. This station lacks vital equipment. It lacks things like wheelbarrows and so on. We need an explanation for this becauseSang'alo Afforestation Station is a very major afforestation scheme which was started a long time ago and which should be improved instead of being left in a state of disuse. This is because at the moment we are not getting many tree seedlings from that afforestation station. I had also made an appeal to the Ministry that Since we have so many afforestation schemes all over the country, Some are run by women groups; others by Kanu and there are others known as leadership tree nurseries. The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources should not abandon its role of co-ordinating these afforestation programmes.With those few remarks, I support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. 0MIN0: Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Ministry, of Environment and Natural Resources seems to me to be suffering from many £ defects. First of all if you look at their Development Estimates, you will find that about 50 per cent of that allocation is for personal emolument's. That has the effect of distorting what monies they have available for actual development work. If you look the printed Estimates carefully, you will find that about 60 per cent of all the allocations in various Ministries is for personal emoluments. This, for technical Ministries, has a very serious repercussion. It means that the technical work and the equipment that they require and all the research they must undertake suffers. I hope that this will be rectified in the near future so that the Ministries are allocated more money for actual technical than for merely paying wages and salaries.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if you look at the Ministry's Estimates you will find that there is a whole lot of forestry projects going on at the same time. A tree is a tree by whatever name you call it. So, I do not see any reason why you have under the same Ministry, one department, Rural Afforestation Programme; Arid and Semi-Arid Lands Afforestation Programme; Rural Afforestation Extension Programme and Local Afforestation Programme. These are all being undertaken by different officers. This leads to duplication of efforts and therefore inefficiency.We now have the Ministry of Reclamation and Development of Arid, Semi-Arid and Wastelands in this country. The projects that are being undertaken by the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, naturally, should now go to that Ministry because it will be given more attention than is being done at the moment. Now, it seems to me that all these projects are the way they are becauseof donor financing. But surely if in fact we as a country are contributing more than 60 per cent of our funds requirements, then we should dictate what we want done or how we want our Ministries, departments and projects organized. I trust that the Minister will take this to heart and if possible and feasible that small project within his Ministry should be transferred to the appropriate and correct Ministry.Sir, it seems to me also that there is a lot of overlap of projects where Ministries are doing what other Ministries are also doing. I think there is need for more co-ordination and consultation. If it is afforestation let one Ministry be responsible for it and we can take them to task her in this House.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, desertification is really the removal of vegetation cover from the land. I see very little money voted for combating desertification. We must start a major progranme to extend the frontiers of our agriculture; in other words move back the desert. The Ministry needs to be heavily involved in the process of regenerating or providing new vegetation cover on the arid and semi-arid lands.I see that they also have what they call Extension Officer I have yet to see one come to my little farm to tell me how to plant trees or which trees I should plant. If these officers are meant to go to the countryside to advise farmers, they must be seen to be doing so. There is also a lot of concern being expressed both here and elsewhere on environmental degradation. But we see very little action being taken. If you look at the Estimates of the Ministry, you will find that the money provided for the national Environment Secretariat is so little that it might as well not exist. We cannot be concerned about environmental degradation if we do not do anything about it. We can only be doing something about it if we provide money with which the Ministry can combat environmental degradation. But more important, this Ministry must have sufficient funds to undertake research. We talk about the biosphere and the ozone layer and acid rain but I am store that this Ministry cannot tell us what level of acid rain we have in this country and they will not be able to do so untill and unless we enable them to have the capacity to carry out research in order to measure acid rain.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, minerals can change the economy of this country if they were discovered in sufficient quantities. But we shall never discover them unless we invest heavily in mineral exploration. The Ministry has field officers who, for lack of equipment and facilities, really do not do justice to what this country expects of them. I would therefore like to suggest that the Ministry asks for more funds so that those geologists in the countryside and those mining engineers in the countryside can go out and help wananchi in mapping out mineral potential areas and in designing adequate and appropriate mining techniques for the minerals that exist in this country.I think this Ministry ought also to take full responsibility for the exploration of all mineral resources in this country. Their exploitation is a different matter. For example, geothermal energy is a mineral resource. The Ministry should be repository of all information on mineral exploration in this country. If exploitation of minerals is found to be more appropriate in another Ministry let that be so. But the exploration and collection of all data on all minerals in this country should have only one repository and I suggest that it should be the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this country is undergoing crisis in the provision of fuel wood. There is too much attention being paid to oil but manu kenyans do not even know oil expect when they travel in a matatu or in a bus.  However, for their daily requirements, must provide a new method of giving them fuel. We had in this country a conference that dealt with new and renewable sources of energy and this to draw our attention to so that do not remove all our forestry cover because of charcoal. In fact, wananchi ought to be encouraged and assisted in producing fuel-wood around their home areas so that they do not destroy our forests.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is no question in our minds that this Ministry is grossly underfunded and therefore, I would like to appeal to the Minister to consult closely with his colleagues in Treasury to make sure that during the coning estimates, he gets sufficient money to enable the Ministry to deliver the goods which wanachi expects of them. I would also suggest that the Ministry now looks for ways and means of relaxing on their licensing procedures so that wanachi can obtain licences to explore minerals easily.  After all I do not think were any Licencing Procedures for these people who discovered gold in Kakamega or in Macalder or in America and Australia with those few remains, I beg to Support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. MALANDI:  Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, sir, for giving me this opportunity to support this Motion on the Vote od the Ministry of Development and Natural Resources. Yesterday when the Minister was moving this Vote, he stated that 56 per cent of the small-scale Miners are indigenous. That statement is rather incorrect because we could be having 96 per cent of Miniers being Indigenous, the bulk of the wealth of our minerals is hold by the "quiet" four per cent of the foreign miners. Therefore instead of the Ministry feeling proud just because 96 per cent of the miners are Indigenous, they should make sure that this 96 per cent is benefiting from our Minerals. Since the Indigenous miners are the biggest prospectus, then they should be given the opportunity to won the mines and to benefit from their prosecution.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister also said that the Ministry is in a process of revising the Mining Act as on incestive to Kenyans miners. However, this is not the first time that the Minister has promised to amend the Mining Act. He has promised this House several times in the past that he is going to bring this amendment, but so far nothing has been done about it. I have an article from the Daily Nation here with me of October, 1985 which talks about the Commissioner of Mines having, a tour in Kisumu and during that tour, he premised that a Bill would be brought to Parliament to protect indigenous miners. However, since that time this Bill has not been brought here Therefore, when the Minister comes hers again and promises the House that this. Bill will he table here soon, I think he is misleading the whole country. If he has been making the same promise over the years, can he assure us this time that the Bill is, in fact, going to be Tabled here? Therefore, I would like to make a special request to the Minister to make sure that no more promises are going to be made regarding the amendment of this particular Act. We should make statements which are factual and not statements which later turn out not to be true. This is a challenge to the new Minister and one of his big take is to overhaul the whole Act. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, within mining legislations, there are four trading in other precious minerals and so on. All these Acts have now become obselet and, they need to be malgamated into one now thing. Act and therefore, we should not be told by the Minister that he is intending to Table those amendments is the House soon, We would like the Minister to amend these Acts immediately so going to be of great assistance to Kenya's today.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I remember that there was a draft Bill for the registration of geologists in this country. This draft Bill was completed in 1986 and it is unfortunate that this draft bill is still lying in the Ministry. There must be some law by somewhere within the Ministry or somebody somewhere is consealing this document. Sometimes they just apply delaying tactics by saying, "oh, we are waiting for a cabinet paper to be prepared".	How can a Cabinet Paper take four years to be prepared unless the authorities in the Ministry have no interest in getting this matter off the way. Somebody should be able to is tell us what is happening because a Cabinet Paper cannot  take four years to prepare. In fact, I understand that the United Nations have offered to assist us in getting this Act revised but the proposal is still lying in the Ministry unattended to.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENIVRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. K'Ombudo): On a point of order, Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the hon. Member really in order to insinuate bad motives on part of officers of the Ministry when he says that we are hiding the draft bill somewhere. This is not a fact at all. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. MALEBE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we all appreciate the fact the ther K'Ombudo is a new Assistant Minister and therefore, he needs to know the facts before he can challenge what I am saying. It is true that the draft of the Mining Amendment. Act has been kept somewhere without the Ministry, and this is quite evident. There was a promise made way back in 1985 that this Act was going to be amended and therefore, I think hon. M'Ombudo should be better informed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES(Mr. M'Ombudo): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the revision of the Mining Act is going to be of any to anybody, it needs to be studied very careful end the Ministry is tailing time to study the Act with a view to amending it accordingly and I think it is suite justified to do so.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, sir, I think I had better continue with what  was trying to say. We have the sessional paper No.1 of 1986 whose objective was to earn foreign exchange for this country. At she same time  the Development of 1938/93, is rather quiet on the mining policy which therefore means that this policy is not spelt out at all. Therefore, I think the ministry should liaise with the Ministry of Planning end national Development with a view to coming out with a tangile policy with regard to the development of mineral in this country. I am saying this because as things stand now there is now way in which we are going to develop in the mining industry because the Act governing mining in this country is in itself colonial.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am saying this because it was way hack in 1962 when they amended the Act by removing the word "Governor" and replaced it with the words, "Commissioner of Mines''. Since then, there have never been other amendments to this Act, and therefore, the whole Act is colonial and this is why we cannot have a tangle policy in mining in this country.Since then there has never been any major amendment to the Act other than small amendments here and there. So, the whole thing is really colonial and that is why we cannot have any tangible development plans. Since then we have never opened any new mines. The only mine that opened the other day at Kilangoni for lead and zine, but it was closed down a year later. Two weeks ago when I asked a Question here, we found that minerals can fetch about K£235 million. So, when the Minister said yesterday that mineral industry is risky, expensive and long-terra, these adjust words to try to get the potential investor not to invest. So, I think there are lot of things to be done in that Ministry for the mining industry to be realised.Sir, I would also propose that we should have a mining advisory centre established in the country which would be able to advise small-scale miners on markets, investigation of minerals,  regulations, restructuring the small-scale miners into co-peratives and associations and so on. Also, in the licensing of mining, it should not be a monopolistic. We should have a legal committee in the Act for the licensing of mining.Thank you, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SALAT: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to contribute to this very important Vote of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources.Sir, first of all, I would like to congratulate His Excellency the President for his environmental concern in this country and the world at large. Then we talk of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, We are talking of a Ministry that is suppose to care for the lives and well-being of Kenyans. It is supposed to tell us under which environment we are supposed to work.When we talk of increasing food production, the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources is supposed to tell us under which climate this food production can be sustained. It is also supposed to tell the Kenyans what kind of life they are supposed  to lead with, increasing environmental circumstances and how best they can be able to counter attack threats like earthquakes when they are supposed to come and how they are supposed to approach them.Sir, the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, I believe, can change the climate of this country and can also change the weather of a particular region if it completely fulfill its obligations. Planting of trees has been associated with the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, and that is an area which the Ministry has put a lot of effort in trying to educate the wanachi on the need to plant more trees because planting of trees it will plays a very big role in changing the climate or weather of a particular region. But they need to extend the education into the rural areas so that wananchi in those areas can also know the benefits of planting tress. This must be emphasised because wananchi from rural areas do not know what benefits they get from trees. But the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, through its Forestry Department, must post technical staff to those areas so that wananchi are well-educated on the need for planting more trees.Sir, as the case is now, the divisions are manned by unskilled staff; staff who do not know when to weed a tree, what age it is supposed to be proved, what kind of trees to be planted in what region and so on. This has made many areas not to have enough trees.Sir, research is another element where the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources ought to put a lot of emphasis on. This is simply because you will find that many of the medicine that we use have been extracted from indigenous trees. I am sure that the many indigenous trees that we have in this country have a lot of potential in curing a lot of diseases, including even the dreaded AIDS! I think the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources in liaison with other Ministries like the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology, should be able to put a lot of effort and also a lot of funding in the Department of Research. This is because the herbalists are the people who know what benefits we get from the trees. If the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources would have been keen enough to know what type of indigenous trees grow in a particular region and their benefits. Then we can be able to save this country a lot of foreign exchange in terms of medicine that we import which would otherwise, have been manufactured in this country using extracts from indigenous trees.A lot of chemicals, Sir, can also be obtained from these trees. For instance, the Colgate we use in our toothpaste. There is a tree that grows in my area which is as good as Colgate. If the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources could liaise with the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology, and take the trouble of trying to discover the particular trees that grow in a particular region, then we would be able to save this country a lot of foreign	exchange.Sir, the mining industry or minerals is another area where many hon. Members have expressed their concern. Some of these hon. Members are also geologists and know very well the Mining Act and what the Ministry is doing about it. We must be able to emphasise on this because I believe that this country has a lot of potential in minerals. There are a lot of minerals under our soil and if the Ministry would inject a lot of money into this area, we would be able to extract a let of minerals from underground to be able to sustain the economy of this country.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKAU: Thank you very much, Sir.As the previous speaker has said, the Ministry of Environment and natural Resources is very lucky in that the Head of State of this country, His Excellency the President,has been very concerned about environment. In fact, he has been given a lot of awards because of his environmental and conservation concerns.Sir, when we talk about the environment, this is the lathing today in the world. I say so because whether we are talking of production of food, industrialisation and so on, the environment is main objective. There is no meeting today, whether discussing about economic development and so on that discussion on environment is left out. There is no meeting of developed or developing countries whereby the environment issue is not considered. I say so because, like now, everybody is being warned by environmentalists that the effects that are taking place today in the world the global warming are as a result of human activities. This is a warning to the mankind that any interference with environment can wipe out the nation.Interference with the environment can be considered to be arose than AIDS.That is why I said that this is a very important because it caters for the future of this country as far as environmental matters are concerned. Allow, me Sir, to comment on one area of concern. Because developing countries are crazy looking for investment and or foreign exchange, there is a danger of dumping toxic waste in those countries. This is a crucial area in which the Ministry and the National Environment Secretariat (NES} should be concerned. We are in a similar situation today as that of the 17th, 15th and 19th centuries when the present developed countries I used to ply the coastline looking for slaves and looting minerals.Many people have expressed concern and have named various people that are playing the African coastlines looking for dumping places for toxic waste. These people have been referred to as "merchants of death". This is because when toxic waste is dumned on our coastline, it means death to the African People.Developed countries have the so called Green Peace Government" who are concerned with the environment. Because they have made sure that toxic waste is not dumned in their countries and that factories which will affect their environment do not cake off the ground, they have gone as far as winning in the election. They have also gone as far as plying their seas to make sure that on dumping takes place.Since industrialists cannot set an industries that will affect the environment in developed countries, they have turned to African coastline. While we talk about political interference in developing countries, the worst of all is the interference of the environment. This is extremely dangerous.I would like to urge the Ministry and NES to be more concerned about our environment. Time has come when a Bill should be enacted in this House so that those who dump waste on our coastline face penalities. We are very grateful that recently the Kenya Ports Authority shotted a ship that was plying the African coastline looking for a dumping place for toxic waste. What we should know is that these people are very</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>Mr. KILIKU: Is anybody timing Mr. Makau?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>Mr. MAKAU: Hon. KiliKu, you are not the time-keeper.These people are very</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Sir. It is out of order for an hon. Member to address another hon. Member directly without going through the Chair. I was alerting the Clerk at the Table about time because we also want to speak.</Newspeech>	</Newspeech>Mr. MAKAU: Congratulations for your recent graduation, Mr. Kiliku. Hon. Kiliku is not the time-keeper and he should, not be pointing that time should be kept.I was saying that those people are prepared to say anything to be given a dumping place for toxic waste. That is why I am. appealing to the developed countries to consider dangers associated with dumping toxic waste. We know what there are rules and and penalities for such offences but we do not have detorrent measures with regard to dumping. For examplesomebody can simply dump toxic waste at the Port of Mombasa because he knows can pay any fine that may be imposed on him.We passed a Bill brought by the Ministry of Labour which had very good legislation on this but the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources should be more concerned in this area. The Ministry should also note that earthquakes have become so frequent in the world. For example, a powerful earthquakestruck Iran and the Phillipines. Recently, tremors hit Mombasa and the then Minister for this Ministry, Mr. Myagah, gave us an explanation in that respect. This Ministry should have trained seismologists to deal with such quakes and not just somebody who has been lecturing in geology because he will not have keep knowledge of the earthy structure. For example, we were not told the actual origin of the tremors which hit Mombasa so that the people can be made aware of the soft spot where earthquakes could strike. It was difficult for us to know the measurement of that earthquake on the ritcher scale. Me need qualified people to tell us that instead of people mumbling around and living press conferences on all sorts of things which might not help us in the wake of earthquakes.People should not just go round holding press conferences and telling people to  go under the beds when there is an earthquake. When there is an earthquake, thepeople in this Ministry should come out and tell us exactly what the situation is.Finally, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to join my colleagues in saying that mineral prospecting in this country should be improved and afforestation schemes encouraged. This country needs to develop its timber industry because, as we prepare for the Export Processing Zone, one of the most important products that should be produced in the Zone is furniture. Kenya is well known for furniture production. Countries that have established export processing zones, such as Togo, Cameroon and others, have benefited from the export of furniture. So, the timber industry in this country should be developed through aggressive afforestation schemes.Books are very expensive in this country because of the cost of paper from Webuye. If we encourage afforestation and have enough wood pulp, we will be able to establish many paper mills and the cost of books will go down. The cost of paper accounts for 60 per cent of the cost of books. So, the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources would, by encouraging afforestation schemes be able to make the country self—sufficient in the provision of wood pulp.With these few points, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Nyagah): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to make my contribution to this very interesting and useful debate on matters of environment and natural resources. First of all, I must declare my interest in that I have just moved out of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources. It is only fitting that I should take this opportunity to thank all those people with whom I have worked, including the Ministry's officers and my political colleagues both present and past. They gave me very wonderful co-operation, and I thank them all. I wish the new Minister all the best and recommend to him that he has a good team to work with in the interest of this country.Through this House, I wish to tell the country that the money the Minister, is asking for is not much nor excessive. In fact, he could do with double the amount he is asking for. This is a first hand evidence that I am giving to this House because I know the amount of work that goes on in the Ministry and the restrictions that exist as a result of not having enough funds. I will not say very much, but I would like to add that I am very encouraged to see how much interest people take in matters of forestry.In the field of agro—forestry, people have already taken it upon themselves to make the country green because they know that they need to do this in the interest of natural forests which produce enough wood for fuel and timber. If people get enough wood from the trees they have in their farms, natural forests will left unmolested in the interest of conservation of water and other environmental matters that pertain to forests.Time has come when we must also look at the end of trees that we continue to call "exotic". I think we should do what has been done by the Ministries of Agriculture and Livestock Development. The officers in these Ministries have looked at the cattle that were exotic at one time and decided that the Freisian, the Guernsey, the Jersy and so on are no longer exotic; they are now Kenyan. In the same way, trees have now come to a point where we must not consider them to be exotic any more. So, when we plant them, they should not be branded "exotic".The other point that I would like to make relates to our wealth that lies untapped or is just beginning to be tapped. This wealth lies underground and is taken care of by Department of Mines and Geology. A lot of good work is being done in the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources. Just before I left the Ministry, I was very encouraged to see the relationship that is being consolidated between the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife and the Department of Mines and Geology thereby strengthening the co-existence of miners and the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife. I hope that my colleagues whom I left in the Ministry will help the new Minister to see this point and continueto work with the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife, to make sure, that our wildlife is preserved and the wealth underground is exploited.I know that there were laws that were being revised in both the Departments of Mines and Geology, and Forestry. I am sure that when these revised laws are published, this House will give them the necessary treatment so that we may be up to date in the laws that govern these departments.Let me now talk about the environment.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Since hon. Nyagah was the Minister for Environment and Natural Resources in the immediate past, could he inform us as to how far the laws he has mentioned gone? I am sure that he is more versed in them than the new Minister.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Is that a point of order or a question?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Nyagah): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not want to talk very much about that issue, but all I know is that the said amendments to the laws are almost in the pipeline now.Talking about the environment, Kenya is famous for its attitude and activities in respect of the environment. Our President has played such a big role in this matter that Kenya has been internationally recognised as a leading country in the conservation of the environment. My appeal here is that we should all try to keep our Kenya beautiful. We should keep it green and stop the desert from ever getting to us as we keep our soils where they were meant to be. We should also keep our air and water clean and unpolluted. If we do this, we will leave longer on this part of the planet that God has given us. This is a responsibility of all of us, and if we do not carry it out well, we will be doing ourselves injustice of the first order, which will result into a natural disaster for this country. If we do not take care of our environment, this will be worse than the political disaster that we, who talk carelessly either from the pulpit of the Church, the political platform, the farm or the streets, engage ourselves in. We should watch out for disasters that could come from natural calamities of being careless to the environment. We shouldalso take care of the immediate political disasters that could come out of our  being careless with our words and our attitude towards one another.The Ministries that are related to natural resources, such as mines, forestry and the environment, are Agriculture, Reclamation and Development of Arid, Semi-Arid and Wastelands, Water Development, Regional Development, Energy, Industry, Local Government and Public Works. The Ministry of Public Works, which builds roads, must make use of the funds it has to deal with the environmental aspects that it has. This Ministry does not have enough funds to enable it to keep our city clean or stop industries from polluting our water and air.The Ministry does not have enough money to enable to preach about soil conservation. They need people from the Ministries of Agriculture and Reclamation and Development of Arid, Semi-arid and Wastelands to help them. I promised that I would not say much but I must in say that I have been very happy in this Ministry. I would like to congratulate the people I left in the Ministry, the new people in the Ministry and all Kenyans for role they have played in enviromental conservation Kenyans have become very much aware of the need to keep Our environment at its best.With those words, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Ahsante sana Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda kwa Kunipa nafasi hii ili niongee ,juu ya idliini ya kutoa pesa. Tatzo letu ni kwamba tunaidhinisha matumisi ya pesa kila mwaka na pesa hizo zinatumiwa vibaya kila zwaka. Tunaulizwa Lcuidhinisha matumisi ya pesa lakini hatuulizwi Kuwaadhibu wale wanaotumia vibaya pesa za uzrza.Jambo lirgine ni kwamba sijui aina ya uchunguci unaofanywa ma wizara hii ya Mazingara na Maliasili. Hii ni kwa snbabu mwaka jana mafuta yaunwagika katika Bahari Indi Karibu na Makuga Causeway na kuyachafua maji, miti yote ikauka na samakd wakafa, lakini hadi sasa wizara hailijui jambo hili. Sijui wizara inavyopokea habari kutoka katika wilaya. Kata Waziri Nsadizi, zhe said Hemed anatoka Mombasa halijui hili ingawa matoka Mombasa na hupita kutika sehemu hii. Tungependa Wizara ituambie itavyo fanaya ili kuondsa uchafu huo. Wakati huu Halnwshauri ya Myaza ya kenya, ambayo iko karibu na eneo hili, imeanza kufanya kazi tena. Sasa wanunuzi wa nyama kutoka nje wakiyaona maji hayo hawazinui nayama sa kalzashawi hii.

Naibu Spika wa Muda, uchumi wetu ni lazima uwe mikononi mwa wananchi. Kila mara tunasema tunataka "liberation", lakini "liberation" inayofaa kwetu sasa ni ya kiuchurai. Ikiwa hatutakuwa na senti hatutaendelea vizuri. Hakuna nchi yoyote inayoweza kuendelea kiuchumi bila kuuweka uchumi huo mikononi mwa wale wazalendo wa nchi hiyo. This is why I insist that we want economic liberation. Nilisema wenye vibanda vyao vya biashara huko Mombasa wasifukuzwe, lakini inasemekana kuwa wanaleta uchafu mjini. Sasa, kwa sababu hakuna nafasi za kutosha za kazi, wananchi hawa wote watakwenda wapi? Hata ndipo juzi tulipowaona wahuni wakifanya matata mijini. Hii ni kwa sababu ni vijana ambao hawana kazi, lakini tukiwa na pesa za kutosha wanaweza kuajiriwa na Wizara kama hii na uchumi ukiendelea mbele, basi nafasi zaidi za kazi zita- patikana. Lakini, bila kuwa na pesa za kutosha, nafasi hizi za kazi zitapatikanaje?Kwa hayo machache, naunga mkono.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. TERER: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to make my contribution on this very important Vote. This is a very important Ministry and I think due care should be taken to allocate it with enough funds. As previous speakers have said, there is a lot of disparity between the Personal Emoluments and Development items. If 60 per cent of the money goes to personal emoluments of employees, and only 40 per cent goes to development expenditure, that is a very big disparity.We know that His Excellency the President is a great environmentalist who is recognised all over the world. We should, as leaders, emulate him in all our activities pertaining to the environment. I think this Ministry has a lot to do. As we have heard from the Minister, this Ministry's operations touch on all other Ministries. It should be able to educate the people.Sir, I think it was only yesterday when I heard that there are officers of this Ministry who have been posted to the divisional levels, but I have yet to see them in my constituency; if they are there, then they are some of these people who are earning salaries without rendering the required services.If these officers are really in the divisions, then they should be asked to start working. They should be holding seminars and meeting wananchi, teachers and students to enlighten them on the necessity of preserving the environment.We know that indigenous trees are very valuable in the eco-system, as they actually keep our rivers flowing. However, due care is not being taken to increase their growth. Some large-scale tea farms have actually planted exotic trees for use in their manufacturing of tea. These trees have affected the volume of water that flows in our rivers. In fact, some of the tea farms have actually planted the exotic trees in water catchment areas. Maybe the Ministry does not have a law to deal with this kind of thing and, unless they do something about it, rivers will dry up and we shall all suffer.We would like this Ministry to establish tree nurseries in all our schools, especially in the rural areas, where it is possible to do so and eventually distribute the seedlings to farmers. We would like to see extension officers visiting farmers and assisting them. Although we have many small-scale farms, trees can be grown and integrated in those farms; there may be trees suitable for growth among some crops, without affecting them.Sir, I also believe there should be a programme of phasing out exotic trees and replacing them with indigenous trees so that, as I had said, we can preserve water and so that our rivers do not dry up. The Ministry has reached a point when they should embark on training researchers. We have had to depend too much on expatriate researchers, who do not have this country at heart.Sir, I know that we have, deposits of gold, silver, ruby and iron ore in our country, but we are normally told that we are very poor, where the mineral resources are concerned. What we require are dedicated citizens to undertake the necessary research. However, before they embark on the research, we have to train them so that they can carry out this exercise professionally.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the Development Vote, I understand that only 4 per cent has been allocated to mining, while 96 per cent has been allocated to the forestry activities. This may actually lend credence to the notion that this country is poor in mineral resources, which is not a true statement. We would like the Ministry to spend more money on research on minerals. I think we have a lot of minerals in this country on which no prospecting has been done, since we are normally told that this country does not have any precious minerals. This may even explain why so little money is allocated towards mining activities.I understand that at a place called Ikutha in Kitui and Marimanti in Meru where there is iron ore. Probably, no researcher has gone to those places to establish the truth of the claims. I think the problem may be in the licensing of the indigenous prospectors and something should be done about that. If we are going to depend on the advice of the foreigners, then those foreigners may not allow us to prospect for these minerals.When it comes to the earth tremors, the Ministry should educate the public on the causes and effects of these occurrences. As the previous speaker said, it is very worrying sometimes because the tremors normally cause a lot of camage to property and even causing injuries and death to our people. We, therefore, would like to plead with the Ministry to take a keen interest in the tracing of the causes of these tremors. I do not know whether it is currently possible to have a forecast of these tremors and, perhaps, this is something that calls for a lot of research and collaboration between the Ministry and other international bodies.Let me also take this opportunity to touch on the recent riots and disturbances in the country. I would like to congratulate His Excellency the President for the quick action he took to quell the disturbances. As hon. Members of Parliament, I think it is upon us to go to our respective constituencies and find out the particular areas that were affected in order to determine the causes. One hon. Member mentioned here that the hooligans did not come from his constituency.So, I think it would only be proper for hon. Members to go back to their constituencies and find out who actually sponsored the hooligans. We all know that most of the hooligans were young people and, therefore, they must have been sponsored.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like to take this opportunity to commend our security forces for quelling those disturbances which, otherwise, would have cause a lot of havoc, dispair and widespread lawlessness. The time has come when the Government should take security quite seriously. I think we should step us security surveilance. We should even involve all members of the public in matters pertaining to security so that they are security conscious All wananchi should know that once lawlessness comes in we have nothing to do except to suffer economically.Sir, as I have said, I think it is actually necessary for us, as hon. Members, to hold them meetings I have mentioned and find out from the people what really happened. If we hold barazas and hon. Members only talk to the people without giving them a chance to ask them question and contribute, we may not know much. So, as far as security matters are concerned, the time has come when we have to sit down with the people at sub-locational levels and discuss. The 20 people who are representatives of a sub-location are the ones who should be sitting together and find out why certain things happen.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Mwaka uliopita Wizara hii ili.uwaga mawe ya kujengea kana 10,000 na hadi leo haijajenga kitu ilichokuwa ikinuia kujenga. Kwa sasa mawe hayo yanenyeshewa na yangali hapo tu.

Je, kuna haja gani kununua simenti na kuiweka kwa stoo kwa miaka niwili hadi inakuwa mawe?Bw. Naibu Spika, hivi majuzi wenye viwanda vya .nbao walianbiwa kwauba wakikata aiiti katika niisitu ni lazina wapande rningine. Nataka Wizara hii iwaambie wemye kiwanda cha makaratasi cha Webuye kwauba wakikata miti wapande .ningine. Badala ya kiwanda hicho kupatiwa yale' .nashamba a-nbayo wanepatiwa katika Wilaya ya Kitle na Uasin Gishu, wangepewa ardhi kule juu milimani ili watu waweze kuDanda chakula katika mashanba hayo kwa sababu hatujajitosheleza kwa chakula katika nchi hii. Wenye kiwanda hicho yafaa wafanye kazi ili wajue kwauba wakati wanapotengeneza makaratasi wamefanya kazi. Mashamba yote ambayo yamepatiwa kiwanda cha Webuye yako katika wilaya ya aihe. Chesire ambaye ni mtu wa jangwani. Kama hajapanda miti kwake ni ajabu sana. Katika Kitale pia kuna shamba lingine kubwa sana nmbalo badala ya kupatiwa Webuye Paper Mill lingepatiwa wananchi.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, nataka kuianibia Wizara hii iwahimize wakulima wapande miti kwa wingi. Kwa miano, ukitembe'a katika Wilaya ya Uasin Gishu utaona kwamba kila mahali ni kama jangwa kwa sababu hakun miti. Yafaa watu wa wilaya hiyo waambiwe kwamba kama mtu ana ekari tano za ardhi, apande miti katika ekari tatu. Kama mhe. Chesire ana shamba la ekari 1,000 anastahili kuambiwa apande' miti ekari 100 ili kuwe na msitu. Hilo ni jambo moja ambalo Wizara yafaa kufanya katika Wilaya ya Uasin Gishu. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu katika wilaya hiyo unaweza kuona mtu akiwa maili 20 akitembe'a.Nataka pia kuieleza Wizara kwamba misitu ni mahali pa maji na wanafaa kupanda miti ya kienyeji huko. Pia, nataka watengeneza mabwawa ya maji ndani ya misitu ili watu waweze kupata maji kule. Kukiwa na mabwawa ya maji katika misitu, watu walio kando wanaweza kufaidika sana.Jambo lingine ambalo ningetaka kusema ni kwamba kuna watu ambao wana ploti zao binafsi kati kati ya misitu. Yafaa watu hao wapewe mashamba mahali pengine ili hizo ploti zao zipandwe miti ndipo misitu iwe kamilifu.</Newspeech>Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, hivi ni vyanzo vya mito na ni lazima vitunzwe. Maji mengi hupatikana katika milima ya Cherangani. Hata hivyo utaona kwamba kuna watu ambao wameenda kuishi ndani ya hiyo misitu. Yafaa watu hao wahamishwe na kuonyeshwa mahali pengine pa kuishi. Si vizuri watu kuishi ndani ya misitu na kuharibu vyanzo vya maji. Kwa hivyo mini, nawaombe nyinyi mhakikishe kwamba watu wametafuti?ra, mahali pa kuishi ili misitu ikae bila watu.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri) : unamwambia nani sasa?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Ni lazima Wizara iyaangalie mambo haya kwa ravkirn sana ili misitu yetu isiharibiwe. Ni lazima misitu yetu ifungwe kabisa. Pia inajulikana kwamba kuna madini ya aina mbali mbali katika nchi hii. Ingefaa watafiti wapewe pesa za kutosha ili waweze kufanya utafiti wa kutosha juu ya uwezekano wa kuyachimba hayo madini. Lakini utaona k.vamba wizara haifanyi cho chote kuhusu mambo haya; hawa.jafanya cho chote. Kiasi hiki cha K3hs.7,489,000 hazitoshi kamwe. Hiki ni kiasi kigodo sana cha pesa. Ingefaa wizara hii ipewe pesa saidi ili iweze kutekeleza miradi mbali mbali ya maendeleo.Kwa hayo machache, naunga mkono.</Newspeech><NEwspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Hang'ole) : Ninakushukuru Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, lava kunipa nafasi ili nami niungane na wenzangu katika kuiunga mkono Hoja hii. Kwanza kabisa ningependa kuishukuru Wizara hii kwa kazi nzuri .ambayo inawafanyia wananchi watukufu wa Kenya kwa kuona kwamba miti inapandw katika karibu kila sehemu ya nchi hii yetu. Pia Wizara hii inahakikisha kwamba miti inayopandwa inatunzwa vyenia kabisa. Vile vile ningependa kumshukuru Mtukufu Rais kwa kuwa katika insitari vva mbele katika shughuli za upanzi wa miti hapa nchini. Yeye ame tuonyesha kwa vitendo kwamba yeye anaipenda miti. Hii ni kwa sababu kule kwake nyumbani anieanzisha tree nusery . Hata nakumbuka kwamba hivi majuzi wakati wa siku ya kitaifa ya kupanda miti wakati Mtukufu Rais aliliongoza taifa hili katika kupanda miti pale Nyahururu miti ambayo ilipandwa pale Nyahururu ilitoka kwenye tree nursery yake. Kwa hivyo sisi tuna bahati kuwa na kiongozi ambaye anaona mbali sana.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kama Mtukufu Rais hakuwalazi mishwa watu wahame katika sehemu zinazotoka magi sehemu nyingi za nchi hii zangekuwa na shiaa ya maji. Utaona kwamba watu wanaoishi kwenye nyanda za chini walikuwa hawapati maji ya kutosha. Kwa hivyo kutokana na juhudi za Mtukufu Rais, utaona  kwamba mito mingi katika sehemu mbali mbali hapa nchini ina maji na wananchi wanapata maji ya kutosha.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ningependa kusema machache kuhusu madini. Sehemu ya West Pokot imebahatika kuwa na madini ya anino. mbali mbali. Ningeichukua furs a hii kuiomba wizara hii kuangalia ni madini ya aina gani ambayo yanaweza kuwafaidi watu wetu. Kuna dhahab- nyingi katika sehemu ya west Pokot lakini utaona kwamba wisara hii haijawahi kuwasaiaia watu wetu. Kwa hivyo ningeiomba wizara ijaribu kuangalia ni mahali gani ambapo tunaweza kuchima dhahabu ya kutosha. Pia kuna vito vya thamani katika sehemu iiiyo na yafaawananchi wasaidiwe ili waweze kuyachimba madirii hayo.Pia, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kuna vyama kadha wa kadha vya ushirika katika s ehemu ya West Pokot. Kwa mfano leuna Karpu Mines Co-operative Society. Chama hiki hushughulikia uchimbaji wa madini katika Turkwell River Basin. Hat a hivyo utaona kwamba baada ya ulemradi wa Turkwell Gorge kumalizika sehemu hiyo itajaa maji. Wananchi wamekuwa wakichimba dhahabu ka~ika sehemu hiyo kwa muda sasa. Kwa hivyo ningependa kuiomba Serikali itafute njia ya kuwasaidia watu wa sehemu hiyo kwa sababu warnskuwa wakitegemea Turkwell River Basinkujipatia riziki zao.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mureithi) : Hon. Members, it is now time for the Mover to reply.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Nang'ole): Kwa hayo machach, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, naomba kuunga mkono.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Dr. Mungai) : Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I first of all would like to thank all the hon. Members who have contributed to this Vote. They have been very positive, very supportive and indeed we appreciate their contribution because it is helpful.	The hon. Members feel concerned about the environment, the forestry and the mining industry of our Republic.Mr. Tempoprary Deputy Speaker, Sir, many hon. Members felt that the Ministry should have asked for more money to run its activities. Usually we hear hoon. Member saying that a certain amount of money should be removed from a Ministry’s vote. However, in this case, they wants more money to be added to this vote, and that nect time we should ask for more money. We have taken note of that point and although we have to consider budgetary ceilings, because of the kind of support that we have received from the Hon. Member, we shall try to negotiate with the Treasury in this matter.Mr. Temporary Deupty Speaker, sir I woud also like to record to apprecication to the hon. Members because all of them have thanked His Excellency the President for the part he had played in the protection of Kenya’s environment. His Excellency the president as we all know has been in the forefront in the campaign of pretecting the environment. He has been advocating, together with other leaders in the world who came about the future generations, for the protection of the world environment. We has not logged behind in this back and he has also been a very good example to each one of us and therefore, in behalf of Environment and Natural Resources, I would also like to thank him for the work he is doing … with regards to protection of Environment which makws the work of any Ministry a great deal … We in the Ministry … only show our apprecision to the President by promoting for Environment with intelligence and ability, to that we can support him in his work he has been support us here at home.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir for the Hon. Memberof thisHouse, I would like to let them know that His Excellency the President has his own nurseries and he runs them very well. This is a very good example to us to Ministers, Assistant Ministers, Members of Parliament and to all heads od statutory bodies and private companies. Therefore we should all run our own nurseries so that we can also set a good examples to thecommunication in whichWe live. We also have church leaders and heads of schools and other learning institutions who should also plant nurseries to help in this noble task of preservation of Environment. I would like to take this opportunity to say that whoever would like to head to this call of planting tree nurseries, will be assisted by my Ministry because this is something that all of us shuld do.	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the preservation of encironment is not the sole responsibility of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resourses. This is the responsibility of everybody because it affects the future of our children and therefore, we must all co-operate in the protection of this environment so that the future of our children can be a happy one. In saying so I notice that the Hon. Members of this House are very much concerned about forestry and afforestation. As many hon. Members did mention, the first thins we have to do is to protect the forest that we have whether they are centered, local or rural forest. All these forests must be protected from random distruction by anybody. Careless felling of trees must be stopped innediately and so is the burning of charcoal from indigenous trees must be permitted. Trasing of livestock where one can destroy young trees should be discouraged. There is also the aspect of invasion by equators we may go and destroy our forests for theirsettlement. This should be stopped.	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, sir. To do this we must try to increase our forest cover by planting more nad more trees nurseries. The Ministry is going to promote the growing of so many tree nurseries ……. We can grow all types of trees that can grow in our country. I realize that there are tree that can only grow in one area and not in another area. Stations nearer to there ares must grow in the tree nurseries all this types of trees that can be well in these areas. Iwould like to ass these running type tree memories, whether they are Government tree nurseries or private nurseries. To ask for our assistance. We know that there are many tree nurseries, to ask for our assistance. We know what there are many tree nurseries in this country that are being run by non-Government organization or schools and we would like to request these people to make sure that they plant more indigenous those in their nurseries.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do really that we need exotic trees dor other reasons, but we have to plant indigenous trees, particularly  in the water catchment areas.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are some hon. Members who raised points which I feel I should reply to. Hon. Mibei in seconding this Motion, mentioned a disease that has affected the cypress trees in places like Mionbu, Kajiado and Marok. This disease is caused by amphid which originally came from Europe and the officers in my Ministry are very active in controlling this diseases in these areas and they have now moved on to other areas like South Myanza just to make sure that it does not spread there. Hon. Mibei as also said that most of our trees carry names that our people do not know and that we should have local names given to these trees. This point has been taken note of and we are going to continue identifying these trees and giving them local names to that they are understood by the local people.Sir, hon. Kisiero talked about Kepsuk Forest. Let me,first of all, commend him because he has been very active there.When the forest was invaded, he was able to talk to the localpopulation and they started moving out of the forest. I mustsay that this was appreciated very much by the Ministry. As he said that he would like to see more of the indigenous trees there, I would like to let him know that out of the 12,000 hectares that we have planted trees, 11,000 hectares are being filled up with indigenous trees. This is very important because this is a water catchment area and 5,000 hectares with industrial wood. So, what hon. Kisiero asked for is already being done and indeed accomplished. It is not only going to be there, but it is also going to be extended to other areas.Kenya is covered by about 2.2 million hectares of forests, and out of that, it is only 168,000 hectares that have industrial  plantations. So, the balance is not bad, but we are very much aware that we have to increase the acreage on indigenous trees and then plant exotic trees where they are required.Hon. Mahihu would like to see all highways and road reserves planted with trees. This also has been started and it is in the programme that all main roads and rural roads should be planted with trees so that we shall have avenues lined up by trees, and that will increase our tree population by a very large number.Hon. Otwani was talking about using grass instead of trees to manufacture paper. I am happy to say that when the papermill at Webuye started, they were using trees. They were making 45,000 tons of paper. They raised it to 66,000 and now they are planning to raise it to 98,000 tons. Cut of this they are going to start using a form of grass, maybe wheat,to make paper from. This is encouragement because wheat will not be lost. We are going touse it for makirig paper and this will save our trees.Hon. Masinde was very much concerned that there are certain hills that are bare, and that the towns are not fully planted with, trees. In fact, he says that London has more trees than Nairobi! First of all, I do not agree with that. Maybe he is taking a section of Nairobi and a section of London. But Nairobi has many more trees than London per acre.However, it is also in cur plans that we must plant many more trees in our towns, particularly where they are developing houses, housing development. In Nairobi, the western part of it has trees but the eastern side does not. Therefore, we must intensify planting of trees in the eastern side of Nairobi. Here we are going to ask for co-operation from the Ministry of Local Government to make sure that for every house that is built and passes through the City Commission, they must have plans for planting trees around that house; it does not matter how many, but we would prefer indigenous trees. In that way, the City will have many more , trees and not only the City of Nairobi but all the other towns.All hills in Kenya where it is not cultivated, we must fill them with trees. In fact, it is about two years ago when His Excellency the President led the University of Nairobi students plus other people to plant trees alongside the slopes of Ngong Hills. We are going to continue doing that and we shall request hon. Members in their constituencies, if they have hills there, please preserve then for tree planting and plant trees there.Hon. Kagwina who spoke very well on those issues only requested that he would like to have a nursery trees started in places called Gatunga, Kamwatho, Kathangachini and so on. I hope the Ministry will help him start them. But since those areas are inhis constituency, we would like him to be active and we shall give him support in starting nurseries there. He load also a very good suggestion that we are wasting a lot of husks like millet, coffee, rice, wheat and so on. He gave an example that coffee husks have been used, to make brickets for energy. There is the Ministry of Energy and we are going to work with them. Since we are in the same Government, we just have to make sure that there is no more waste.Hon. Lugonso mentioned something that is of great importance. He said that there is discrimination in the distribution of wood for sawmills. My Ministry was not aware of this and I thank for drawing, attention of my Ministry about this fact. I would like to assure him with all other hon. Members that my Ministry is not going to permit any form of discrimination or favouritism, or if there is corruption in this manner, we are going to act to make sure that there is no more corruption and that we are going to have equitable distribution of wood to all saw millers. However, I thank him for this information, and I have already requested the officials of the Ministry to look into it. I shall let the House know the action being taken there in due course.Sir, there was concern that sometimes it appears as if we have too many casuals, and that may be true. But this is only because there are some projects that are supported by donor countries it is agreed between the Kenya government and them that since these are not long-term, we shall employ casuals, when planting trees. For instance, we did this in Mt. Elgon. We employed many casuals, but when that work was finished we could not just keep them on the payroll. This is why you find the Ministry employing many casuals.Licensing of charcoal burners in the rural areas and other areas may be very dangerous because it may deplete our tree population. So, it must be controlled. There are occasions when we have to do it, but we cannot just license everybody.	Another point was raised by Dr. Vekesa of exchanging of farmlands with forests. This is already being looked into and we are going to do it in some areas around Mount 31 on. If I have move on quickly since there was not very much controversy on this Vote, I would like to say that mining is a very expensive exercise. Right now, we have well trained geologists who are out in the country to man out areas and find out what minerals are there and how they can be exploited. For example, we have have of them already working in the western part of Kenya and those people who know of the existence of minerals in certain areas, should come forward and tell us because these people are ready and willing to assist.As I said earlier, mining requires a lot of money and many	personnel. As you can see, Sir, we do not even have enough money 	under this Vote but we are doing the best we can Right now, we are mapping out the areas of these denosits. Iron are is very important	and kenya now is on record of having made three cars. I am sure we are going to start making them on commercial basis and it would make a lot of if we had our own iron ore. We have iron ore deposit in certain areas and we are actively looking into how they can be mined. When we have enough Money, we shall built a smelting plant for thin iron ore.Kenya under the President, is in the forefront in international efforts to protect the environment not only in this country but it also holds hands with other people who have interest in the same thing, that is protecting the environment for the future.The Ministry and particularly the national Environment Secretariat (NES), takes a lot of interest in matters pertaining to the environment. In fact, it is very active now to make sure that they are involved in any development projects or programmes. They also want to make sure that anything called development does not include poisons that will pollute our air, water, land or individuals. That is why every factory which is to be set up in the country, must be vetted by the Ministry. We have capable people here who are doing it.  There are many old vehicles running on our roads which pollute the air. We must also control this problem.Webuye Paper Mill is doing well as a commercial venture but we are looking into the fact that the effluent from there must be purified before it is put into the river. Studies are complete in this regard for the installation of new equipment to make sure that, although the water is not very polluted, it is going to remain clean. That is not only true of but She same applies to the other sugar factories down the river.Hon.Mwaura mentioned about the offensive smell oranatin  from the Bata Shoe Factory at Limuru. The officers in the National Environment Secretariat have already looked into this and made recommendations and techniques which are going to be used at Limuru to reduce the obnoxious smell from the effluent which pollutes the air as well as the water.	hon. Members, I would like to invite as many as possible to take interest in environment. Let me also Mention that the United Nations Environmental Programmers headquarters is based in Nairobi and it is only right for hon. Mwmber to have interest. I would like to urge hon. Member to promise to be keeping them informed of new developments from time to time s0 that they can be involved. We want hon. Members to be actively involved in the protection of the environment. Sir, next month, the Governing Council is holding meetings here in Nairobi. This is the Governing Council of Uneo, which involves people from all over the world. Their agenda is very important and I would just like to mention what they are going to dealing with, because I would like many hon. Members to be involved The agenda is going to be as follows.a)	The protection of the ozone layerb)	Global warming and climatic changesc)	Trans-boundary air pollutiond)      Protection of fresh, water resourcese)      Protection of oceans and coastal areasf)      Protection of land resourcesg)     Combating dessertificationh)     Conservation of biological diversityi)      Environmentally sound management of biotechnology.j)      Environmentally sound managment of harzadous wastesk) Management of toxic wastel)Control of trans-Boundary trade in toxic wastes.                             m) The Cairo Programme for African co-operation on Ministrial conference on Environment.Sir, these days you find that countries are getting together on regional basis and discussing and co-operating on how to protect their environment. This is being done very well by European Commission member countries. This is where we, in Africa, must the same, and this is the action that is being referred to as Amen. The Chairman of this body is the Minister for environment and Natural Resources of Kenya. We, therefore, must be active in leading other African countries in this aspect.I Sir, there are other important ones but before I conclude, let me thank those people who expressed their concern over the disturbances that took place here some days ago. I, and my Ministry, hated to see. what happened and we do not only want pure air, water or just good environment, but peaceful environment in our Republic. We strongly condemn those people who were inciting others and those who were trying to destroy this good Government led by His Excellency; President Moi.Thank you, Sir.</Newspeech>	(Question put and agreed to)/The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mureithi) left the Chair/.IN THE COMMITTEE/The Temporary Deputy Chairman (Mr. Malebe) took the Chair/Vote 21 — Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Dr. N.

D.M. AMIN): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Mr. Mwachaia, NSSF No. 111—129—346, was paid all the money his former employer had sent to the Fund as his total contribution. The complainant raised the issue of less payment with the Fund and was asked to bring documentary evidence, such as, payslips. He has not done so to-date. I am, therefore, requesting the hon.

KILIKU alimuuliza Waziri wa Ujenzi lini barabara ya Kenyatta Avenue Kuanzia Jomvu Madavuni hadi Ywembe Tayari, Mjini Mombasa, itarekebishwa.<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Mibei): Bw. Naibu Spika, naomba kujibu. Sehemu ya barabara hii, yaani cuanzia Jomvu hadi mzunguko wa barabara ya Changamwe ni nzuri. Ilirekebishwa kwa kuwekwa lami (premix carpeting) mwaka wa 1988.Barabara ya Kenyatta Avenue kutoka mzunguko wa barabara ya Changamwe hadi Mweirbe Tayari, imekwishawekwa katika mipango ya urekebishaji wa barabara mjini Mombasa na iraeoangwa kurekebishwa wakati wa kipindi cha 1991/92 wa makadirio ya fedha za Serikali.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Bw. Naibu Spika, ni kwa nini Wizara ilichelewe sha mpango wa kutengeneza barabara hii? Barabara hii imeharibika sana na hali wakaaji wa Mombasa wanalipa kodi kila mwezi na sasa Waziri anatwairbia eti itatengenezwa mwaka wa 1991/92.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIBEI: Bw. Naibu Spika, mhandisi mkuu wa barabara katika Mkoa wa Pwani ameamriwa kuhakikisha kwamba mashimo vote yaliyo katika barabara hii yamejazwa na barabara kuwekwa katika hali nzuri ya kupitika Moaka wakati itakaoostawishwa kulingana na mipango yetu.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Bw. Naibu Spika, ningeoenda kumshukuru Waziri, kwa hatua ambayo wamechukua. Je, anaweza kuwaamuru wafanyakazi wake wasitumie mchanga kujaza mashimo barabarani? Hii ni kwa sab juzi walitumia acxmchanga kujaza mashimo katika barabara ya Jojmvu Madavuni na mvua iliponyesha, huo inchango ulifagiliwa wote. Ingef watumie lami na sio mchanga wanapojaza mashimo haya barabarani.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIBEI: Bw. Naibu Spika, nimeweka maanani yale mhe. Mbunge amesema.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. FALANA: Bw. Naibu Spika, ninafikiri kwamba Wizara inafanya kazi moja mara mbili na bila shaka, gharama inazidi kupanda.	Ikiwa, kama Waziri	anavyosema, ameamuru mashimo yajazwe mchanga na bado Wizara ina mpango wa kuitengeneza barabara hii tena, hii ni gharama mara mbili. Ni kwa nini pasiwe na mpango wa kuitengeneza barabara hii mara moja tu ili gharama hii ipatikane mara moja tu?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIBEI: Hii ni kwa sababu kuna mipango fulani ambayo imefanywa. Kwa hivyo, barabara hii itakapotengenezwa, itatengenezwa vizuri sana.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.KILIKU: Bw. Naibu Spika, ili tujue kwamba Waziri amefanya homework ya kutosha, amesema kwamba kulingana na mipango ya Serikali, barabara hii itatengenezwa katika mwaka wa 1991/92. Ni kiasi gani cha pesa kitakachotumiwa kuitengeneza barabara hii kulingana na mipango iliyopo?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIBEI: Bw.

Naibu Spika, nilisema kwamba barabara ya Jomvu Madafuni iliwekwa mchanga hivi majuzi na mvua iliponyesha mchanga huo wote ukachukuliwa na maji, huku nyuma mashimo yakabaki wazi. Nilimwuliza Waziri kama anaweza kuwaamuru maofisa wake wakomeshe tabia hii ya kutumia mchanga kutengeneza barabara, na akasema kwamba amelitia maanani jambo hili.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

JALANG'O asked the Minister for Public Works whether, in view of the slow pace in implementing the bitumenisation of Road C28 (Ndori-Owimbi) in Rarieda Division, and the apparent lack of road construction equipment by the contractor, he could consider cancelling the present contract and re-awarding it to another competent contrator.<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Mibei): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.My Ministry notified the contractor of our concern about the slow rate of progress last May. The contractor has further been warned that unless he takes to site the required equipment within the next three weeks from 11th July, 1990, and satisfactory progress is seen by August, 1990, the termination of his contract would be considered in accordance with the provisions of the signed agreement and the contract be re-awarded.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. JALANG'0: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I took this early opportunity to assist the Ministry. I think it is too late to cancel this contract because the contractor involved has been on site for about 14 months without making much progress. Could the Minister advise this House as to what the contract value is and how much money has already been paid to the contractor? We do not need to wait until the contractor has been given too much money for too little work done.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIBEI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the length of the road is 22.2 kilometres, and the contract value is Shs.138,902,466/=. The contract is for a period of 36 months and the completion date of the project is scheduled for 31st October, 1992. The time already elapsed is eight months, and the value of the work done to date is Shs.8,878,214/=.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. JALANG'O: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in view of the detailed information given by the Minister, which I appreciate very much, can he not see that there is no need of waiting any further since the contract is already behind schedule and that the three weeks that have been given to the contractor will not make much difference in the work that the contractor has done in eight months? Can the Minister not decide now to cancel the contract and re-award it?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIBEI: As I said, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have given the contractor three weeks to pull up his socks, but I do not think that this is long enough. The camp work, which was started in time and was to be completed by June, 1990, is about 60 per cent completed and a number of buildings have already been put up. So, we thought it better to give the contractor an to put more effort. If he fails to do so within the given time, he will have no excuse at all.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Minister name the contractor and give the details, relating to the equipment that the contractor specified in the contract?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIBEI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the contractor has already made available on site a number of pieces of equipment, including one grader, one shovel, two tippers, one flagged bed lorry and one semi—trailer of 30—tonne capacity, but we find that these are not enough. Although these pieces of equipment are quite adequate for the project, the contractor is saving other equipment elsewhere and if he does not bring all the other necessary equipment within the period we have given him, we will terminate his contract.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Minister has not named the contractor as I requested him to do.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIBEI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the hon. Member who brought up this Question knows the name of the contractor in question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. We cannot just talk about an anonymous contractor here. We would like to know his name so that we may find out whether he is conning the Government or not.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr.MIBEI:Mr. Deputy Speaker,Sir,I said that the hon, Member for Rarieda knows the name of the contractor. Now since we have given the contractor only three weeks, perhaps, after that period we will be able to name him.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. JALANG'O: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it has taken this contractor eight months to assemble one grader, one shovel, one lorry and one Peugeot 504 car. Can the Minister tell the House whether this equipment can bituminize a road in eight months?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIBEI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I as I said before this equipment is not sufficient. However the contractor started work on an eight kilometre stretch but the project is two months behind schedule. We have given sufficient notice to this contractor and we will wait to see whether he will improve or not.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think hon. Malebe asked the Minister to name the contractor. Could he do that now?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIBEI: I think I agreed with the hon. Member for Rarieda that he could name the contractor himself if he feels like.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Question before us is the property of the House and the agreement between the hon. Minister and the hon. Member is irrelevant. If they are interested parties they should declare their interest. Could the Minister name the contractor?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIBEI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the contractor is known as Tamcon Africa Limited.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is good that the Minister has named this contractor because he has delayed bituminization of another road in Uasin Gishu. Now, is this contractor competent to handle this type of job and was he given the job rightsful</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR MIBEI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the contractor was given this contract rightfully after he expressed his wish, to do the contract, and we had high hopes that he would do it. But I am now eagerly waiting for elapse of the notice we have given him.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Minister agree or disagree with me that the contractor is a conman?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIBEI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not agree with the hon. Member that the contractor is a conman.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I have just heard that the same contractor abandoned work in Uasin Gishu and Machakos and now he is abandoning work in Raried Constituency. Is it in order for the Minister to continue awarding contracts to such a firm which is known for conning the Government?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIBEI:Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to warn contractors against obtaining contracts from the Government and not fulfilling their obligations. But each case is dealt with on its own merit.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Dr. Misoi Question for the second time.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR.

MISOI asked the Minister of State, Office of the President in view of the fact that Nyayo Tea Zone Programme is due to mature into full production of tea with significant benefits what arrangements he has made to ensure that there is adequate fuel for processing the tea.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT(Mr. Onyancha): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Ministry is aware that Nyayo Tea Zone Programme is due to mature into full production of tea with significant economic benefits. Currently, the Nyayo Tea Zone Development Corporation green leaf is processed by Kenya Tea Development Authority (ETDA): factories. However, in view of the fact some ETDA factories might be too congested to handle increased green leaf some consultants have been commissioned to do a feasibility study with a view to assisting the corporation in establishing its own processing facilities in those areas. It is only after those factory sites have been determined and identified that a programme will be instituted to develop fuel wood plantations within the proximity of the sites.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Assistant Minister for that short reply and also I appreciate that ETDA is processing tea leaf from the Nyayo Tea Zones. But, could the Minister tell us how tea, which is maturing now, was planted and yet fuel was not provide</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that may be so, but the feasibility will determine the kind of factories to be built. Presently, out of the 39 factories the KTDA owns, only siz use motor oil. It is, therefore, very important that the kind of factories to be built is determined after the feasibility has shown whether those will be using motor or wood fuel.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Wambua's Question for the second time.</Newspeech>Question No. 405<Header>Delay in implementing Pensions Increases</Header>Mr. WAMBUA asked the Vice-President and Minister for Finance what has the full implementation of the pension increase with effect from the 1st July, 1986 as outlined in Sections 2 and 3 of the Pensions (Increase)(Amendment) Act, 1990.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah): Mr. Deputy Speaker, I beg to reply but, before I do so, let me apologise to the House for not being here when the Question was asked the first time.There has been a delay in the full implementation of the pension increase with effect from 1st July, 1986 as outlined in Section 1, 2 and 3 of the Pensions Increase Amendment Act of May, 1990 because the financial provision which was to effect that increase was made in the year 1990/91. This is because the Bill was given consent on 11th May 1990, at which date the financial year ending June, 1990 did not contain any provision of this particular increase.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, now that it is agreed that there has been a long delay, what plans does the Ministry have so that the pensioners are paid their dues as stipulated in that Bill?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEAH: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, first of all, I do not agree that there has been a long delay. I said that the Presidential assent to the. Bill was on 11th May, 1990. We have1 over 50,000 pensioners who are affected by those increases. The months of May and June, 1990 happen to be very recent, indeed. More so, the financial year is the one beginning in July, 1990. So, I do not agree that this has taken long at all. Be that as it may, provision has been made in the correct year, 1990/91 and calculations done so that all the arrears, from 1st July, 1986 to 30th June, 1990, will be effected in the month of July, 1990.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister assure this House, now that the exercise has been completed, the pensioners are going to be paid their dues as from July onwards?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEAH: That is exactly what I have just said.</Newspeech>Question No.377<Header>Rural Electrification in Kabaru Location</Header>MR. MUREITHI asked the Minister for Energy what plans the Ministry has for the rural electrification programmes in Kabaru Location of Kieni East Division.<Newdspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Biwott): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.My Ministry, through the Kenya Power and Lighting Company, has been undertaking detailed designed work to cover Warasu Centre in Kabaru Location, alongside Kamburaini and Kangureti areas, which are bordering Kabaru Location. These designs are at an advanced stage at the moment. Construction work will be undertaken when funds become available.</Newdspeech><Newdspeech>MR. MUREITHI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, since in the Printed Estimates there is provision for the construction of the rural electrification programme, can the Minister assure this House that such construction will start as soon as they finish the work on the designs?</Newdspeech><Newdspeech>MR. BIWOTT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is confirmed, provided that the funds so budgeted will be adequate. However, I think the way I have put it is more more appropriate than stating categorically that the amount of money printed will be used. All I have to assure the hon. Member is that as soon as the design work is completed, construction will commence according to the funds in our Vote at that particular time.</Newdspeech><Newdspeech>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Minister elaborate on the problems in his Ministry regarding the plans for rural electrification in other areas, apart from Kabaru Location? This is because there are areas where plans for rural electrification have been completed and budgets approved but the funds have either been deployed in other activities, or returned to the Treasury.</Newdspeech><Newdspeech>MR. BIWOTT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, the Question before the House is specific; it is related to Kabaru Location in Kieni East Division. However, I would like to confirm to the House that our planning is for each district.This is because we would want everybody in all the districts to benefit from the little funds we have. So, whatever we have budgeted for any one district will remain in that district; there will be no shifting of funds from one area to another. I would like the hon. Member, if he has a specific problem which I am not aware of, to come and let us know it in the Ministry so that we can solve it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let us now go on to Questions by Private Notice.QUESTIONS BY PRIVATE NOTICE<Header>Surgeon for Lodwar District Hospital</Header><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Health the following Question by Private Notice.Since the resident surgeon formerly stationed at Lodwar District Hospital has left and noting that there are numerous surgical cases pending, what urgent measures is the Minister taking to post a surgeon to this hospital to provide this essential service?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Dr. Godana): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.My Ministry is aware that there is no surgeon at Lodwar District Hospital since April, this year. A surgeon will be posted to the hospital next month, August, 1990, when post-graduate doctors who are specialising in surgery are expected to qualify from the Faculty of Medicine, University of Nairobi.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is a very abnormal answer. People are dying in Lodwar and we are being told to wait for post-graduates. Are we short of doctors in the Republic, or what is happening?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member is sounding alarmist for nothing. Lodwar had a certain Dr. Donald Gilchrist, who was the surgeon since September, 1982. He had been recruited under the Norwegian Technical Assistance but, at the end of his contract in April this year, hecould not be replaced immediately. However, we do have post-graduate doctors, who are specialising in surgery, completing their courses at the end of this month. That is why I said we are posting one surgeon in August. I would like to assure the House and the hon. Member is fully aware of this that for the short period when we have not had a surgeon, the Ministry has been taking care of surgery needs using the Flying Doctor Services. Lodwar is also connected to Kitale, through a very good tarmack road one of the best roads in this country and whenever it has been necessary to refer patients, we have done so. Therefore, there is no cause for alarm.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is shocking that the Assistant Minister can give such an answer to the hon. Member. The lives of people are being lost because of the shortage of surgeons and the Assistant Minister has the audacity to say that they are still waiting for those trainees, and that, in the meantime, there are Flying Doctor Services available. The hon. Member is acting what urgent measures the Ministry is taking. Let me add that if the Ministry of Health does not improve, we are in hell. We are being sincere because the people outside are asking what is going on in the Ministry.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: What is your question?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, my question is for the Assistant Minister to tell us When this Question was put, they should have ordered a surgeon to go there and, as we are talking now, a surgeon should have been at Lodwar. Can the Assistant Minister now tell us when this surgeon will be posted there? He should not tell us that those people are relying on the Flying Doctor Services, when we are paying our own doctors. He is even telling us now to be paying to the Flying Doctor Services. Is it in order for him to do that? </Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. GODANA: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is obvious that hon. Mang'oli is ignorant of the Flying Doctor Services. We do not ask the hospitals or the people who are residents of those districts</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to impute ill motive against me that I am ignorant? He has said here that he wants the Lodwar people to be hiring flying doctors and he knows that is what happens. The Flying Doctor Servicer is not free. So, is he not misleading this House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I did not impute any ill motive to hon. Mang'oli. I only said that he seems ignorant about the operations of the Flying Doctor Service. The Flying Doctor Service works entirely for the Government. We do not ask patients to pay for the cost of flying doctors to attend them. As I said, with the African Medical Research Foundation, the Ministry has put in place a system of service whereby where there is no resident surgeon and a surgery problem requires the attention of extra surgeons rather than ordinary officers of health, the Ministry flies surgeons there to do the operations. So, I am saying that while we do have the Medical Officer of Health in Lodwar Hospital, they are lacking a resident surgeon and for those case's which cannot be attended to by the Medical Officer of Health himself, the Flying Doctor Service has taken care of emergencies. In any case, today is 24th July, and when I say that we are posting a resident surgeon to Lodwar, I am talking about something that is only a week away.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has told us that there was a doctor who was an expatriate and that his term of service has come to an end. From what the Assistant Minister has said, it is clear that, in fact, the Ministry has no forward planning. They should have planned that a doctor should have been posted to that place immediately after the expiry of that contract. So, can the Assistant Minister agree with me that they had not made any provision for this hospital and that they should go ahead and make immediate provisions in their planning?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I cannot agree that we have not made provision for it. In fact, my forward plan included that within two to three months of the expatriate doctor leaving, our own newly trained expert  surgeons will be coming out of Kenyatta National Hospital.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALLANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Question, having been put by Private Native, means that there is something of great importance, urgently requiring serious consideration. The hon. Assistant Minister has said that they will post somebody there sometimes in August, which is still a long way to go. This Question concerns lives of Kenyans. Could the hon. Assistant Minister be very specific and tell this House when, precisely, the surgeon will be posted to Lodwar?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think there is some misconception under which some of the hon. Members asking supplementary questions are operating. What we are talking about is the absence of a resident surgeon and not the absence of a resident doctor in Turkana. Even when the surgeon was there, Turkana District had always had a qualified doctor who is the Medical Officer of Health. When. I say that we are going to post a resident surgeon to the hospital next month, I hope hon. Members do understand that there are many hospitals in the country where, in fact, there are no full-time resident surgeons but which are properly served by the Flying Doctor Service or by surgeons visiting from other hospitals when emergencies arise. So, there is no cause for alarm. The fact that hon. Ekidor decided to put the Question through Private Notice, a procedure which suggests emergency, does not mean that there is any emergency in Lodwar Hospital.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALLANA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. With all due respect to my colleague, Dr. Godana, he has done the best he could to avoid answering my question. I have asked when, precisely, the Ministry is going i to post a surgeon to Lodwar Hospital, and he has not mentioned anything to that effect. Could he please respond to that particular question?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the month of August, 1990, is quite specific.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister tell us how many times the Flying Doctor Service have been to Lodwar Hospital since the expatriate surgeon left? Could he also tell us when those visits were made?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for the benefit of the House, and particularly ay friend, hon. Ekidor, the Flying Doctor Service is invoked when those in charge of a particular hospital or a particular part of the country feel that there are certain or specific case's which require emergency attendance by expert surgeons from Nairobi. In other words, they go as soon as they are called. I do know that there are times whein an emergency arises</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to avoid the "answer" which he has been asked, that is, when the Flying Doctor Service ever visited Turkana District? He is saying that if there is an emergency We want to know when the Flying Doctor Service visited the district. If no visit has been made there by the Flying Doctor Service, then the Assistant Minister is misleading this House by saying that the Flying Doctor Service has ever been to Lodwar Hospital. Can he tell us when the Flying Doctor Service was every used in Turkana District, even if it was 10 years ago?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question I was answering before I was rudely interrupted by hon. Mang'oli was different. I was saying that the Flying Doctor Service extends its service's to a particular part of the country when those in charge of health service there feel that there? is a particular case requiring expert attendance. I do know of cases where flying doctors have been called in at a notice of two to three hours. The Flying Doctor Service is ever ready with surgeons on standby. If the flying doctors have not gone to Turkana District for the last two months, it does not mean that, in fact, Turkana District has not been getting the best medical attention. It only means that the medical personnel present at Lodwar Hospital have been able? to deal effectively with all the case's that have come to them.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Very well. Mr. Wambua's Question.</Newspeech><Header>Sharing of Hospital Ward by Different Sex Patients</Header><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Health the following  Question by Private Notice.Why does the M.O.H., Machakos District Hospital, allow female and male mental patients to share the same ward, i.e., Ward 9?Since the said ward is untidy and poorly maintained, could the Minister direct the M.O.H. to have it properly maintained?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.I wish to inform the hon. Member that the Medical Officer of Health, Machakos District Hospital, does not allow female and male mental patients to share the same ward, i.e., Ward 9. Never. Ward 9 is a building used by mental unit of the hospital. It is a building with two departments, male and female rooms, separated by a wing in the middle? which accommodates two strong rooms.The wing is locked at night.The M.O.H. was directed to keep and maintain the said ward 9, which is just a building for the two altogether, and the whole hospital in general, tidy when officers from the Ministry headquarters visited Machakos District Hospital on 20th July, 1990.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Spe'aker, Sir. The hon. Questioner states, as a matter of fact, that male and female mental patients share? the ward in question. The Assistant Minister has denied that, and I wonder whether the Questioner can be asked to substantiate? and explain how he got his information. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, mental cases in Machakos District Hospital are put in the same ward. You can imagine a mad woman and a mad man being put in the same ward. What would be the consequence? It is not as simple as what the Assistant Minister tells here. I wish he could move to the hospital and see for himself. It is a mess; a total mess.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Six, some of us might have visited some of our hospital	wards in the country	You mayhave a large building with several wings, ward No.9 in Machakos District Hospital is just a building with one wing for female mental patients and another wing for male mental patients with a big strong wall separating the male side from the female side. There is no problem about that. This is because when it comes to</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. We are almost getting fed up with the Ministry of Health. We are talking about uncleanliness in all hospitals in the country. If you visit these hospitals you will find that the wards are very untidy.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is your point of order, Mr. Mang'oli?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: The Assistant Minister, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, is deliberately misleading this House by saying that these things are not happening. Does he want the entire House to travel to Machakos to find out what is happening there? I would urge the Ministry to be particularly careful when dealing with matters affecting the welfare of our people. The Assistant Minister must admit that these things are happening and apologise to the nation and undertake to correct the situation. That is what we expect him to do. He should not mislead the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Ward No.9 is used for convenience; one wing is for male patients and the other wing is for female patients. There is no problem at all; there is an open yard where the patients, female and male, can play volleybal</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is now telling the House that there is an open yard where people men and women "play". That games do they play? Could the Assistant Minister stop misleading this House? Ward No.9 is a very famous Ward in Machakos Hospital; women have gone there and have come out pregnant. I do not know what the Assistant Minister is saying. If the mind goes mad there are other parts of the body that do not go mad Can the Assistant Minister separate these two wards for mentally sick people in Machakos District Hospital?</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: What kind of children are we going to have from these mad men and women?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister is misleading the House. This is a serious matter.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is not aware that when mad women are taken to Ward No.9 for treatment they become pregnant. That is not a part of our treatment; that i not part of our treatment at all I There is an open space adjacent to each Department the female and male departments. This is the area where these patients are looked after during the day. The open space on the male side has added facilities to allow them to play games like volleyball and so on. It is normally recommended that by mixing the patient improves their condition faster. Those who do not know how mental patients are treated may not understand what we are trying to do to them to rehabilitate them to make them look like normal people. Here men live close to females and women live close to males. This is what we are trying to do by making them live in one Block Ward No. 9 but the wings are separated. These patients are looked after by our doctors and our nurses.It is convenient to visit Ward No.9 as a block but when you go to the male and female wings you will find that when they come out during the day they are on their two separate sides. This is quite in order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. With due respect to hon. Ogur, I think he is taking this matter very lightly. Here we are talking about human life. He talks of mad men and mad women playing together in the open yard. We are not joking here. Where we have some patients there is always a sense of privacy and that is the reason why we have separate toilets for  male and female patients. Just imagine what would happen if mad men and mad women were left to mix freely?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is your point of order, hon. Falana?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: With all due respect to you hon. Members, you should keep quiet. We have two hon. Members here who know Machakos District Hospital very well; hon. Mrs. Ndetei has also confirmed what hon. Wambua has said, that these patients live under the same roof. The. Assistant Minister should take this matter very seriously and instruct the Medical Officer of Health Machakos, to separate these madmen and women immediately so that no further damage is done.Hon. Mrs. Ndetei has said that mad women who have been taken to that Ward have come out pregnant.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. 0GUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, these mental patients are separated; they live separately. However, in the 1988/89 Budget and also in the current Development Plan: period the Hospital recommended to the Machakos District Development Committee for the construction of a new mental unit. This was priority number four in the D.D.C.'s set of priorities. A new building will be put up during the</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

MEMBER: He has already withdrawn his remarks.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Ogur, I thought I heard your withdrawal, but would you like to do it again?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I did so.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIILU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is it, hen. Kiilu?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIILU: Could the Assistant Minister withdraw and apologise to the House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have withdrawn twice. We are already planning to put up a new building.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir We would like the Assistant Minister to withdraw and apologise.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am very happy with your ruling and I comply.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order! I hope you realise, Mr. Ogur, that you are literally provoking reaction from hon. Members. It is therefore important to be explicit without necessarily provoking hon. Members.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to apologise. With regard to the question of funds arising from the cost-sharing at the Machakos General Hospital were used by the Medical Officer of Health to improve this facility. Therefore, this clearly shows that we are very serious as a Ministry to improve this particular building. In addition, we are going on to build yet a new.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAMUYU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Question is very clear. It is talking about allowing female and male mental patients to share the same ward. We are not worried about the future plans of the Ministry but with the immediately solution to this problem. The Assistant Minister has himself admitted that sale and female patients are sharing the same ward. Can he direct the Medical Officer of Health to stop this practice with immediate effect?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUS: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I once again explain the situation in ward No.9. This is a building with two separate wings, one for female and the other for male but if it is true that female and male made people are being allowed to share the same ward, this is indeed a very serious matter which ought to have been brought to oumotice much earlier than now.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. I. MOHAMED: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we would like to seek your guidance with regard to this Question. This is a very serious issue involving the use of one ward by female and male made people and these patients cannot take care of themselves and it would be most unfortunate if female patients end up getting pregnant in hospital. Therefore, could the Assistant Minister be serious enough and tell this House what action he is going to take to separate these patients so that this dirty habit does not continue in the hospital.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGOR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said that Hard No.9 is just a building used as a mental wing in the hospital. I have said that this building has two separate wards, one for male and the other for female patients and the two A wards are separated by a wing in the middle. So, this is not a single ward but a building as I have explained and therefore the  description Of this building as a ward lid.9 is not proper.</Newspeech>             <Newspeech>Mr.DEPUTY Speaker: Very well, let us now move on to the next  order!</Newspeech>POINTS OF ORDER<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Keen): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, on Tuesday, the 17th of July, while contributing to a Motion for the Adjournment on a matter of national importance, I made certain disclosures regarding a "shadow cabinet" list and some of the persons who were arrested while the riots were being contained. At all times in the discharge of duties, I shall be guided without failure by total loyalty to my President and to my country. Similarly, at all time, I shall endeavour to respect the feelings of my countrymen with particular attention to the Hon. Members of this Parliament. In this approach, I have been consistent all along in my 30 years of political career and indeed, my record, speaks for  itsefl. I do not intend to deviate from ay usual and firm and honest stand on all issues and shall, continue to discharge my duties to the Presidency to  the best of my ability without fear or favour. In a state of turmoil, civil disturbances and confusion, it is of paramount importance that Parliament is kept fully informed of all important development. In other words in such a context, and in the discbarge of my duties, of internal security, I am duty, bound to inform parliament of all relevant facts which are of national importance. In this regard, I do have not have any option, and therefore, I simply have to do it, otherwise, hon. Members of this House would be after my hide. Indeed the whole country would be up on arms if I was to hide vital information concerning their security. The list disclosed by me in Parliament, did not come from heaven, neither did I or the Government of Kenya, manufacture it as has been suggested by some people, nor did I have any reasons to disbelieve the investigative arm of the Government. Needless to say, I do not arrest offenders or do any investigations myself. This is the duty of the technical arm of the security apparatus. Investigation officers with any relevantinformation that they cay come across in the course of their duties, pass it to me and I in turn pass such information to this August House. My Officers have done their duty and I have done mine, and therefore, the ball is new passed to the other arms of the Government who will take the necessary action according, to the law of this land. This they will do, by either exonerating, by charging and convicting those persons involved upon evidence established.I am aware that the police are actively engaged in investigations of those persons found with the list of the names of the shadow cabinet or the draft constitution with a view to bringing them to justice. Similarly, whether all or any of the arrested persons will be found guilty of any offence or not, is a matter for a competent court of law to decide. The provisions of law relating to being in possession of seditious material is very clear, and anybody found in possession of such documents, will be dealt with in accordance with the law.	 Finally it is not within, my competence to clear or charge any of the persons whose names appeared on the list. It is upon the to exonerate themselves by giving an explanation as to their non-involvement or they are cleared by the people with whom the list was found when taken to court.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT (Mr. Otwani): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I rise on this point of order to bring to the attention of this House and the nation as a whole a certain publication which I consider to be dangerous. This publication echoes the notorious serms regarding the signs of the times. This publication is by Roman Catholic Bishops entitled, "The Present situation in our Country". I bring this publication to the attention of the House because our Government has taken appropriate steps to correct whatever has been said during the recent debate on multi-partysystem of Government in Kenya. This publication appear to me to be highly political and it is not as spiritual as it is supposed to be. It is talking about the queueing system of voting in Kenya, rigging, corruption, forced Harambees, the poor and the rich. However, for the first time, there is nothing tribal in this publication, but what I would like to observe is that at the moment, we have various commissions at work within, the country. We have for example, the Kanu Review Committe, Employment Committee, the Commission on the Law Society of Kenya and so on. However, this pastoral letter is calling for more than we expect, because it is asking all the Christians in Kenya to go down to the roots and discuss political issues,We expect these Catholic Bishops to address this publication to the Kanu Review Committee.It is also being translated in all languages and today Kenya Times page four tells us about the Kikuyu version which is highly inflamatory, with very many ridiculous cartoons. So it is not a publication which should be taken lightly. It sounds worse than the "Haoroto cassetts" because it suggests a workshop by the Catholic Commission of Justice and Peace. It has outlined a whole workshop kind of approach right from the grassroot. Now, we do not know whether this is the intended convention that the Bishops have always asked for. So, mine is to call upon the Office of the President to take note of this and see how this publication is supposed to be discussed in all languages. Here, have the English, Kiswahili, Akamba, Kikuyu which is selling very fast and so on.Thank you.</Newspeech>- <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LAB0UR (Mr. D.M.Amin): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. When answering Question No. 404 by the hon. Member for Kerio Central, Mr. Arap Chepkok, I promisd to give more information about Simba Tours Ltd. Our efforts to trace the whereabouts of Simba Tours Ltd and Kimbo Safaris whose, number the claimant is using was not successful Can the hon. Member please ask the claimant to call at the nearest N.S.S.F. office and supply all the particulars of this employer where he is situated. Thank you.</Newspeech>BILLSecond ReadingThe Public Holidays (Amendment) Bill<Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Mali): Mr. Deputy Speaker,Sir, I rise to move the Second Reading of the Public Holidays(Amendment) Bill, 1990.I have privilege and honour indeed, to move this second reading of a bill on a son of  Kenya whom the Bill is intended to honour. This son of Kenya is His Excellency the President. He has done so much, for the country since assumption of office. He is the man who brought about the philosophy of Nyayo, that is Peace, Love and Unity. He has gone all over the country to try to bring together the unity of the Kenyans. He is the man who has travelled every corner of Kenya to cultivate love and unity as the basis for development. He is the man who has sacrificed his entire life in the promotion of the welfare of the nation. He is the man who has charged that the youth of this nation are the future leaders of this nation and their upbringing is very important and paramount. He is the man who has spared no time in going around the entire Kenya to bring about love and unity as for the pillars of development. He is the man who has love for the children and youth of this nation, as future leaders, of the nation.He is the man who, during his reign,increased the intake of students in universities by increasing the capacity of universities space from one university to four universities. He is the man who has advocated conservation of the environment and in fact appointed a commission for environment to safeguard afforestation and environment as a whole.He is the man who has by tireless efforts brought about the awareness of the unity as a basis for nationhood. He is the man whose ideals of humility and fear of God has made Kenya the key to survival. He is the man who brought about the 8-4-4 system of education to equip the youth with something to do for themselves in this competitive world. He is the man whose humility and tolerance are unparallelled with any other person. He is the man whose leadership is not based on hatred. He is the man who has supplied milk to the young children in schools and provided free education in primary schools.He is the man who, on the question of agriculture, has done greatly, and the keynote here is to enlarge the cash crop area known as the tea zone in order to increase the production of tea as a cash crop of this nation. He is the man who has gone to any part of Kenya to assess the need of the people. He is the man who believes in justice for all and has pioneered the decentralisation of courts to the district level in order to bring justice nearer to the people. He is a man who will spare no energy to assist other African countries to realise their independence, for instance. Namibia, Mozambique, Chad and many others. I can go on and on.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, to talk about that man or that son of Kenya who has done so well and so much for us all, we owe him a great deal. We have nothing that we can offer him, but to say for"THANK YOU" for what he has done. The man I am talking about of course, you must have identified him by now is the man whom we know very well and I am proud to move this Bill in order to name a day or a date in the annual calender of this country to be a day that is named after him in honour of what he has done for us, as a little token of appreciation. I hope that the House will support me in this Bill in order to honour that man by naming that day or date to be associated with him. Of course, the man is HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT DANIEL TOROITICH ARAP MOI.The purpose of this Bill is to provide that 10th October of every year be set aside as a public holiday to be known as Moi Day. This is in honour of the outstanding leadership of His. Excellency the President to our nation. Tuesday, 10th 1989, was observed as a public holiday throughout the country in recognition of the excellent leadership of our beloved President Daniel Toroitich arap Moi.Under His Excellency's wise leadership, Kenya has surmounted many challenges and made tremendous progress in the field of education, health, economy and international relations. I will not need to remind hon. Members of the great achievements Kenya has made in this field during the leadership of our beloved President. These are obvious for all to see and appreciate. This year alone, our researchers have, discovered, a drug known as Kemron which no other country has been able to provide to combat the dreaded AIDS disease. This has given Kenya a name that is unaparalled anywhere. Our researchers and engineers at the University of Nairobi and elsewhere are working very hard with regard to discoveries of things that are relevant to Kenya as a whole.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, you can recall the Kenya made car which the President challenged the local universities to produce. This is no longer a sort of a guess but a reality because the car has already been made by our universities in Conjunction with other engineers in order to fulfill that promise. We appreciate these achievements.We must take cognizant that these things cannot be done if there is no peace, unity and love in the country. Unity of purpos is essential. There can never be discoveries of development where chaos exist. It is needless to say that Kenya, as a nation, has cone a long way since the President took over the leadership of this country.Hon. Members will, no doubt, agree that observing the 10th of October of every year as a public holiday knowns as Moi Day, is a befitting honour to our beloved President. It will be our token of appreciation.With these opening remarks, I wish to move that the Bill be now read the Second Time.Thank you.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Nabwera) It is with great pleasure that I rise to second the Second Reading of this Bill that is seeking to set aside a public holiday to be known as Moi Day.The House will recall that it was a unanimous wish of the entire Kanu membership and many Kenyans that we should have a day set aside to celebrate the occasion when our President took over the leadership from the late Mzee Jomo Kenyatta. Because the 14th of October, which happens to be the actual day is too close to another very important day in our calendar Kenyatta Day the Government decided that we should ask the House to establish the 10th of October instead so that there would enough interval of time in between the two very important historical days for this country.It is because the President has made tremendous development for this country that we shoud honour by setting aside this day. Since President Moi took over the leadership of this country after the late Mzee Jomo Kenyatta having established or set us as an Independent State, there have been far many radical changes in our economic and social life. The changes that have taken place have far reaching consequences for the welfare of this nation. "If  we  were  serious  as  a  nation,   it  would  not  be  necessary   for  us  to    concentrate  on  the few negative  things, that our  critics keep  on  harping  on.  This  afternoon,   Sir,   you  have  just  heard the  hon.  Member  for  Amagoro  reading  a  pastoral  letter  which  was  well intended and  sent  out  by  the  Catholic  Bishops,  but which  has  been turned  into  a propaganda  gimmick. I  am  quite  sure  that  the  Catholic Bishops  who  were  authors  of  this   pastoral  letter  could  never have imagined  that  that  letter  would be turned  into  a  propaganda machine  to  be  used  against  this  Government. By  and  large,   the  catholics  have  been  very  keen  on  ensuring that  the  country  has  peace  and  that  there  is  stability. They have also been  keen  on making  sure  that  they  point  out  to  leaders  and the Government  certain things that  they  would  like to  see  corrected. It  has  not  been  the  intention  of  the  Catholic  Bishops  and, indeed, the  entire catholic  leadership  in  this  country,   that  they should  fight  the  Government. You  can  see  now  what  has  been  translated  into  the  Gikuyu language  and  the  kind of  things  that  are  being  said. It  is,   in  facttaking  that  pastoral  letter  out  of  context. We  have  been  apologeticfor  too  long. We  should,   as  a  Government  and  as  a  people,   stopbeing  apologetic. There  is  no  country on  this  earth  where  thereis  complete  absence of  corruption. Every  country  has  got  its  ownills. "There  is  a certain  amount of corruption in our society and the Kenya Governmentand  President Moi  himself are  the  first  to  acknowledge  this  fact. President  Moi has  been  fighting magendo  ever  since  he  took over  the  leadership of  this country, and kept on reminding us  of our shortcomings. So,  there  is  no  need  for  anybody to  appear  as  angels  and  talk  down  to us  as  if those  of us  in  the  Government and Kanu  are nothing but  corrupt  leaders  to be  accused of this  and  that. There  is no  society  on  earth  that  is  pure. So,  as  we  continue  to grapple with  the  problems that  face  this  nation,  let us  remember  that  the  question of poverty  and unemployment  is  not  unique  in  Kenya because  every  nation  in  the world has  some poor people. It  is  the  aim of this  Government  to  fight  ignorance,  poverty and disease,  and  this  is  the  declared aim of Kanu. We  have  been  doing this  since  we became  independent.   No  country has  so  far wiped out all  its  ills  and become  a kind  of heaven  on  earth. This is why I  said that  we  must now  face  our problems and  fight back. When  we are being criticised correctly, let us accept  the criticism,  but when  the  criticism  is  ill-intended and has  ulterior motives, we should  be  able  to  explain our position. I  said  that  we  wish  to  honour  President Moi  because  of his  philosophy.He has been  fighting for  the  small  person,  helping the poor of this nation and ensuring  that  those  who  are  dispossessed of their  land  in various provinces are  given back  their  land. He  has  also  been  fighting unemployment  and spreadingeducation  to  every  corner of the  Republic. In  fact,  he  has  transformed our  lives.So, let  us  be  a  little  bit proud of ourselves. How many of the  countries  thatbecame  independent  in  1963  are  more  developed,  have  more schools,  hospitals  or bittimenised roads,  or  provides  more  employment  than Kenya? Let  us  avoid  a defeatist  spirit. I  think our biggest problem  is  that  since  this  ""disease""  of wanting a multi-party  system  started  in  this  country,  some  of our people have  become prepared  to go  to  any  length and  dissent  to  any  level  to  say what they think is going to be  harmful to  the  Government. As  hon.  Members  of Parliament and Kanu leaders,  however,  let us  unite with  the people whom we represent and lead in  fighting back  to  make sure that our position is  understood.Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to make  one  other point before. I  let  my collegues  take  part  in  this  important  debate. Let  foreign governmentsknow  that  Kenya  is not  up  for  sale. The  foreign governments  that are  friendlyto  us  should  do  business  with us  in a proper manner  as  should be  done between one  sovereign  state  and  another similar state.  Kenyans  will  not  surrender  their sovereignty  nor kneel  before  anybody just because he  is economically more powerful  than  we  are. Our  traditional  friends  in  the West  should understand that they  have  societies  to  look after and that we have  our Kenyan society to look after. Under  President Moi,  the  Government will continue  to work and struggle for  the welfare  of all  Kenyans  regardless of where  they live and what they do in our  society. In  dealing with  this  Bill on Moi  Day, we should remind ourselves  ofwhere we have  been  and  the  stages through which we have gone  in order to make sure  that we  re-examine  our position and reunite  to  do that which  is good for Kenya and beneficial  to all our people.Those  in-our society who want to -detract  this  Government. from  its commitment should know that the  Government ofKenya will  remain steadfast  and,  under Kanu,  we will  do what is right and justto  the  majority  of Kenyans. We  will  continue  to move  forward under theleadership  of His  Excellency  President Daniel  arap Moi. I  urge  the  House  toestablish Moi  Day  as  a  small  tribute  to one  of the best workers  and perhaps one of the  most  important-leaders  that this  country will  ever have.  With  these  few remarks,  Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I  beg to second. (Question proposed) <newspeech> THE MINISTER FOR CO-OPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT	(Mr.  Cheruiyot):Thank you,Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir. I  also  rise  to  support this Motion. I  would  like  tothank the hon.  Attorney-General for moving the Bill and hon.  Nabwera for seconding it. This  is  a very  important Bill,  and we  expect  all  the hon.  Members who have grown in the Nyayo Era to support it as they witness the unique  achievement made by  His  Excellency  the  President over a period of 10 years  in the Nyayo Era. We know of many heads  of state the world over who have been much honoured after having served  for a period of only four years  or less. Our  President has  madetremendous  achievements  and served this nation with distinction. I  would  havebeen  the  first  to honour  His  Excellency  the President. I  would  like  to  pay  tribute  to our public  universities because  they were  the  first to  award  His  Excellency the President honorary degrees  in recognition of the big contribution that he has made  to this nation.  He  has been  awarded the  Doctor  of Literature degree by the University of Nairobi and Kenyatta University. This  is  a high award,  and even the  late President Jomo Kenyatta was  given  the  same honour  in 1972. Hon.Members have  said here  many times  that  our President has  done a lot  in all  sectors  of  our economy. I would like to mention,  in particular,  the 8-4-4  educational  Programme,  which will  stretch into the  next  century. This  programme  is transforming the minds of the  youth to  think differently;  it is creating youth who will be self-employed in  jua kali  programme  and,  in fact,  enable  us to  enter into the industrial revolution.  This  is what  the  President had in mind when he  started this  programme. Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  the  other  thing,  for which the President  should be  honoured by making the Moi  Day a special  one,  is the  rule  of law in this  country. We have been shocked to hear  of  church leaders  telling us to call a convention.  .We call for conventions where  there  are  no institutions like constitutions, judiciary,legislature  and  executive  arms of the  government. Situations  likethese have  arisen in Liberia and Uganda.We, therefore wonderwhen people call for national conventions  to decide  on what shouldbe  done  for this nation when we  have Members  of Parliament whospeak for  the  people  of this  country.Our President  has  guaranteedthe rule  of law and we should respect him for  that unique  position  In  environmental matters  the  President has  practically done  conservation in his  Kabarak  home,  which is  a tremedous achievement. In recognition  of his efforts he was  invited to makethe  key speech during theOzone-Layer Conference  in London. Who elsecould we honour  other than our President on this Moi Day. We,  however,  continue  to get more  shocks:  we were very much  surpi'ised when the  Internation Bar Association (IBA)  changed the venue  of  the  conference  it was going to hold here  from Nairobi to New York claiming that there was human rights violations and lack  of  security in this  country. I must  thank the  hon.  Attorney-Generalfor  continuously continuing, to  state  in the  media that  there  is Peace,  stability,  law and order in this  country.  So,  changing the venue  of  the  IBA conference from Nairobi to New York had ill motives  it was not  done  because  of the  excuses  they gave us.  This  country is  so  save that the  embassies,  foreign correspondents,  including those of the  BBC,  are  very happy to  operate  from here.  Therefore,  I  fee)_ that  the  IBA was misled by our enemies;  they should have  asked us whether  it was  true  that we had  security problems. Mr. Deputy speaker, Sir, his Excellency the President has done  a lot;  he has  been so  accessible  that today it  is very difficult  in independent Africa to  get  another  president whom you can go  and  see.  He stops  on the way and takes tea or  soda in kiosks,  Which other  president  can be so close  to his people  that he is  able  to stop by the roadside  wand give  a lift to a sick woman? In fact,  I  am sorry to say that  some  of us  do no do that. I  thus  do not  know how much honour we  can give  our President. I  thus  appeal to  the House  to aupport  this Bill  so  that Moi Xuj goes  down in history in recognition 	of the  achievements  of  our President. I would have  said more,  but I have  a hoarse voice: With those  fta fe77 remarks,  I beg to  support. Mr. Deputy Speakers left the Chair) (The  temporary Deputy Speaker(Mr.  Mahihu)  took the  Chair) </newspeech><newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LOCAL  GOVERNMENT  (Mr.  ole Ntimama): Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I stand to  support  this Bill,  which gives Moi  Day national  and international recognition. I  support thisBill because  it gives  great  son of Africa what he   deserves.PresidentMoi has been a leader  of this  country for  over  30 years  and has never faltered in his leadership;  Kenyans have  elected him repeatedly because  they know he has led and will continue  to lead this country  very well  for  the  benefit  of us  all. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Sneaker,  Sir,  President Moi  has  been a nationalist  since  pre-independence  days;  he has attended all the conferences,  including the  Lacanster House  Conference;  he  has represented his  people  and has  always  stood  shoulder high as  an honest man  and a great  leader. On  the  death of the  late  Kenyatta,Kenyans  constitutionally,  and without any dissent, we elected him tobecome  the President  of this  country. we  must  thus honour  President Moi for having maintained his integrity,  honesty and  alsofor minding the  welfare  of his people  since when he was a young man. In the  last 12 years  our education has  been absolutely revolutionised:  the  tremedous expansion in education from primary school to the university is unbelievable. In fact, you cannot compare  Kenya in this area with most  countries  in the  sub-Sahara region. This has happened because  of our President's efforts and his  love  for  the  youth;   he has built  primary and secondary  schools  in most of the  districts in this country.Now ,wehave	40,000  students  in our universities  as comapred to veryfew who  there;  in fact,  at  independence  we  has only 	3,000 of  them. You can see  the  trenedous effort he has personally put because he loves this  country's youth. This  country would have  become  a desert  or inhabitable,  if the President had not  single handedly spearheaded the  campaign tomake  this  country as good as the  Garden of Eden.	Using my owndistrict  as an example,  where  people had cut down all the  forests and made  rivers  to  stop following,  we  now have  these rivers flowing and rains  are  falling where  they did not use  to  fall. Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  His ExcellencY  the President has  personally initiated  his  own  tree  nursery  in his  own  compound  where  he. grows  various  indigenous  trees  through which  the  country  at  large,  and  even the Forestry Department's  officers,  are  learning how to plant those indigenous trees. Before,  people used  to consider  indigenous  trees  as useless  and wouldnot grow  them and,  therefore,  took so  long  to  initiate such growth. Now,  HisExcellency  the President has  spearheaded  that development and the  indigenous trees are to be found all over this country and we are soon going to have a beautiful  country,  like  it  used  to  be the case many years  back. Sir,  I  think the biggest contribution that His Excellency President Daniel  Toroitich  arap  Moi has  done  is  the  establishment of peace in this country, which has  continued since the days of Mzee Jomo Kenyatta and still continues. He  has  pulled together all  the  ethnic people  of this  land andmaintained peace and  stability in this  country. It is  very  important because -I  think he  is  a  ""Prince of Peace"" who been Sent to  this  country as  aprophet  to maintain peace  in the country. I  would  not have  known  anybodyelse to  have done a job  of maintaining things  in this country,  except for   His Excellency President Daniel  arap Moi. So,  this  is  a very important  holiday  and  it  is very important that we maintain it and make it a great day  to honour him  as  a great  son of Africa. Sir.  let me  say  here  again that His  Excellency  the President has been  a  ""Prince  of Peace""  in  this  country;  he has maintained peace  in the country. However,  some people have  taken  this  peace and harmony of thecountry  for granted. If people  do not want to have  this peace continuing,I  am sure most of the people who are making trouble will really face a lot of problem;  both  themselves,  their families,  children and even their property. I  think what  is happehing in the country is amateurism;  there are people who are  trying evil  things. These  people  have had a good time and a lot of good things have happened  in this country so that they have made a lot of money.  Their children go to good  school,  have good jobs,  professionally or otherwise  and are doing good business. However,  because  somebody has  everything,  he  now ants  anarchy;  he  is now trying to bring in other things under  the pretect of  introducing democracy and pluralism and also pretending  that people are corrupt,  and other things. They  are  sowing anarchy.They  will  reap  anarchy. This  is  unfortunate because none of us will bespared;  nobody  will  be happy  in this  country. Everybody will  be  affected,without exception. I  would want to take this  opportunity  to warn  these  people who are  pushing these  things  in the name  of advocating for multipartyism,  in the name of pluralism  and any  other  "ism"  that  it  is very dangerous.  In this  country we have democracy,  as  it were. We have  a Kanu  committee today  chaired  by  the  Vice-President  and Minister for Finance;  In which the Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly,  Mr.  Kalonzo Musyoka was a member before. This  was  convened  so  that people can change  those  thingsthey  feel  should  be  changeth in the Kanu-constitution,  if  it  is so felt. In  fact,  a few  changes have been made  in  the Kanu constitution.  Now that we have the Vice-President and Minister for Finance chairing  that  committee, there will be additional  changes. However,  Sir,  even before  these  people  go  before  that  committee to  present  their  proposals,  they  want  to."rock  the  boat",  they want to put. us  into trouble  by calling for  short-cuts  and using some  other methods. I  will be forgiven for saying that some few people,  not the majority,  have some tribal disease in their minds. There is  a magazine  which  is  called the Financial  Review and  in its  last edition,  about four weeks  ago,  the editor  of  that magazine went on to mention the ethnic group from which I come  from  and refer  to them as  similar to  the Red  Indians  in American history who,  similarly,  have not contributed anything to the economy. The  editor went further to mention my name and that of hon.  John Keen and  saying that weare not worth  being  leaders  in  this  country. That  is the extreme of arrogance;  tribalism - I would say – and I know where that gentleman comes from 	He should know that if it were not for the Maasais,  when the Europeans came, his forefathers, including himself, would have been cutting sugar-cane in the Caribbean, South America or other states in the world. However,  it is the Maasal who protected them when they were either in the holes, or caves. This kind of arrogance must be removed from our society. Sir,  at the  same time,  there was a remark,  actually attributed to  one  of the  lawyers who has escaped from the country,  that a certain ethnic group  is superior to the others. These  are  only  individuals,  onlya few people. However,  they are very dangerous. I  do not know what theywanted to do,  or whether-they wanted to behave like the Ibo tribe ofNigeria. What has happened to the Ibo tribe of Nigeria? They  thoughtthat  they were  superior and knew business more than anybody  else and that they were  the majority. Now, the Ibo tribe has been given its place inNigeria because they were fixed and reduced to their proper size.Thattrend  is very dangerous  in a country like Kenya. People  should not saythat  they are  superior,  or that they know how to do business better than others,  or  that they have better brains than others. They  should not  thinkthat  they have the right to sujecting others. I  am particularly talking about  the  few people,  like  the ones I have mentioned.	We  must all worktogether and follow the example of President Moi of working together like a nation,  one group of people. Not  one  little tribe,  or ethnic group, even  if it could have happened 30 years ago  Such things will never happen again. Nobody will be  allowed to put their legs on our heads. I personally will fight. I want everybody to know that we will fight for our own rights so  that we do not have to be colonised twice by our fellow brothers who are Kenyans  like us.  Let us work together and build this country together.  However,  we will  not agree  on  that kind of thing again,  and we will  fight with  all  our means. We  fought many years  ago  and we can fight  again. So,  I  want  to say  that we want  to make this  day a great day, an honourable  day respected  by  everybody  and so  that we can support our  leader. We  will  never get  another  leader  like His Excellency President Daniel  Toroitich  arap Moi;  I  assure you of that.  We must agree  to  shelve little turmoils like these and go ahead for progress in educating our children and growing more food for our people. Those  are actually the essentials of today.	We  should not start grumbling just because somebodywants  to become a leader by using short-cuts.	That one we will not  agree.Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I will say the last one for our friends,  especially our Western friends. 	We have. been  together with these people for a very long-time and we have been partners in progress. Our colonizers,  the British,  have turned  to be our friends  since we got Independence. We are not interested  in created any, problems with them,  and I  do not think  they want to create trouble with us because,  that way,  they will also be losers. To put Kenya In turmoil,  who will not lose? Who will not be in trouble? The investments thatthe West has  put  in this  country; the money  and the people. We want peace inthis  country. We want a peaceful change. W4 do not want plurarism and democracyin  the name of the West to be pushed  through our throat. We want  to be giventime to evolve our own way of democracy  until we reach something that we think is  good for  us. Importation of Western  styles,  methods  and democracy will notfit Africa. And you  can  see what  they  are saying  in many other areas. You  cansee what  the  Organization of African Unity  said  the other  day  today. It  is  notthat we are refusing to make adjustments;  we cannot be pushed. If  you  push  somebody,  you  probably end up  breaking his neck  or  leg. We need time to evolve and we will  come and agree with ourselves  to something that  is  called democracy  in our own style and not the style of the West of of any other capital of the West. 	With those few remarks,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to  support. </newspeech><newspeech> THE  ASSISTANT MINISTER  FOR  CO-OPERATIVE  DEVELOPMENT 	(Mr.  Ejore): Ahsante sana,  Bw.

Naibu Spika wa Muda, hawa watoto hawajawahi  kuona vita.Hayati Mzee  Jomo Kenyatta pamoja na wengine ambao hawako pamoja nasi leo walipigana vita ili  kumfukusa Mzungu kutoka nchi yetu.

DULYAAR:  Thank you very  much,  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, for giving me  this opportunity to join my colleagues in support of this Amendment  Bill.	It is true that the 14th and 20th  days of October are veryclose and therefore  we  support this Bill very strongly.	Secondly,I stand to challenge  the  Church leaders of come denanations in	this country,particularly,  those  from the C.P.K.  and the  Catholic  Churches. 	I know that  not all  the bishops from these two denominations are involved in oomosing the  Government.	I would  like  to take this opportunity to tell fellow Kenyans that just because a statement is made by a bishop,  does not mean that that  statement is	 from  God  himself. A bishop  is  just like any otherhuman being;  he  is a sinner and we cannot even be sure that he himself is a Christian.   I an saying this because when Jesus Himself was in this world, he was opposed by the Pharisees and the  Scribes,  but he told them that although they claimed to know all  about God,  they knew very little about Him,   and Jesus found them to be the worst sinners. Today,  we are not  sure that      Bishop  Okullu is a Christian nor are we  sure that Bishop .Kuria is a Christian. I think these people are behaving  just like the Pharisees used to behave 	daring the  time of Jesus. Let me remind them that  Nicodemus Who  was a 	pharisees came to  Jesus during  the night and he repented and  was forgiven. 	These bishops are talking  about corruption in our country but I wonder Whether 	they are teaching their congregations to turn from their corrupt ways and believe in God.	I as saying this because we  are  told that	80 per cent ofthe population in this country is Christian and therefore, those corruptpeople they are talking about must be coming from the C.P .K.,  Catholic,.the	A.I.C  and all the other churches. It  is their responsibility toteach the  Christians to repent and. </newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER,  OFFICE OF TEE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah): On a point of order, Mr.  Temoorary Deputy Speaker,  Sir. I wonder whether it is in order for the hon.

He is condemning the  Catholics,  the  C.P.K.,  the A.I.C and all other denomincations and I think he is completely out of order and Should withdraw that remark and apologize.	Some  of us are very good  catholics and I would not acceptsuch a criticism whereby an hon.

MWAMZANDI:  On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Eeputy Speaker, Sir. I think the hon. Assistant Minister is most  unfair to the hon. Member because as we all know the largest percentage of the population in this country is Christian.   The hon.

Order!Shall we continue contributing to Bill? </newspeech><newspeech>MR. BULYAAR:	Sir,  I was  just  referring to  the  Bible. In Romans  Chapter 13,  the Bible  says that the  church leadersshould pray to for authorities,  and that  is what we expect ofthem.	If there  is any corruption that  they know,  they have  theBibles  in their hands  and they can teach people how to  change	theirbad habits. Sir,  Jesus Christ himself called Zaccheus  (Zakayo) who was  a Theif  he had  been stealing money as  a tax collector so that he could beEven Zaccheus himself changed his way of life  and refunded people their money back,  I think,four times. 	So,   true  Christians  should pray for theircountry  so  that those they suspect to be corrupt can change  their hearts  and become  good citizens,  in the  same way Jesus Christchanged Zaccheus to become  a Christian. 	Sir,  we  do not need to change the  system in order to correct the corrupt people. 	If we  change  the  system,  the  corrupt people willstill continue  to  steal money.	But what we need here'is for the good people  or Christians to teach the corrupt people and I am sureby change  of heart those people will be corrected.	That is what we  expect of our Bishops.Again,  Sir,  are  those Bishops  sure  that the  corrupt people they are  talking about are not their church members,  children and so  on?   As  a leader,  I must check myself first to see whether I am  Doing the  right thing. I have to be an exampIe to my people  in	Laisamis  Constituency.	Sometimes the  corrupt people  or employeesMay be  the  sons  and daughters  of Okullu or Kuria and so  on.	Yetthese Bishops talk of corruption always. As leaders,  they haveequal rights  to  tell Kenyans  the wrongs  that  they know of	Also  in the  Bible  there was a High Priest whose name wasEli whose  sons were  corrupt.	When they heard that the  Israeliteswere  bringing the  burnt  offerings,  they took the  best part  of itfor themselves  instead  of giving it to  the  Lord.	They took it  andGod has punished the  family  of that  oldman.	Therefore,  our Bishopsmust be  aware  of that. 	They should read the Bible  carefully, properly and follow it because they may also fall in that  trap. 	Sir,  I am  sure  that the word of God  is very clear.   thank His Excellency the President for the  peace and stability that    we have  in this country.  Kenyans know and love  one  another as brothers and sisters regargless of where they come  from.  Those who  come  from Northern kenya,  Central and Coast Provinces,   know  one  another  as  brothers 	because  we have     One party 	kanu  and  one president  Who  has  demonstrated  love  to  all  of  us.

Je.hamwoni  raha?,   Kabila  langu  Pia  linawakilishwa  Serikalini.	Jelhamwoni  raha?	Tuna	Wasornali,	iakamba  na  kak  kadhali;:a  Serikalini.Je,   hamwoni  raha?  • e Bw-Naibu-Spika-wa  kusikiliza umekwisha;  sasa ni  wakati  wetu kuzungumza. 	Tumewasikiliza kwa muda mrefu  viongozi wa Kanisa na watu wengine  wachache,  na sasa sisi  tutaongea. Tukiongea,  tusiambiwe kwamba tunamtukana ye yote. Watu wengine wamesema uongo, lakini  sisi  tutaongea ukweli. Hivi  majuzi  nilipokuwa kule  Mecca,  nilisikia kwamba kulikuwa na fujo hapa Nairobi,  na nimeambiwa kwamba fujo  hiyo  ilikuwa  ikipinga Serikali. Mimi  nimmojawapo wa wale waliomo katika Serikali hii na nitakufa nikiiunga mkono. Miminitaendelea kuwa mwaminifu kwa Rais  Moi  katika maisha yangu yote. Kamaningekuwamo katika Kenya wakati huo,  ningefanya maandamano ya kuonyesha uaminifu kwa Rais  Moi,  huku nikiwaambia wale  wanaoipinga Serikali  hapa Nairobi  kwamba ninawapinga kule Mombasa.	Hapana ye  yote  atakayedhubutu  jambo hilo  tena.	Walewanaowafanya watoto wadogo  kuwapiga watu hawafai.	Mimi  sitaki  kumpiga ye  yote,bali  ninataka kuwa mwaminifu ndipo  tuone  tutakuwa katika hali gani  baina ya wale wampendao Rais  Moi  na wale  wasiompenda. Wale  walioongoza fujo hapa Nairobi hawadhubutu kufanya hivyo  tena kwa sababu wakifanya hivyo,  watakiona  cha mtema kuni. Kenya  sio  Nairobi  peke yake,.bali  ni  kubwa.	Haifal  watu  fulanikuwabeba watu wengine  kwa gaii  na kuwaleta hapa kufanya maandamano.	Hivi  majuzi,nilikwenda kule  Nakuru na watu 2,000.	Mhe.  ole  Ntimama aliwapeleka watu	5,000kule  Nakuru.	Kwa hivyo,  haifai  kuwaleta watu hapa  Nairobi  kufanya maandamano.Ikiwa watu wanachezea pesa kwa kufanya hivi,  basi  sote  tunaweza kufanya hivyo, lakini  ninaamini  amani  na upendo kwa sababu ninajua kuwa ukabila ni  mbaya. Hii ndiyo  sababu ninasema kwamba  tunafaa kuwa na umoja  ili  wale  ambao hawajua mambo bado waweze  kujua. Ninasikitika kusikia kwamba ni  lazima  tuugeuze  mtindo wa Serikali  ya Kenya. 	Wale wanaotaka kuwa marafiki  zetu,  hata wawe Warusi,  Wachina,  Wajapan au makabila mengine watakuwa marafiki  zetu,  lakini  hatutamsikiliza adui  yetu ye yote. -Hatutamsikiliza mtoto ye  yote  akitwambia  eti  kwamba  fulani  ni  mbaya.	Sasa  tunafaakutambua ni  nani  aliye  rafiki yetu.	Umesikia kwamba mataifa fulani  makubwa  7 vingi- vya kisiaba, -lakini-vile-yatakavyo-sivyo. 	Hapo-zamani,  Hitler alikuwa  akiziendesha Serikali  za watu wengine kwa nguvu za bunduki,.lakini  watu wengine  walibadilisha nia.	Hata mataifa  fulani  yalipiganishwawakati  huo,  lakini  sasa wale  walioyapiganisha wamebadilisha mwenendo.	Siku hiziwanakupa pesa na kukwambia uwasikilize  na kufanya watakavyo.	Watu hawa wanaonakwamba Wafrika ni kitu kimoja na wanasikilizana. 	Kwa hivyo,  wansema,  "We will not be  able  to play around with them. We  must  form  two political parties." Wanasema hivi  iii  tusipomsikiliza kiongozi wa chama kimoja,  tumsikilize wa kile kingine. Watu hawa wanaongeza kusema,  "To control  them,  we should divide  them." Vyama vingi  vya kisiasa vinawaganya Wafrika. 	Watu hao wanajua kwamba ikiwa mhe. Mahihu ndiye  rais,  makabila yote ya Kenya yatamsikiliza na wachochezi hao hawatawatawala Wakenya. Kwa hivyo wachochezi  hawa wanasema ni  lazima kuwe na Shariff Nassir  iii wapigane na mhe.  Mahihu. Watu hawafai  kusema mabaya juu ya kupiga mstari wakati wa uchaguzi au kuongea juu ya rigging ya uchaguzi. 	Nimefikishwa kortini  mara nne  kwa petition. Walionifikisha kortini  walikuwa wakisema eti kwamba debe la kura limeibiwa, Serikali ni  mbaya,  uchaguzi  wa kutmia madebe ni mbaya na hawataki kutumia madebe. Kwa hivyo,  tulikwenda kortini  na kuwanufaisha mawakili. Mawakili  hawa walitumia pesa  zetu ajabu,'huku  watu wakisema eti kwamba wakuu wa wilaya na maajenti wa wapigiwa kura ni wabaya,  debe moja lilikutwa likiwa na kura nyingi au debe moja lilitupwa baharini. Kwa hivyo  tukaanzdckupiga mlolongo nyuma ya wataka kura. Kwa sababu tutakuwa na review,  watu wanafaa kuachwa wayatoe maoni yao,  lakini hata tukiyakubali  maoni haya,  tutakuja kusikia mambo mengine  zaidi yaliyo mabaya zaidi ya yale ya zamani. Mimi  ninasema kwamba heshima inafaa kudumishwa katika Kenya.	Yuleatakaye kuheshimiwa akiwa rais ni  lazima amheshimu Rais aliyepo sasa hivi.	Ikiwahumheshimu Rais wa sasa,  siri yako ni nini na hali Nassir atakufanyia fujo utakapokuwa rais? Ulinzi  wako ni nini  ikiwa humtaki Rais Moi? Ni  kwa nini unataka rais mwingine,  na hali  tunakwambia kwamba hatumtaki huyo.   'Utakapokuwa rais,  tutakuja kufanya fujo hapa Nairobi,  huku tukinyakua mikufu ya wenyewe,  kuiba mali ya watu na kuvunja  magari ya Ktira hivyoTheshima ni  kitu Cha bure na  tunafaa kuheshimiana.	Binadamu hachukui  uongozi  kwa nguvu,  bali  anaupewa naMungu.	Tutamheshimu ye  yote  atakayekuwa kiongozi  wa Kenya hata  ikiwa ni  wakabila gani,  bora  tu  atufanyie  mazuri.	Tulimheshimu hayati  Kenyatta na,  vivyohivyo,  tutaendelea kumheshimu  Rais Moi  na rais  atakayemfuata.	Tunafaa kuwa nasubira na hatufal  kuwatetesha Wakenya eti kwa sababu Shariff Nassir anataka kuwa Makamu wa Rais. Hata  ikiwa ninataka kuwa Makamu wa Rais,  tusiwaache Wakenya kutetana,  kupgana na kumwaga damu eti  kwa sababu  tunataka kuwa na Wizara kubwa na kupeperusha bendera kubwa. Makabila yote ya Kenya tunafaa kujihadhari  ili tusifanye  jambo hili. Hivi  majuzi,  Bw.  Naibu Spika wa Muda,  kulitajwa shadow cabinet,  lakini hii  haifai  sasa. 	Hata wakati  wa hayati  Rais  Kenyatta,  jambo hili  lilizuka. 	Wakati CV huo,  wanaume  walionana na wanaume  wengine.	Tulifanya maandamano  kote  katika Kenya.Kama kuna shadow cabinet,  sote  tunafaa kufanya maandamano ya kuipinga.	Ye  yotealiyetajwa kuwa katika shadow cabinet na marafiki  zake si  adui  zangu mimi,  kwa sababu mimi ni Waziri  Msaidizi,  bali  ni  adui ya mwanangu.	Mtu huyu anataka  tukuzusha vita katika Kenya.	Kama nisemavyo  kila mara,  hatufal  kuyachukua mambohaya kuwa rahisi.	Waswahili husema kwamba ukimtambua mtu kuwa anaweza kukupiga,amekwishakupiga kofi  tayari.	Ikiwa watu hawa wanaweza kuunda jama zao,  hatakuzitekeleza wanaweza  pia. Bw.  Naibu  Spika wa Muda,  naunga mkono. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  MWENDWA: 	Thank you,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  for giving me  also this  opportunity  to  join other hon.  Members  in supporting this Bill.  	This  Bill  requires  that  a day  be  set aside  during which we should remember the contribution  that our President has made and will continue  to make thereafter. Let me repeat a few known efforts made by the  President.  His  contribution in  all fields  of Human endeavour is welcome. During the 12  years he has  led  this  country he  has  contributed greatly to  sports  development as evidenced by the  existence  of Moi International  Sports Centre,  Kasarani,  Nyayo National Stadium,  the quality and quantity of  sportsmen  and  sportsmanship. Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Sneaker,  Sir,  in  education expansion has  gone  beyond expected limits;  over the  last 12  years  he has established three  more universities,  which is  not  a simple  matter, and the  number  of university students has  increased greatly. we  know that 12  per  cent  of Kenyan  population is a very able  and could benefit  from university education.	But we  have  not  even reached thatpercentage.	The  important thing is  that we  are moving in the rightdirection under  the  wise  and able  leadership of our President. We  have  also  seen his concern for his fellow men. 	This is seen in his  efforts  to  conserve  and  preserve  the  environment. Provided school children with milk,  whose  benefits  are  well known,  over the  last 12  years;  when you go round the  country you can recognise 	the good health and well-being of  school  children. Thirdly, he hasconstructed Nyayo Wards to  enable  people  to  get  treatment  easily and comfortably. We  should  also remember his wonderful devotion to serve his  fellowmen as  is  shown by his  frequent visits  to various parts  of our  country so  that he  may get  to know the  grassroot needs of his people  and 	find releirant  solutions  to  them. As I  said earlier,  his foresight  is,  indeed,  phenomenal and self-evident.	Since  the  start  of the	Multi-party debate he has  beenwarning us that the  existence  of such a system at this time wouldcause  great  problems to Kenyans.	The  end of this debate was,  indeed,a  show of what would happen  should the  system exist:	There  was hooliganism  and  thuggery,  which  attested  to  what  would happen  if  the system  existed.	Can  we,   therefore,   imagine	 if  the  mention  of  itwould  cause   such  problems	  what  the   situation  would  if  the  actualsystem  existed? </newspeech><newspeech>DR.   WAMEYO:	On  a  point   of  order,  Mr.   Temporary  DeputySpeaker,   Sir.	I am sorry to point out that we can hardly hear thehon.  Member  who  is   speaking. We    do not know whether  the  problem  iswith  the  microphone   or  his  low  tone,  but  we  would  very much  like to  hear  him. </newspeech><newspeech>MR. MWENDWA: 	Thank  you,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker. will  raise  my  voice   and  I  thank  the  hon.  Member  for  pointing  out that  he  is  not  hearing  my  important  contribution. I  was  talking  about  the   great  foresight  of  our  President, which  he  has   shown  by  telling  us  what  would  happen  if  a   multi-party  system  existed  and  that  we  recently  got  a  dose  of  it. I  would  also  like  to  touch  on  our  President’s humility.You  will  recall  during  a  recent  rally  in  Nakuru he  declined make aCall   to make him  life  president.	Such,   therefore,   is   the  humilityof  the men	we   are  talking  about  and in  honour  of  whom we  aredebating  to  establish  a  holiday. I think his greatest  has  been  the	formulation  of  theNyao  Philosophy  of  Peace,.Love  and  Unity,  which  shows  his  greatlove  for  peace.	This  is  why  he  has  been  invited    elsewhere  tohelp  establish  peace  in  other  countries  where  there  have  been  problems.If  other  countries were   to  follow  this  Philosophy  carefully  and=	strictly  we  would not  have  kinds  of  problems.Let  me  also  touch  on  our  President's  internationalstanding.	We  know he  has  been  invited  to  various  places;   in  somecases  to  negotiate  for  peace  and  in  others  to  give  keynote  speechesabout  the  environment	  this  indicates  his	international	- standing and we should do everything to ensure that this standing lasts. With these words, I would like to support. </newspeech> <newspeech>MR. TERER: Ahsante sana,  Bu.  Naibu Spika wa Muda kwakunipa	nafasi hii iii  niseme  machache	juu ya mswada huu ambai	wenyeweumeletua katika wakati ufaao  na hii  ni  kuonyesha kwamba   wananchivote  wana imani  na	Rais Moi.	kwanza Rais Moi ni mualimu wa kwanzakatika nchi yetu.	Ameaana watoto wa shule  za rasing maziwa,anenanua shule  oa unili  na vyuo vikuu na vile vile akauanzisha mfuno  mnya wa e	ua 8-4-4.atika kilimo,  amakima   lritilia mkazo utafiti na tumenata maendeleo makubwa kutokana na juhudi  zake;  tena yeye huria ingeni mashuhuri katikakaribu maonyesho yote  ya Limo hapa nchini.  Bw.  Naibu  Spika wa Muda,  Mtukufu Rais  amekuwa akiyatiliamkazo mambo yanayohusiana na afya.	Hata mara nyingi  Mtukufu Raishuwatembelea wagonjwa hospitalini na kuwapa pole. Katika mambo hayaya afya,  utafiti  umezidi  sana kutokana na juhudi  hizo za Mtukufu Rais. Tunajua na kufurahia uvumbuzi  wa dawa ya kukinga ugonjwa wa  Ukimwi inayojulikana kama Kemron,  ambayo  imeiletea nchi yetu ya Kenya sifa kubwa kwa sababu inaponyesha ugonjwa huo wa Ukimwi. Pia,  Mtukufu Rais  amekuwa akiyatilia maanani  sana mambo ya kitamaduni,  na sote tunafahamu vyema kwamba amekuwa akitueleza kuwa tusiusahau utamaduni  wetu kwa sababu  inajulikana vema kwamba  "Msahau utamaduni  ni  mtumwa". Pia,  itakumbukwa kwamba wakati  fulani  tulikuwa na matatizo fUlani  katika mbugha zetu  za wanyama,  kwa kuwa hakukuwa na usalama wa kutosha. 	Ingawa hivyo,  sasa hali ya usalama  imekuwa ni  nzuri na hata idadi ya wanyama wa porini  imeongezeka kutokana na  juhudi  za Mtukufu Rais. Kuna  aina fulani  za wanyama  ambazo  karibu  zimalizike kabisa katika mbugha zetu  za wanyama,  lakini  sasa zimeongezeka marudufu. Hii  ni  kuonyesha wazi  kwamba Mtukufu Rais  anayajali  maslahi yetu,  kama binadamu,  na hata ya wanyama. Tunatoa  shukrani  nyingi  sana kwa Mtukufu Rais  kwa sababu amekuwa akiwasaidia wakulima sana iii  waweze kuiuza mimea yao kwa wingi. Kwa njia hiyo hatuna  tatizo la njaa,  ama la kuuza mazao nje.  Filosofia ya Nyayo,  kama  ilivyoelezwa hapo awali na wehzangu,  ni moja iliyoanzishwa na Mtukufu Rais  mwenyewe. Hii  ni  Filosofia  ambayo  imeifanya nchi  hii  iwe na hali ya usalama,  tumepata maendeleo na,  hata majirani wetu wamekuwa wakituonea wivu  kwa sababu tumekuwa na muda mrefu sana wa utulivu na maendeleo. Jina  la nchi yetu  linajulikana sana ulimwenguni kwa sababu Mtukufu Rais  amewahi kuzitembelea nchi  nyingi  sana za ng'ambo na kuweza kuliweka jina  la nchi  yetu  juu kabisa.  Bw.  Naibu  Spika,  nikigusia mambo ya kilimo,  upandaji wa majani chat,  kahawa na katani ni  mambo  ambayo Mtukufu Rais  ameyatilia mkazo sana na,  kwa sasa,  inaonekana tutaweza kujitegemia ikiwa tutazifuata nyayo zake kwa kuwa tutakuwa na bidhaa za kuuza ng'ambo na kujipatia pesa za kigehl. Kuhusu siasa za vyama vingi vya kisiasa,  Mtukufu Rais ametuambia kinaganaga kwamba wakati haujawadia wa kufanya hivyo. 	Hii ni  kwa sababu vyama vingi  vitazusha mgogoro na,  pengine,  tutarudia ukabila kwa sababu kwa miaka-hii 27  tangu kujinyakulia Uhuru,  tumekuwa tukiutupilia ukabila mbali  pole  pole. Ingawaje,  kwa sasa ukabila haujaangamizwa,  unaweza kufufuliwa na siasa za vyama vingi  vya kisiasa.  Hii  ni  kwa sababu bado hatujakuwa kitu kimoja,  na tunamwunga mkono Mtukufu Rais  kwa kuseMa tuendelee kuwa na chama kimoja mpaka wakati wa kuwa na vyama vingine utakapowadia. 	Kwa hayo machache,  naunga mkono. mr.  mangoli; 	Thank you very much,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir,  for giving me  this  opportunity to contribute  on this very  important Public Holidays  Bill.	Why  should we  talk about Moi  Day?	That  is  what  isimportant here.	We  are  trying to  look  back  at the records  to establishwhat President Moi  has  done  to deserve  this  great  day  in  his  remembrance. This  is  because of the good work he has  done  for  this  country. That  is the reason why  the  Attorney-General  has  introduced  this  Bill  here,  to  be passed by  this  House,  so  that we honour  such  a statesman who has  fought so well  and made this  country  so peaceful,  the way  it  is  today. This  is a man  in the name of His Excellency President Daniel Toroitich arap Moi;  a humble man with a lot of humour and courage even in  the. face of the things  that happened  the  other day. 	I  say so repeatedly  because it  is  because  of his worrior stance  that this country has been able  toget where it  is,  particularly  at  this very moment. We are saying  this without  fear because  it  is  important  to  talk about Moi  Day.  Moi  Day  is  a great day;  a day  that we  want  to honour a  living President so  that he  always knows  that we respect him. 	We do not want to do  it in  the Luhya way where we honour people only after they have died and bring  so much money  and presents.	We want  to appreciate the work doneby His	Excellency the President,  while he is still alive so that hecan hear  it  loud and  clear.	He will  know  that we have set this day asidebecause we want to remember what he has done  for this country. Sir,  His Excellency  the President has done  very many things. If we refer to records,  then we should ask ourselves why we are being forced by  our  enemies  in foreing countries  against our wishes?	The reasons arevery  basic.	I  have  almost prophesied that the reasons  for which we arebeing  fought,  especially  in this year 1990,  is  that we discovered medicine which  the Americans  themsselves  have not discovered.	We  are  being  sincereand humble  to  them.	If the Africans  can in  this Century discover drugswhich  the Whitemen have never discovered,  that means  that the Kenya Government  is  busy.	Our  foreign problems  are  not  because we have any  internalproblems.	We  are very busy under the able  leadership  of His  Excellencythe President. Sir,  the  day we are talking about is one we want to be commemorable,  a day when  people  sit  back  and  reflect on what His  Excellency  the President has  done.	This  is what we are talking about.	We will  reflecton the  fact that he  introduced the Jua Kali  sector.	This  introductionwas actually the. first time we saw an industrial revolution in Kenya.  But our foreign friends  are not happy.	They  think an African  is  so shortsighted that  it is  almost  impossible for us to discover anything.	So,  weare  telling them that we  are prepared to discover more and this  is why  they are worried. Sir,  for the  first time,  Kenya has manufactured  a local  car, using local materials,  without having to go and seek assistance from  4 .4 Japan,  Great Britain or the United States of America.	That  is what  isat  stake  for us.	This  is why we are being fought for having made suchgreat  strides.	The  foreigners would prefer a foreigner like them,  aMacDonald  to discover  things,  even in our own villages,  but not us. We  are telling  them  that because of these achievemehts,  the great son of Kenya,  through whose eforts we have achieved these things,  Daniel Toroitich arap Moi,  must have a special day on which we commemorate these developments. We are saying that during the  12 years  that His Excellency the President has  held  the reigns  in Kenya, we have established many universities. It  is  important for the people  to know that it  is His Excellency the President who also  came  out to assist the  sick people by establishing the Nyayo Wards.	This  is  why  we  are  now honouring him.	We  are very happy and would  like  to express that happiness in this way.	We  are  saying  that this  is  a statesman who has preserved,  under his Ministerial  appointments, our African culture,  by having the Ministry of Culture  and Social Services.  Recently,  when the other great son of Africa,  Mr.  Nelson Mandela,  visited Kenya and  I  want  to speak on this particular  issue   because it touches on statesmanship 	-we saw something that we did not like. One would want to find out why the Mandela rally was  sheduled for Moi  International Sports Centre,  Kasarani,  instead of Moi Stadium.	Many people wanted to go and see Mandela but they could not do so becausethe meeting was  called at a short notice and  there were no arrangements.	Whywas  the meeting held at Kasarani? 	Nobody  has  explained  that  to  this nation,  despite the fact  that many Kenyans wanted to  see  this great son of Africa who questioned the democracy  Whites are talking about when they detained our people during the time  they ruled this nation. We want  that to be heard loud and clear,  and I want the Ministry  of  Information and Broadcasting  to tell Kenyans what happened  that day because  the speech  of  the great  son of Africa was not shown live. Why  should the Ministry  show us pictures  of Wazungus  and not Mandela. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  the. other day  I posed the  same question  to  the Minister for  Information  and Broadcasting,  but he  seems  to  take too  long  to  come up  with an  answer. We want  to know why  Mr.Mandela's  speech was not  shown  live. I  am  raising  this  matter here because  today we  are  talking  about a great day  that  is being put aside to appreciate what the great son of this country,   in  the name of President Daniel  Toroitich  arap  Moi,  has  done. That  is why  I  am asking  the Minister  for  Information and  Broadcasting  to  explain what happened  to  Kenyans. (Hon.  Members  applauded  as hon.  Saitoti  entered  the  Chamber) Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  we  do appreciate the arrival  of His Excellency  the Vice-President and Minister for Finance because he is a defender  of Nyayoism  and we all support him.	We hope that all other Ministersalso support him.	We  say many  things here,and when  at  times  I  say  here  thatsome Ministers are "kombo kombo",  I was told here that they are not. 	But,  over a period,  we have realised what they are.  R	•Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  there are other things  that have come  in the newspapers.

I  do understand that  "kombo kombo"  in English means  zig-zag  and,  therefore,  it  follows  that what the hon.

Your ruling  is clear that the word  "kombo kombo"  should be withdrawnunreservedly.	If hon.  Mang'oli would withdraw that word unreservedly,  then yourruling would be lived up to.	But  if he starts chenga chenga himself,  avoidingthat unreservedness, then we cannot accept  that.	We must maintain  the honourand the dignity  of this House.	Under our Standing Orders,  he must withdraw theword unreservedly. </newspeech> <newspeech>MR.  MANG'OLI:	Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I  do not know whyI  am being  followed by  the Assistant Minister.	And  he  is  using other words  like"chenga chenga".	I  think you heard him say  that and,  first of all,  he must withdraw those remarks  and then I  will withdraw mine. </newspeech><newspeech>THE  TEMPORARY  DEPUTY  SPEAKER 	(Mr.  Mahihu): 	Order,  hon.  Mang'oli. The ruling of   the Chair  is  that you withdraw  the word  "kombo kombo"  unconditionally. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  MANG'OLI:Okay,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir.	I  withdrawunconditionally,  but  I  am sorry  that  the only  thing</newspeech><newspeech>HON.  MEMBERS:	Do not  say  "but".</newspeech><newspeech>MR.  MANG'OLI:	Sir,  I  withdraw unconditionally. ri • Mr.  TeMporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  we appreciate' the work done byHis Excellency  the President.	But,  if you look  at  the Editorial  column of theDaily Nation newspaper  today,  you will see that there is this ICDC money and itis  said  that expatriates are being paid KShs.100 million,  and only KShs.38,000is what will  come here.	This one reminds us that if the situation is like that,the International Monetary Fund  (IMF)  and the World Bank should be sincere tous.	If they are giving us money and almost a half of it is remaining with theMand then  theY  say  that we are mismanaging the money here</newspeech><newspeech>THE  VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR FINANCE	(Prof.  Saitoti):	Ona point  of  information,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir.	Let me correct theerroneous  impression which was created by one of the newspapers to the effectthat a sum  of six million dollars,  which is being provided by the World Bank andAIDA	(?)  Credit  to restructure the three development finance institutions,  thatis,  thd  Industrical  and Commetmial Development Corporation,  the IndustrialDevelopment Bank and the Development Finance Company of Kenya,  more than 80 percen of it will be used to pay salaries for expatiates. 	Mr:	Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,	.I want  to  submit tothis  House  that  that was a proposal and we have already worked outa revision of the way we want this money to be used.	Over  60 per  centof that  money will be used to train.	our  own Kenyans;  both locallyand abroad.	Only a sma11  portion will be used to finance a fewexperts who will be looking into a few of our institutions which are ailing today.'   I hope.that the hon.Member will takethat  information into account as he makes his contribution. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.	MANG,OLI:	Mr.' Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I wouldlike to thank His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister forFinance  for that  information.	I  say that  the wananchl have read thateditorial  in the	Daily Nation.	It  is  good that His Excellencythe	Vice-President  and Mirister for Finance has madethat correction.	It  is  a good correction because  our people  now knowthat the  situation is  different  from what  was described  in thatnewspaper  editorial.'   This  is because the , people  are  saying"If this  is what the World Bank does, then they are the people who are  sabotaging our economy." But the  Vice-President and  Minister for Finance  has  cleared the whole  issue..   Let us  also  be  told how much it will  cost to train people  overseas. This  is because  if it is cheaper to train our people  locally then we  should not  send them out  for training abroad. </newspeech><newspeech>AN HON.  MEMBER:  With those  few remarks? </newspeech><newspeech>R.  MANG’OLI: 	Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  there  is no question of saying "with those  few remarks".  Touching on the  things	that are  being said by  someof  our bishops,  I was  almost  disheartened this morning when I heard that Kanu Headquarters  condemned the youthwingers who confronted Bishop Oknllu   Kanu youthwingers  are the  askaris of Kanu.  So, when Kanu  is being attacked and I want Kanu Headquarters to hear this loud and clear  you do not  expect  the kanu soldiers to  sit back and see  the  party being attacked.	Let  us not  pretend here;  we  knowwhat the  problem is.   If the Bishop continues  If Bishopokullu is  found in Webuye  and  I  am not  mincing any words  the Kanu youthwingers will take  on him. If the  bishops wantus to  go down,we will go down with them.   I am not  going to tell my youthwingers to sit back and watch Kanu being attacked;  when the  bishops  are  saying that Parliament must be dissolved and  that Kanu must resign.   Must we  allow Bishop Okullu to continue preaching politics  and  inciting wananchi against  the  Government?	Do youexpect  my Kanu youthwingers  to  sit  back and  say  "Hallelujah"?	Weare  telling Kanu Headquarters to be careful.	If Kanu goes down itwill  go	down with all  of us;  we  are  all kanu members.	Outsiderslike  bishops  should know that Kanu is vigilant. </newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONIAENT AND NATURALRESOURCES	(Mr.' K'Ombudo):	On a point  of	information,  Mr.  TemporaryDeputy Speaker,  Sir.It  is  my   pleasure  to  inform the hon.  Member contributingthat  the  incident reported in all the newspapers this morning wasreported to have taken place  in Nyakach  at a place called Rae. Itshould be remembered that I am the kanu Chairman,	NyakachSub-branch.   I have investigated this matter fully,  in my capacity as 	Chairman of that  Sub-branch,  and found  that nothing irregular took place.   The Kanu youthwingers never entered the  church because the Bishop was preaching in that church.  But the Kanu youthwingers,  outside the  church,  met okullu thePolitician!   When you call upon the  Government to resign and you call upon the President  to resign;  you call  for  the  dissolution of 74"anu and the  dissolution of Parliament,  that  is high politics and the Bishop,  having entered politics,  cannot c1_Pi,1 to be given the chance to play privileged politics,   Politics has its rules and there is no question of Playing privileged politics. If it  is raining and you decide to wear you white  suit to go and weed in the garden you cannot  complain   about mud  spoiling your  suit.  That is notpossible;  the Bishop has  chosen politics  and while  in politics he must  face  it  as  it  is. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  MANG'OLI:	Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I  amhappy to know that  the  Chairman of.	Kanu,  Nyakach Sub-branch  isalso with me.   Therefore  I am telling the Kanu Headquarters who released that  statement  to the  Press  to wake  up and face the reality. This  is because we are  not  prepared to go down;  if those people succeed,  hon.   Mang’oli will not  be here. Let  the Kanu HeadQuarters not  be  cheated;  they will have  no offices.   They should not play the politics  of compromise  because  the  issue here  is  that  we  must resign and dissolve  this Parliament.	When you say that there  are no checksand  balances,  you are not  correct.	I  am telling those  people  thatthey are wrong.	I am happy that	my brother hon. K’ombudo hasabsolutely agreed with me.	So,  Dr. Henry okullu should betold  in no uncertain terms that we are no longer going to dilly-dally., We  speak if the whole  affair is  over;  the thing is not  over. When you see the  Catholic Bishops  start iSSIling pastoral letters it means that the  war is  on.	So,  we  must remain  vigilant  all the  time. 	Let us tell the whole world that we  are here  to  stay;  we  are not  on transit.  vt-.4 We are not just passing through Kenya;  we are here to  stay.   Those who want  to live  in Kenya must respect  our laws. 	Our Constitution is very clear  on these  matters.   We  are  emulating the  Great  Son of Africa,  President Daniel arap Moi.	We want  to  set  aside  one  day toshow honour to him;  to remember what he has been doing for us.Peoplewill remember that he did  so much for us  and yet  we  gave himonly a day.  His Excellency the President hat done a lot of things during the 	12 years that  he has been President  in this country.  If you look in and aroundNairobi, you can see how many buildings have been put up during that period. However,  there are certain people in this country who do not seem to appreciate what he  has done. I do not know whether  they  will appreciate  these things if they have by now not see what development our President has brought about in this country.	If you look in the field of education,  you would find thatour achievements have more than doubled.	Similarly in  the field of Health,we have witnessed the establishment of Nyayo wards all over the country and this too  is a great achievement of health services in this country.  In Education, we have  established several universities and polytechnics inthis country.  Apart from Education  and  Health,  we are also talking about the improvement   in road services. We have more roads in Kenya tamarcked than we have ever   had before. </newspeech><newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER:  Do not  forget  the  bursaries. </newspeech><newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI:  Thank you very much.  An hon. colleague of mine here is reminding me of yet another chievement by  His Excellency the President   the education bursaries for the poor children. Another  important achievement by the President is that  when we had a problem of food Shortage in this country is that  the President  took it upon himself to go and look for food for us abroad. Therefore,  it  is important  to  get these records very clear. </newspeech><newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER:  And the Tea   Zones. </newspeech><newspeech>MR. MANG’OLI:	 there   is also the tea zones.	what  else can we  sayabout this   man  our President?   He  has restructured the whole process of producing and marketing of tea and coffee  in this country. 	All  these things have been the  brain workof one Person - His Excellency the President. He  is one person who is mindful of the disabled;  that is the people who cannot walk;  people whom cannot even  see and so on. Some of these people have even found a place at  the  Olympics and I think this is great. So,  we are talking about  setting aside  a day,  in total appreciation of what our President has done,  in order to remember him for the achievements he has  C Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are not saying  these things for the  sake of it, but we are doing so because we know that the short time that he  has been the President of this country,  His Excellency President Daniel arapMoi  has achieved a lot for this ccuntry, and let nobody tell us something contraryto  this.	our roads have been tarmacked,	many  educational institutions havebeen established and so on.	I	would  like	to  take  this opporturity to	appealto  Government 	Ministries to demostrate their responsibilities by assisting the President in the difficult task that he is undertaking  We do not  want  to hear that  there is no medicine   in our hospitals. 	we do not  wan, to  hear that  maize is not being supplied to consumers nor do we want to be told that  rice  is in short supply. 	The people behind these  shortages are the one  Who  are undermining the Nyayoism and in saying so,  I am  being very clear in mind,  and these people Should understand what I am trying to say.  Mr.Temporary   Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  this is a person  who has done  so much for this country that we talk for days on end about his achievement and never be able to reach a conclusion. 	It  is during  this period that  we have  started receiving water right into our homes and this is another  great achievement.We also have  the programme for rural electrificationwhich is providing  wananohi  with electricity in the rural area.we haveachieved industrial revolution due to this programme because it was very well defined right  from the beginning. we  also have another ambitious programme,the  District	Focus for	Rural	Development Programme which is the brain-workof the  President we are now talking about.	He has,  through  this programme,made  sure  that  the money budgeted in this House,  is no lcnger controlled from Nairobi. This money is now being controlled, at Turkana District Headquarters,  at Bungoma District Headquarters and so on. Consequently,  this money has gone as far as webuye and those responsible for the development there have been able to  sit and decide on how they are going to use this money right down to the division level. These are the sort of achievements that we are talking about. we have witnessed ecual distribution of wealth in this country  through this kind of arangement.   However, as we know, there are seme people who are never satisfied,,Even the Bible tell us that although Pharisees and others remained with Jesus forsuch a long time, they were not able to appreciate the great miracles he had performed, nor were they able to  heed to the things that  He said to them. Even today, despite that some of of these people have been with our President for so long and they have seen what he has done and heard what he has said,  they are not able to appreciate. However, the truth of the matter is that our President has done quite a lot and we must give him total support. Every Kenyan is well represented and looked  after. If you consider the field of employment, equal opportunities have been offered to people from all tribes. If you look at the distribution of Ministries, you would find it to be very fair Even some of us at the Back Bench here, have been promoted recently and taken to the Front Bench and they are very happy to be there, What kind of appreciation car. be shown to such a kind .President? You may be a Back-Bencher today, but tomorrow, you may hear thatyou have beer. promoted to the Front Bench. Today, our Ministers and Assistant Ministers are all happy and we at the Back here are equally happy because "we have been allowed to speak our mind As a Back-Bencher, I am able to tell His Excellency the Vice-President  that we are experiencing a shortcoming here and there and when he stands up to respond, he explains to me and the House as a whole, what the position is. This is the pride of being a Back-Bencher;Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have been able to enjoy thisfreedom of speech both in this House and outside because of the leadershipof our President. He has bee able to bring about peace  love and unity in this country. Therefore, what we are saying is that in order to appreciate his achievements, we must set aside this great day in appreciation of these achievements. If foreign countries have appreciated the achievement of ourPresident ana made him the Chairman of the Preferential Trade Area, we shouldbe proud of him very much. Therefore, we all agree that this is a very important 	Billbecause it talks about setting a day tobe cerebrated as Moi Day and therefore, it is important that we all support it. Mr. Temporary  deputy  Speaker, our  President  ha s been thirking  aboutthe plight of wananchi. You will remember that there was a time the Assistant Chiefs  were forcing wananchi to contribute to Harambee and when this was "brought to the attention of the President, this was immediately put to a stop. This is why ire are saying that we as Members of president  must stand to "be counted for our support of the President. we do not want to hear Ministers or Assistant Ministers who do not deliver goods to wananchi. If there are Government projects to be started, they must "be accountable for what is happening in the Ministries regarding these projects, when we pass Motions in this  House, the Ministers responsible must make sure that hese Motions are  implemented.• Sir, oullu says he  is determined. What  is  he  determinedto  do?   He  is  determined for his  course.But we  are  telling himthat  so  long as we have Kanu and we  are  hon. Members  of Parliament, we  are  going to  declare  war on them   because we  cannot  afford any more  for them to  play around with our seats. We  are  telling them that  time has come  for all  Ministers  and hon.Nembers to  stand up and be  counted. It  is  time  for us  to  stand here  and  say that we  do not want  this nonsense  any more. It cannot be  true,  Sir. 	His Excellency the President stands up and says that this debate  is closed,  but  somebody else  comes up  in a different  way and opens up  the  debate. 	Otherwise,  talking about multi-parties  or pluralism,  it  is  something that His Excellency the President had closed down. Therefore,  for us to respect him we  must  obey what he  says. Sir,  we  are  telling Kuria  to  stay  in the church because by the  time he will  touch on Kanu,  Parliament  and  so  on,  we  shall stand up here  to be  counted. After all,  if there will  be  another Government,  there  will no  way for  them to  accept  Mang'oli  in that Government.	So,  I want to  tell him quite  clearly that  I  stand upto be  counted  on this  Government.	So,  if he wants,  we  shall  godown with him.	Therefore,  we  are  saying  here  quite  clearly thatkanu the  Party and  anybody who  thinks  otheriwee,  we  are  going to deal with them. 	If it  means  telling  our youthwingers  to move out  in every town and  find  out who  are  the  supporters  of multi-parties,  we are  going to  to  do  it. 	There  is no  diplomacy involved. If you want  to  take my  seat  as  Member for Webuye,  there  will be no diplomacy.	There  is  no question of diplomacy anywhere.	As  soonas you  say that you want my  seat,  I will  employ any tricks  or forcesto  defend my  seat.	So,  since  these  people  are  talking aboutdissolving Parliament	and in essence  talking about my seat	 • e I  have  also  declared-war-on them! (applause) There  is no way now for them to  think that we  are  joking. 	Time has  come  for them to be  told that hon.  Members are now very serious. They are  now prepared to be  counted.	We  also want to be  countedat home.	I  am having a meeting on Friday at home  and I want tofind  out  whether there  are  some multi-parties  in those  areas,and I will report back to  this House. 	It is  very important that  all hon.  Members  should bring records  of multi-parties  from their areas. Why are  they quiet?	It  is not  true  that Kuria can be  alone  in this.He must be  preaching to  people.	Is  he preaching to multi-partypeople  alone  or to good  citizens  of this country?	If he  is  preaching to  good citizens,  then a way must be  found where  youthwingers must  stop Kuria from preaching to them. We  have  respected foreign countries because we know that they give us money,  but they  should not  give us the money to dictate 	 to us who  should be  married  to Mang'oli:	My father paid for my dowry, but he  did  not decide  who  should be my wife.	They should  just giveus  the money but not to  tell us what  should be  done with the money. We  are  people with good brains.	We  have  discovered Kemron and wecannot be underrated.	We,  as Kenyans,  are respected because wehave  discovered Kemron.	We, as African Kenyans,  are respectedbecause  we have produced a car Nyayo car,  and it is important for the people  to respect us. Why  should they not respect us for that? So,  time has come  for all hon. Members here to bring us records MR.	KUBO:	On a point  of order,	Sir.	The  hon.  Member onthe  Floor  is  imputing that in some  of our constituencies,  there are  some people who  are  for multi-parties and that hon. Members are  not aware  of them,  or what is happening in their constituencies.  I would like to inform him that most.hon. Members there are  aware of what is happening in their constituencies,  and they know thatall the  people  in their constituencies are  for the Government and are  also 100 per cent behind the President! </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  MANG'OLI:	Sir,  I  am happy that hon.  Kubo  is  talkingabout his  own constituency,  but he  cannot  talk about Webuye  constituency.	So,  if he  thinks  that since his  place  is  safe,  then we  are all  safe.	But if that were  true,  as he  says,  then there  would be no reason why Okullu,  Kuria,  Cardinal and   so  on should be  speaking. So,  it  is  important that we  should find  out whether this  Catholicdocument  is  in his  area.	Also,  we want to  know whether the  Church of the  Province  of Kenya (C.P.K.)  in his  area supports  the  Government because  I  know C.P.K.  in Webuye  supports  this  Government  fully.So,  he  should not  assume  anything.	If he  knows everything,  why were  these  things  happening?   Why was  this meeting held here? Why were  there  damages  in Nairobi,  Kiambu,  Nyeri  and  so  on?   Therewas  nothing in Kakamega,  Bungoma,  WebuTe,  Busia and so  on.	We  areall behind Kanu!	This  goes  on to  say that  in the  whole  of  westernKenya,  we  are  100 per cent behind Kanu and the Government.	So, we  would  like  to be  told whether it was  the  C.P.K.  or  outsidersWho were  responsible  for the  situation in Nairobi.  .It is Importantfor hon.  Members from Nairobi  to come  out and tell us.	Time  has come  for us  all  to  stand here  to be  counted. </newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT  MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING(Mr.  Mwenje): 	Embakasi  is  clear! </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  MANG'iOLI:	But if a meeting was held  somewhere withinNairobi  area,  were there any people  from Embakasi transported to that meeting or not?   Time  has  come for us all to be counted. 	We  are  not  joking.We  are talking with a lot  of bitterness. </newspeech>(applause) <newspeech>MR.	KUBO:	On a point  of information,  Sir.	If the hon.Member  is  doubting about Taveta,  I  had a meeting on Sunday andeverybody is  for the  Government! </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  MANG'OLI:	Thank you very much.	we  are  getting morehands  and then the  outside  world will understand us.	we  are sureof where  we  are  going.	I  an sure  if Kanu is being attacked,  thenwe  are	being attacked at  our level.	I  am glad that hon.  Kubosays  that people  in his  area are  for Kanu and President Moi.

WAMBUA: 	Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,   I  brought  this Question here  because  I  have  seen  someone  with  a circular  from  the  Treasury asking him  or  her  to  fill  a  certain  form  to  indicate  when  he  or  she  will  attain the  age  of 55 years  so  that  his  or  her  pension  may  be  processed  then. Could the  Assistant Minister check  this matter once more  to find out whether  this  is done  or  not  so  that  if  there  are  incidents  of this  type  he  stops  them? </newspeech> 	<newspeech>MR.  KEAH: Mr.  Temporary  deputy  Speaker,  Sir,   I  have  checked  this matter  and  the  information  I  have  given  is  correct  in so  far  as  this  Question is  concerned. 	I  might  add,  however,  that prior  to 	11th  May, 	1990,  when the Pensions 	(Amendment)  Act became  law,  pension  increases had,  in fact,  been granted to  persons  who  fulfilled  certain conditions  set out  in section  III  of the  Pensions(Increase)  Act,  cap..190  of  the  Laws  of Kenya.	These  conditions,  one  of whichwas  the attainment of the age of 55 years,  were reviewed under the provisions ofthe  Pensions	(Increase)(Amendment)  Act  of May,	1990,  and pensioners  are  not  nowrequired to  fulfil  these  conditions before  they are granted pension  increases Hence,  prior  to  the  effect of this  amended Act,  pensioners were  required to fulfil  these  conditions,  including the  filling of a certain  form. 	However, subsequent  to  this  Act,  fulfilling  these conditions  is not necessary. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  WAMBUA: 	Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,   I  thank  the  Assistant Minister  for  his good answer,  but  I  still  ask him whether he could go and check this  matter  again  in order to  ensure  that  those who were sent circulars asking them  to  comply  with  the  said conditions  are paid their pension  increase without further complications.	The  circular  I  saw bore  a  date  prior  to  the  one  theAssistant Minister has  quoted.	Could  the  Assistant Minister make  the  necessarychanges  to  ensure  that  those  people  are  not affected by that circular? </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  KEAH: 	Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  the  hon.  Member  has actually  confirmed  that  the  circular he  saw was sent out prior to the  amended Act,  and this  is  in  line with my answer. 	I  would  like  to  take  this  opportunity to  assure  the  hon.  Member  that  subsequent  to  May, 1990,  there  are  standing instructions	pensions  officers  certainly understand them to  the  effect  thatno  pensioner  is  required to  fill  any  additional  forms.	So,  should  the  hon.  Membercome  across  any  case  contrary  to  this,  he  should get the  form  in question,  bring it  to  me either  here  in  Parliament  or  in my  office  and  I  will  duly  deal with  it. </newspeech>Question  No.	411<header> Establishment of a Kenya Consulate  in Jeddah</header> MR.

JALANGLO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir , I 	consider  that to be a very unsatisfactory answer to  a very direct  Question. The Question asks  when  the Ministry will implement the recommendation of  Siaya District  Development Committee (DDC)  to  construct  shallow ponds  in Rarieda;  I request a direct reply to  this Question. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.MWEU	: Mr.  Temporary	 Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I  havegiven the reply. I  have  said that the  money  set  aside  by the  SiayaDDC  is  the  money that we  could use to	rehabilitate  the  dams. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  JALANG'O:	Mt.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  why can the Assistant  Minister not reply to  the  question? If  funds  areavailable,  why can he  not  say how much money has been  set  aside  for rehabilitation of  the  dams?   This habit  of going round in  circles occasionally makes us raise  our voices when we  should do not do that. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  MWEU:	Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I  am not  ina position to  say how much money has been  set  aside for thispurpose.But  the Ministry wanted  to use  the  usual  channel  ofproviding money for  construction of the  new dams  through the  DDC. </newspeech> <newspeech>MR.  KUBO: 	Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir, 	the Ministry is  being asked   what  it  is  doing to  implement  the recommendation and the Assistant Minister  seems  to be  Saying that  some  funds have been set  aside  by the  Siaya DDC. But the  hon.  Member  is  asking how much the  Ministry  not the  Rural Development  Fund   has  set  aside for that project. Has  it  set  aside  any money  for  the  project  or not? </newspeech><newspeech>MR.MWEU:   Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I have  said I am not  in a position to  say how much it  is,  but given time  I  could give  the answer as  to how much we  have  set aside,  if at  all we havedone  so. </newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DL.PUTY SPEAKER	(Mt.

MWEU:	Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I said thatthe Ministry is ready to  implement  the recommendations jlthis financial year  if some  of the  funds  Siaya DDC  allocated for rehabilitation of dams  in the  district could be  spared for construction of  ponds in Rarieda Division. The  implication here  is  that we have  some  money which we would like  to  add on to whatever the Siaya DDC has  set aside  for this kind of work. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  JALANG’O:	Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  theDDC,  through  the Rural Development  Fund	(RDF)  allocates  funds	tospecific  projects.	But  I am asking the Ministry   and not the DDC	when it will implement the  Siaya DDC recommendations to construct shallow ponds  in my division;  that is  a straightforward question! </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  MWEU: 	Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  in that  case I  beg to  be  given more  time  to be  able  to fish around and find out whether the Ministry has funds  other than those  set aside by the Siaya DDC  for  the  same  purpose. </newspeech>Question No. 	416 <header> Payment  of  Retirement Benefits  to Mr.  Mwanduli  </header> MR.

Mapengo Mwanduli,  PP No. 964781, who retired in 1988,  has not been paid his  retirement benefits  to-date. <newspeech>TEE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS 	(Archbishop Ondiek): Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to reply. The  delay in payment of Mr. Mwanduli's retirement benefits was  cuased by his non-submission of  pension commutation  forms Which  Were sent to him on llth February,1988 for completion and return to	  the ministry for submission toTreasury. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.BIDU:Mr.Temporary  Deputy -Speaker, Sir, I want to Inform the Assistant kinister that.Mr.Mwanduli did not delay in	_returning his commutation ,forms. In fact,  he  came  to me with only the  duplicates. 	Can the  Assistant Minister,  therefore,  go  back and find out from his  officers,  who misled him,  whether  these  forms were  not returned in time? </newspeech><newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK:   Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  it  is not true  that my information is inadequate.	I believe  that the  formswere  not received on time.	If  the  hon.

BIDU:	Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker	Sir,  the  Assistantshould be  more  committed when answering Questions.	I  am sure  thathe was  only told that  the Ministry  sent the  forms  in February, 	1988. Is he  sure  that up to now those forms have  not been received back by his Ministry? </newspeech><newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK:   Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I have said that  the  delay arose because  the forms were not  submitted in time.

I have  answered  the  Question about how many employees have retired. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  KAGWIMA:	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  it isusual  to replace  people who retire  from an establishment.	I thoughtthe Assistant Minister would undertake  to find out how many people have  been employed to replace  those who retired so  that we  know many vacancies there  are  in that  establishment. </newspeech><newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEE.: 	Mr.  temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  we always have  casual workers who are  employed on permanent  terms when people retire. </newspeech> <newspeech>MR.  ARTE: 	On a point of order,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir. It  is  very  much  in order,  when  somebody has  retired when  in such employment, for  the  officers  concerned to employ a replacement,  whether it is a casual labourer or  any  other ordinary person.	How many  of those who have retiredhas  the Ministry replaced? </newspeech><newspeech>THE  TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER	(Mr.  Tuva):	What  is your point of order? </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  ARTE:My point of order is  that the Assistnat Minister did nottell us the number of people who have been replaced,  whether casual workers or not. </newspeech><newspeech>THE  TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER	(Mr.  Tuva):	That  is  not  a point of order. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  KAGWIMA:Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  to clear matters here,can the Assistant Minister tell us what these people's  duties were at the Chiakariga and Mitunguu road maintenance camps? </newspeech><newspeech>ARCH.  ONDIEK:Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  our duties  in theMinistry are well  known,  even to  the hon.

KAGWIMA: Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir, 	Since  they  are  not there now,  who  is maintaining the roads? </newspeech><newspeech>ARCH.  ONDIEK: Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I  do not believe the hon.  Member's  claim because  the workers  are  actually  there and are working. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  KAGWIMA:On  a point of order,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir. </newspeech><newspeech>THE  TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER	(Mr.  Tuva):	I  hope  it  is  a point  of order. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  KAGWIMA:Yes,  Mr.  TeMporary Deputy  Speaker,  it  is  a point of order.Earlier on the Assistant Minister said that he was not aware that those 15 people had been replaced. However,  he  is now saying that there  are  some people doing the job.Is he in order to claim that?Is  he not contradicting themselves whenhe  claims  that he  is not sure that those people were replaced and at the sametime contending that they are there working? </newspeech><newspeech>ARCH.  ONDIEK:	Mr. .Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I did not say that.Maybe the hon.  Member did not hear me well.I  said  that  in most cases,  when aperson retires,  there are some people who are normally working there as casual  workers  and on such retirement, one of the casual workers is absorbed inthe  place of the one who has retired. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  KAGWIMA:	Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to differwith the hon.  Assistant Minister's reply.	The reason I asked this Questionis  that for the  last five years,  or so,  bush clearing along the C92 Road from  Chiakariga to Mitunguu has not been cleared.  This  is why I raised the  issue  to  find  out what happened to those who used to clear the bush. This  is why  I am seeking to know whether those who have retired have been replaced and if the Ministry has plans to employ additional workers. </newspeech>	<newspeech>ARCH.  ONDIEK: Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  the existing establishment  at  the two roads'  maintenance Camps  is 21  sub-ordinate staff. Chiakariga has  9  of those workers while Mitunguu has 12. That establishment is  adequate  to  serve  those areas. </newspeech><newspeech>THE  TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER 	(Mr.  Tuva): 	Let us  now go on  to  the </newspeech>next Question. Question No. 	391 <header> Number  of Television Cameras  in Nyeri District</header> MR.  MUREITHI  asked the Minister for  Informan and Broadcasting how many  television cameras  are  there  in Nyeri  District  and how many times,  in  the last  financial year,  the cameras have been available to cover public functions  in Kieni  Constituency. </newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR  INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr.  Kimani): Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to reply. There is  one ENG Camera based at the office. of the ProvincialInformation Officer,  Central Province,  Nyeri.In  the  last financial yearfive public functions in Kieni Constituency were given television coverage  as  follows:- 1)A Harambee.funCtion at Narumoru Children's Home on 8th July,1989.2)  The   tour of Kenya Meat Commission officials on 28th August, 1989.3)The Nyeri District Commisssioner and local leaders  tour ofKieni East Division on 24th january,1990.   4)  The  tour of Pyrethrum Board of Kenya directors  in Kieno on 15thMay,	1990.5)	The official  opening of a business seminar at the Aberdare CountryClub by  hon.  Zakaria Maine on 6th March,	1990.Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir where a television camera was not available,  many other public functions in hon.  Mureithi's constituency were given coverage using other media at the disposal of the Ministry. 	It  is  on record,  for example,  that 31 public functions in Kieni Constituency were given Press coverage in the period under review. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  MUREITHI:	Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  can the AssistantMinister tell the House how many distridts that camera  is	supposed  to cover? </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  KIMANI:	Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  that camera issupposed  to  cover five districts;  in other words,  25  constituencies. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  KUBO: 	Mr.  Temporary-Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  from the reply by the Assistant Minister,  it looks  as  if the camera crew is only interested in the  district commissioner and other personalities from outside Kieni area. It also appears  as  if all the functions where the hon.  Member for the area is offidieting the camera crew never cover them. Can  the  Ministry correct that anomaly  because  it appears  as  if they only cover some Administration officials and Ministers,  while others are  never covered?</newspeech><newspeech>MR.  KIMANI: 	Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  the Ministry's wish to inform the public of what is happening everywhere,  whether it is being done through a meeting by the Administration officials or the hon.  Member for the partiduler. area. 	If the hon.  Member has  a particular instant which we can follow up,  I will be happy to do so and,  probably,  get the culprit punished, if necessary.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MUREITHI:   Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  the reason why   I  asked this Question is that whenever we have a function in Kieni Constituency and we Call them to come and Cover it,  they never turn up.	In actual fact,  I remember one incident where a provincial Commissioner was the guest of honour in  a Harambee  fund-raising meeting and the camera crew did not turn up.	Is  itcorrect,. then,  to say  that these people when called select where they will go to cover a public meeting? </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  KIMANI: 	Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  it would be bad for the  camera crew  to say that they will be available and then refuse to show up. However,  if the hon.  Member has e particular  incident,  as  I  said earlier,  I will be happy  to  follow up  on that.   However,  I  cannot really  generalise  and say  that all camera crew do  that. It may have happened on one  occasion,  but the hon. Member  can come to my  office with that complaint and  I will  summon the officer concerned and we get the  truth. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  MUREITHI:	Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  the  first replygiven here  is  that the camera crew covered a Harambee  fuhction at   NaruMoru Children's  Home on 8th July, 1989. 	There was no such Harambee meeting. 	I  was present in that function and  it was  an open day,  not a Harambee meeting. does the Ministry have  any evidence  to show that  its  officers  attended this  function? Even  the manner they have described the function shows  that they were not there because  it was not a Harambee meeting. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  KIMANI: 	Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I do   not have the . evidence  right now but,  if the hon.  Member comes  to my office,  I will summon the  officer who gave me the  information and we will get the truth. </newspeech>	<newspeech>MR.  KUBO: On  a point of order,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir. When  a Question is brought to this House,  it becomes the property of the House. So,  when the Assistant Minister says that the hon.  Member should go to his        Office,  I  do hot-know what he wants to cover up because the problem is all	over the country.	Therefore,  when they discuss it in the Office we have noguarantee that hon.  Members'  functions are going to be covered. </newspeech><newspeech>MR. KIMANI:	Is agree with the hon.  Member.	I will bring theanswer here. </newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let us go back to Question No.  411. </newspeech>Question No.411 <header> Establishment of a Kenya Consulate  in Jeddah </header>MR.

TERER: 	Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  when the House adjourned last week on Wednesday,  I was speaking on this Motion and I wish to thank you for giving me time to Continue. Sir,  I would like to start off by touching on the service charge money. In most cases,  this money does not go to the people who contribute it, and I would like to  suggest that district committees be formed to oversee the utilization of this money. I  am of the opinion that such committees  should be chaired by the local  district commissioners and should be composed of Members of Parliament, councillors and district officers.Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  this is a lot  of money and we  cannot leave  county councils alone to decide  on how to use this money because  they may not actually use it for the purposes it was intended.	The  District Development  Officers should act assecretaries for these  committees.	The District  Cess and ServiceCharge  Committees  should be able to  set priorities as regards the utilization  of this money.	Roads  are very important particularlyin the  agricultural districts  of this  country.	These roads shouldtake top priority. With regard to the  new Makueni District,  those  concerned should	earmark the roads which should be  given this money.	Theyshould also pinpoint the roads that need repair.	On the question ofmaintenance  of roads and machinery,  I think the Ministry shouldestablish divisional depots that are equipped. Thesedepots  should be  able  to  service vehicles  and repair them and  take care  of roads  in those particular  areas. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Sneaker,  Sir,  the Ministry  should form Divisional Roads  Improvement  Committees whose  duty will be  to take care  of the roads  at the  divisional level. These  committees should be chaired by the District Officers;  the  area Members  of Parliament,  area councillors  and the  chiefs  should  bemembers  of those  committees.	Some  of the  officers  of the Ministryshould be  supervised well.	This  is because we  cannot  entrustroads to  some  of these  officers who may not be actually very efficient and who may not  care much about the plight of the farmers.   Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  touching on contractors, I think the Ministry Should work closely with the contractors. The contractors  should be  supervised and they should be  able to do their work in accordance with the  specifications given to them. Some contractors may not  be  able  to do a good job and if they are paid before they have  completed their work then that will be a great loss to this  country. Touching on bridges,  I think there  are  a number of wooden bridges and these bridges  should be  inspected from time to time. 	This is because  some bridges fall off and if there is no regular inspection accidents may occur.The Ministry should prepare  a scheduleof inspection of these wooden bridges. Also the Ministry  should drawplans to  construct foot bridges  at  appropriate places soas  to help Wananchi especially school children,to cross rivers.This  is  because  during heavy rains  some riversoverflow their banks and we have  known of cases where people have  drowned  due  to lack of bridges across rivers. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  we would also like to know more  about the Ministry's priorities in tarmacking roads in this country.I think the Ministry should have a policy regarding thetarmacking of roads  in this  country.Also with regard to grading ofroads,  the Ministry should erect culverts at appropriate places and it  should also be  able  to murram certain sections  of the roads  so that the roads become passable throughout the year. Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  the Minister and his team of officials should visit the new Makueni District  so as to familiarize themselves with the needs of this particular diS	With those remarks,  I beg to support the Motion. </newspeech><newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS	(Mt.  Mibei):	Thank you verymuch,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  for giving me thisopportunity to  give  my views  on this Motion.	I think this Motion isimportant  in that when the roads in this area are improved people inthat  area will benefit.	This  is  in line with Government policyregarding rural development.	As you know,  the Ministry of PublicWorks follows a systematic  approach to the improvement  of roads and it  is not possible to  improve all the roads in this country at the same time.	The  improvement  of roads is  supplemented by both periodicand routine maintenance  of .	the roads  so .	that  theroads may be passble throughout the year. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  hon.  Members have  expresSe their views  on this Motion and  I agree  entirely with their suggestions and their emphasis  on the  improvement  of roads. Some  of the roads mentioned  for tarmacking under this Motion have been recommended by the Machakos- DistrictDevelopment Committee for tarmacking:   These roads are C99; part of C101 and D514. Currently,  the Ministry of Public  Works  is  experiencing problems in the  implemehtation of a number  of  on-going road projects due  to under-provision of funds  by the Treasury. The under-funding of these road projects has been prompted by a low ceiling imposed  on the Ministry of Public Works by the Treasury.   So,  in view of this  fact  the Ministry cannotcommit  itself to to  tarmacking the proposed roads  during thecurrent Development Plan period.	However,  this position may bereviewed if the  situation improves:-   The Ministry.is making all effort to maintain our roads to motorable  standards. In this respect,  during the month of February,-this year,  road No:C99,  C101 and D514 were satisfactorily graded. At present,  only a small section of Road C99 needs to be  re-graded  and this work will be  carried out as soon as  grading 	is  completed  on Road 2 E708 which is currently on-going:  $11 For the other two roads, E708 and E705,.Road E708 had been recommended by the Makachos D.D.C. for improvement under the Minor Hoads . Improvement Programme. Consequently, after evaluation, Road E708 has been: recommended for improvement under Phase Two of the Programme. Phase Two of the Programme covers the period July, 1990 to June, 1993, and although the Road is not recommended for improvement during the current Financial Year's Work Plan, it will be slotted in in the 1991/92 Financial Year. For Road E705, no improvement is planned. </newspeech><header> QUORUM</header><newspeech> DR. WAMEYO :- On a point of order Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. There is no  quorum in the House. </newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER 	(Mr.Tuva):  yes,  there  is no quorum in the House. Would you ring the  Division  Bell. </newspeech>(The Division Bell  was rung) <newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER 	(Mr.  Tuva): 	We have  a quorum now.  Would you continue Mr.  Mibei. </newspeech><newspeech>THE 	  MINISTER FOR  PUBLIC WORKS  (Mr. Mibei):  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I was  saying that Road No.E705 will be graded during the current grading operation going on in Makueni  area.   My Ministry has also approved, under the miner roads programme,  the construction of Road No.E476 Which  joins Road No. E708 during the 1991/92 Financial Year. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I would like  to  say that all the sentiments that  have been raised by hon. Members regarding  this Motion,  have 	 been taken into consideration by the Ministry. Else where in the country,   cess  has been collected from farmers and one  hon. Member raised this issue and I would like to  assure him that all the cess money is returned to the  district from which it was collected And will be kept in the district Treasury. 	The  district  commissioner who  is  the chairman of the  district development committee.  together with our officers and other from the Ministry of Local  Government,  will identify the roads to be constructed by using that money. It  appears to me  that the hon. Member who  raised this issue should be reminded that hon. Members are members of the district development committees in their respective districts and I think this is the right forum to identify the roads to be improved with the cess money. 	Mr.  Temporary Delanty'Speaker,  Sir,  we are  strengthening the maintenance section of my Ministry so,that when there is a problem on our roads, quick action is taken te  solve the  problem.I would like to  assure hon. Members   that they will  soon be realising certain changes on our roads as we go along.  Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir I am sure the hon Mover of this Motion   will remember that I visited the area and had the chance to see the various roads in this area.   I went up to Makueni and I saw for myself the  state of the roads there and I would like to assure the hon. Mover that we -Shall do what we can to improve the roads in the area in question. 	I notice that the Mover wants the Ministry to include the implementation of this Motion in the 1988/93 Development Plan but I am sure he will agree with me that if these roadS were to be  tarmacked during this period,  then  discussions for thisshould have been undertaken prior to 1988.    I am saying 		this because whatever projects were included in this development  plan have already started to be implemented and we are now half-way through and therefore,  we cannot come up at  the eleventh hour and propose to incorporate another project into the development plan.However,  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I have no quarell with thea sentimes expressed in this Motion and as I have already said, we shall do allwe can to look for the money to implement this Motion.   In so doing,  I intend to move a slight amendment to the Motion as follows.THAT,  on the nineth line,  delete the 	words " within the current Development Plan Period 	1988/93" and inserted in the place thereof the words "as soon as funds become  available.In proposing this slight amendment, I am Very serious in sayingthat if we get  this money within this financial year, or within this developmentplan period, we  Shall not hesitate to tarmac the roads that the hon. Mover hasmentioned in this Motion.   However,  it is only fair for us to make this amendmentbecause we do not want to promise something in this House Which we Cannot  fulfill.As I have already said, I would like to assure the hon. Member that we shall doeverything possible to look far these funds.   I am sure that the House also appreciaies the Ministry's position and   the need for this amendmamt. As is.the normal practice,  we get money for funding projects from the Government ofKenya or from foreign donors.	However,  when we go asking for funds from donors we are not sure when to get those funds. 	So, we shall try the much we can to assist Since I have also visited the  area,  I  am sure  the  hon.  Member is happy. He  knows that I know the  area very well  and we  shall  do  all we  can. So,  with those  few remarks,  I would like  to  propose  that amendment:  "as  soon as  funds become  available". </newspeech><newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr.  ole Kaparo):   Sir,  I would like  to  second  the  amendment proposed by the Minister for Public  Works. The hon.  Minister has  given in details what  the  Government has  done  on roads  and what it intends  to  do. It will be  appreciated by hon.  Members that the  Government has done  a considerable amount  of work in the  improvement  of roads  and will continue to do  so. The  only constraint,  as  has been  said by the hon. Minister, are  funds because  there are  so many competing projects that require financing from the Treasury. As you know,  Sir,  funds  are  limited, and we  can only do  so much with a given resource. 	Sir,  as the Minister has already pointed out, the current Development Plan, 1988/93,  has  already been underway for the  last almost three years.	This  is  about half-way the lifespan of thePlan.	Hon.  Members  should accept that  the  Government operates,within a given Development Plan,  but  if we  are going to leave it as we  go  along,  then we can play haywire with all  our Development Programmes. I  think it is  only appropriate that hon. Member should liaise  with the next Development Plan to ensure  that funds for this project  are  include in the Plan. I  thinle everybody will agree  that we must 	follow some  sound planningso that projects are implemented as  they come  in the  order of priority. As the hon. Minister said,  as  soon as funds are  available, the Government will be quite prepared to  implement this Motion along with other Motions.   This is because there are so many other  areas  that require  improvement  of roads. The   Government appreciates  the  role  played by good  communication,  roadwise  and otherwise, in the  development of the  economy and  also  In easing communication of the  public  from one  place  to  another. With those few remarks,  Sir,  I beg to  support. (Question of the  first part of the  amendment,  that the words  to be  left out be left  out,  proposed) </newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR  LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr.  Mbori): Thank you,Sir,  for giving me  a chance  to  contribute  to  the  amendment  introduced by the Minister for Public Works who  is in charge of  our roads  and related communication network. I  think it would also be  fitting for me  to  thank the Mover of the Motion,  hon.  Kyonda,  for introducing this Motion although he has  tended to localise  it  to Makueni  and Machakos  areas. I  am sure  it rings a bell in most  of us who  travel through the length and width of Kenya to  find  out the state  of our roads  throughout the  Republic. In particular, with regard to area like  the  one  hon.  Kyonda has referred to,   I am sure  communication system,  especially the roads,  are affected by the nature  of rainfall we have had in the current year. We have  had very heavy rainfall which begun as early as February, and continued nonstop up to now when there  should be  some  fairly dry season.	Sol. there  is no doubt that a number of our roads havebeen washed laway by the  torrential rains  and floods.	I  think thelam. Member  should be very happy now that the Minister has said that he has visited the area in question.	This  fact  alone,  eventhough it may not provide the immediate funds,  it satisfying.	Itshows that the Minister is  concerned with the state of roads in this area.I think this  is why he has introduced an amendment tothis Motion.	This  shows the  seriousness of the Motion.	 I would  only request him,  as my colleague,  to see to it that he implements  this Motion. 	Some construction work on this road should begin once  funds  are made available. The hon :  Mover refers   to a number of roads which require  some repairs. Lack of SufficientFunds may not allow immediate  tarmacking of these roads,  but if they are made all weather,  communication would be  easy.  I am sure by the time these improvements will be made,  the hon.  Mover will be very happy. I  know that the Ministry of Public Works ha s  overwhelmingresponsibility  throughout  the  Republic. As  I  said  earlier,   rains have  caused  destruction  to  our  roads  thus  making human  communication difficult. Because  of  its  overwhelming  resnonsibility,  the  Ministry of  Public  Works  should be  assisted as much as possible  in,  say, maintaining  access  roads. The  main  roads,   such  as,   C,   B  and  A classes  should be  maintained by  the  Ministry. 	Apart  from  the  roads-mentioned in  this Motion,  I would like  to  bring  to  the  attention of  the  Minister  the  fact  thatparts  of  South  Nyanza  roads  are  completely   impassable.	Theroads  have  been  more  than washed away by the  long rains.	TheMinister  should  sit  down  with  his  officers  and find out  if  our national  budget  can  afford  to  look  after  these  roads. 	If  our resources  are  not  enough,  I  think we  should look  for  donor  countries to  help  us  look  after  the  road  network  in  this  country. 	Without  roads,  we   .  cannot  be  able  to  make  any  development. No  progress  will  made  without  proper  roads.	If  the  Ministry'sallocation	is  not  enough,   I  think	we  should  get  an  okay  fromthis  House  and  seek  funds  elsewhere	for  the  improvement  of  ourroads. The  hon.  Member  who  brought  this  Motion   says  that they  are  going  to  have  a  new  district  headquarters   I  hope  it will  be  called Makueni  District -and  that  road  network  should comensurate  with  the  requirements  of  the  new district.We  knowthat  people  like novelty  and  the  more  the  roads are  made  novelthe  better  for  the  future  communication.Some  of  our  main  roads  have  many potholes  which  pose  a'	danger  not  only  to  vehicles  but  to  life  as  well.	This  is  becauseas  you  try  to  maneuver  a  pothole  you  may  fall  off  the  road or  collidwith  an  oncoming vehicle.	This  responsibility lies  with  the Minister and I hope the  amendment  he  has  introduced  this Morning  "		assoon  as  funds  become  available		"  should  take  account  of  thearea  brought  to	us  under  this Motion	and  also  parts  of  Oyugiswhere  roads  are  impassable  due  to  heavy rains.With  these  few  remarks,   I  beg to  second  the  amendment. </newspeech><newspeech>THE	ASSISTANT MINISTER  FOR  TECHNICAL  TRAINING  AND  APPLIEDTECHNOLOGY  (Mr.   Thuo):	Thank  you,   Sir,   for  giving me  this  chanceto  contribute  to  this Motion.	First  of  all,I would  like  tocommend  the  Mover  of  this Motion	because  road  network  is  vitalfor  communication  purposes.	One  cannot  emphasize  the  need  forthe  country  to  have  better  roads.	This  is   because  it  is  throughgood  roads  that  we  can move  our  agricultural  and industrial  produce from  one  place  to  another.	Development  activities  will  increasein  this  manner.This  Motion  is,   therefore,  relevant	and  its  importancehas been  underlined	by  the  Minister  by  way  of  accepting  it  witha  minor  amendment.	I  think  the  Minister  should  be  commended	forthis  because	as  much  as  his  constituents  would  like   to  have  goodroads,   other  areas in  the  Republic would  also  want  the  same.	Weshould  pass  Motions	in  this  House	which  will  help	those  whoelected us  in  their  day  to  day  activities.The  Minister  has  said  that  he  has  visited  the   roadsmentioned  under  this Motion  and that  he  is  going to  do  something about  them.	Ministers  have  a  lot  of  work  to  do,   such  as,   office works  receiving people .from different areas  and  so  on,  it  isImportant  that they also  travel  to  various  constituencies	and acquaint themselves with  development  activities  taking place  there. Since  we  have  been  elected  by  the  peoples  we  are  national  leadersand  all  constituencies  in  the  Republic  should be  of importance  to  all  of  us  in  this  august  House. I  happen  to  be  one  of  those    people who  have  visited the  area  in  question	and  I  sunnort Mr.   Kyonda  that  these  roadsshould  be  improved  and  tarmacked.	We  understand  the  Government’sfinancial  constraints  in  undertaking major  roads  works,   such  as, tarmacking. The  funds  voted  for  this  Ministry  are  in  the  hands of  the  hon.

So,  the Motion has  not yet been amended.	I  willput  the  Question after Mr.  Thuo finishes  speaking. You may carry on,  Mr.  Thuo. </newspeech><newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TECHNICAL TRAINING AND APPLIED TECHNOLOGY (Mr.  Thuo): 	Thank you,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  for clarifying the position and making the hon.  Member happy. I was  saying that  I  have been  to  the  areas mentioned  in  this  Motion, and  that  I  agree with the Mover that these roads need to be  taken care of. 	I happen  to have  travelled two weeks  ago to Ukamba Agricultural  Institute,  in Machakos District,  where  I represented my Minister at a graduation ceremony of the  Institute.	To get  there,  one passes  through various places travelling overboth tarmacked  and untarmacked roads.	I  saw  for myself that  some  of the  roadsin both the  area the. hon.  Member  is  talking about  and the  adjacent  district  really need to be  looked into without going into  the  specifics of whether they are tarmacked or not. As  hon.  Mbori  said here,  you find  that  a road may be  tarmacked by  repair work has not been  done. We  have  a  case  here  in respect of the  road from Nairobi  to Thika, which was  repaired only  the  other day. 	Potholes  have  already started appearing in the road and vehicles  travel  over the  road in a zig-zag manner trying to evade the potholes. The standard of our roads  in general needs  to be  looked into, because they may be repaired now,  but they  do not  last  long due  to the poor -	standard in which they are constructed. The roads  in the  areas mentioned here need to be put in the  district harness as was suggested earlier so that they may be tarmacked in the next National Development Plan or earlier if funds become available.	 However,  this  applies  to roads  everywhere  in the  Republic. Roads  need to be  repairedespecially immediately after the  long rains. At that time,  grading of roads  is   very  necessary. 	If  I  may  cite  a  few  cases  here,  I  have been  in a meeting of Murang'a District Development Committee  where  it was  observed that we have many bridges  in the  district  that need to be  repaired or replaced. In my  Kigumo Constituency,  for  example,  there  are  many  such bridges and I have mentioned them to  the  District Road Engineer. Some  of them are  so dangerous,  to say the least, that  they can  collapse  any time  a vehicle  passes over them.	If this  happens,  thevehicle will  plunge  into  the river below and kill  the passengers.	These  bridgesare  dangeroUs  and  I  would  like  to urge  the Ministry to take  time to repair,  grade and murram or tarmack  the  roads  there. The  issue  of bridges  should be  taken very seriously because people use them to cross rivers,  thereby avoiding long distances that  they would otherwise have  to  travel. There  is  a bridge  on the road from Karuri,  in Muthithi Location,  to Kaumbu which  is  so  dangerous  that. the road has been avoided by motorists.	Thereis  another  one across  Maragua River on the road from Gachuchu to Mucibia.	I  havetold  the  Chairman  of my District Development Committee that this bridge needs to be  repaired,  and  if the  tyres  are  worn out,  you can easily slip over and plunge into  the river because  the  side  railings  on both sides of the bridge  are gone. Both  coffee  and tea roads  in this  area,  which  is very important for the economy of this country,  have  all been washed off.	So,  as  I  support  the  Motion,  Irequest  that  the  bridges  in my constituency  as  well be  looked  into.	Thank you.(Question  of  the  first  part  of the  amendment, 	that  the  words  to be  left out be  left  out, put  and negatived) (Debate  on the original Motion resumed)</newspeech> <newspeech>	MR.

P.J.W.  MASINDE: 	The  roads Machakos Ukia Emali,  Ukia Kilala, Kilala Wote,  Makueni Nzilu and Wote Kiangini  should be tarmacked and maintained so  as  to  encourage  the  transportation of both passengers and the agricultural products  in the  area.  Where  it  is not possible to carry out tarmacking.at once, the  roads should be made  all-weather by murraming so that they are passable  throughout  the year.	In this way,  we will be  saving on motor-vehicle spare partsand fuel.	Instead of using the  short-cuts provided by the roads,  people have togo winding all  the way to get to their destinations,  and this consumes a lot of fuel. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker?  Sir, if we cannot get funds from the Treasury,  it  should urgently look for loans. 	There seems  to be  a lot  of dragging of feet by Ministries when loans are being acquired. 	Occasionally when we 	enouire  we  are  told that negotiations. are  going on,  or they are  about to be  completed or the loan agreements are  only awaiting signature	but they never materialise.	The question/of when funds  become  available  should never  arise because  it could,take	10 years.	Delay in implementation or projects results in-thecountry spending more money because  of materials costs rise. while on this  issue  I would to  touch on the Mumias/Nambale/ Busia Road,  whose  the  tarmadking the  Government  directed in 1983, but which has  so far not been  donex  despite  that  it  is a very important road leading to  the  Kenya/Uganda border. Although Busia   isa ditrict  like  any other,  being a border  district it  is a very sensetive  oneand so means  of transport  should be  such as to  allow easy	movement.I want  to emphasise  that the roads mentioned in this Motion shouldbe worked upon immediately,  possibly with the  current financial year.</newspeech> Masinde! <newspeech>THE.

Members have  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  as  I  and  other hon. Members have Said we  are  going to have a new district.	In fact,  theGovernment	has  spent a lot  of money in putting up a five-storeyoffice  complex,  which is almost complete.	Staff houses are  alsobeing put up and soon or later we  expected to have  a district posted to Makueni.,   It will be  a great  embarrassment for a district commissioner to be  in an area where he  cannot move whenever he needs to  do  so. It was,  therefore,  fitting that the Motion was not amended because the  district  commissioner and other  Government  officers would have been hampered in the discharge  of their duties by poor communications. 	As  a result  of these very bad roads  bus fares have treppledin some  areas  so  that	instead of  people paying Shs.33/ fromMachakos to Kathonzweni they have had to  Shs.150/- which is aboutfive  times more.	People have  also had to  follow long routes  so thatthose  going to  Kathonzweni have had to travel via Kibwesi.	We  arethus urging the  Goverment to  do  something because  of what have experienced,  and it  is  only fair that the motion is not amended. 	Again,  as  I  said  before,  this area is known as the granary of Machakos  District because  of its  great m agricultural potential. 	But  there  are many times when farm prodece benefits are , lost because  farmers  cannot transport the produce to buying places: I even gave  an example  of a district officer who had to sleep in the bush in a Government Land Rover,  which is an indication of how bad  the roads are.   These are some  of the things  we are talking about and I am glad hon. Members here have  stood in support of this.          We know that tarmacking of 100 or more kilometres is not An easy undertaking but  I would urge the Minister to ensure that we,  at  least,  have  all-weather roads.	He  could mobilise  his  officers  togive us murram roads  so that before the tarmacking we can enjoy using murram. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  we have district hospital at Makueni  and there  are  times when patients cannot be move to Machakos Provincial General Hospital for further treatment. 	You can imagine  the  pain and suffering when a patient cannot be transported to  an hospital with better facilities!So  the  spirit of this Motion is that the  Nyayo people in this area should feel that their Government appreciates their problems, particularly in the  field of communications and transportation,  because it has moved in and helped them. Once  again I would like  to thank the Minister for accepting this Motion and hope  that  something will be  done  soon or  later, particularly the  provision of all-weather roads,  so that we can  join other kenyans  in the  development of this great nation. 	With  those  few rernqrks I beg to move. (Question put and negative)<header>MOTION</header> <header> Establishment of a Mineral Advisory Centre</header> <newspeech>MR.

Thehon.  Member  contributing referred to  hon.  Members  as  "making noise"  whereasthey  do not  do  that;  they  only  consult one  another  on matters of great importance.Is  he  in order  to  say  that  they  are making noise? </newspeech><newspeech>THE  TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER	(Mr.  Tuva):	I  sm  sorry  I  did  not  hear  that. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  MALEBE:	Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Motion,  proposingthe  establishment of  a mineral  advisory  centre,  is  very  important to this country. In  this  country  we  have a  lot of potential  for  industrial minerals  and gemstone trade. To  begin with,  I  would  like  to  say  that  the  Mining Act,  which controls the  mining  of  industrial  minerals  and gemstones  is  overdue for amendment and,  I am  sure,  when that is done,  the amended Act will  incorporate rules which will enable the Minister  to. establish  the proposed institution to propose the mining of minerals in this  country. At  the same  time,  I would  like to say  that we have a lot of interested and potential investors in this country for industrial gemstones and minerals. We also have qualified mining engineers  and geologists,  both in the public and private  sector,  who would be very willing to start investing in the industry. Since the inception of the mining industry in this country,  there are a lot of  potential  precious minerals which have been discovered in this country 	, but the  exploitable  minerals  are very few,  particularly on industrial minerals. The country has been depending mainly on its foreign earnings of soda ash which contributes  to something like 90 per cent of the foreign exchange earnings  from mineral resources. The gemstones,  which could be contributing vast sums of money in form  of foreign exchange,  are a little bit neglected.	We have  the famousgemstones  that have been discovered in the Taita District,  like	the  Tsavorite,the green garnets and rubies, which are in high demand all over the world. If we had a centre charged with the responsibility of disseminating information to would be buyers,  then this country would be earning a lot from the gemstone trade. Sir,  the Kenya Gemstones Dealers Association was formed recently, and  it mainly  deals with buying and selling of gemstones and other precious minerals. I  would like  to congratulate the Association because its main objective  isto promote mining  in this country,  as well as making wananchi aware of the  value  of  the minerals,  which form the  bulk of the natural resources  in Kenya.	We have  very  precious minerals  like  gold,  diamondsand also silver,  which are quite distributed all over Kenya.	You will  findthat  historically Kakamega was  very potential  for gold mining but,  today,  due to  lack  of guidance,  we have never been able to revisit the mines,  which were very  famous  in the 1940's. 	If Fi  we  form  this mineral  advisory centre,  then,  we will be definitely advised to go back to the Kakamega mines and try to exploit  the gold deposits  in that area. we have gold deposits in Kenya, for example in Nyanza Province at aPlace. called Ndori where there are small co-operative societies which have 	been formed to mine gold in those areas.   We also have gold in West Pokot 	and  in Turkana areas  along the rivers  there. There is  a particular river where we have a.hydro-electric project,  along which there  is  a lot of gold  which just flows downstream and which could be utilised.	Gold miners normallyform small co-operative societies and carry out petty mining.	HoweVer,  ifthere was an advisory centre formed, we would promote these societies so that more gold can be mined. Once gold is formed into bullions,  it forms the worth of a country,  as that is measured by the number of the gold bullions in the reserve banks. We also have'a lot of industrial minerals which have been discovered in the country and are currently being mined. Just near Athi River here,  we have the Gypsum mines which are being excavated for the manufacture of cement. I believe we should encourage that mining of the cement in that particular place, because the mining could earn this country a lot of money in form of the much-needed foreign currency. There is also fluorspar which is mined within the Kerio Valley,  and this industrial mineral has brought a lot of foreign exchange to this country. We should encouraged our people to mind it even more. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  recently thd Kenya Breweries Ltd. established a glass manufacturing company for making bottlds. 	I would like to point out that there is a lot of white sand found around Kilifi and Kwale districts which can be exploited to assist this industry. We also have other minuterals around Kajiado and the central Kenya which could bd located and mined to be used in the manufacture of glass. In regard to iron ore,  we have a lot of iron in Ikutha,  Kitui District, and also in Marimanti,  Meru District. 	Currently the Government is trying to establish an iron ore reserve in thd country so that when we start manufacturing thd Nyayo car we will be able to use raw materials from the iron. ore available in the country. If the Government,  therefore, establishes a Mineral Advisory Cdntre,  the institution will be able to dessiminate information on locations where mines could be started, and identification of minerals would be easier. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Spdaker,  Sir,  today thd gemstone trade is treated as a secret one. 	You find that even very knowledgeable fellows who would like to get rich quickly are takdn behind car parks or othdr dark alleys to carry out thd business. We have seen conmen who con even lawydrs through this trade. A Mineral Advisory Centrd could opdn up thd whole trade to everyone interested in investing in minerals because thd mwananchi would know whdrd to go to get information. 	Currently people fear to go to the Department of Mines to get their minerals identified,  and more so if they are not licensed.   The formation of a Mineral Advisory Centre would formalise all the licensing procedures and make wananchi aware of minerals and regulations so that they are not scared of handling gemstone's and Other minerals. We have mineral markets all over the world,  led by thd famous ones in London. 	If a Mineral Advisory center is established in Kenya,  then we would  be among thd first African countries to establish a mineral market.   Most of our  neighbours would be coming to Kenya to sell and buy minerals.   So,  I think the establishment of such a centre is a very noble idea:   Although the Ministth for Environment and Natural Resources and his Assistant Ministdrs are not in the House, I would like them to note that this is a very important Motion which, if accepted by the Government, would enhance our economy tremendously. because such a centre as proposed would act as a major link betwddn would-be investors and tnd   mwananchi. That way, we would be making a lot of money to balance our payments. For example, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it was revealed in an swer  to a Question in this House that minerals earned Kenya KShs.205 million in a period of four years.   Th6sd were the earnings recorded direct from official  miners.   What goes on in the underworld could earn three or more times that much 	if gemstone and gendral mineral busindss was legally controlled so that piratingof those commodities does not occur.   I am sure that what is pirated out of the country is far much more than what is officially traded.   Dealers fear to pay income tax and,  therefore, pirate gemstones in form of bungle's, beads and other ornaments. If all gemstonds and mindrals were delared, this country would not be going forloans.	we would be making enough money to be able to initiate projects in all parts of Kenya.Sir, when it comes to taxation, thdrd is no export compensation on minerals.That means that there are fewer dealers who oftently export mineralssince taxation is very high.   It is in this regard that I urgd thd Government to establish the Minerals Advisory Centre.   I am saying this because we have evenseen gemstones and minerals in this country being used in thd construction industry.FOr instance, we have the black granite,  available somewhere in Kisumu, which has been used to construct the Harambee Plaza.   What happens is tnat the raw materiala ard   exported Overseas,  where they are slashed into sluba and then re-expOridd back. If we had such a centre as proposed in this Motion, we would not be deprived ofour natural resources.	In my view,  an advisory cantra in mindrals would ensurethat wd benefit mord than 100 per cent from our mineral natural reSources. ".Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  going back  to the question of expertise,  you find that the mwananchi is very much interested in prospecting for gemstones. but they do not know who is supposed to identify the minerals for them. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  although we have universities which can identify minerals,  the  mwananchidoes not  know where to go to get the minerals identified.	At thesame  time the  mwananchi  should be made  aware  of the value  of the minerals.  This  is because  even when grazing cattle in some ranches a mwanamehl might come across a precious stone but he maynot  know where to take  it to have it identified so that he can earn some  money from its  sale. With those remarks,  I urge the  Government to take this Motion seriously and have the Mineral Advisory Centre  established. Finally,  I beg to move  and request hon. Mcharo to second the Motion. </newspeech> 	<newspeech>MR.  GALGALLO:  On a point  of order,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir.

MCHARO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,  I was saying that is a very important Motion and I would like to commend the Mover for bring 	 to this House.   It is important because what it is asking for is in line with Government policy of industrialization in this country which has been all diversify our economic  activities   in this country in an effort to earn foreign exchange. As the Mover of this Motion observed,  this country is of mineral resources but we are fully aware that these mineral resource not been fully exploited. I happen to come from an am area where there a lot of mineral prospectors who are looking for the various types of  However, their activities are Conducted in a very haphazard manner and Why we would like the Government  to come out and   devise a specific pelf organize and regulate the mineral exploitation in this country for the of the people  of this country and the Government at large. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  the establishment  of the Mineadvisory Centre is a very good proposal because it would co-ordinate the activities in this country and be  able to advise our people through the of Environment  and Natural Resources. This Mineral  Advisory Centre would able to  advise  the various entrepreneurs in this country on how to go about exploitation  of mineral resources in this country. We need to have our properly trained in prospecting for minerals in this country because we aware that foreigners are very much involved in the prospecting of these As we all know, minerals are a very important commodity in any country fore we need to have trained people particularly in areas where these are likely to be found so that they can undertake the prospecting, explain and exploitation of these minerals. This would eventually enable then the out effective marketing of these minerals in this country, and can this would be able to earn us quite same amount of foreign exchange in		country.   This can only be done if the Ministry of Environemnt and Nature establishes this Mineral Advisory Centre as proposed by the Mover of the The main concern of this centre would be to ensure that our people are trained in mineral prospecting. This would also mean that the exploitation of our minerals would be carried out effectively.At the moment, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the prospecting of our minerals as I have already indicated above is being done in a very haphazard, manner. In any own area, that is Mwatate Constituency, we have a lot of people who are currently carrying out the work of mineral prospecting and although they are able to get these minerals, we are not sure how they market them. Therefore, we would like their activities to be properly organized and  co-ordinated so that the profits they get from these minerals are properly monitored. I would like to suggest here that the local authorities should be able to benefit from the minerals that are exploited from this area. At the moment, the local authorities do not benefit at all from these minerals and it is important that they should come out and investigate to find exit how much minerals are being exploited in their own areas and the amount of revenue that is accruing out of them. These local authorities should get money to assist in the improvement of the various services in our country such as roads, education, health and so on. I am quite sure that if our mineral resources were properly exploited, this would go a long way into assisting the local authorities in getting some revenue.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it has been noted that the foreigners are very keen to get industrial minerals, including gemstones from this country. Therefore, our Government should devise a policy of encouraging these foreigners who are interested in mineral prospecting to come and work together with the local people.; I suggest that these foreigners should not just be given lisences to operate wherever they want but should be able to work without people so that whatever minerals they exploit should not find its way out of this country to be sold abroad without our knowledge of what is happeningsSo, that is a very fundamental, aspect of this Motion and that is why the Mover has called upon the Ministry to establish a mineral advisory centre this country in order to assist in the regulation and organisation of mineral exploitation in the country.Sir, without having to add more of what we are saying,we are requesting the Ministry concerned to look seriously into the question of mining activities or mining industries so that more people are encouraged to go into it. The business can he very lucrative or rich, and very many people in this country can he assisted in getting employment. As such, the exploitation of these minerals should assist in the development of our rural centres because most of these minerals are in the rural areas. Therefore, exploitation of these minerals will assist in offering employment to our local people.This country has a lot of unemployment and any activities, such as this one, should he encouraged by all means so that such industries can grow and prosper. Employment can also be found for our people. Our rural urban centres will also grow. With those few remarks, I beg to support,</Newspeech>(Question proposed)<Newspeech>MR. MAKAU: Thank you,Sir.This is a very important Motion calling on the Government to set up a mineral advisory centre to, assist those who would like to deal in prospecting minerals. I say so because this is our natural resource and it is left for people to come from nowhere to. come and exploit the Kenyans.

MAKAU: Thank you, Sir.As I was saying, the Motion is calling for an advisorycentre to he established to advise indigenous Kenyans on minerals.I say this Motion is important because Kenya is known for itsminerals. ?or instance, during the 1950's, we used to hear of mcalder gold mining in Kakamega and so many other places where mining was taking place. So, when you go in some hotels in Nairobi or Mombasa, you will find some people who deal in minerals. Therefore, we are requesting the Government to, establish an advisory centre in order to avoid the that is taking place today in minerals. People are told they are going offered minerals like Tanzanite, but when they buy then they find they are fake. So, this advisory centre would be able to advise people on all aspects of minerals.Sir, we are requesting the Government to set up an advisory centre so that when people come from, say, Turkana or Samburu or other areas that are rich in minerals are able to be advised accord-ingly when it comes to prospecting minerals. This advisory centre will also be able to collect data that will help us know areas with potential for mineral prospecting and so on.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: On a point of order, Sir. I hate to interrupt, the hon. Member who is speaking but I would like to seek the guidance of the Chair here. We are debating a Motion that is directed to the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources and yet there is no representative from that Ministry nor is there anybody taking notes of what we are saying. Why does the Front Bench take Private Members Motions lightly and yet we are told that there is what is called "collective responsibility. Is the Chair convinced that we should go on discussing this Motion in the absence of a representative from that Ministry?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mureithi): Mr. Falana, the Chair had already ruled on that. Hon. Mbori is taking notes on behalf of the Ministry concerned. Notice to this Motion was given only yesterday and I think it is reasonable that hon. Mbori continues taking notes of what hon. Members are saying on this Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKAU: Sir, we hope that hon. Mbori has had the experience in macalder mines and he knows what we are talking about as far as minerals are concerned. What I was saying is that this advisory centre will help the Government in ascertaining potential areas as far as minerals are concerned. We know that there exists a geological map but an advisory centre will assist the public a great deal. Many people have lost a lot of money going to Taita-Taveta and other places looking for minerals. Because they are crazy about getting minerals 	to sell, they have been conned of a lot of money. For example, some people have been conned by being sold crushed pieces of Sprite bottles in the name of Tanzanites. There have been many cases of people being conned in the name of minerals and that is why we are calling for this advisory centre to be set up.  Another very important aspect why we want this advisorycentre: set up is that since the marketing of cash crops, such as, coffee is being affected by world markets, foreign exchange can be earned from the marketing of our minerals. I am saying so because foreigners correct and buy minerals from this country and it seems that we are not getting enough of what we are supposed to get.Hon. Members here know of the famous ruby mines in Taita-Taveta District. We have heard of cases of people being taken to court with regard to these mines. This shows that a lot of mineral potential exists in this country and that is why we are asking for the setting up of an advisory centre that would be able to guide those who	would like to be engaged in the mining industry.For example, we have an advisory centre composed of businessmen who advice those who would to venture into various businesses. Therefore, the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources should set up this centre to guide those who are interested in mining. We also have the Investment Promotion Centre which guides those who are interested in investing in the country.Therefore, the setting up of this centre will not cost the Ministry a lot of money. It will simply be a place where People can go and get advice when they want to venture into this industry As one hon. Member said, mineral prospecting, mining and marketing is a labour intensive activity. For example, in Zambia, the najorite of people are employed in mining centres. We have often been given the excuse that mining of certain minerals might not be economical but we know that if this centre is set up within the Ministry, prospecting areas will be centres of offering employment to Kenyans.Unemployment is the biggest problem that this country faces and I would like to commend the President for setting up a committee to look into unemployment. The youth that leave school are looking for employment as well as university graduates. "For example, veterinary doctors who graduate from our universities have no employment. Therefore, mining, as a labor intensive industry, should be considered seriously.      Another thing is that the Government losses a lot of revenue because those people who are involved in prospecting and selling minerals in this country have no one overseeing their income and are, therefore, not taxed. Therefore, this centre will help a great deal because the Government will know the people that are involved in that industry and the Government will get its due revenue for the financing of other projects.         Finally, I would like to say that this Ministry should be able to up-date the geological maps that are available in this country. This will go a long way in helping those interested in mining.         We are appealing to this House to support this Motion because its implementation will not cost the Government a lot of money because what it is seeking will go a long way in assisting the Government and create employment in this country: earn the country foreign exchange and control conmen in the industry.        This centre will also train personnel in the marketing of minerals which is not being taken into account at the moment, 	With those few remarks, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

KIPKORIR: As you are aware, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have many resources and the Ministry concerned should exploit them by getting its experts to advise miners on how best to do this. Instead of relying on importation, we should depend on our own land for development of the country. There are people who are interested in this work and they shoul be advised on how to go about it. In my area, for example, we have many minerals, but they have not been exploited for the benefit of the nation. So, we would like to have more experts advising on how to expand the mining of these minerals, especially gold in river banks. We have a lot of gold in valleys, highlands, and many other parts of the country, and it is high time the Ministry had a body to advise on where these minerals can be obtained.

JALANG'O asked the Minister of state Office of the President what specific plans the Ministry has to extend the Kisumu Airport Runway and Apron to enable the airport to handle all types of aircraft.  <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER,. OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Kamuren): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.  My Ministry has already identified the need to extend the KisumuAirport Runway and Apron and has already carried out a feasibility study to this end. The extension of the runway and apron will be carried out when funds are available.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. JALANG'O: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my Original Question, I had asked the Minister to advise the House on the specific plans that they have to extend Kisuuru Airport Runway and Apron, but instead the Assistant Minister is saying that they will do that when funds become available. The expression when funds become available is not giving a specific date. Could he tell us the specific plans that they have to extend the runway and apron of Kisumu Airport to enable it handle all types of aircraft?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the benefit of this House, I would like to give the following supplementary information:-A feasibility study was carried out and completed in 1987 by engineering consultants. That study revealed that it was not viable to expand the airport but the following developments could be carried out to accommodate DC 9 types of aircraft, a much larger type of aircraft than the types currently using the airport:-(i) construction of a new and bigger terminal building to accommodate 120 passengers at the peak hours;(ii) urgent repair and resealing of the existing runway, taxiway and apron movements to accommodate DC 9 types of aircraft,(iii) extension of the parking apron to enable it accommodate a larger number of aircraft,(iv) provide additional navigation aids. Efforts are being made to obtain funding through bilateral and multilateral donor agencies. This is why I have said that as soon as funds become available we are going to carry out that extension. So, the hon. Member should give us time to get the funds so as to carry out those extensions.</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. OMINO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we do not look for funds before we have identified a project. Could the Assistant Minister confirm whether they have identified Kisumu Airport as a viable project to be upgraded in the nationalstatus before they look for those funds?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, that has already-been done. My consultants completed their work in 1987.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. JALANG'O: MR. Speaker, Sir, Kisumu is the third largest town in kenya, be it in terms of development, tourism or communication to other neighbouring countries. Doe's the Ministry have to wait until these funds become available to recognise the importance of this town?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already said that we have already identified that project because we recognise that it is one of the important towns in this country.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAMUYU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister said that the feasibility study was completed in 1987 which was three years ago. How much do they currently need to complete this project?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the body that was set aside to approach the donors have not yet submitted their report and at such I cannot exactly tell the amount of money that is going to be involved. But as soon as they do so, hon. Jalang'o can come around to my office and I will show him the figures.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMINO: The Assistant Minister has-just told us that there are other airports which are going to be treated equally with Xisumu Airport. Could he tell us the criteria established for identifying those airports and whether Xisumu Airport is ton of the list or where it lies in its taking order?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. XAMUREN: Sir, this Question was about Xisumu Airport and nothing else. When other Questions are brought regarding other airports, will reply accordingly.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAMUYU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I asked a specific question and not on behalf of hon. Jalang'o, about the expenditure which the Office of the President is unable to fund. I do not see the reason why the Assistant Minister deliberately refuses to give us an answer and why he should ca hon. Jalangto aside. Can he tell us the amount of money required for the expansion of Kisumu Airport?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. XAMUREN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I made it very clear when I said that there is a body working on funds and as soon as it completes its work, we will inform the House accordingly.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. JALANGTO: On a point of order, Sir. Hon. Kamuyu wanted to know how much money is involved in this exercise. That is all that we are asking. How much money are we talking about?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. XAMUREN: Mr. Sneaker, Sir, I will not be able to give the figure right now but I am sure it involves a substantial amount of money.MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Sir. We need the guidance of the Chair here because it seems that the Assistant Minister does not have an answer to this particular Question. What does he mean by "substantial amount of money?" Maybe he is "kombo kombo". Is he in order to come and reply when he does not have a satisfactory answer from his Ministry?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member has been here long enough and he should, have known what a point of order What he has raised is a question but not a point of order. As soon as the figure is arrived out because it involves a lot of money I will bring it to this House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAKUYU: On a point of order, Sir. We seek the guidance of the Chair in this matter because I asked a specific question about how much money has been set aside for the expansion of this airport. Since the Assistant Minister does not seem to have a proper answer, is he going to ask for time and answer to this Question later on?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Kamuyu, the Assistant Minister has just told the House that as soon as he gets the figure, he will infor the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAMUYU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would, like to know what he means by "as soon as possible." Can he bring that figure, say, tomorrow?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as. I said, we have team working out what it will cost us to expand this particular airport As soon as, we get that figure, I will inform the House immediately</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMINO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Since the Assistant Minister has assured us that they have carried out feasibility studies which must include the cost of expansion. Can he now bring that document here so that we can work out the figure if he is unable to do so?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: That is not a point of order but a supplementary question.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. OMINO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order not to give us the actual document which has the information and which is in his possession.</Newspeech> (applause)             <Newspeech>MR. KAMUREN: I have told the House, Sir, that as soon as I get the figure which is  being worked out right now by the officer concerned, I will inform the House accordingly.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Omino, I think you are learning very fast. Can we move on to the next Question?</Newspeech>(laughter)Question No. 353Gazetted Road Blocks Between Isiolo and HanderaMR. A.I. MOHAMED asked the Minister of State, Office of the President how many gazetted road blocks/barriers ther are between Isiolo and Mandera Town.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Kamure Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.There are no gazetted road blocks/barriers between I siolo and Mandera. However, we have several road blocks/barriers at different places erected in accordance with Section 26(l) of the Police Act Chapter 84 of the Laws of Kenya and Section 12(1) of the Administration Police Act Chapter 85 of the Laws of Kenya.MR. A.I. MOHAMED: Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister tell us exactly how many road blocks/barriers there are between Isiolo and Mandera?MR. KAMUREN: Sir, the hon. Member normally through that area and the powers to erect road blocks or barriers is provided for under the Laws of Kenya Section 26(l) Chapter 84 and Section 12(1) Chapter 85. The only persons, empowered to do so are the gazetted officers. That is to say, any officer in charge of a police station</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Sir. The hon. Member wanted to know how road blocks there are between Isilo and Mandera and instead of answering, the Assistant Minister is reading a statement about police and so on. Is he in order to do that?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAMUREN: There are only four road blocks.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.I. MOHAMED: On: a point of order, Sir. Is the hon. Assistant Minister in order to mislead the House when we know that there are over 21 permanent road blocks between Isiolo and Mandera? Why is he saying that there are only four road blocks? Is he not ashamed of saying that? Why can he not be honest?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, road blocks are normally erected by police depending on what is happening on particular roads in the country.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.I. MOHAMED: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has said that road blocks keep on increasing and I know that the most recent road block has been there for the last three years. Can he mention the four road blocks that he is talking about so that we guide him?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were four road blocks originally and we decided to increase them because of the nature of security in the area.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.I. MOHAMED: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Assistant Minister has said that there are four road blocks. Can he name them?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. KAMHEN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a section of our laws that enables the police to open road-block for some security reasons. For the same security reasons, I said earlier that the police were able to purposely increase the road-blocks.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: On a point of order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question, Mr. S.M. Amin.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.I. MDHAHMED: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am speaking from experience and would like the hon. Assistant Minister to tell us</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: No, hon. Mohammed. I do not want further discussion on the Question TO have just disposed of.</Newspeech>Question No. 412Extension of Nyayo Bus Services to Mandera DistrictMR. ABTS, on behalf of Mr. S.M. Amin, asked the Minister of State, Office of the President whether he could extend the Nyayo Bus Services to cover Mandera District in order to provide reliable transport to the residents of the area.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Onyancha): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.While appreciating the transport problems of the people of Mandera District, it is not possible, at the moment, to extend Nyayo Bus Services to cover the district</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. ARTS: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the answer given, can the Assistant Minister tell us the shortcomings and why he cannot extend these services to Mandera District?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Nyayo Bus Services were started with the view of easing congestion and facilitating efficient communications in Nairobi City. It should be noted that while the Nyayo Bus Services has provided transport needs to other areas of the country, it has not fully serviced the purpose for which it was created, For the time being, Nairobi City alone requires a minimum of 360 buses, assuming the continued services of the Kenya Bus Services and the matatus. The Government is, therefore, unable to provide these services elsewhere. In fact, the Government is now arranging to secure more buses through donor funding, or by direct acquisitionfor the City of Nairobi. That is the reason why we may not be able, in the near future, to provide these services to other areas outside Nairobi, apart from those already provided for.</Newspeech>          <Newspeech>MR. FALANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Assistant Minister is not  being sincere in what he is telling the House. If these buses were to be restricted to Nairobi City only, there would not have been cause for any dissatisfaction. However, the buses are currently plying the up-country routes as far as Isiolo and Meru, on our route to Eastern Province. He asserts that the buses are only used for Nairobi City services. Would he be kind enough to let the fellows in other parts of the country, as far as Mandera and Karsabit, feel they are also being allowed to eat the Nyayo "cake" by providing them with one bus? That would not make much difference.</Newspeech>     <Newspeech>MR. ONTANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said, the Nyayo Bus Services were intended to serve the City of Nairobi only. I do admit that the services have also been extended to some towns outside Nairobi. However, I have also indicated that, in future, the Government policy, which is also the policy of this Corporation, will be to firstly, to serve the Nairobi City residents sufficiently, before the services can be extended outside. I do appreciate and sympathise with those needing the required services, as the one the hon. Member is making. It is now our policy that we will have to sufficiently serve Nairobi City.</Newspeech>     <Newspeech>MR. ADEN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from the reply by the Assistant Minister, and since it was the policy of the 2fyayo Government for the buses to serve Nairobi only, could he tell us whether the Government is, in future, contemplating serving other up-country areas, apart from Nairobi?</Newspeech>       <Newspeech>MR. ONIANCHA: Mr. Speaker. Sir, we have no such contemplation. As I had earlier said, we have provided a few buses to ply routes outside Nairobi. We are not going to discontinue those services. However, we now intend to concentrate on Nairobi City and, when the City is adequately served, we shall then be able to go outside Nairobi and improve on those services we have already extended there.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ARTE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, now that the Assistant Minister has accepted that Service vehicles go up-to—Kisumu and even Kakamega, can he consider a similar provision to transport the Mandera people?</Newspeech>      <Newspeech>MR. ONYANCEA: No, Sir. We cannot do that until we have served Nairobi residents sufficiently.</Newspeech>      <Newspeech>DR. MISOI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. while fully aware of the good services being provided by the Nyayo buses to the public, would it not be in order for the Company to expand and open up for public shares so that we. can have more of these buses serving areas like Wajir, Garissa and Mendera?</Newspeech>          <Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I had said, the Nyayo Bus Services Corporation Government-backed and its aims are quite wide.          In fact, the intentions are that finally the services will touch on all parts of the Republic. What I said is that for the time being, because of the strains in Nairobi, we find it very necessary to, first of all, render services in the City. The hon. Members in this House do know that especially during certain occasions in. Nairobi such services are so seriously required that it would be prudent that we serve Nairobi first.</Newspeech>        <Newspeech>MR. FALANA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The hon. Assistant Minister is contradicting himself. He insists, and keeps on repeating, that the services are first of all for Nairobi residents. He, at the same time, acknowledges the fact that some of the buses are plying up-country routes up to Kakanega, Neru, Kisii and so on. So, he is already talking of the buses serving interests of people outside Nairobi. Is he in order to contradict himself? Why does he not then start with Nairobi, without having any other buses going outside the City, before starting with a few areas? "When we talk of Handera and Marsabit, the people there have to be considered on humanitarian grounds, Why is it that they have to be left to be travelling in lorries on top of goats and sheep? He should stop contradicting himself by claiming that they are only serving Nairobi, when they already are serving Kakamega and other areas, and he also acknowledges that.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the hon. Member is being too harsh. I said very clearly that we are not saying that we are not going to extend Nyayo Bus Services to other areas of the? country. In fact, earlier on, as I have admitted, we had provided some Nyayo Bus Service buses outside Nairobi. What I am saying now is that because! of the? strategy in Nairobi, which also touches on security, we intend to serve the city first. The hon. Member will recall that recently, when we had disturbances in Nairobi, Nyayo Bus Service buses provided essential transport services because matatus were not operating. Therefore, we intend to strengthen the service in Nairobi and make the city self-sufficient before we move to other areas.</Newspeech>      <Newspeech>MR. ADEN: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker,Sir. Is the Assistant Minister trying to imply that he has only Constitutional obligations to serve the residents in Nairobi and abandon civil servants and the wananchi in Mandera District?</Newspeech>      <Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: No, Sir, I am not implying so.</Newspeech>Question No. 396 Payment of NSSF Dues to Mr. kamuti  MR. KUBO asked the Minister for Labour when Mr. Ndambuki Kamuti, NSSF No. 041-641-345, of P.O. Box 74, Taveta, will be paid his benefits which he applied for on 4th March, 1985.     <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.         The claimant was paid his benefits in January, 1990, and he cashed his cheque on 15th February, 1990. The cheque was for KShs. 12,783.25, and it was cashed through his bank account No. 124488 of Kenya Commercial Bank, Wundanyi.</Newspeech>         <Newspeech>MR. KUBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Minister and informing him that, in fact, this gentleman never came to see me after he gave me that information that is the reason why I put the Question can he! explain to the House why it had to take the Ministry all the? time from March, 1985, to January this year to pay this gentleman his benefits?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir. I can explain that. The reasons are that, first when we, got the application, we found that there. was no money in the account of the claimant. We asked him to come and show us his payslip but he did not do so. We sent three letters to him, but he did not reply to any. Finally we sent somebody to the Kenya Railways Corporation, and the information we got was that their accounts had gone to the auditors. Another one-and-a-half years passed before we could get into the accounts. When the accounts came back, we verified the payment and that is how we managed to pay the gentleman in such a short timed.</Newspeech>Question No. 418Primary School Staffing Position in MasingaMR. KIILU asked the' Minister for Education:-a)	what the' current staffing position of all primary schools in Masinga Division is; andb)	whether hW could give! the' number of trained and untrained primary school teachers in the division.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.  Masinga Division of Machakos District has a total of 836 primary school teachers. The division is understaffed by 25 teachers and every effort is being made to rectify the situation.f)	 There are 487 trained teachers and 349 untrained teachers in Masinga Division.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIILU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the: Assistant Minister tell the House when the understaffed schools will be fully staffed? There are! some schools, like Mukusu Primary School, which are! understaffed by three teachers. If this is the correct number of teachers, why should such a situation obtain in the area?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the understaffing is not all that serious, considering that Masinga Division has four educational zones. Masinga        Zone is understaffed by three teacher, kithyoko Zone is understaffed by teachers. Ndithini Zone is understaffed by seven teachers and Ekalakala is understaffed by ten teachers.   Sir, the Ministry of Education, through the Teachers Service Commission, will recruit untrained teachers to try to cover the understaffing in the area.</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>MR. KIILU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not agree with the hon. Assistant Minister when he says that Masinga Zone is understaffed by three teachers because I know of several schools in the zone, Mukusu Primary School being one, that are understaffed by three teachers. How come that the Assistant Ministers says that Masinga Zone is understaffed by three teachers when I know of two schools with a total understaffing of four teachers in the area? Where did he? get his information?</Newspeech>     <Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the hon. Member asked a Question here last week about understaffing in Ekalakala, we posted four trained teachers to the area. Teachers are being posted continuously, when they are found in other areas, and that is why the figures he is giving may not be correct.</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR. KIILU: Mr. Speaker, sir, can the Assistant Minister assure the House' that during the time of recruitment this understaffing will be cleared and that enough teachers will be posted to tha division which has stayed for a long time? without adequate teachers?</Newspeech>     <Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Yes, Sir, we will recruit teachers from these zones that are? understaffed.</Newspeech>Question No. 393Number of Dam Construction Units in NyeriMR. MUREITHI asked the Minister for Water Development how many dam construction units there are in Nyeri District and where they are currently located.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Mweu): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.At present my Ministry does not have any dam construction units in Nyeri District.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUREITHI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in view of the fact that Kieni Constituency is a semi-arid area, can the Assistant Minister consider stationing one dam construction unit there so that it can assist wananchi in the construction of dams?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWEU: We will do that Sir, depending on availability of funds. MR. MUREITHI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the' Assistant Minister aware! that in some parts of Kieni Constituency wananchi have paid money to his Ministry so that dams can be constructed for them, something which has not been done up to now?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWEU: I am not aware of that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

MISOI asked the Minister for Local Government what action he is taking to ensure that Nairobi City Commission acquires adequate break-down (recovery) vehicle's for its own use and to earn income from service's rendered rather than relying on hired vehicle's.<Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Ministry of Local Government.</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Anybody from the Ministry of Local Government?</Newspeech>        <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TECHNICAL TRAINING AND PPLIED TECHNOLOGY (Mr. Leakey): Mr. Speaker., Sir, on behalf of the Minister for Local Government I beg to reply.     The Ministry of Local Government has authorised the Nairobi City Commission to" utilise the service charge funds to purchase one additional breakdown motor vehicle this year and two more next year. Some of the vehicles in the transport section will also, be repaired and converted to towing vehicles. This will boost the towing vehicles fleet and hence eliminate the use of privately hired vehicles hopefully by December next year.</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Assistant Minister for that assurance that the City Commission will purchase more	breakdown vehicles. Most people have had very bad experiences especially when their vehicles have been towed away to the City Commission depots or to the Traffic Police headquarters. There is we always some genuine concern that those who have been, given this job may have	some common interest with those who are in charge; either within the City Commission or the other institution. There is an element of exploitation in this whole affair. I therefore request the Ministry to make it a policy throughout Kenya that local authorities or even the police should have their own breakdown vehicles because there is an element of corruption in this; share-share. Could the Assistant Minister assure the House that such a policy will be forthcoming?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. LEAKEY: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member has made a very serious allegation. He has implied that there is corruption and collusion between the breakdown service that hire and members of the Nairobi City Commission, Mr. Speaker, Sir, would you assist me to make sure that the hon. Member substantiates that allegation or withdraws it?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell the House whether this work of towing vehicles is awarded through tender? What system do they use to award these jobs?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEAKEY: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have no intention of answering anything until he substantiates his allegation. <Newspeech>DR. MISOI: I beg to differ with the Assistant Minister, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Unless he confirms that the warding of this work is done through advertising or tendering, it means that there is something fishy about the whole affair.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. LEAKEY: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member stated clearly that there is an element of corruption in this matter. If he cannot substantiate that the I ask the Chair to request him to withdraw that statement.<Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Hon. Dr. Misoi, did you say "there is something fishy" or what did you say?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said that there is something fishy which needs clarification. That is what I said.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEAKEY: Mr. Speaker, Sir, he clearly used the word "corruption". Could you ask him to withdraw that word?</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. SPEAKER: Did you use the word  "corruption" or did you really mean to say a different thing?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said that there may be something fishy about this service particularly if the awarding of the work is not done through the open tender system.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER; Okay. We will take it that the hon. Member used the word "fishy".</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEAKEY: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I accept your ruling on that issue. I would also add that if there is something fishy about this matter, we are not aware of it. We would urge the hon. Member to please lead us to where that "fishy" is and we will deal with it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAMOYU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell us how much is charged when a breakdown vehicle tows a car from the City centre to the Nairobi Traffic Headquarters?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEAKEY: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not in a position to give that information here now. But I am sure that if the hon. Member insists on getting that information we can supply him with that information, but as a Member of Parliament from Nairobi I am sure he can find out this just I as easily from- the Ministry.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Kagwima's Question.</Newspeech>Question No.421 Maintenance of Road C92MR. KAGWIMA asked the Minister for Public Works what steps the Ministry has taken to ensure that road C92 (Ena-Ishiara-Meru) is properly maintained and the bush along the road cleared.      <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Maiyani): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Ministry has released the first allocation of roads maintenance funds for 1990/91 Financial Year to the District Works Officer, Meru, and he has programmed to start carrying out maintenance work along road C92 including bush clearing.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAGWIMA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I appreciate that good answer from the Assistant Minister. Could the Assistant Minister tell this House how much money out of that first allocation has "been released and how much of that money will be spent on Road. C92?</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>MR. MAIYAIII: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to inform the House that maintenance of Road C92. is scheduled to commence during the second week of August, this year. A total of K£l,989 has been allocated for maintenance of class "C" roads in Mem District which include Road C92. There is no breakdown own of this money to show how much is going to road C92 but nevertheless it will get a portion of that total sum. The allocation was released on 16th July, 1990, vide A.I.E. No. MOPW.7/R/335/90/91/65 and the project's account is R385-460-281.</Newspeech>      <Newspeech>MR. KAGWIMA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Assistant Minister for that reply. But when he says that this money has been allocated for maintenance of class "C" roads in Meru District, would he be kind enough to tell the House how many roads under that category are there and the total length of those roads? I ask this question because K£l,989 is only about KShs.40,000/-.</Newspeech>     <Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the information I have before me, which was produced specifically to answer this Question, does not show how many roads under class "C" are in that particular area. But I am confident that my officers in Meru did forward their request for this money considering the length of these roads. If the money is not enough, I would request the hon. Member to see our District Works Officer in Meru and find out what is happening. If there is any defficiency he is free to bring another Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MB. SPEAKER: Let us move on now to Questions by Private Notice.</Newspeech><Header>QUESTIONS BY PRIVATE NOTICE</Header>Measures to Improve Services: Machakos District Hospital <Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Health the following Question, by Private Notice:-Since medical services provided at Hachakos District Hospital are deteriorating and realising that this issue has consistently been raised in this House, could the Minister make an undertaking to visit this hospital with a view to taking remedial measures.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Dr. Godana): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to give the following reply. I am happy to inform the hon. Member that I shall visit Hachakos District Hospital soon.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was only yesterday that I raised a Question by Private Notice in this House regarding Ward No.9 in the same hospital where male and female mental patients are allowed to share the ward.Previously, I had asked another Question by Private Notice complaining about lack of be dings in the hospital and I was assured that blankets and sheets were going to be provided to Machakos District Hospital, I also have raised another Question by Private Notice in this same House complaining about the maternity ward in the same hospital where as many as three women are sharing the same bed and I was promised that action was going to be taken to extend the maternity ward but so far nothing has been done. I am seeking your guidance Mr. Speaker in this particular Question where I am just requesting the Minister to visit the Hospital to see for himself what is happening. I remember there was a time that the Minister promised to supply an X-Ray machine to the hospital during his answer to another Ques that I had raised here. The Minister has a Government vehicle which has a lot of petrol and also has a driver, tell this House when he is going to visit this hospital. We do not want to hear him saying he will visit this hospital soon; we want him to ± give us a specific date when he is going to do SO I am saying this because the services in this hospital have almost come to a standstill, and patients are suffering.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. GODANAY: Mr. Speaker, from what hon. Wambua is saying about this particular hospital, I suspect that he does not know much about it.I am saying this because my Ministry's Headquarters has been in touch with the administrators of this hospital. During the last six months, there have at least been 11 visits by senior officials of the Ministry and the Minister himself Hon. Mwai Kibaki visited the hospital in April this year. Therefore, I do not think it pays for the hon. Member to sound the. kind of alarm that he is sounding regarding the problems in this hospital. The point is that the Minister is fully aware of the problems affecting the hospital and we do not think there is any cause for alarm. As I have already said, we shall visit this hospital very soon but I cannot say here and now that we shall do so tomorrow,</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like the Assistant Minister to give us a specific date when they are going to visit this hospital. Yesterday, the hon. Member from this area brought a Question here saying that female and male mental patients are allowed to share the same ward in this hospital. Today, the same hon. Member has brought a Question complaining about the deteriorating in the same hospital. Therefore, if the Assistant Minister is serious enough when he says that they are aware of the problems affecting this hospital, he should be able to give us a specific date when he is going to visit this hospital. In fact, he should be aware that the state in our the Republic is terrible and we are all concerned. You will find no medicine, no blankets, no sheets in our hospitals and this is a very serious matter. He should tell us when he is going to visit Margafrfr Machakos District Hospital which is much closer to Nairobi than Bungoma District Hospital is. He should tell us why he is afraid of visiting this hospital.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE GODANYA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not afraid of visiting this hospital and this is why I said that the Minister will visit the hospital very soon. I am sure everybody in this House knows the meaning of the word, "soon". However, I cannot here and now</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is it really in order for the Assistant Minister to say that the hon. Member from this area does not know the problems affecting this hospital. How does he bring this Question here if he does not know what is happening in this hospital?</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: He is as much out of order as you are in thinking that he is not taking this natter seriously.</Newspeech>    (laughter)    <Newspeech>DR. MISOI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. This Question says that the services in this hospital are deteriorating and despite the fact that this matter has been raised here consistently, no action seems to be taken. For this reason, is the Assistant Minister really in order to say that the Minister will visit this hospital soon, instead of giving us a specific date for this visit, considering the gravity of the matter?</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>DR. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am perfectly in order not to give the date of the visit here. This is because the programmes of Ministerial work cannot be drawn up here in the House but at the Ministry's Headquarters. However, I have said that we shall visit the hospital very soon and that the matter is receiving our utmost attention.</Newspeech>        <Newspeech>THE SPEAKER: Next Question! Mr. Momanyi.        Tea Cess Remitted to Gusii Country Council MR.MQMANYI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Agriculture the following Question by Private Notice:       How much money, in terms of cess collection, has been remitted to Gusii County Council by the eight tea factories located both in Kisii and Hyamira Districts.</Newspeech>      <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Ngaruro): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. Since the inception of one per cent cess reduction from the green leaf proceeds in July, 1989, a gross at sum of KShs.4,606,662.60 have been deducted by the eight tea factories in Kisii and Nyamira Districts and the same amount has been forwarded to the Gusii County Council.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MOMANYI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister ask the Gusii County Council to the district development committee so that it can be distributed to the various tea roads in this area? I am asking this because we have very bad tea roads in this area and the armers find it very difficult to transport their tea to the factories.</Newspeech>      <Newspeech>MR. NGARUBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was decided that from March, 1990, instead of forwarding this money to the country council, it would be forwarded to the district treasury through the Ministry of Public Works. The Ministry of Public Works plus the district development committee and the county council will sit down and decide which roads need to be done first. In fact, we are greatful to the Ministry of Public Works because in most districts, they have tea made available, equipment for repairing these/roads. Therefore, the hon. Member being a member of the district development committee should pursue this matter when this discussion comes up.</Newspeech>       <Newspeech>MR. MOMANTI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, would the Assistant Minister be kind enough to give us the breakdown of this amount so that we can know how much each factory has contributed for cess.</Newspeech>       <Newspeech>MR. NGAEURO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not have this information now but I am willing to make this information available to the hon. Member as soon as he comes to my office.</Newspeech>       <Newspeech>MR. TERER: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has asked hon. Momar$ri to go to his office for this information, but this Question is now the property of the House and therefore, we would like the Assistant Minister to bring this information here. Could he promise to do so?</Newspeech>      <Newspeech>MR. NGAHORO: Mr. Speaker,Sir, the hon. Member is quite in order to say that I should bring this information here, but the reason whys I asked the hon. Member to come to my office is because he had asked a supplementary question relating to factories that are specifically in his own area. This is why I wanted him to come over so that we can discuss this matter over a of tea in my office.</Newspeech>	<Header>POINTS OP ORDER</Header><Newspeech>MR. KAGWIMA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir:The present Minister for Public Works is doing a lot of good work for this country in terms of roads maintenance and also in supporting Motions passed in this House. A Motion was passed here last year on 29th November, 1989, urging the Ministry of Public Works to tarmac road C.92. I have tried to find out as to whether the Minister has received a copy of that Motion from the Clerk, National Assembly or not so that he can start work on that road? I have not been informed anything since that time.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KITELE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Mine will be a short one. This concerns my name having been mentioned last Tuesday in this House.I stand here today to pledge my total loyalty to His Excellency the President and the Government of this country and also to the ruling Party Kanu.Kenya has been enjoying a lot to peace because it has been guaranteed by the President and we are all very happy that we have been enjoying this peace. We need this peace and anybody who is interrupting it, is with Secondly, I categorically deny any link with the multiparty advocates who were involved in putting my name in the list.I am also one of the people who have condemned them in this House and also outside this House. So, I do not know how my name came to appear in their list. I have no connection with them and I disassociate myself with them. I am here as a Member of Parliament on a Kanu ticket. So, how can I deviate or Kanu having been brought in this House by Kanu ticket?I am a strong supporter of Kanu and I wil never deviate from Kami. I am for one party system and the party is Kanu, led by the President Daniel Toroitich arap Moi. That is all. We do  not need two parties, We saw what happened when we had several parties. We had Kadu, Kenya People's Union (K.P.U.) and so on. So, we do not need many parties now. We sire satisfied with the ruling Party Kami and we do not any more parties.I am a Kanu life member and I do not see how I can work against Kanu.Thank you.</Newspeech><Header>MINISTERIAL STATEMENT</Header><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Waithaka): Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the proceedings in this House on Tuesday, 17th July, 1990, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation, hon. Ndolo Ayah, M.P., drew our attention to an incident that occurred on Saturday, 7th July, 1990, when a private conversation in Luo language could be heard over the radio soon after the 9-00 p.m. Kiswahili news bulletin. The private conversation was not only unauthorised but it was also not related in any way to the news bulletin concerned or any other radio programme.In view of such a serious occurrence and also in order to establish the facts and to ensure that such an event is not repeated in future, I undertook immediate investigation into the incident. As a result, I was able to confirm that on Saturday, 7th July, 1990, from about 9.16 p.m. to 9.30 p.m. and soon after the evening Kiswahili news bulletin there was a leakage of a private telephone conversation in the post office programme line into our radio transmitting station at Yala. The kind of conversation which leaked into our system appeared to be the one which hon. Ndolo Ayah had drawn our attention to.      Following the discovery of this leakage, we immediately drew the attention of Kenya Posts and Telecommunication Corporation (K.P.T.C.) to this incident and asked them to urgently carry out investigations and to let us know the cause as well as the action the K.P.T.C. was going to take in order to avoid any future inter-ference. Our investigations established that the rest of our National Service News Bulletin of the day concerned were clean and did not contain any background noise. We have also confirmed that the leakage occurred only at Yala Radio Station and nowhere else. The problem was limited and localised to the Yala area. Our earlier suspicion that the leakage might have occurred at our main station in Nairobi turned out to be without foundation.This House will be interested to know that such problems do not occur frequently in our programmes. In order to ensure that Kenya Broadcasting Corporation similar incidents not occur in future, the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (K.B.C.). plans to phase out gradually reliance on K.P.T.C. lines. This will be done through the establishment of reliable F.M. Radio Programmes links between Nairobi and our field stations. It is expected that the work on the new links will be completed by 1992. Meanwhile, every effort will be made in consultation with the K.P.T.C. in order to minimise or eradicate such leakages. Police are already investigating the incident actively.Thank you.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. As a result of that statement from the Minister, wananchi are interested to know the contents of that conversation. He is just giving us a statement, but we want to know the contents of that conversation because we were told that it also touched on matters of multi-parties. We cannot exonerate K.B.C. from the blame. When reading news, I am sure the readers also hear what they are reading in the background.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr.Waithaka):Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the hon. Member listened carefully to whatI said, the police have been alerted about this incident, and investigations are being carried out and it is too early to say what the discussion was all about because the police have still to give us a statement on that.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr.Chesire)On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I wanted to follow what the Minister said because he mentioned about a leakage of a line between Kisumu and Yala. At the same time, I am also aware of a line in Loresho which I was trying to contact for quite some time but I was unable to get through. But when I met my friend eventually, he told me that they were unable to get out, but the K.B.C. line was on that telephone. Could he also investigate on this one? There could have been many more lines that appear to have been connected to the K.3.C. other than the one he is talking about in Kisumu.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. If a conversation in the Luo Language was heard the people knew exactly what they were talking about. It is, therefore, up to the Minister to tell us what the conversation was about. The police are only investigating to establish who were involved in the conversation. Whethere the conversation was in English, Swahili or any other language, will the Minister tell us what it all about?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR  INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Kanyi): Mr. Speaker, Sir, the matter is being investigated. I personally do not understand the Luo Language and so did not hear what was being discussed. We shall thus rely on the investigations being carried out, and as soon as I get all the details, I shall come and make another Ministerial statement in this House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. While we appreciate the Minister's point that he does not understand theLuo Language we are likely to go for a recess and we want the Minister to promise that tomorrow he will tell us who were talking and what they were talking about.This is important because that is where Bishop Okullu operates from and, perhaps, he was the one talking.  We are entitled to know about it especially at this time when some people have died because of the actions of the multi-party proponents. This is serious, and yet somebody in the Ministry is taking things for granted. We want to know who was talking so we can take corrective measures against those involved. Can the Minister tell us whether he will bring here tomorrow a taped version of that conversation? Even this Kenya Broadcasting Corporation has outlived its purpose.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Kanyi):Mr. Speaker, Sir, these matters touch on state security and we cannot go on discussing them before investigations have been concluded. The police have been given orders to investigate. So, I have reason to believe that I shall soon get a report on the matter, and as soon as I get it I will come and make a statement in this House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

I am going to raise two points of order. The first one concerns the Ministry of Health. Two weeks ago I asked a Question in this House regarding clinical officer for Kitise Health Centre and I was told that a clinical officer had been sent to this health centre on the 4th of this month. But over the end I was at Kitiss Health Centre and found that no clinical officer had been sent there I believed that the answers we are given in this House are nothing, but the truth. Now when wananchi hear a reply being given here which does not turn to be the truth, I stand to be guided by the Chair.Mr. Speaker, Sir, my other issue concerns a Question I asked here on the 12th of this month regarding our national youth sports team that will represent us in the International Youth Sports.The Minister for Culture and Social Services himself stood up and promised to give this House an answer by Thursday last week	but he was not here on that day and I am yet to hear anything from him. If the Minister is here it would only be fair for him to makes  a statement. If he is not here, we would like to have the guidance of the Chair on what we should do when we raise matters that we think are of importance to this nation and then we are given half answers or no answers or what we are told does not materialise; it is as if we are wasting time. Thank you, Sir.</Newspeech>        <Newspeech>MR.

MANG'OLI: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me continue from where I left yesterday. I was saying that the Mover of this particular Bill has ably presented material evidence to convince this House that it is important to have Moi Day, and it is important to support the Attorney—General in getting this Bill enacted.While we appreciate the many things that His Excellency the President has done, I will be short of words if I do not mention that as far as sports and games are concerned, we have Nyayo National Stadium and Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani. The President has done a great job and it is important that we appreciate this. He has worked marvelously in 12 years.With respect to unemployment alleviation, he has appointed commissions to look into the issue. There was the first commission, and now there is a second similar commission to look into the issue of unemployment. When this commission makes its recommendations, I am sure that the wananchi who Eire now unemployed will get jobs. However, as we talk in praise of Moi Day, there are some parastatal bodies that are now on the way of sacking their workers. We ask these bodies in the Nyayo Spirit to hold on because this cannot be the time for all such bodies to declare their workers redudant. I say this because the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation has started sacking its employees and I wonder whether the Minister for Transport and Communications is aware of the fact that most of the senior fellows with this Corporation have been sacked on matters that may be tribal. I say this clearly because these people have been working with the Corporation for a long time. Then someone just stood up and said that they should go home. It is important that we tell parastatal bodies, that are partly owned by the Government, to keep wananchi in their jobs. If we allow them to sack wananchi left and right, these wananchi will be left helpless.We say this very clearly. When the Kenya Airways Corporation laid off workers recently, the criterion it used in doing so is highly suspect because it was very tribal and needs to be checked. Those responsible for this lay-off are the ones who are spoiling the name of His Excellency the President, and when they do so they turn round the next day and say that it the work of His Excellency the President. However, it is the President who appoints managers to run parastatal bodies. We say so because</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Kones): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The hon. Member talking is making a very important contribution, but he is also making some very dangerous allegation that there are parastatal bodies, such as the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications and Kenya Airways, which have sacked people on a tribal basis. Could he make some clear substantiation of his statement? When he talks about tribalism, we would like to know what exactly he means.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wonder whether the Assistant Minister really wants me to tell him anything here. We are not here to name people, and I am sure it understandable why this is so. We support His Excellency the President and we would like people to be clean on national issues. I say this very clearly. It is important that wananchi are protected by this House. If they are being sacked left and right, and we say that that is the way things should continue to be done, this is wrong and we say here</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Maiyani): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Much has been said so far, and I would like to beg your permission to move that the Mover be now called upon to reply.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Well, the decision is yours, hon. Members. So, I  will put the Question</Newspeech>(Question, that the Mover be now called upon to reply, put and agreed to)<Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a few comments and also thank those hon. members who contributed to this Bill, including hon. Mang'oli whose contribution was cut short by a closure.Every hon. Member who spoke contributed to this Bill by praising His Excellency the President for what he has done for this country. Whatever was said has already been recorded in the HANSARD. So, I do not see any point that I should reply to in particular. I only want to request hon.

Members, me included, to do that which we are supposed to. All the hon. Members have in unison confered this little award to the President for the good job well done through his wise leadership. What I would only like to add is to ask the hon. Members to assist the President to run this country smoothly. The only way we can do this is by supporting him in all that he is doing in order to make this country rise to higher heights.      Although this is a small token, that appreciation by the hon.

In my opinion, this is an essential item but not a luxury. Can the Assistant Minister tell why he had to impose duty of 25 per cent when we know that some mothers do not have milk to breast feed their children and that some mothers are working and have to leave their children to be fed on this infant milk. Why does the Assistant Minister not find a way of waiving this duty imposed on this commodity which is essential to families?</Newspeech>       <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Kariuki): Madam Temporary Deputy Chairman, the hon.

(The Motor Car Loan Scheme).<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY  OF FINANCE (Mr. Kariuki):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would now like to very briefly explain the; purpose of these amendments. On 29th November, 1988, pursuant to Section 6(1) of the External Loans and Credit Act, Cap. 422 of the Laws of Kenya, this House approved the increase! of total indebtedness in respect of principal amounts of money borrowed or credit obtained by the Government, under Section 2 of the' Act, from K£2,500 million to K£4,200 million. At the same time, pursuant to Section 3(B) of the1 Guarantees (Loans) Act, Cap. 461 of the Laws of Kenya, this House approved the increase of total contingent liability of the Government for principal money for the time being outstanding under the guarangee given under Section 3(1) or referred to Section 8 of the Act, from K£150 million to K£200 million in case of covenants expressed in Kenya currency.On 3rd November, 1988, pursuant again to Section 3(B) of the Guarantee (Loans) Act, Cap. 461 of the Laws of Kenya, this House approved the increase of total contingent liability in respect of the principal amount of money borrowed or credit obtained under Section 3A(2) of the Act from K£3,600,000 to K£5 million. This credit covers the Car Loans Scheme operated by civil servants, Members of Parliament and teachers employed by the Teachers Service Commission.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, sir, it has become necessary to raise the ceilings on total external  borrowing in order to support our development objective's as set out in Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1986. As you know, exchange rate' adjustments have' raised the Kenya Shilling equivalent of external loans denominated in various currencies beyond the ceilings set but in December, 1988.In the Budget Speech of June, 1989, it was stated that the' Government Conner that the external debt management should be developed into a more active tool of overall management policy. In the past during periods large balances of payment deficits, we have borrowed funds abroad to supplement our foreign exchange reserves. In the implementation of the Budget, as a matter of policy, we have to focus almost exclusively on funds which are available on concessionary ratherrather than on commercial terms. I am glad to report that due to concessionary loans the average terms of new commitments, for example interest rates, maturity periods, grace periods and grant element improved quite considerably over the last two years.Sir, during the current Development Plan period, it is expected that the Budget and Current Account deficit will decline as proportional of GDP. Correspondingly a decline in public debts and debt servicing is envied. This concessionary loan will be used to help finance priority development projects throughout the country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as you may be: aware, public officers, Members of Parliament and teachers employed by the Teachers Service Commission receive? loans to purchase personal cars through the Motor Car Advances administered by the National Bank of Kenya. The need to increased the current contingent liability has arisen due' to a number of reason, most of which are known to hon. Members here. Firstly, the1 prices of motor vehicles have risen sharply during the last several years. Thus, it has become necessary to revise the minimum amount of advance so that the office and hon. Members can acquire? vehicle's. Secondly, this House increases the maximum amount to be advanced to Members of Parliament to enable them to purchase more reliable and economic cars. Thirdly, the number of public officers and teachers applying for motor car advances has substantially increased over the years.Sir, I have emphasized that the fresh borrowing will almost entirely be on concessionary terms and, therefore, repayment will be set far into the future, at which date it is impossible to determine the valued of the? Kenya Shilling vis-à-vis other foreign currencies in which Kenya has debts. This uncertainty with respect to the valued of the Kenya Shillings requires some lack in external borrown ceiling.The Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation has acquired some commercial loans to finance part of the cable requirements for telecommunicationsprogramme during 1990 and 1993, arid more importantly to finance part of the transfer of technology for Kenya Posts arid Telecommunications Multi-Purpose Manufacturing Complete at Gilgil. The loan proceeds will also be utilised for the supply of telecommunications equipment and services for the Kenya Posts arid Telecommunications Corporations on-going rural telecommunication development programmes associated with the' Kenya Government focus on district for rural development.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the' expansion of the Athi River Cement Factory and the Multi-Purpose1 Manufacturing Complex at Gilgil, together with the modernisation of the Moi International Airport, Mombasa, will earn the: country substantial foreign exchange. In addition, all these projects will spar production iri the modern sectors and create employment opportunities.In conclusion, Sir, left me point out that during this year's Budget, the Vice-President and the Minister for Finance discussed, under the heading of "Fiscal Policy", the finanes of state corporations or parastatals. This is also an area of public sector for finance that is causing great concern. There is now a widespread lack of financial control arid discipline. For instance, it is not unusual that parastatals engage in new investments while they are falling behind, or even in default, on their obligations to the Treasury. In addition, there is a Equally disturbing development. The Government, as the guarantor of external loans by parastatals, is being increasingly being called upon to honour parastatal loans when these parastatals default. The Trerasury is there forced to divert funds from budgeted purposes to meet these obligations. As a consequence, the Budget becomes distorted arid the deficit remains too high. These developments are totally unacceptable. I want to make it clear that the Government will not honour such parastatal debt obligations without a thorough investigation of the circumstances behind payment defaults.Now, Sir, pursuant to Section1 6(1) of the' External Loans Act, Cap. 422 of the Laws of Kenya, we are seeking art increase in "total indebtedness in respect of principal amount of money borrowed or credit obtained under Section 2 of the Act from the equivalent of K£4,200 million" to K£5000 million. Also, pursuant to Section 3(B)of the Guarantee (Loans) Act, Cap 461 of the Laws of Kenya, we want an increase in the total contingent liability of the Government for principal money for the time being outstanding under the guarantee given under Section 3(1) or referred to at Section 8 of the Act, from K£200 million to. K£300 million in case of covenants expressed in Kenya currency and from K£1,000. million to K£2,000 million in the case of covenants expressed in other than Kenya currency.Also, pursuant to Section 3(B) of the? Guarantee (Loans) Act, Cap 461 of the laws of Kenya, we are seeing an increase of the total contingent liability in respect of the principal amount of money borrowed or credit obtained under Section 3A(2) of the Act, from the sum of K£5 million to K£10 million.With the full support of the Government, Tana and Athi River Development Authority has successfully negotiated for a loan of Japanese? Yen totalling 6,031 million, that is equivalent to KShs.876,344,000/-, from the Overseas economic Co—operation Fund of Japan. The loan bears an interest rate? of 2.5 per cent per annum payable semi-annually on the principal disbursed and outstanding. The loan carriers 10 years grace period and 20 years repayment period.</Newspeech>		<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr.Kariuki.) Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sure hon. Members would like to know now the proceeds are going to be utilized. I would therefore like to inform the House that the proceeds of the loans shall be used for the purchaser of eligible goods and services necessary for the implementation of the projects from suppliers, contractors or consultants. The scope of the work will also involve construction of irrigation facilities including work for administration buildings and a forestation, construction of estates funds a State farm manage management and consulting services.The East African Portland Cement Company Limited is a limited liability company registered under the Companies Act; it has a share capital of Kill, 500,000. The Company manufactures cement by utilization of locally available raw materials, with the full assistance of the Kenya Government East African Portland Cement Company Limited has successfully negotiated for a loan of Japense Yen 7,674 million and that is an equivalent of Khs.1,115,032,300.00 from the Overseas Economic Co-operation Fund of Japan. The loan is concessionary and it bears an interest rate of 2.5 per cent per annum payable semi-annually on the principal amount disbursed.In 1983, the total local consumption of cement per year was only 517,000 tonnes of cement. In 1939 the consumption had risen to 1,017,000 tonnes. So, you can see the necessity for the expansion of the company.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the 'technology currently- used. at Athi River, which is called the Wet Processing is very expensive in terms of fuel consumption. At the present low level production, the factory burns about 130 metric tonnes of fuel per day At an increased production of 552,000 tonnes per year the factory would burn about 215 metric tonnes of fuel per day. This would cost a lot to the company and also to the nation in terms of foreign exchange. The project funded by this loan is therefore intended to change. the technology and modernise it. It will change it to the Dry Processing Method which will save fuel consumption "by up to 45 per cent thereby considerably reducing the production cost. The National Assembly is therefore.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister has touched on the East Africa Portland Cement Company Limited. I would like him to tell the House whether this is a privately owned company or it is a Government parastatal.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Kariuki) : Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir I do not know whether the hon. Member is in order, first of all, to interrupt me "before I have actual1y finished moving the Motion. But all the same, I am glad to respond to his question. The East African Portland Cement Company is a parastatal and the majority of the shares are owned by the Government of Kenya." The Government of Kenya owns 52 per cent of the shares; 14 per cent is owned by Blue Circle Industries of the United Kingdom; 14 per cent is owned "by Cement Holdings Limited of Switzerland while 20 per cent is owned by the public through stock exchange. So, the Company is 72 per cent locally-owned; 52 per cent by theGovernment and 20 per cent by the Kenyan public. I am therefore asking Parliament to approve the Government guarantee of a loan of Japanese Yen 7,674 million; that is equivalent to KShs.1,115,082,800/- from the Overseas Economic Co-operation Fund of Japan to the East African Portland Cement Company Limited.The current total contigent liabilities of the Government of Kenya in respect of the guarantee given under Section of the Guarantee Loans Act, other than those specified in the Schedule to the Act, amount to K£l,041,783,746 and with this guarantee of a sum equivalent to K£55,754,0140, the aggregate amount will be increased to K£l,097,537,886 of which K£83,489,499 will fall within paragraph"A" and K£l,014,048,387 will fall within paragraph "3" of Section 33 of the Act.I beg to move.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to second this Motion and to confirm that the borrowings and guarantees requested by the Assistant Minister are within the laws of this land. The financial management of any money in Kenya is governed by the law. For instance, to withdraw any money from the Consolidated Fund, we have to come to this House and ask you to pass an Appropriation Act or a Supplementary Appropriation Act to meet the Recurrent and Development expenditures.It becomes very necessary for the Government to borrow money from abroad. Indeed any nation in an international community, and we are a member of the international community, has the right to engage in financial transactions of an international nature. As the Assistant Minister has given the House the merits of why he wants to raise the ceilings. If Kenya borrows over and above theceiling, that would be an offence; Kenya would be acting contrary to its own laws. So, as the Assistant Minister has explained he wishes, on the first occasion Under our External Loans and Credit Act, Cap.422 of the laws of Kenya, the Assistant Minister is asking this House to increase the total indebtedness of money; is to increase the figure from K£4,200 million to that K£5,000 million. At the moment the indebtedness stands at K£4,200 million and that is not sufficient to our requirements as the Assistant Minister has already explained. So, he applies this External Loans and Credits Act, through this House, to increase the amount of total indebtedness which is for the time being standing as money borrowed or credit obtained under the Act. He wants to increase this figure of K£4,200 million to K£5,000 million. That is the ceiling the Assistant Minister wants us to raise.	This is the borrowing ceiling which the Minister wants this House to approve and he has various reasons for making this request in order to deal with a lot of development activities within our programmes. I -would like to confirm that in part (a) of this Motion, the increase in total idebtedness is governed by the External Loans and Credit Act. Therefore, the House would he within its powers to grant the Minister this increase to enable him to cany out the programmes that he has mentioned. The second reason for moving this Motion is to guarantee loans intended for development. I would like to say that this guarantee does not always give rise to the liability on the daythat the guarantee is made, But comes to effect when the borrower fails to pay. For example, in the case of the Kenya Airways, the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications or indeed any other organization, being unable to repay its loans, the Kenya Government would come in to assist them by way of guarantee. That guarantee does not become right until the Kenya Airways or any other parastatal fails to meet its obligations. It is only at this very juncture that the Kenya Government would be called upon to honour its guarantee. Such a situation is known in law as contingent liability. It is referred to as contingent because the loan does not become payable until the borrower has failed to pay the liabilities upon him, at which point, the Government is called upon to honour its guarantee.Therefore, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister would like to raise the ceiling of this guarantee and has come to this House to request hon. Members to approve the raising of the contingent liability to the tune mentioned in part (b) of this Motion, namely, from K£1,000 million to K£2,000 million. This, again is in order and in conformity with the law, namely under the Guarantee Loans Act Cap.461 of the laws of Kenya. Therefore, having been satisfied with merits of such rise in the standards with respect to contingent liability, this Souse is within its legal powers to approve the rise. The merits as explained by the Minister, in my view, are very deserving.The other type of liability is very common, particularly where civil servants wish to hire cars and by so doing, they go to the bank andthe bank gives them loans for the purchase of cars. Here, the Government is once again called upon to guarantee the payment of that kind of loan to the bank by the borrower. However the Government is only called upon to pay the loan if the borrower fails to pay. This is another form of contingent liability in respect of motor-car loan schemes and so on. Here the Minister is asking for an increase of the total contingent liability in respect of the principal amount of money borrowed or credit obtained from K£5 million to K£10 million. I think this increase is justified. As we all know the civil service cadre has become very large and the need therefore for mobility by the civil servants is also very high. Therefore, I recommend that the contingent liability in respect of the Motor Car Loans Scheme as guaranteed by Government, is increased as indicated above. This exercise is called, raising of standards" as approved previously. I do not want to go into the merits of doing this because these have been well elaborated by the Minister with clarity and conviction. Therefore, I recommend that the Minister be given the approval for raising the levels of guarantees to enable him to undertake the development programmes that he envisages during this current year.With those few remarks, I beg to second.</Newspeech>(Question proposed)<Newspeech>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Kyalo): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand to support this Motion due to its importance. As we all know, Kenya has developed as a result of hard work on part of our people and also as a result of peace and stability, which has guided us in our development. So country in the world can develop without technical know-how and also capital finance from outside. We in Kenya have reached a stage where all these things are required and therefore, we have to get them even if it this means at a cost. When moving this Motion, the Minister said that part of this money is being borrowed to cater for technology particularly in the Gilgil Telecommunication Complex.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is an area where Kenya has tried as much as possible to do its best so as to fulfill its internal requirements and also to ensure that we expect as much as possible. This being thecase, there is a need, for this country to agree that foreign technology has its own cost and. that whether we like it or not, we have to agree it will have to he bought at a cost that at time might not be pleasant to us.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER OP STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Kyalo):  This is the way other, countries are going, about it. So, we have suit. At the same time, we have said that we are going to industrialise this country. So, we have to agree that industrialisation of this country is very important in terms of employment and other developments.Sir, I am glad to note that the Treasury is borrowing this money for the purpose of increasing the country's cement manufacturing. Without cement, no country can have a proper base for industrial development. The only thing that I would like to mention is that the technology that we are currently using is very expensive. Currently, we are using a lot of power for the purpose of manufacturing cement and I hope that the Minister will try as much as possible to find out whether we can adopt other technologies that might be slightly cheaper.At the same time, we also find that the cement that we are manufacturing now is not adequate for this country. I would even go further and say that there is a need to have another good cement factory in western Kenya for the purpose of supplying that area with cement and also for the purpose of exporting cement to our countries in the western region.For that matter, Sir, any money that will be borrowed to increase our cement capacity will be useful in creating a better base for our industrial development. At the same time, we hope that the Minister will try as much as possible to find out how we can have a cement factory in western Kenya so as to increase our export capacity and at the same time to reduce costs on our production. When it comes to transportation of cement, it is very expensive.Sir, I also note that the Minister is also borrowing this money for the purpose of developing and Athi Rivers basins.As we are all aware, these, basins are in the arid region, and the more we develop the arid regions the more we shall be aable to create more areas for human settlement. Kenya is faced with a tremendous population growth and there is a need to find out what we could do to ensure that the areas that are dry are developed for the purpose of settlement. We could move out some of the population from the densely populated areas to those areas so as to ease the congestion in the country.Not only that. There is also need to ensure that our food production in the country is also increased to match our population and also for export purpose. For this reason, I feel that there is a need for the Minister in charge of arid regions to have proper plains for the purpose of human settlement for the purpose of increasing our food production and also for the purpose of increasing production in ranching and so on. We should have a proper study of the Tana and Athi Rivers region so that we can increase all round production in the area. Therefore, to borrow money for this purpose is not only good for the country but we shall also be increasing the potential of this country in it3 expansion all round. I hope that the Minister for Reclamation and Development of Arid, Semi-Arid and Wastelands will look into the question of some of the proposed dams that had been proposed earlier on. For example, there was a proposal that a dam should be constructed near Donyo Sabuk which should be known as Munyu Dam. I do not know how far that proposal has gone, but I think there is a need currently to try as much as possible to revive that proposal because once that dam is built, it will be possible to irrigate the whole of Yatta Plateau down to Malindi. If that can be done, we shall have opened a dry area that can accommodate a very big percentage of our population which is currently giving us trouble.I hope that these, studies should "be given serious thoughts so as to open up that land.Not only that. There is also the question of opening up the whole of Tana basin for the purpose of human settlement. I think that adequate studies and plans have not been done and time has come for this country to take up this matter seriously so as to plan ahead and ensure that those are areas that we shall move the extra population that has grown as a result of development that we had in this country. Once the amount of money borrowed is put to proper use, it will just be a drop in the ocean. We shall need more money because once that area is opened, the economic development of this country will take shape.Sir, there is also the question of money being borrowed to finance motor vehicles for hon. Members, civil servants and so on. I think this is good borrowing in that - if you go outside here - most hon. Members have old vehicles which are repaired here so as to avoid heavy expenses. Most of the cars are old and the jua kali outside here have helped hon. Members,but this is not enough. Hon. Members have wide areas to cover. So, they require better cars so as to serve wan an c hi properly. But it is not enough to depend on the jua kali the way we have done in the past. They have done a very good job for us and I commend them for their work. But there is a need for hon. Members to get better cars so as to serve wananchi better. This being the case, the money that will be borrowed will be put into good use. This is because hon. Members will be able to meet with their constituents and ensure that the contact is maintained. The same applies to a civil servant, a teacher and so on. A car today is not a luxury but a necessity. For most of the civil servants, a car is required for various . purposes, for instance, to come to the office and to serve Government.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Kyalo): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is also the need to expand the Moi International Airport, Mombasa. This airport has now become very important in our economic development. Today we earn Shs.3 billin from tourism, most of which is based in Mombasa, Nairobi and in the National Parks. Therefore, money on the expansion of Moi International Airport, Mombasa, will be well spent in that we will be expanding our ability to earn foreign. exchange from tourism. I would even go further and say that this airport should be as modem as the Jomo Kenyata International Airport, Nairobi, so that it can handle all types of aeroplanes bringing in tourists from other countries.In fact, I wish to say that tourism has become one of ourmost important foreign exchange earners. It should thus besupported by creating good infrastructure not only in the airports, but also by improving tourist roads and so on so that we can compete internationally. If we do not do this it is most likely that we will be overtaken by other countries; there are small countries like Sychelles that are coming up in tourism very fast.Whether we like it or not development cannot be achieved from internal resources only. No country has developed from its internal resources only every country that wants to develop has to open itself for foreign investments and also borrow. In our case, therefore, we have no alternative but to borrow for development.The Assistant Minister touched on state corporations, some of which are not in a position to finance themselves. If a corporation is unable to finance itself, it should not be financed from public funds it should be left to wind up. This is because from a business point of view, it is wrong to tax the public tofinance an organisation that is supposed to make profit. I agree with the Assistant Minister that state corporations must be self-finance in and should is not be financed from public funds. I should, therefor examine closely corporations which are not self-supporting and decide what to do with them.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, while the Kenya shilling is depreciating very fast, there is nothing abnormal about this. ",7h you look around you find that our shilling is a very strong currency in Africa and it is being used everywhere in the continent. We thus understand that we have to borrow to bridge the depreciation in our shilling but where should work hard to ensure that our shilling continues to be a strong currency in Africa.I generally support this Motion and would urge that we approve the increase in borrowing capacity that the Assistant Minister has asked for.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKAU: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, This Motion shows the role Parliament plays in our country and also we have democracy. This is because before the Government borrows money, it asks the people's representatives to give it the authority to do so.Secondly, that we are being asked to approve an increase in our borrowing capacity is a clear indication that the lending countries, especially Japan, consider Kenya to be credit worthy. This has been because Kenya has been servicing her debts without any problem. This is why Kenya has never had to ask for rescheduling of her debts. Therefore, despite what people say, Kenya has prudent financial management. Even recently, the Vice-President and Minister for Finance mentioned	here that the ratio of ourdebt servicing to our foreign exchange earnings had dropped fi 34 per cent to 27 per cent. This means that despite the finance difficulties that are facing other developing countries are continuously asking for moratoriums because they cannot debts shows that we are doing very well. Considering that the last 27 years we have been consistent in paying our debts lenders should thank us by writing off some of our loans. It done this recently for some countries like Zambia.        Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance also toon state corporations performance. I remember that in Budget speech last month the Vice-President and Minister for made it very clear any state corporation that will not meet expectations should not expect the Government to bail it out This is one thing on which the Vice—President and Minister for Finance should be  strict. By approving this contigent liability, we are committing the country and any company that is in business should make profit in order to be able to service its debts. We need these loans for our growth and development, but we would like those who manage parastatal bodies to know that a lot is expected of them.         Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, since parastatal bodies all over Africa have been a problem, time has come when the practice of political pay-offs should be stopped because in this practice, people are given responsibilities and when you look at them you find that there is some sort of political pay—off. We must now start looking for competent and experienced managers who will make our parastatal bodies efficient and profit-making. The failure of parastatal bodies occurs all over Africa. In fact, Kenya is lucky in that it has very competent managers, but time has come when political pay-offs in appointments should cease so as to curb the debt problem in Africa. People should be appointed because of their competence and exprience.       Having said that, I would like to add that those who give us loans and aid should avoid the conditions that they always give to developing countries. The first conditionality that was given by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund was structural adjustments. We, in Kenya, are lucky in that before these bodies started giving us that conditionality, the Kenyan finance managers in the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance laid the background very well and we had started our own internal structural adjustments. That is why Kenya has not had the same problems that other developing countries were facing. Structural adjustments have caused a lot of social unrest elsewhere, but Kenya has managed its affairs very well. All I am saying is that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which have given the conditionality of structural adjustments, after finding that developing countries</Newspeech>(Hon. Malebe stood up in his place)<Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,Sir. Our Standing Orders provide that there will be only one hon. Member standing in the Chamber at all times, that is the hon. Member speaking. I have noticed hon. Malebe was standing in his place at the same time as hon. Makau was on the Floor. Was he in order to do so.</Newspeech>     <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Dr. Wameyo): I confirm that hon. Malebe was out of order and that I have noted that fact.</Newspeech><Header>QUORUM</Header>   <Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I was standing up to bring to your notice the fact that the House has no quorum. All the same, I am sorry to have interrupted my dear friend.</Newspeech>         <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Dr. Wameyo): Ring the Division Bell.(The Division Bell was rung)We now have a quorum, and you may proceed, Mr. Makau.</Newspeech>      <Newspeech>MR. MAKAU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was saying that those who give loans, not only to Kenya but also to other developing countries, have been giving conditionalities, such as structural adjustments. Kenya is lucky because we had started our own internal structural adjustments before those concerned started giving these conditionalities. It has been proved that the structural adjustment programmes that have been imposed on developing countries have not worked; instead, they have caused social unrest.        You will find that those who give loans have continued to make sure that developing countries, which are helpless and have to look for loans, are given other new conditionalities in which they call for multi parties, and we, in Kenya, have said that this conditionality does not apply to us because we manage our loan repayment very well. It is very clear that this new conditionality is a way of trying to avoid financing developing countries because they want to finance their brothers in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. These people look at African countries as second rate whose people, cannot service their loans. So, we appeal to all the agencies and institutions that are giving these conditionalities to cause chaos in developing countries to stop doingso and understand that developing countries know what they are doing. Kenya in particular, which has very prudent management of its finances and economy, should not be lumped together with countries that have never had this success. Each country should be considered on its own merit when it comes to giving out loans. We know that there are countries that may have not managed their economy well, but Kenya has done very well and it should be exempted from meeting these conditionalities.Finally, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to take, this opportunity to congratulate the Vice—President and Minister for Finance and his officers on having continued the policy of concessionary loans. When he put up this Motion for approval, it was very clear that Kenya had been consistent in concentrating on places from which it got concessionary loans.At this juncture, this House should congratulate andcommend Japan for coming to the aid of Kenya. This is because when you look at the continent liability, you will find that Janan is one of those countries that is giving us contigent loans of 2.5 per cent. As I said earlier, we need a source of growth and development and the countries which are putting conditions on borrowings, should consider each country individually. I am saying so because Kenya should not be put together with other countries which do not manage their affairs well.With those few remarks, I beg to support the" Motion.</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR.MWAMZANDI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to support this Motion in which the Government is seeking the approval of the House to increase its total idebtedness and also to guarantee borrowing with regard to those institutions mentioned here.     I am also happy that the moratorium period is almost 10 years which is enough time for the Government to move forward. Before I proceed, I know developing countries, like developed countries, cannot forge ahead without assistance. I know for certain that developing countries depend entirely on financial assistance from the developed countries.      Recently, there has been a trend in developed countries that is not favourable to us at all. You will agree with me, Sir, that with the on going campaigns for multi-party system of Government in the African Continent, the developed countries which loan the developing countries, have proved to be very unfair with regard to the way they treat the developing countries. The fact that we seek assistance from them either financially or otherwise, it would be very unfair for them to impose conditions on developing countries.We should be given these loans without any strings attached. The Super Power countries have said that they want multi-party system of governments in Africa. Some of us are not ready for multi-party system of Government. We have said that we shall run our country this way and they are insisting that if we do not do as they want, then they will do this and that. All this is due to the fact that they are assisting us financially. This is a very unfair method. We need friends to assist us but they should not go to the extent of running ones household. For example, it would be very unfair for anyone to tell me I want your life to dress this way. If she does not, I an not going to help you."      Therefore, developed countries should know Africa is running its affairs the African way and not their ways. We run our affairs in our own way. Therefore, we should be given loans and other forms of assistance without strings attached. I would be the first person to refuse any assistance if I am forced to accept an ideology which is against my conscience. The Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance should see to it that the loans we are given are given freely bearing in mind that "we are friends and there should be no strings attached all together.        We have been receiving a lot of assistance from developed countries and some of them have been kind enough to write off our debts. We should not always expect debts to be written off. We are lucky because our President was able to persuade some of the donors to write off some of these debts. We should be carefull in the utilization of this money. We should not always expect to have our debts written off.      I must thank the countries which were kind enough to write off our debts last year. That was a good thing and we are verygrateful to then The House is being asked to uplift the. ceiling or the borrowing power in order to finance our corporations. I agree that corporations should be financed. My question is: Are these corporations making profits? Are they giving good returns? We have been told the East African Cement Company Limited is a Government corporation. Sir, you can hardly tell that this firm is a Government corporation because even their vehicles do not bear the blue number plates.Those who are running this firm should be made to understand that this is a Government corporation. Most of the corporations we have today are run almost like private companies. That is why I wanted the Assistant Minister to make it clear whether this firm is a Government corporation or not. In fact, some of the managing directors of these corporations have become big headed.I know for certain that the Kenya Posts and Telecommunication. Corporation is doing a lot for this country and, in fact, we should give it an okay to acquire more money so that." it can instal Subscriber Trunk Dialling services throughout the Republic.We have also been asked to guarantee loans for Tana and Athi River Development Authority. That is all right. What we should ask ourselves is : Are they doing good work like the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation? We must be told whether they are profit making or not. I remember the President said in Mombasa sometimes back that if you see a corporation doing well, there must be a European or an Asian manning it. We should improve ourselves and perform well like other people elsewhere.We have also been told that we are being asked to approve this ceiling so that the National Bank can have finances to loan thepublic. What is surprising is that Members of Parliament get very little loans that cannot buy a good car. We normally go for serviceable We hides which are obviously not new. Gars have become very expensive and yet we get loans of up to Kshs. 300,000/= which cannot buy a good car. All hon. Members of Parliament should not be expected to afford Mercedes Benz cars on their own.Sometime back, it was resolved that Members of Parliament would be given stir, authority to buy duty free cars, so that they could have easy means of transport during their tenure of office. How many Members of Parliament cannot travel to the interior of their constituencies because their cars are broken down? We should be given authority to import cars duty free. You will see here that interest paid to those</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. While listening to my hon. coleague here, I heard him give an impression that there was a time when the Government had agreed to waive customs duty on cars imported by hon. Members.

If there is a breakdown in the Treasury, I am not to blame.</Newspeech>       <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL HERITAGE (Mr. Lalampaa): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. That was quite a categorical statement made by hon. Mwamzandi. Could he now substantiate as to when this authority was given for hon. Members to import cars duty-free? I believe he is misleading the House.</Newspeech>        <Newspeech>Mr. mwamzandi; Sir, I am not misleading the House. It looks as if I am telling stories to my grand-children here. The same hon.

Hon. Members, hon. Mwamzandi is saying that it was a request put to the Government through the Parliamentary Group meeting. Now, whether it succeeded, or not, is something that hon.

Lalampaa wanted to know.</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the suggestion was not taken to the Treasury and, therefore, that is why it was not implemented.

If that is surely what I heard him utter, then he should be asked to withdraw those remarks. There are no grand-children here; some of us are older than him.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Dr. Wameyo): Before I ask the hon.

Members to the fact that if that matter was discussed in the Kanu Parliamentary Group meeting, it should be left alone so as to be raised again when we have another similar meeting.Now, hon. Mwamzandi, if you used the reference "like my grand-children", then that remark is unacceptable and I urge you to withdraw it and proceed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Sir. While I would not like to go back on the ruling you have just made, I think, since our debates here are for public consumption, the record should be kept. straight so that there is no mistake or misunderstanding in the country. The matter was raised by one hon. Member and the decision of the Kanu Parliamentary Group meeting was quite clear, that there would be no exemption of customs duty for hon. Members. I remember very clearly and can even remember the hon. Member who raised the matter. I am saying this so that we do not leave this matter in abeyance.</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>MR.

I am glad the Minister confirms that the matter was raised, only that the matter was rejected. I thank the Minister for that.I was further going to say that when we are being loaned this money to buy vehicles, the interest rates charged are so high for us that we are given a lot of problems, and yet we are given so many years in which to repay those loans.Finally, let me say that if the countries that loan us money deem it fit to write off the loans they have granted us We have cases in my areas where sugar-cane farmers are facing a lot of peoblems. The company that was milling the sugar collapsed and there is a lot of sugar-cane in the fields worth over Ksh.290 million. The fanners do not know where to sell that sugar-cane. I am glad the Government has accepted that no farm will be auctioned because of such loans granted.

I would like to start by expressing my gratitude to all hon. Members who have spoken and, indeed, supported this very important Motion.        Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the fact that the Government has brought this Motion to this House is an indication of our democracy. We know of certain governments, which I do not want to mention, where such a thing is thought of as a very small matter and is done without consulting the representative's of the people. So, the fact that we take trouble to consult hon. Members and give them enough time. and I am sure we have given therm enough time to express their opinions, shows that we have indeed matured in as far as democracy is concerned.      Sir, there is no country in the world today that doe's not borrow. Therefore, hon. Members should hot be? worried by the? mere; fact that we are borrowing. In fact, the richer a country is the more it borrows. The greatest debtor in the world today is the United States of America. So, I would like' to assure hon. Members that the fact that we are borrowing does riot necessarily mean that we are bankrupt; you do not borrow because? you are bankrupt. You borrow because you have the strength to borrow. The weak cannot borrow; only the strong ones borrow.       The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Dr. Wameyo) left the Chair The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Tuva) took the ChairIt is because, we are, credit worthy that we are able to borrow.</Newspeech><Header>QUORUM</Header><Newspeech>MR.

As I was saying before that: interruption, the fact that a country is borrowing does not show any weakness; in fact, it is a sign of a vigorous economy.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Members who have spoken have expressed their fear that we may be borrowing with conditions or with storings attached. I would like to inform them that there is no loan that you are going to get without conditions. Even when you go to a bank to get a loan, there will always be conditions. However, what we try to do is to insure that whatever conditions are attached to a loan do not jeopardise our sovereignty. We shall not accept any loans that jeopardise our sovereignty, nor shall wet accept a loan that will hurt our people. We do make sure that the loans we get are such that we? are able to pay It is because? of our good records in repayment of loans that we have had hot difficulties in getting others.     Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those generous countries arid institutions that have? been helping us over the years with loans and grants. I would like to mention, countries like Germany, France, the rest be the European Economic Commission countries arid the Nordic countries. We are very grateful those countries for the assistance they have given us in the past. But we must also realise that the loans and grants we gelt must be repaid. I would like! to tell this House, and the public at large, that in the final analysis our Economy and livelihood depends not on loans or grants but on us. The call that we should be? preaching to our people is that of hard work.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we must also realise that we are not going to get any loans at particular concessionary rate's, as we are getting now, unless we can show that we are living in a country that is peaceful. Here,I would like to caution hon. Members of this House and other leders that what we say is taken very seriously. So, we should also be very careful in whatever we utter.

Nyagah, M.P. to be a Member of the Appeals Tribunal.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva): That is your point of order?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not know who appointed these Members. I do not know who selected them without the approval of this House. I do not know whether this Motion will just be bulldozed through the House like the other one or not; we have not given anyone the powers to select these Members.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva): This is the work of the Sessional Committee and it has been properly done.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: But Sessional Committee should seek the approval of this House to select Members to the Management Committee. How are we going to appoint them when they have already been appointed?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva): You are here to decide on that; If you want you can oppose the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Seah) : Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am moving this Motion on " i "behalf of the Leader of Government Business. This Motion is being moved in accordance with the relevant Act, which is the Parliamentary Pensions Act, Cap. 196 of the Laws of Kenya, which hon. Members can make use of. If I may jus refresh the memories of the hon. Members, let me say that this Act came into force on 31st May, 1983, and took effect on 1st July, 19o4. The Parliamentary Pensions Scheme is an obligatory scheme for all surviving Members of Parliament, excluding the Attorney-General. A Member who has served as a Member of Parliament on and after 1st June 1963, may purchase his previous service up to the  1st July, 1984 As part of the conditions, a Member is entitled to a pension when:-f)	he ceases to be a Member of Parliament;g)	his aggregate period of reckonable service is not less than two terms; andh)	he has attained the age of 50 years.A Member of Parliament who ceases to be a Member but does no qualify for pension may apply for a refund of his contributions plus interest accrued thereon. If a Member retires before the end of 50 years, for reasons of ill health, he can be granted a retirement pension or refund of contribution whichever is applicable, subject the provisions of the Act. If a Member passes away before he becomes eligible for pension his family can claim death gratuity. Upon the death of a pensioner the family gets a Widows' pension plus Children's pension subject to the provisions of this Act.The Act is administered by a Management Committee comprising of the Speaker as the Chairman; the Attorney-General; three Members of the National Assembly to be appointed by the National Assembly, hence the objective of this Motion today.Other members include the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury; the Clerk of the National Assembly who will be Secretary of that Committee; the Accounts Controller in the Treasury. Further, a person agrieved by a decision made by this Committee can appeal to the Appeals Tribunal which is composed of the following persons:-(a) The Chief Justice as Chairman;(b) The Controller and Auditor-General, and;(c) A Member to be appointed by the National Assembly.That is why, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have Section (b) of this Motion this afternoon. These names have been selected by the Sessional Committee which is the appropriate Committee to make such proposals and it is upon this House to appoint these Members, to the Management Committee as provided for in this particular Act.This is, therefore, a very important Committee and it is important that the deliberations of the Committee are made. It is the representatives of the National. Assembly at the moment whoWe seek to appoint to that Committee and I therefore urge this House to pass this Motion. Thank you.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION (Mr. Munyi) : Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as my good friend has just explained, this is a straightforward Motion. I would like to remind hon. Members that we have been looking for a pensions scheme of this nature. As has been explained this idea was mooted back in 1933. It was given the final approval in 1984. The only point that I would like to raise here is that there are some former Members of Parliament who do not understand</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On appoint of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.

Therefore, you have every right of charing this very important sitting which is no* discussing this natter. You were proposed by the Sessional Committee and it is just a coincidence that you happen to be in the Chair when this matter is being discussed. This is a very straightforward matter and I would like to thank the Leader of Government Business, the Sessional Committee and all those who played part in proposing the names that we are now discussing. These two committees as mentioned in the Motion axe of great help to the Members of this House.The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Tuva) left the ChairThe Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Muxeithi) took the ChairMR.

Members of this House to enjoy these facilities.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.I would now like to thank the Chair for following democracy because we notice that hon. Tuva has now left the Chair.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION (Mr. Kamwithi) Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Six, that was not a point of order I was saying that we are very happy to pass this very important Motion and I am sure it is going to be implemented straightaway. I would like to say that I have no quarrel with the inclusion of the hon. Members who have been proposed in this Motion, in the committees including hon. Tuva who has been in the Chair.Therefore, Sir, with those few remarks, I beg to second this Motionvery strongly.</Newspeech>(Question proposed)<Newspeech>MR.WASIKE-NDOMBI:Ahsante sana k Bw Naibu-Spika- wa-Mucla- kvakunipatia hii ilinafasa hii ili niunge Hoja hii mkono.

MISOI asked the Minister for Co-operative Development what has delayed the sub-division of the Kiambaa Farm owned by the Kiambaa Farmers Co-operative Society of P.O. Box 943, Eldoret.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CO-OPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Ejore): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The delay in the sub-division of the Kiambaa Farm which is owned by the Kiambaa Farmers Co-operative Society has been due to disputes by afew members who claim that new members have been recruited into their societywithout their consent or through dubious means.Mr. Speaker, Sir, since 1980, the District Do-operative Officer has been holding meetings with the members with a view to resolving this problem. On 24th June, 1983, the District Commissioner, Uasin Gishu, went to the Kiambaa farm to supervise the: balloting of members' individual plots. This exercise went on smoothly without any complaints. Every member took his/her plot as per the ballot. Thereafter, each member paid the survey fee for the confirmation of their agricultural boundaries. After this balloting, a preliminary survey was carried out and each member was allocated his/her plot. Members then settled on the farm. Since 1983, it was all quiet on the farm. Members' curiosity on sub-division was revived in 1989 when the management committee- wanted to have the boundaries, demarcated during the preliminary survey, confirmed officially.A special general meeting of the society was held on 13th May, 1989 and the members resolved to have their farm officially sub-divided. Another follow—up general meeting was held on 5th December, 1989 to confirm the sub-division of the farm and to advise a few disgruntled members to desist from interfering with the surveyor who had by then been engaged by the management committee to sub-divide the farm. The surveyor is now confirming the boundaries. Once the surveyor completes his assignment, this problem will be fully resolved.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this problem has persisted since 1980. Could the Assistant Minister assure this House that the few members who would still we disatisfied would be given a fair hearing?</Newspeech>        <Newspeech> MR. EJORE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the answer to that is in the affirmative. According to our information, our officers were there this morning and the few disatisfied members were given another chance to air their views. But after all the surveyor has done his work and all members have settled on their plots. So, all in all, the Ministry will solve the problem of these few remaining members.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR.MISOI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Assistant Minister forthat positive answer. I would like to add that these farmers are in myconstituency which is why I am representing their interests.</Newspeech>Question No. 419Measures to Contain Rampant Elephants in MasingaMR.

Minister for Public Works whether, in order to connect Tharaka Divisional headquarters with the rest of the division, he' could consider installing culverts across streams traversing the road between Chiakariga and Marimanti.      <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Archbishop Ondiek): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I berg to reply.    Yes, my Ministry will consider installing culverts along the Chiakariga- Marimanti road.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAGWIMA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while appreciating that good reply from the hon. Assistant Ministe*r, I would like him to know that the? Meru District Development Committee1 has already put that road as priority, without that road, the divisional headquarters is cut off from the rest of the areas. What I am asking here is not the obvious question about grading the road. In addition to grading the road, and taking into account the fact that the local district development committed has put the road as a priority, can the Assistant Minister assure the House that culverts will be Installed so that the streams do not wash the' road away, thereby cutting the people from their divisional headquarters?</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK: Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech>     <Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Sir, while appreciating the reply from the Minister that his Ministry is going to supply what the hon. Member has asked for, we would like to know when the culverts will be delivered to this place so that the streams do not wash the road away. The problem we have is that the Ministry doe's not provide adequate drainage. Can the Assistant Minister, as a matter of general policy; state exactly when they are? going to install these culverts along this road and also state whether they are going to look into all other areas with the? same problem?</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are going to do this road during this financial year.</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>MR. KAGWIMA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we seek the guidance of the Chair because the Assistant Minister is avoiding to answer the! specific question put to him with regard to exactly when the Ministry will instal culverts along this particular road.</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have just said that we are? going to do the road during this financial year. It is up to the hon. Member to be a little bit patient.</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR. FALANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Bishop is not very serioud with his answer. When he talks about installing culverts along this road during this financial year, we know that the will be, several rain seasons during that period and the rain water may cause the damage the hon. Questioner is fearing. Can he say exactly when the culverts will be installed?</Newspeech>        <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LONADS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Mutiso): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

FALANA asked the Minister of State, Office of the President, how many private Member' Motions passed during the 1st, and 2nd Session's of the Sixth Parliament have been implemented so far. <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT 	(Mr. Onyancha):   Mr. Speaker, Sir,  first of all,  I wish to apologise for misleading the House earlier. I had the answer to this Question.   It was the first Question by Private Notice whose reply I did not have.   So,  I beg hon. members pardon. Having said that, Sir,  I beg to reply. Of the 36 Private Members' Motions passed during the 1st and 2nd Sessions of the Sixth Parliament, 	26 have been fully implemented or are in the' process of implementation. The Motions which have been fully implemented are six, and those which are in the process of being implemented are 20.   Motions that have not been implemented for technical or financial resons are 10.   Out of the 10 Motions not implemented,  four were due to technical reasons and six due to shortage of finance.   The latter category will be implemented when funds become available. 	Mr.  Speaker, Sir,  details of the sttus of implementation of each Motion are attached to an appendix which I have, and which I will lay on the Table for any hon. Member to examine.   The answer to this Question is very wide.   In fact, I have almost a booklet on it, and that is why I am requesting hon. Members to feel free to look at the appendix I have mentioned.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA:   Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for that good answer, can he tell the House which are the six Motions that have already been implemented?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA:   Mr. Speaker, Sir,  it is going to be very difficult for me to go through those six Motions because, as I said, I have a booklet containing the information.   However, I can give an example of one or two only.   For example,  a Motion asking  for an upward review of cotton prices in favour of tenant farmers, tabled by hon.  Galgallo,  was adopted. on 26h April, 1989,  and the Government has acted effectively on it. Another example is  a Motion tabled by hon.  Boy Juma Boy, reading,  in part,  as  follows:-“…. Serikali kuthibitisha matangazo ya sale katika Maduka ya nguo na vifaa vya nyumbani". This Motion was adopted on 15th November, 1989,  and the Government has acted effectively on it. 	There are other Motions that the Government has Implemented and,  as  I  said,   I will  lay  all  this  information on the Table for hon.  Members  to examine.  Mr.  Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the reply  from the  Assistant Minister,  could he tell the House what problems he  is talking about?   The hon. Member is asking a very simple  question. The  Assistant Minister  should tell the  House when these Motions were  moved,  passed and which Ministries are implementing them now. I  say this because Ministries have been taking Private Members  Motions  for granted.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  ONYANCHA:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I have  already mentionedtwo Motions that have  been fully implemented.	The  third Motionwas  about Measures to  Compensate :	Reduced Purchasing Power ofWorkers."	This Motion was moved by hon. Kiliku and it was adoptedon 4th April,	1990.	The  other Motion was moved by hon.  Kipkorirregarding the provision of adequate  water to Mokero Location ofKerio Valley.	The Motion was passed  on 26th July,	1989. The  sixthone was  a Motion brought by hon.  Galgallo  for enhancing agricultural production in marginal areas;  it was passed  on 20th July,	1988.	Those  are  the  six Motion I had mentioned in my main reply.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  FALANA:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we Back-benchers reallyvalue Private Members  Motions.	When these  Motions have been passedby this House,  we  expect nothing but immediate implementation of these Motion by the  Government. 	From what  the hon.  Assistant Minister has  said,  it appears that about  four to six 	Motions  are in danger of being totally dropped.   What criteria does  the Ministry use to drop	Motions?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  ONYANCHA:	Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  none  of the Motions passedhave been dropped.	I  said that  the limitation could  only possiblybe technical  or lack of funds. That  is to  say,  when the  technicalitiesare later removed  or finances are made  available as we go along, these Motions will be  implemented.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant minister indicate what progress has been made by the relevant Ministries to implement those  Motions?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA:  Mt. Speaker, Sir, as I have already said a total of 36 Motions have been passed in this House during the 1st and 2nd Sessions of the Sixth Parliament. My Ministry is satisfied that six out of those 36 Motions have been executed or implemented satisfactorily.  Also 20 of those Motions have been partially implemented; they are in the process of being implemented.  The answer to this Question is very detailed and it is in the form of a booklet.   I do not think I have the time to read   whatever is contained in this booklet.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE:   On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  my question is very clear.  Could the Assistant Minister indicate the progress of implementation of those Motions by the rele vant Ministries?  Could he, for example, tell us whether the Motion by hon. Kipkorir, for provision of water to one of his locations What has the Ministry of Water Development done so far to provide water to that Location?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA:  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think I will need the guidance of the chair regarding this matter.

MANG'OLI:  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister should give this House a satisfactory reply.  If he is not ready now he should go back and prepare a better answer. This is because the officers in his Ministry have prepared a schedule with   the intention of confusing this House. I  say this because the Assistant Minister himself is not able to follow the information which has  been given to him by his  officers. 	Could he tell us the  technicalities he  is talking about?

KIILU asked the Minister far Tourism and Wildlife what action the Ministry is taking against the rampant elephants at Kyangosi  in Masinga Division. <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR DAMS,  HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING : (Mr. Mutiso):  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on behalf of the Minister for Tourism and Wildlife,  I beg to give the following reply. The Ministry  of Tourism and Wildlife,  through the Kenya Wildlife Service,  intends to fence off the Mwea National  Reserve from Which the rampanging elephants come. The Kenya Wildlife Service is actively looking for funds for this purpose.   In the meantime,  Game Rangers have been a deployed at Kyangusi and Ngetani villages in Masinga Division to  scare away elephants and. herd them back into Mwea National Reserve.</Newspeech>	-<Newspeech>MR. KIILU: Mr. Speaker,  Sir, arising from the answer given by the Assistant Minister,  could he tell this House when the Ministry mill aspects to get  the funds to fence off this area? 	I am asking this because the people   in this area are   being greatly disturbed by these elephants.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  the moment, the Ministry is looking for ways and means  of getting funds to fence off this area. The hon.  Member would agree with me  that this is  not a simple exercise and that it requires the  Government  a lot of money. As I have  said,  the Ministry is  seriously looking for this money and as soon as the money is  available  this work will begin.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAMUYU: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  While  the Ministry  is looking for   funds to  fence of this area,  could they allow the people in Masinga to use whatever 	 means they have to protect  themselves from these rampant elephants?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that certainly cannot be allowed to happen because the Ministry has enough game rangers who are capable  of scaring away  these animals.   The hon. Member knows pretty well  that it is part of his responsibility as a leader to protect wildlife in this country. Therefore,  we cannot  allow anybody to kill  our wild animals but,  as I have indicated above, we are going to use the means available to us to prevent these elephants from disturbing wananchi  in Masing Division.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUI: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  you will  agree with me here that  we have a really  serious problem in Masinga. We know that our wildlife is protected by law in this country  and therefore,  wananchi  are  not  supposed to kill wild animals even when these  animals kill their livestock. Worse  still, is that when wild animals kill our livestock,  we are not compensated by the Ministry.  Could the  Assistant  Minister tell this House what wananchi in Masinga are  supposed to do when these elephants continue to destroy their crops?   Could he be  specific  enough and tell this Rouse when the Ministry  is going to fence off this area to keep off these rampanging beasts?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the hon. Member knows very well that where we have wild animals living close to wananchi,  there are bound to be this kind of problem. 	All that the Ministry and the  Government is doing is   to appeal to the people in such areas to report cases of animal intrusion into their areas. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>DR. MISOI:  On a point of order, Mr. Speaker,  Sir.  Elephants as we know them are friendly animals and we know that they are particularly	friendly to tourists. Therefore, it  would be adviseable to the Masingapeople  to befriend these  animals so that  they  do not become hostile</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  SPEAKIR:  Yes,  it would be adviseable for them  to do so, but that certainly is not  a point of order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIILU:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these 32 animals have gone to the extent of invading people in their homes. There  are  even cases where the  animals have destroyed the  stores where people keep maize or millet in search for something to eat.   I do not think the answer given here is proper because we have only two game rangers in Masinga and I do not know how they are going to control these animals,  particularly When we know that  they live very far from Kyangusi. 	Could the  Assistant  Minister tell this Rouse what  specific arrangements the Ministry is making to protect the people in this area from  these animals?   Our children can no longer walk freely to  school  in the morning or evening because of these animals.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, could the hon. Member tell this Rouse how many times he has reported the presence of these animals and  the Government has been defeated in herding  them back to their own national  reserve?   I am quite  sure  that there are  enough rangers Who can</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIILU:  On a point of order, Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is the Assistant Minister really m in order to give this House the impression that we have not been reporting to the Ministry cases of these animals destrying crops and other property in this area?   The truth of the matter is that we have reported these cases several times and not  action has every been taken to protect our people. 	Is he really in order to give  such  a wrong impression?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER:  I am tempted to believe what the hon. Assistant Minister is  saying because he is very much conversant with that area, but he can probably reply to that point of order.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR. KIILU:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  I do not intend to, disputeyour ruling,  I doubt whether the hon. Assistant Minister is conversant with this problem in Masinga Division.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  tae hon. Member does not indicate that  there have been repeated reports concerning the  intrusion of these animals in Masinga and the Government's failure to cope with the   problem. Therefore, I am saying that  as  soon the presence of these animals in Macji3ga Division   is noted</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  KAMUYU:  On a point of order,  Mt.  Speaker,  Sir.   The  Assistant Minister is obviously misleading  this House in that the Question clearlyDoes indicate that there 	been rampant invasion of elephants in Masinga Division.   These animals can cause,  not only destruction of am crops and other property,  but also lives of people. Therefore,  since the Questioner is quite clear in What he  says, namely that these elephants have been rampant in this area,  the  Assistant Minister should tell  this House what urgent measure  the Ministry is intending to  take to keep off these animals.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO:	Mr. Speaker,   Sir,  what  I  am saying is that_the. Question does not  indicate  that the Government has failed to  attend  to  those reports. The  frequency of  the  animals visits  and the fact that no reports have been made are one  thing,  and where the  report has  been made  and the  Government has not been effective  is another thing. Therefore,  I  am saying that the Government has now been alerted that these  animals  have  been visiting there  and, perhaps, disturbing wananchi. If  there are few game rangers  in the  area,  the Government will make  sure that more  rangers  are  sent  to the  area and  hand these  animals back to  their areas.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.KIILU: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  do not think the  Assistant Minister is  serious  in his reply simply because people  do not  even sleep in this area.	This  area is near the  game reserve. People  have  been reporting to the  two game rangers in thearea, but they are not  sufficient.,  They also take time to reach the  area. For instance,  people  in the  area now do not have  food. What  is the  Government going to  do to assist those people  so that they can feel that they are  free  and protected by the Government?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MUTISO: 	Mr.  Speaker, Sir,  first  of  all,  I would like to  tell the  hon. Member that I am taking this matter very seriously and  I  am not  joking at  all. I mean what  Lam  saying. Therefore, I would like  to  assure  the House  that if there has been slack in taking prompt action in ensuring that these animals are handed back to their areas,  the Government has now been notified and an adequate  action Will be  taken.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

KONES:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  would  probably be good  for me  togive  background  information on  this  matter.	Four  factories were  involved  in thissuspension:  two  in Murang'a,  one  in Kirinyaga and one  in Kericho. A  total  of 25contractors,  and not  just  one,  were  involved  in  this  contract. The  probecommittee  felt  that  there  was  a bit of over-pricing of the  contract and,  now that the  Government  has  read  the  committee's  report,  it  is going to  make-recommendations on whether  the  original  contractors  or  new  ones  will  carry  on  the  contract. So, I  cannot  confirm  to  the  House whether  the  original  contracts  will  take  the  contract.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Regardless  of whether  they  are  going  to  get  their  contract  backor not,  they  will,  like  any  other contractors,  have  to  tender  afresh.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

A.H.O.  MOMANYI: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  most of the  teachers who qualified  in 	1981  have  been  waiting for  the  P.1  teaching certificates very eagerly because  they want promotion. 	Some  of the  teachers  travel all  the way from  upcountry  to  Nairobi  to get clearance. 	Could  the  Assistant Minister order the  Kenya National  Examinations  Council  to release  these  certificates  to the teachers  who  qualified more  than eight years  ago.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  AMAYO: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  perhaps  it would be  important at this stage  to give  a brief background as to why the certificate  in question,  along with  others,  has  not been released. The  teachers  concerned sat their  teacher examination  in 1981,  a  time  when there  was  a general  cause  for all  teachers  in teacher  training colleges  and their actual grading into P.1,  P.2 and P.3  levels depended on  their performance  in  the  examination and not on their academic qualifications.	This  went  on until	1981  when  His  Excellency  the  President gavea directive that they-be graded according to their academic qualifications.	So, the simple requirement here is the teachers concerned fill  the  appropriate application  forms,  which they can obtain from the District Education Officer's office  or  the  Kenya National  Examinations Council.

I rise  again in connection with a report appearing on page  of  today's  issue  of  the 	Daily Nation entitled "V-P tablet VAT Proposals". This report  implies  that  the  Government has  imposed VAT  on  essential commodities;  the report is attributed to  the Parliamentary Order Paper. The  erroneous report refers to the  following commodities: salt,  sugar,  jaggery,  wheat and nestle flour,  semi  and wholly milled rice,  broken rice,  maize  and maize , seeds,  juram, w	heat;  other wheat,  milk and cream, all of which are said to  be  deleted from the schedule  of  Exempted goods - that is the  fifth schedule  of the  Bill to make	them taxable  at 18 per  cent.	The  correct  position is  that these  goods have  now been zero rated by inclusion in the  seventh  schedule. of the .Bill.	Thismeans  that  they are  not  only exempted from VAT, but  in additionanything paid  on raw Materials used to make  such commodities	 will now be recoverable. Consequently,  the  essential commodities  are better  off under  the  zero rated  schedule  than they were under the exemption schedule.

Malebe,  which went:-"THAT,  in view of the  increasing demand for Kenyan industrial minerals  and gemstones  both locally and overseas,  and in order  to  increase foreign exchange  earnings  to balance  our  payments, this House  urges  the  Government to  set  a mineral advisory centre  to  assist  indigenous mineral prospectors in financing 	s their activities and marketing their  products". I would like  to  let  the  House  know that  the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources was not  informed about  this Motion and that 	 even up to this moment we have  not received  any communication aboutit. The reason may be  because  notice  for  this Motion was  given  onTuesday,	24th July,	1990 and the Motion was  put  on Order Paper  ofthe  following day 	the evening of the  same  day before there was time  for  communication 	r 	the Ministry. 	I, therefore,  would like to  say that  I would be  happy to have  this Motion raised again and we reply to  it  provided vie  are  given adequate  notice. 	Thank you,  Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR fl REGIONAL DEVELOPEENT (Mr.  Okwara):  On a point  of  order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir. On 19th July, 1990, I  Promised to bring this  House  supplementary details relating to Question No. 363,  which had been raised by the Member for Rarieda, hon. jalang’o. The Ministry  carried  out  the necessary investigations concerning the  circumstances relating to  The issue raised by the hon. member. The result of the investigations are as follows: The  fish Banda office  building,  which houses Luanda- Kotieno Fisheries Cooperative  Society,  was built  in	1937,  with assistance,  both in cash and materils,  from SVR Holdings Limited. Subsequently,  it was agreed, through a written agreement, that the  two-roomed building,  which is  adjacent  to  the  Fisheries Department 3uilding,  be  shared between the management  of Luanda-Kotieno Fisheries Co-operative  Society and the  SVR. Holdings Limited. I  now table  here a copy of the  agreement with relevant  correspondence for the information of  the  House. (Hon.  Okwara laid the  documents  on the Table  of the House) Up to  now Luanda-Kotieno Fisheries Cooperative  Society has not honoured its  obligation to  this  agreement  in availing; without failure, one room to  accommodate  SVR Holdings Limited staff	to  facilitate  themto  carry out  their work at  the  landing site. The  details  of the  materials  already provided by SVR. Holdings Limited for  completion  of the  Fish Banda office  building are  as follows:  Shs.35,000/- applied towards  purchase  of materials and Shs.10,000/- for  labour and	other incidentals. Sometime  in mid June,1988,  a vehicle belonging to SVR holdings Limited rammed into  the  building and caused some minor damages to the roof,  calculated to  cost roughly Shs.5,000/-. This was  a minor  accident  and on 12th July, 1983  the  SVR Holdings Limited dispatched the required materials to repair  the  said damage  as follows:- four  pieces  of timber  and four pieces  of iron sheets. The  materials were received and  signed for by a Mr.  Eddy Mboya,  who  is  the  site manager of the Luanda-Kotieno Fisheries Co-operative  Society. It  is understood that the  materials  later  disappeared under mysterious circumstances.           Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just this issue was brought to the  attention of this House  on 18th July, 1988, SVR holdings Limited again dispatched additional materials  similar to the previous  ones  directly to  the  site in order to replace the materials stolen previously.	The same was signed for by the  site manager,  the  sane Mr.  Eddy Mboya.	In addition to this the company sent Shs.1,500/- for labour and other incidentals  in order to  speed up the repair work. We  hope  that  the repairs have  now been carried  out  to  the satisfaction of the co-operative society.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  from the  foregoing it is now clear that the  management  of the Luanda-Kotieno Co-operative  Society gave  the hon.  Member  for Rarieda inaccurate  information,  which resulted in this House  being misled. Judging from the  information I have given to  this House,  SVR Holdings Limited is actually doing a lot to  assist  this  society for mutual benefits. I would  like  call  on the management  of  the Luanda-Kotieno Fisheries Co-operative  Society to  honour  the  agreement they reached with this company and to  stop fabricating things which are  likely to harm their business  operations in the  community. I  also  call upon the  hon.  Member for the  area to assist  the  management  of the  society to bring harmony in that  area. Thank you,  Sir.  On   a  point  of  order, Mr. Speaker,	Sir.	During  the   sitting  of  the  House   of 11th   July, this   year,	the   hon.	 Ibrahim Mohammed, Member for wajir west, referred  to   an  outbreak  of  a  mysterious  cattle  disease  in wajir District and,Especially, the fact that a lot of cattle belonging to a Mr. Maalim had died.  The 	answer I gave   at   that   tire  did  not   appear  to   be   very   satisfactory  and  I promised the House that I  was going to instruct   the   Director  of  Veterinary Services   to   carry  cut   further  investigations into   this  disease.	We have done   that   and   the  position is as   follows.Sir, since   October, to November, 1989,	20   out of   200 heri of  cattle belonging  to Mr. Ali Maalim had died. Mr. Maalim reported  the  matter  to  our office   in March  this  year   and  his livestock,	Pius   those   of the entire   area were vaccinated against contagious bovine  pleuropneumonia and rinderpest.  However, on 20th may, 1990, Mr. Mealim reported that his cattle were still dying. Our staff visited his farm and collected blood and serum samples for analysis. The   samples were   tested   at   the kabete laboratory   and   they   Showed negative   results. it  was  suspected to   be   common diseases,	such as  contagious bovine plauropneumonia, rinderpest, trioanosomioqis   and   tick-bome malalies. For these reasons, I mentioned the last time that it was likely to be disease. However, after the issue was raised in the House on 11th july, further samples were collected from the farm on 14th july, 1990 with the same result. Our staff also treated to animals that were sick and they recoverd. On  21st  July, 1990 another visit was made to the farm and our staff carried out a post-moterm on the sick animals.	They found	them  to   have   pneumonic lungs. It is most probable that Mr. Maalim has been losing his animals because of pneumonia. This   is   a  treatable 	disease   and  we have supplied the said   farmer with  enough drugs, like tetracycline to treat his animals when they   fall   sick. If, inspite   of  this, the   disease   continues  to   plague Mr. Maalim’s animals, the Ministry will despatch  a specialist laboratory teem to   carry   out   further  investigations.  Sir, it is noteworthy to observe that the whole locality the area around Malka Gufu Dam only Mr. Maalim’s cattle had been reported to have died of that disease. We, therefore, suspect that the disease is not contagious. Our staff will continue the whole locality and Mr. Maalim’s farm in particular, for any evertuality.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT(Mr. Onyarasha): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. On 17th July, this year, I gave a reply to question No. 339 raised by Hon. Makharu, the Member for Kneduyi, with regard to hun. Member being members of the district executive committees and district tender Boards. According to the standing policy on the district focus for rural Development strategy, all hon. members are automatic members of the district development committee in their areas. As hon. Members are, no doubt,aware, the district development committee is the main body charged with the responsibility of implementing the decentralized rural development strategy.Sir, when I was answering this question here, information was lacking and I promised to bring it to the house and I wish to read the following. The main functions of the district development committees are as follows:-1) To review on-going projects to ensure that current projects are rapidly implemented and that completed projects and existing infrastructure are effectively operated and maintained.2) To consider new project by the divisional development committees.3) To establish priorities for future projects in the five-year district development plan.4) To encourse the districts annual csubmission of projects proposal to the Ministries in the annual to the district development place.5) To review and enforce all projects proposals of that committees, parastatal bodies, regional development automatics and non- governmental organizations operating in the districts. It would   therefore  clearly appear that the district development committees are responsible for each district's develomental Planning andCo-ordination, projects implementation, management of financial and other resources, overseeing the procurament of goods and services, management of personael and the provision of public information	with the district commissioners as chief exective officers.I pointed cut in the earlier reply to the question that the technical support for the activities is provided by the district exective committees, which makes operational decisions within the guiding directives of the DDC. The DDC’s prepare briefing notes on all proposals and reports to be submitted to the DDCs for operationally sub-committees of the DDCs. In order to maintain the effectiveness of the DDCs, it is the government’s wish that the committees remain small and as technical as possible in their onerous tasks of promoting interministerial co-ordination of development activities in the districts. For these reasons, their membership is restricted to development heads of the various ministries reprasents in the districts and also local authorities and perestatal bodies. Hon. members are therefore not members of DDCs since they are members of the more important body, namely, the DDC.Concerning the hon. members being members of the district tender boards, I wish to reiterate that by a circular letter datel 20th March, 1990, the government directed that hon. member of parliament be elected in such by other hon. members to this districttender board. Accordingly, all district commissioners, who are also chairman of the DDCs, and to which the circul;ar was addressed, advised hon. members in the districts to submit the name of one hon. members so that his name could be included in the notice of the DDC meetings. I have details of the names of hon. members from any district are of the opnion that they have not and elected one of their own to be in these committees, we would like to be informed. I would like now, in conclusion, to read out the rares of those hon. members whose we have received in headquarters.  Nyeri 			                   -                  Hon.

While dealing with a question by private notice raised by hon. Magwise two weeks ago, I gave the undertaking to inform the house further regarding the late when konii settlement scheme was declare a land adjudication and the amount of work done since that time.I now have the honour to inform the house as follows:-Kondi was declared an adjustication section, as I said as on 19th March, 1955. From the time the adjustication work in 1975 up to when it stopped in 1975, a had been adjustication. A total of 1,500 parcels are adjudication in section when the work is completed.Our adjudication staff are made to return to the site and complete the remaining work within six months tire once the exising boundary dispute is resolved. The Meru district development commity in which the hon. member , resolved be refer the                  The boundary disputr to the yeru council of Elders, namely, for the necessary contribution. The Njuri is yet to come up with a lasting solution to the said dispute.The boundary despute is between the tharaka people and their neighbours in Tigania and Irenti. The hon. member should co-operative with the local administration to assist Nakuri come up with a quick and lasting solution to this dispute before the adjudication can commence so that the land owners title deeds can be processed.The hon. Member should also advise his constituents to co-operate withNjuri Njeke in order to hasten the process by the elders. Sir, I will now read from a copy of the declaration statement by the land adjudication officier, district, as follows:-  This Paragraph Not Readable  I hope that with this information,  the hon. member and the  people of Meru, will be satisfied and solve  the existing dispute so that the remaining work can be completed. Thank you,</Newspeech> <Newspeech>Mr. A.K. KINYSNJU: On a point of order, Mr. speaker, Sir. Then the Assistant Minister, Office of the president; Mr. Onyancha, was reading names of representatives from each district to the Tender Board,  he  read names that have been submitted and the districts which have not submitted names of their representatives. I did not hear him mention Kiambu District. Was that an omission?</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. SPEAKER: I am sure you are going to submit the nameof your representative and there should be no difficult at all.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr.  KAGNIMA: Mr. Speaker, Sir,  my	point of order is on the information which hon. Kutiso has given this House.	First ofall,  I woilld like to indicate that I am very co-operative withthe provincial administration. Therefore,  there is  no problem between the provincial administration. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  people of Tharaka have  been very co-operative with  the  council  of elders 	- Njuri  Njeke. 	The other thing is  that  I  still stand  on what  I  said here  last week  that Nkonthi  adjudication section was declared an adjudication  section  in 1964. Since  it  is  becoming more and more difficult  to  convince  the Assistant Minister and since he  still continues to rely on  the  same  personcwho gave him the reply  he gave the House  last week, I  am  ready  to  table  this  Question  in form of a Motion  so  that I  can provide the  House with more  details  including the names  of people whose parcels  of land were adjudiated  in 1964 and  1965.	I  am  dissatified with his  contentionthat  this  area was  declared  an  adjudication section  in	1975  and not	1964.I  would  also  further  request  that he  checks  and  brings more information  to  the  House. 	He  could  even  send  an  independent  senior officer  there. This  is  because  the  same  person who gave him  that  information will not consent that he  mislead  him which  made  mislead  the  House. So,  to  repeat,  it  is  not correct  to  say  that  that area was  declared  an adjudication area in 	1975.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MUTISO:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  do  not  want  to  engage  on  an heated argument with  the hon.  Member.	I  have here  with me  a photocopy  of  the  declarationstatement  by  the  adjudication officer  in Meru which  is  dated 19th March, 1975.So,  I  do  not know what  other  information  the hon.  Member wants  me  to  provide to  the  House. This  document  is  very  clear  for  it  is  dated  and  signed. If the  hon.  Member  has  other  information which  is  contrary  to  what we  have  then we  should provide  it to  the House  so that we  can  investigate and find out where  the declaration was made  in 1964  or 1975. I  am  not  in  any  way  imputing that  he  is  not co-operating with the administration there;  I am only appealing to  him  and  the  other  leaders  in  that  area  to help  the council  of elders  to solve  the problem between  the two groups concerned  so that our officers  can return  there  and  complete  the work which  is now pending.   Our officers  cannot return  there without  being  told  by  the  Njuri  Njeke  that  the  problem has  been solved. This  is  because  if  they  went  there  they might  even be  speared. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  KAGWIMA: 	Mr.  Speaker, Sir, although I agree with what the Assistant Minister has  said,  there  is  this problem of the difference between the  two years,  that  is,	1964 and  1975.	That  is  a difference  of about	12 years.If we  accepted the fact that the area was declared an adjudication area in1964  until  it was  stopped  in 1978,  then by now the officials would have finishedtheir work.	But  if we are  talking of 1975 then the difference would be  threeyears which is excusable.	But  because of this  difference  of these two years,1964  and 	1975,  I  am requesting  the House  not  to  close  this  matter until  the issue has been clearly  sorted out. I  am ready  when  the House  resumes  after recess  to produce  the facts and bring people  here outside  this House  to  prove that  their  parcels  of  land were  adjudicated  in 1964 1965, 1966  and 1977 and  they were given plot numbers.	So,  I  would  like to request  that he sends  an  independent officer there  so  that he  can be given a different view</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  SPEAKER: Order! Order,  hon.  Kagwima!	I  am  sure  that  theAssistant Minister  has  taken note of your views,  but  if you  are still  nothappy  with  that you can see me.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  A.I.  MOHAMMED:	On  a point  of order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.	I  riseon  a point  of order  in  connection with  the  reply  given  to  my  Question  byhon.  Chesire,  the  Assistant Minister  for  Livestock  Development.	First  andforemost  I  must  thank  him  for  his  effective  role  in  saving  the  station.	Althoughthat  is  so,   I  would  like  to  appeal  to  him  to  send  officers  there  to  investigate the  conduct of some  of the  livestock officers  in  that district. This  is  because most  of  them are  just. there  to  incite  the  public  against the Government and to  carry  out  their matatu  business.	They engage in their own person businesses instead of doing their official  duties.	It  is  better  to have  technical  assistant there  instead of having  such malicious veterinary doctors  there. Thank you. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND VATIONAL DEVELOPMENT(Mr. Ogle): 	On  a point of order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir. 	I  think  the  hon.  Member who has  just left  the Floor made a general accusation  that some of the officers are  matatu  drivers  there. In  order  to save the  other good  officers  from embarrassment,  he should name  those particular officers who are inciting the public  against the Government.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  SPEAKER:	Order!	Order!	That was  for  the  information of theAssistant Minister! Hon.  Members,  I  think,  it  is  would  be better  if we could move on to the  Motion for  the  Adjournment of the House because we are running short of  time.</Newspeech><Header>  MOTION FOR  THE ADJOURNMENT </Header><Newspeech>MR.  SPEAKER: 	Will  the  Leader  of Government Business move  that the  House  do  now  adjourn.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  VICE-PRESIDENT  AND MINISTER FOR  FINANCE  (Prof.  Saitoti): Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  beg  to  move  that  this House do now adjourn until Tuesday, 2nd October,  1990.  In  moving  this  Motion,  allow me  first  to  commend  the hon.  Members  for  having  transacted  very  substantial  business since this House was opened.  A  number  of Bills  have  been  debated  and  passed  by  this  House., most  commendable,  the  Finance Bill  which  is  going  to  provide  resources  to this  country.  At  the  same  time,  in  the  Committee  of Supply,  several  Ministerial Votes  have  also been debated and passed. This is important because their passage will  enable  the Government  to  continue  to provide  services  to wananchi. This  is  a  normal  recess  and  we  should use as an opportunity for hon.  Members  to go back to  their  own constituencies,  have time with our people, follow up  the various  development projects which we have debated in this House and  much more  important,   to discuss  with wananchi  issues related  to the  stability and  security of this  country. I  am  prompted  at  this  stage  to  talk  on  thoseissues because  of what we witnessed some few days  back. We witnessed  incidentswhich we did not like because they were calculated at distabilising this nation.  We know,  for  sure,  that all  the wananchi are solidly behind the President,  loyal to  the Government  and  the party. What  I  think  is  important  for us  is  to pass  the message  to  the wananchi,   that  all  of  us  must  stand  united  to  defend  our  Independence. Independence would be meaningless  if we did not have peace and stability. If a country  does  not have peace  and  stability,  it  is not worth being referred to as an  independent country  because  it would  be  impossible  for  it  to provide  services to wananchi,  for  it must go begging because of a lot  of scarcity. Many  people would be starving,  and  then  that opens the way for foreigners to come and feed them. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the remarkable thing about our country is that we hav4 been  able to  feed  our people and,   therefore,  we  can  say  that we are an independent  country. W4  are  independent  because  this  country  is  able  to  feed  itsown people. We do  not go  around  begging  and we do not want to be placed  in  aposition where  this  country  is  going  to  beg. If we are placed in that state ofaffairs,  then Kenyans  will  lose their  dignity  and we do  not want  to  do  that. Sir,  we continue to educate our own people For  instance,   today  we are going  to  have more than 40,000 students in our universities,  and they will be  educated by  the resources  of Kenyans. If we jeopardise the stability of this country,  we will not be able to provide kind of education and we cannot be able to provide  health,  water  or  transport  services. These  are  the  achievements  whichwe must  stand  and defend. We must resolve once again that we must defend our ownchievements. It  is for  hon.  Members  to  discuss  these matters openly with  thewananchi  so that  if there are people who  try to threaten  the stability of this country,  the wananchi  and the security forces will be one and  the same thing in defence of the stability of this nation. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at this stage,  I  cannot forget to really thank His Excellency  the President for the manner in which he has provided stability in this  court,  stability which has  united us and which has made it possible for  thiscountry  to  record  development  in the various  sectors  of our economy.   We must say it quitd clearly for the world to know that in this country we have a President that we  love,  and  that we have a President who cares for our country. If  it  is the question of transportation,  we can all see for ourselves the efforts His Excellency  the President has madd in the provision of Nyayo buses. And we know that  there are many mores plans to bring more buses to Kdnya. If  it  is  thd question of education, we can see how much has been done under the 8-4-4 education system  and  the expansion of our universities. Today we have four universities and several university  colleges. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we could not have' been  able to achieve these developments  if we did not have a very far-sighted President. And  the President  continues to worry about  the  future of our youth. Apart  from  providing  them with  education, he worries  about whether  they get  jobs. This  is  evidenced  by  the  fact that  not too  long  ago  the President did  set up  a committee to  look  into matters  related to  employment  opportunities. We do know  that we have problems of emmployment for the youth but,  even before we start working on it, our President, who is always ahead,  has set up a committed because he wants to see every youth of this country utilise his  own abilityand capability. I  do not  think we could have expected anything better  than  that. Sir,  what  is  important  is  for  us,  as  hon.  Members,  to  complement  the efforts  of His  Excellency  the President. sMore  important,  we should  all times follow His  Excellency  the President's  footsteps. We  should ensure tht we try  as much  as  possible  to  consider  the matters related to other people.  Let  us  be mindful,  as  the President  tells us,  of the welfare of other people. With  those few remarks,  I  beg  to move.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  MINISTER FOR ENERGY	(Mr.  Biwott):	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,	I  arise tosecond this Motion and,  in doing so,  I would like to suggest that perhaps this is  the most  appropriate time for us to break:  the time when thd Kanu Review Committee is  ddaling with  its deliberations.	Hon.  Mdmbers  of Parliament will  be able to meet their constituents and encourage those who havd somd.views to come forward and present thdm to the Committee.   Members of thd public should be assured that this Committee is impartial;  it is theirs and it will ensure that thd views of the people will bd heard without fear or favour so that Kenyans can receive a report that is meaningful and that is rehresentative of their own ideas. 	Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I would like to take this opportunity to thank His Excellency the President and Kanu for seeing it fit to appoint the Kanu ReViw Committde.   I happdn to be privileged to sit in the   Committee, and what I have seen convinces me that it was a well thought idea. Sir,  I cannot overemphasize the point made by the Vice-President and Ministdr for Finance about the security of this state because it is that security that determines the lives of our people and that gives hope to our people;  it ensures our existence in this country.   I would like to pay tribute to His Excellency the President,  the police and other security forces for maintaining peace and stability in this country.   I want to encourage them to continue doing so because security has no price.   Security cannot be maintained by the law enforcement agents alone;  it has to be enforced by Kenyans themselves.   They do that by recognizing the importance of peace and stability. Mr.  Speaker, Sir,  I urgd hon.  Members to preach the word of love and unity when they go hom.   In other words,  they should sing "Nyayo" as loud as possible because that is the only language that guarantees us the peace we want. Hon. Members should also assist wananchi in the process of development.   It is, indeed,  a well known fact that most of the probleMs arise because of poverty. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  indeed a well known fact that  most  of  the  problems  arise  because  of poverty;  many People  are faced with hardships which we  do recognize  and which can only be overcome by  sheer hard work,  proper  organization and better understanding. We  know that  His  Excellency the President  has assisted this  country by  setting um  the  District Development Committees. Hon. Members  should  educate	our people  when they go home  so teat  our people  are  fully aware  of the role  of the D.D.C.s;  the  projects  that  are  being implemented through the D.D.C.s;  the  employment Potential that  exists. They should also  influence the  tenders. I would like at this  juncture  to  thank the  Assistant Minister,  Office  of the President who gave us the  names  of those Members  of Parliament  who  are  supposed to assist the  DistrictTender Boards. With regzard to those  districts which have not giventheir names, I think they  should  find  it necessary to provide  thesenames as  soon as possible  so that wananchi can be  assisted. We need politicians who are  sensitive to the  needs  of wananchi  so as to makesure  that  what  the  officers do  in  the districts  is what benefitswananchi.There is also the  issue  of Jua kali industry.	The hon. members  should take advantage  of the  tine  available  now tointroduce  wananchi  to the  concept  of Jua kali. They should  advisethem as  to where  to  go  for loans  and what  services are available and the jua kali programmes the money which our government has  given to  the  Rural Developmert	 fund. There is also the question of Harambee  where hon. Members might wish to assist wananchi in 	the construction  of classrooms.	They  should  see  to  it  that our people  are  attended by public officers.  I  say this because time and again,  our people have  complainedthat  the  Government  officers  are  not  assisting them.	It  is the dutyof  Government  officers  to  assist members  of the public  otherwise the  offices  they hold will not  be  functioning the way they  are supposed to  function. With those  few remarks,  I beg to  second.</Newspeech>(Question proposed) <Newspeech>Mr.	BOY:  Ahsante  sana,	Bw.

We  are where we are today because	of the  role	ifs  Excellency the President	has played  in preservingpeace  and  stability in this  country.	Peace  is  a prerequisite  forsocial and  economic  development  of any country.	Peace  is man-made andas we  go  on recess  should  become peace  ambassadors.	One veryimportant  thing that  has  kept this country intact is the  Philosophy of reconciliation.	As  we  go  to  our	constituencies we  need to  actas  Peacemakers: we need to be reconciliators. If the  people  in  ourconstituencies  are  united the  total  sun of that unity is the  one  that gives  stability to  this  country.	There  is nothing that  destroyspeace  faster than the People's  failure  to understand  that	it  isthe  action of the  leader We  should learn a lot from the recentriots  that hit  certain. Parts  of this  country. This  should be  viewedas  a tremor and those  in areas  that were most  affected  should	go  andsit  down with their people  and  find  out what was  behind that  tremor. That  is why  I  am saying that  people  should  think about that matter seriously. People  in Machakos  and  other  places  know the  problems that  made  people riot during that  time.  	I would like to take this opportunity to urge hon. Members_ to preach peace _ ____and reconciliation when they go home for recess.	As I said,  Sir, peace isman-made and the reasons for  saying  this is that  a lot of problems come in a country as a result  of people trying  to  "finish" others.   You may find one group fighting another group and the result of  this is just chaos. Mr. Speaker,  Sir, we must be honest in what we say a both in this House and outside it. At  times,  we have heard certain people talking quite a lot,  but  if you follow up these people closely, you would find that they are just pretenders.   You may hear somebody issuing a statement saying, “Somebody wants to kill me just because I am loyal to the President".   This is a very misleading statement and the idea behind it is just to cheat the public.   This is how sensational headlines such as this find their way into 	the foreign press.   Therefore, it is no wonder to see some of the foreing papers flashing en their headlines,  "So-and-so,  claims he is going to be killed because he loves the President"   This is cheating and pretending!   People should be genuine in their statements. If you are a true Way person,  and you speak the truth;  if you love your people and your people love you, then there is no need of shouting all over the place,  "Oh, you know some people want to kill me".   Therefore,  I would like to urge leaders in this country to be reconciliators and to preach love, peace and unity.   Peace is made-made and our people should do everything possible to bring about the peace we  so badly need in this country without any pretence. Mr.  Speaker, Sir,  if the 	200 hon. Members of this House preached peace, love and unity, they would make sure that their statements both in this House and outside are genuine and geared towards bringing about peace, love  and unity.   We as leaders should avoid making statement just for the sake of creating headlines in the newspapers both locally and abroad. When hon. Members complain about reports from the B.B.C or other foreign media ,  they should know that some of us are responsible for bringing  about these reports.   If you stand up today and say that some people  want to kill you, you are showing the whole world that there is no peace or stability in this country and this is taken very seriously, Particularly if you happen to be a Government Minister. Consequently,  this would affect tourism and. industrial investment which bring a lot of foreign exchange in this country.   Therefore,  I would like to take-this opportunity to plead to leaders to be truthful and to stop-thinking that they are more Nyayo than other people.   Let us all,  as hon. Members of this Rouse go home as ambassadors of peace,  love and unity. With those few remarks,  I.beg to  support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MARIEU: 	Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  for giving me this opportunity to join those hon. Members who have spoken before me on this Motion. I would like to first of all  say that this nation is verylucky to have a President who loves his people.	In today's newspapers,His Excellency the President issued a warming statement to leaders in this country to stop irresponsible talk. This statement by the President is very timely in light of what has been happening in this country, and it was aimed at appealing, not only to the hon. Members of this Rouse,  but to all other leaders in this country,  including church leaders,  to put an end to irresponsible talk. We have heard enough and I am afraid to say that what has been said about this country has created a very bad image to us and it is up to leaders to reverse that  image by preaching peace and stability. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we in Kenya love people because we know that this is ideal for our development. It has been shameful to hear utturances by some of our clergymen to the effect that they would not mind to be detained. It is like they having been saying,  "show us the Way to detention or prison"These people must know that  detention or prison is not a holiday resort where people apply to go.   It is this kind. of attitude on part of some of the church leaders and other leaders in this country that we want to change.  We Want these people who are  agitating others to  stop forthwith and I hope that this coming Sunday,  there will be a change in the kind of that will be delivered by all the clergymen in the country.  Some of these clergymen have I even written pastoral letters and others have issued statements to the Press where they have made so many complaints. As a result of these and other complaints that have been made countrywide, our beloved President has appointed a committee chaired by the Vice-President and Minister for Finance whose main purpose is reconciliation where everybody Who  is aggrieved would be free to present his complaints. Some everybody who thinks that there has been something wrong in the way that the ruling Party Kanu has been running the  affairs of this country,  he is at libel y  to present  himself before this committee. It is my hope  anr1 prayer that  all  the religious leaders including the  Muslim leaders in this country,  will go  to this  committee and explain what their feelings are with regard to the affairs of running this country. We hope  that  when this Committee winds up its deliberations, there will be a united Kenya with peace,  love and unity so that we  Shall:,  be able to  sit down and deal with problems of employment and others that are  facing us. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is only .when we have peace and stability that we can be able  to establish industries that can give our young graduates from the universities and other  school  leavers some work to do. 	I am pleased to note that my friend,  the Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation has just entered the  Chamber.  I hope that during this recess,  he will start going around the world informing foreign countries that Kenya is not the Kenya they are hearing about. I am grateful  that we are  still attracting more and more tourists in Kenya.  I am sure when these tourists go ix home,  they say,  "We have been to Kenya and all is well and we do not know what the newspapers are talking about"   It is the responsibility of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation and others to try and change this image because we cannot afford any more to have our name smeared like this.Mr. speaker,  Sir, we have a President Who loves us and he has created A good international image for Kenya. He has been everywhere in the world andHas set a shining example for Kenya in East and Central Africa if not in thewhole of Africa.	Therefore   some of our neighbouring countries are envious of the achievements that we have made in development and they would like to mess about in the internal  affairs of Kenya.   We must stand firmly behind our President;  we must  stand firm and lead our people so that when we come back from recess, we shall be one united nation of Kenya so that we are  able to attract more investors in Kenya. With those few remarks,  I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEPELOPMENT (Mr.  Ogle):  Ahsante sana Bw.

Naunga mkono.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PLANNING MID NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Dr.  Onyonka):   Thank you,  Sir,  for affording me  this  opportunity also  to  express my views  on this  important Motion. 	The main point  that I want  to put across this  afternoon is  that  during the  recent  discussions about  our system of Government,  I  think,  one  sad  thing that we  have all  had to  listen to many many times  over is  the impression being created by certain individuals that  over the  last 27 years  or  so,  the  Government has achieved almost nothing for the  people  of this country.  That is the  impression that some  of them are  trying to  give,  and yet we  have things  to  the  contrary. I know,  Sir,  that  development specialists  or experts tell us  that we  do not now measure  development in terms 'of the gross national product per capita. That  is not what  I am talking  about. 	Even  if one  were  to  look at  the recent United Nations Development Programme (U.N.D.P.)  Report on human development, how does Kenya rank when   compared with other countries whose income  per capita  are  much higher than ours,  even in some cases double  our level?   Definitely,  we  stand quite well in comparison to  some  of these  countries. The  implication is obvious. The education  system has not  only been expanded but  also been made acceptable  to many people  who  did  not have  that accessibility before. This  equally applies  to  other aspects  of national development. 	Therefore,  Sir,  it  is  easy to  stand up  and criticise,  butin practice,  we  know most  of these  things  are  easier said  than done. my second point, Sir, is that one of the leading churchmen recently said that he was rather surprised with respect  to the  list  of  "shadow cabinet"  for whatever government was  supposed to  be  created. According to  him, that  "shadow cabinet"  did  not constitute  a group that would create  a viable  government  or a viable democracy,  for that matter.	But  that is  the  fact;  thatis  the nasty truth!	In fact,  I will  borrow a leaf from the  Bibleand  call  them an  "earthly"  group.	This  is  a group  that is  comprisedof people  with so  many shades  of  opinion that,  in reality,  they can hardly constitute  a viable and worthy government  due  to ideological  and  other differences. 	Yet,  in one  and the  same  breath, they are  the  same  People who  say they do not want the  present Government. This  is  the  reality of the  matter. In fact,  in too many international  situations  we have been,  it is easy to  say that  this Government is not good but, thereafter,  those  who  have followed have  proved incompetent, corruptible and incapable of organising a smoothly-functioning government that can deliver  the  goods  to wananchi.Sir,  we  have  never Pretended that we  are  paragons  ofperfection and that there  is no  scope  for improvement.	Thatwould be naive, if not  folly. The  truth of the matter is thatwhen we  look at  the  "pluses"  and the  "minuses",  I think,  the "pluses"  far outweighs the  "minuses"! 	Hence,  we  hon.  Members  support His Excellency the President and  the  Government because of the results he has  achieved. 	We  are  poor people who  need to be  assisted and supported by the  fact  that  His Excellency the President has already taken the  initiative  in some  of these  areas with programmes  that would benefit the  poor in the  rural areas,  the rural enterprise  fund.	After all,  even the rural development fund which is administered in my ministry, essentially goes to assist  the  local people  in the rural  areas.  So,  there  is still room for improvement  in a lot  of areas.  But it is another thing to say that we  totally do not agree  and practically nothing has  been achieved.	That may be  simple  on a religious platform,  but inmanaging public  affairs,  it  is not  all that easy.	We  are  readyto  do more  and we  are  committed.	We  are  a Government  that iscommitted  to help wananchi. 	Thank you.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TECHNICAL TRAINING AND APPLIED TECHNOLOGY	(Dr.  Koech):	Thank you very much sir, for giving this	opportunity to  support this motion. I would like,  first of all to thank His Excellency the President for having arranged for my treatment abroad. I  also  thank my colleagues who  prayed  and  supported me  in every way,  particularly the Vice-President  and Minister for Finance who was able  to arrange  for my financial expenditure while  abroad.(applause). Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would also  like,  along with my colleagues,  to  support  the  presentation "of  the  Budget  Speech made  by  His Excellency  the  Vice-President  and Minister for Finance  and his  maintenance  of the  economy  of this  country. I  also  support  the  support  he  has  given  and  theenvironment  he  has  created  by  the  establishment  of certain policies. He  hascreated  an  environment  conducive  to  investment  and  the  development  of  industries in this  country.  I  would  also  like  to  join  my  colleagues  in  expressing support  for  the maintenance  of peace  in  this  country. 	I  thank  His  Excellency  the  President  for being mindful  of the  nation  and maintaining peace  and stability  in this country. I  would  like  to  request  my  colleague  hon.  Members  and people  outside  Parliament to  pray  and hope  that  there  will  always  be  one  President  in  the  country. We  know that  there  are  small  "presidents"  who  have  come  up  through  the  pulpit  and  in certain  streets  of particular  areas,  but no country  can survive  without  leadership. Let  us  not  be  cheated. Even  in  the  western world,  the  economy of a country depends  mainly  on  the  direction  that  its  president  follows. 	We  pray  that  the  one-party  system stays  in  this  country because  it is  a  solidifying factor,  a matrix  of our  society  and  our  own survival. 	I  hope that  people  in  this  country  pray  for  one  Church,  the  Church that preaches salvation  through  Christ,  leave  alone  social  theology  and  liberation  theology which  has  destroyed  Latin America. These  are  facts  that  compose  history,  and a situation that we can observe. I  hope  that we  will  develop  a cohesive  society  in which our children will  talk only of being one  tribe,  and not many  tribes.  Let  us  not be  deceived. When America created a country,  this was because 99  per  cent  of  its people  are Whites. They  were  able  to  create  an undivisible country. They  destroyed  theIndians and the Blacks  by creating many political parties  in the country. Therewas  the  Black Panther  Party  in America which was  demolished by the CentralIntelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigations. Our  detractors are  not  telling  us  these  things. Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I  know  that  my  peole  in  my constituency  would  also want  me  to  say  something about that place. My  peopleof Kipkelion  Constituency  are  a  special  mixture. I  have  there  people  from  allover  the  country,  and  I  want to agree with those who have said that we  should not victimise  any  one  group  of people. We  are  trying  to  create  one  tribe  ofKenyans  that will maintain unity  following the  Nyayo Philosophy. I  am  happythat  the  people  of Kipkelion  did not riot. In  fact,  they helped us  inarresting  some  of the  rioters  from  other areas. I  would  like  to  urge  the  Ministry  of Public  Works  to mend certain bridges  in my constituency  and the  Ministry of Health to help  us  in fighting highland malaria,  which  is  prevalent  in my area. Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  AND  INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION (Mr.  Ayah): 	Thank you very much,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir. 	I  support the  Motion  that we  go  home  and do  some  work among our people  for  the  next month or  so. Listening  to  and watching  the  events  that have  taken  place  in  Kenya in recent weeks,  I  have  come  to  the  conclusion  that we  should  remind ourselves of what  I  consider  to  be  two  important  issues. Firstly, I  would  like  to plead with my  fellow Kenyans  who  have  had the privilege  of being educated and who hold 	high position  in the  Government,  public  affairs,  universities  and other areas. It  is  my  contention that the  educated people of this country I happen to be  privileged to be  included among them - have  lost confidence in ourselves and institutions. We have  lost confidence-in our ability to manage our own affairs,' and this  is  the reason why,  as we  listen to what educated people  are  saying  about this  country,  you find that they talk about foreign  ideas  and institutions saying-that  these  are  things that  should be  imposed on Kenya as  if we cannot develop  ourselves. The very foundation of colonialism was  based on the  theory  that we ourselves  Were unable  to do anything. Colonialists came to this country   and  said that we were  unable  to  sing or do anything else well,  and they substituted their values  and culture for ours.  Apparently,  this  is  still continuing unintentionally among our people,  and I would like to appeal to our educated people to  stop  this practice. At  least,  we  should show our people that when we  talk about our political organisation,  our Government or any other  institution,  we  talk  about Kenyan  institutions  that  are  capable  of being developed because,  apparently,  so often our people talk about our institutions  as if they are  incapable of development. I  would  like  to  see  our political  institutions, for  instance,  developing through our own efforts  instead of hearing that they should be  thrown aside  as we have new  ideas  and institutions being imposed on our people. More  importantly,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  we should talk about our people  and  institutions. 	Let  us  not  talk about Aristotle,  Pluto  and the  other people  who brought old  ideas. These  old  ideas  have  been discarded  all over  the  world. I  feel  that we  are  not talking enough about  the people that we are  supposed  to be  working for;  we  are  talking about other  institutions. Secondly,  I want  to  appeal  to my colleague hon.  Members  in this House. As  I  listen  to  foreigners who  come  to  see me  in the  office  and the radio and read magazines,  I  get  the  impression that we,  as hon.  Members of this House,  are not  talking enough  about ourselves. We  have  a first-class  country,  President and  Government,  but we  are not saying so,  so that the people who are  talking about us  in  the  United States  of America,  England,  Germany and elsewhere do so out  of ignorance  of what we ourselves  are  doing. I  appeal  to my hon.  colleagues to  ensure  that when we  get  an opportunity  t6 talk to our constituents,. we  talk about what we,  the  Government,  the President and Kanu are  doing so that anybody who wants  to  know Kenya may  do  so  from  our  own people  and we  ourselves who are Involved in the running of the affairs of this nation. Otherwise,  they will listen to  the  Okullus  and the Kurias  of this world who have no responsibility at all  except to shout. 	We  have  the  responsibility of explaining to the world what We are doing because  we have  the necessary information and knowledge. Let Us tell  them  this  so  that  people  do not  just  talk about Kenya has  if it had no owners  or any  information to give.  My colleague, the Mombasa Kanu Chairman,  has  told me here  that we  should request our  ambassadors to talk to  foreigners  about this  country,  and I  want  to  tell him that  I have recalled them and for the next two weeks  they will be  attending a seminar  in Mombasa where  they will be  discussing among themselves how to  project Kenya to  the rest  of the  world. 	But we  ourselves,  as  leaders  of this  country, should also talk about what we are doing in agriculture,  environment conservation and so  on so  that  people will know that Kenya is being run by competent men and women.With those  few remarks,  I  support the Motion.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Thank you,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker, for  giving me  this  opportunity to  contribute  to this Motion for the adjournment.	I  appeal to  all the  leaders in this  country to  be sincere  and committed in their responsibility.	We  would like  senior  civil  servants,  administration officers,  Kanu officials  and Members  of Parliament  to  co-operate.	 Sometimes  problems  in our constituencies  are  created  by people  who  do  not want  this  country to develop rapidly.In particular we have  places where  land adjudication was declared 26 years.	But because  of interference,  sometimes by civil servants,  with clan land the  land adjudication process has beendelayed.	We would like  to have  sincere  civil servants whose  main concern is  to help wananchi.   In Igember land has been not beenadjudicated for  27 years now because  we have  landless  people  there whose work is  to  sabotage  the  land adjudication process;  this is why we teed civil servants who can ensure  this  process  starts  and movesfast. I believe that we should be sincere and try to deliver the %goods  to wananchi,  otherwise we should not talk about minding other people's welfare.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other problems we have in this country is  that  of awarding projects to contractors who cannot start off the projects. We have road projects which havebeen given to  one  contractor even		though the  Government knowsthe  particular contractor cannot complete those projects; yesterday we  had an example  of such a contractor. This  contractor  called "Camson Africa Ltd"  is known for ripping the  Government and the Government  should find out who in the Ministry of Public  Works colludes with this  company there must be  somebody who helps who helps  it to  get  Government  contracts. In Igembe we have roads which have  not been repaired for the  last	10 years.	I would like  the Minister for Public Works  tocome  to  Igembe  during this recess  and see  for himself the  state  ofthe roads  there	 they are  like  cattle  tracks.I would also  like  to  suggest  that kanu should a propanda organ to  be  countering propaganda against  this country from the foreign press.With those few remarks, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING(Mr. Nassir):  Bw.

Let the Goverment seriously consider their light.Sir,  the other point relates to the Ministry of Health, which I would Like to rewuest, further to a promise about the provision of an ambulance in Masinga, to assist us. We now have a health centre and I would appeal to the Minister  to provide that ambulance to serve the people within mesinga Division.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I would like to inform the ministry of lands and Housing  that we have two sub-locations which have not been declared. I would like to appeal that land adjudication be carried out in those two sublocations;	 namely, Kiyea and kangorde sub-locations. People have no security in cases	where they would want to granted bank loans. We would like to join other Kenyans who are enjoying those security privileges with their title deeds to get loans.(The temporary Deputy speaker, (Mr. Tuva) left the chair)(The Temporary Seputy Speaker (Mr. Mahihu) took the chair)Sir, the other thing is that we have some government land in an area known as Kwa Ndolo. I would appeal to the government to see to it that something is done, maybe land adjudication, so that those people there can be given their portions of land. This is because there are some other new people who are now going to disturb those who have been residing there for many years. I am urging that the government prevents those new faces that are going to disturb those who have been squatters there for a long time.On the condition of roads, I would like to request the minister for public works to check on this in my constituenct. It is long since people in the public in enjoying the fruits in Kenya.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,  for giving me this opportunity which I will use to support the Motion. I would, first of all, like to thank my hon. colleagues here for a very hard session; indeed, and for their constructive criticism. I wish them all the best during the coming holidays.I take this opportunity to particularly thank Kenyans for the very mature manner in which they handled the situation that arose recently, particularly rejecting hooliganism, lawlessness and assisting the security forces to apprehend the hooligans. As we proceed to go on Recess, this the time to reflect on a number of issues. I will, particularly my contribution here on various developmental aspects that face us in our constituencies. I would particularly like to concentrate on the role of the district development committees because, If my experience serves me right, I do notice a lot of anomalies in the execution and implementation of the intentions of the district development committees.First of all, I am not sure that the sub-location chairman, who are in fact the chiefs, do appreciate their roles exactly. I call upon the ministries to make sure that education is imparted among the members of the sub-location development committees, let alone the fact that the members of this sub-location development committees are far from on e location to another within the same constituency. So, I would like to underscore and emphasire the importance of that because DDC’s policy states that development projects are initiated by the people themselves. If the DDCs are not able to identify their priorities, how do we go forward with these? I urge my hon.  colleagues to try and assist in importing education on the importance of these committees, as a focus point for initiating development projects. The same thing goes for the locational development committees and so on up to the district development committees themselves.I  urge	my  colleagues  to  visit  all  development  projectsin  the  their  constituencies  with  a  view to finding out how theyare  progressing.	They  shoul_d	hold  talks  with  district  developmentofficers  and  the implementing  agents	who  are,   in  fact,   heads  ofdepartments.	We  have  just  approved  the  Budget  and  it	is  importantfor	hon.   Hembers  to  go  and  find out  whether	Authority  to  IncurExpenditure 	(AIE)  has  been  received  and  whether  spending on development  nrojects  has  started. This  is  very  imoortant  and  I  urge  my  colleagues  to  use these  two  months  and  concentrate  on  this  ans  aspect  and  to  ensure that funds  voted  by  this  House  are  spent  carefully. This is innortant  because  now  one  hon.  Member  from  each  district  can sit on  the  Tender  Board as  well  as  Kanu  representatives, and  we should  participate  fully  in  these  committees. 	I  would  also  lihe  to  take  this  opportunity to  urge  hon. members  to  launch  massive Manu  recruitment  campaigns in  their areas  so  that  the  Party  can  live  as  a  strong Organ  as  possible. The  other thing  is  that  newsnapers  are a development catalyst  and  I  would  like  to  ask  those  who  run  them  to  work  with us  and  not  against  us  in  disseminating  the  truth  rather  than sensitizing  issues. With 	those  remarks,   I  beg  to  support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT MINISTER  FOR  SUPPLIES  AND MERKETING (Mr.Mwenje): 	In  supporting  this  Hotion,   Sir,   I  wish  to  start by  thanking  the  Kenya  Power  and  Lighting  Company  for  connecting electricity  to Umoja  and Kayole  Estates  which  have  been  indarkness  for  the  last  two  years.	I  requested  this  company, throughthis  House,   to	connect  electricity  to  these  estates  and they  havedone  it  and  I  am  very  grateful.  I  would also  like  to  thank  the Ministry of  Public  Worksfor  starting  to  do  the  road  between  Outering Road and kangundo.This	again  was  done  after  I  had made  a  request  through  thisHouse. I	would  like  to  thank  the  Government  very  much  and  toinform  those  who  do  not  know  that  the  Government  is  working tostart  seeing  what  it  is  doing. People  are  now  receiving  servicesthey  have  been  asking  for  because  of  the  peace  that  we  have continued  to  enjoy  in  t!ls  this  country  under  the  leadership  of His  Excellency  the  President. We  read  in  the  Bible  about  People  like king solomon  who became so  famous because  they built huge  temples  for the  Lord and were honoured  throughout  their  lives. I  would  like  to  compare  King Solomon  with  our  President,  who  has  not  only  constructed one temple,_but  has  done  so  in  so  many  different  parts  of our country.	If  those  kings  were  respected,   I  do  not  see  any reasonwhy  we  should  not  respect	our  President  who  is  godly. He  isa  strong  Christian  and  it  is  because  of  that  that  this  country hasenjoyed  a  lot  of  peace,   stability  and  development.	We  pray  togod to  continue  blessing  hi  so  that  he  can lead us  to  even  greaterheights	of  stability.I  would  like  to  thank  the  residents  of  Nairobi  for  realisingand understanding that  we  need to  maintain peace  if we  have  toattain  any  development.	I  am  now  happy  that  there  is  peace  inNairobi  and  that  things  are  back  to  normal.	We  all  appreciatewhat  the  Government  has  done  to  make  sure  that  there  is  peace.	Ialso  thank  the  residents  of  Nairobi  for  continuing  toassist  the  Government  to  make  sure  that  peace  is  maintained. For  example,   I am happy  that  when  one  fellow tried to  cause confusion  in a  certain area,  it was  not the members of  the  security forces  who  went to  control it, but the members of the public went  in and made  sure.  That peace prevailed. I am glad that everybody now appreciatesthe  existing  neace  and  we  should  all  continue  to strive  to  seethat  peace  is  maintained  in  the  City and  in  other  parts	of ourcountry.We  also need	to	appeal	to foreign	countries	to	be	at	peacewith  us.	For  example,   the	American  television, after  screeningwhat  is  happening  in  Konrovia,   they  went	on	to comment	 that is what  was  hapnening  in Nairobi.	This  is  total  confusion  and ourPress  officers  in  washington,   should correct  that impression and  tell  the Americans  the  truth  about  what is  hapPenig  in	kenya.One	person  who  came  from   America  was  surprised  to  find  that  the streets	of   Nairobi  peaceful  and  yet  they  were  being  told  thatthe  streets  are  patrolled  by  army officers. This  is  not  happenigin	kenya  and we  are  happy  that  we  are  Peaceful.	The  Americancommon n	an  should  be  made  aware  of  what  is  happening  in  the  streets of Nairobi. With  those  few  remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR.

We have  a nation,  the Republic  of Kenya,in which there are  about 23 million people.	It  is  the wish  of all  the  peopleto  live  in  peace,  tranguility  and go abour their businesses uninterrupted. This  is  an  issue  that needs  to be realised. 	What  is  making us collide? 	I suspect that  the answer to this  question lies  in the fact that we are making developmental strides which means that we are not likely to be the darling of everybody. Because of this,  we have jealousies surrounding us,  which means that we have to guard ourselves against thesi things. I  say  this with confidence bedause the leadership 'of this  coury is unqualified,  excellent and wise. We have been able to make inroads to the discdvery of the drug Kemron which is  fairly effedtive against Aids. We have also been able to venture  into the field of motor  mechanics and  produce a Kenyan car. These two  items,  whenone  looks  at  their future potential,  stand to offer a substantial devidends to  this  nation. I think  this  is  the. reason why we  are not being looked at favourably. It  is  with  this  background that we must not destroy ourselves and we  should  also not let selfishness  eat  into our society. I would like to say that,  should one be an ordinary peron or a clergyman, the bottomline is that we  are  all  Kenyans  and have total  responsibility  towards maintaining peace in this  nation.  As  a result,  one  cannot take liberty upon himself and sarogate oneself the conscience of the rest of the  people. I  feel that  I must  say this  because therelhas  been a tendency  for some  few people  to  sarogate  themselves power and the conscience of this nation. There  even a few silentwho have not spoken about this issue.	They  should  know  that  the  silent majoritywant peace and they do not want  to  hear  Prof.  Ongeri  speaking everyday  about  this issue.. When  one  has made his point,  he should  let it lie in state. Do not use the  issue  as  if you are fighting everybody. I  would  like to  ask  the  few clergymen  in'this  country to Come out and  say  whether  they  want  peace  or  chaos  in  the  country. 	In  my  opinion,   if they  want  chaos,  then  that  is  contrary  to  the  teachings  of  the Holy Bible. On  the Other hand  if they want peace,  then their sermons should be directed towards  that end and not towards  incitement of the people.	We  are not here.attacking anybody but we want  to be  basic. One  cannot  destroy the  name  ofthis  nation;	When  I was  abroad recently,  I was not amused to find that thename of.this nation  is  being  smeared with dirty  from all sides.	_.The ordinary	mwananchi linIthis country is very peaceful and wants to go about his businessuninterrupted. But the amount of literature being pilled out to the international community is very upsetting. This is because what is being said is not the truth about this nation. It is all false.  There  was  even  a group  of journalists  who  reported  the  events  in Liberia  and  equitted  them  with  the  events  in Nairobi.	This  is  not  fair  atall. We would  like  through  the same  vein  to  appeal  to  the  internatinal  communityto understand  our  society.	The  values  of this  society  are different fromthose  in other  societies.	If we  did  something  in  our  own  manner,  then  itshould  not  be  seen  as  being contradictory  to  an  international  community. It should be seen in our light. With  those  few  remarks,  I  beg  to  support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  KILIKU: Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  His  Excellency the President for what hesaid  today. 	The statement that some  of  the  leaders  have been  making  in  this  country,  are  going  to  cost us  a lot  of money  to restore the  image  of  this  country.	It  is  unfornate  for  a  Cabinet Minister  to saythat people  should  pick up pangas  and cut each other.	It  is  very  unfortunatefor 	a Kanu_Sub-Branch Chairman  to urge youthwingers  to  chop  off the  two  fingers of those  people  who were flashing  the  two-finger  symbol.	Such  statementsare the  ones that show that there is:no  security  in this  coutnry.	It  is  wisefor  leaders  to ensure  that  they  know what  they  want  to  say  before  they  issue a  statement. They  should know  the  implication  of  their  statements. When the  opponents  of the Government  read  such  statements  they  capitalise  on  them and  say  that  the  country has  no  security. Such  statements  affect  our  tourism, investments  and  the  image  of  the  country. The statement by His Excelldncy  the President was very timely,  considdring thd fact that  it was only  the other day whdn a Cabinet Ministdr and a MeMber of Parliament said hdre that some Ministdrs are not loyal to  thd Government.

I would particularly register my gratitued to His Excellency the Prdsident for the way in which he restored peace after we saw the turbulent behaviour cased by a few people who are not satisfied with what has been achidved,  and what would have been even more achieved had they not interrupted. Sir, His Excellency thd Presiddnt has even moved fastdr.   Before we finish our sigh of relief, we find that he has even released some of the detainees.This show that our President continuds to be magnanimous and forging despite thd provocation that some people have continued to throw around.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think one of the most remarkable things that we have achieved is this year's Budget.  What I would urge those responsible for dispatching the money to the district is to ensure that Authorities to Incur Expdnditure reach the districts as it has been directed by His Excellency the President through the district focus strategy for rural ddvdlopment.  That ensures that those hon. members mentioned today and who will take part in the district tender boards will find the money thdre so that projdcts can be implemented. That is my plea. Sir, when we go home, our greatdst duty will be to preach peace.  That is not a repitition, and if it is then it is bdcausg it is almost too serious to forgdt.  we havd to continue preaching peace.  The recent disturbances showed us that without peace nothing really mmoves.  Therefore, as we go home, it is very important tha we emphasize the Importance of preaching peace because we have all realised that peace is the only basis upon which development can take place. 	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, had we taken the teachings of His Excellency thd President seriously He has really warned Kenyans several times. For example, during thd opening of thd Nakuru Agricultural Show, he forewarned of what would happen at the Kamukunji meeting.   Unfortunateiy, some people attended thd meeting and thd ensuing consequences were lose' of life and looting.   I only wish that we took HisExcellency thd Prdsident very seriously.   Whdn we are warned we do not walk into the trap.   I think this time we have learned a lesson.   So, we had better preach peace for our own good. Sir, I think it is also very important that we learn to combat the poor image we are being given by foreign media. whereas the British Broadcasting Corporation was the first and to report the detention of lawyers, when His Excel1ency, the President released them yesterday the Corporation said nothing.  So, it shows clearly that they are looking for anything that is negative.  They are not interested in Kenya's favourable development.   Therefore, I think it is up 	  to us,  as hon.  Members,  to act responsibly and not to give these people anything negative.   I am even told that they were trying to make a quiz puzzle on the Nakuru incident,  asking,  "In which country will your two fingers be chopped off if you raise them?".	We have to take this  seriously because these people are not ourfriends.	They are out for us and anything good will not be reported. Those whotuned to the BBC today to try and get the nears of the release of detainees were disappointed because there was nothing of-the sort reported. 	This was deliberate. So,  we have to do quite a lot to improve our country's  image. The country  is good and the economy  is well managed, but the problem is the false reports that are going on about Kehya. Something has to be done,  and  I hope that every one of us will  contribute one or or the other to see how we can tackle the situation. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, recently His Excellency the President did help  those students who obtained 10 points to go to the university.   Today, he has organised soething good for those who will take diploma courses. This  is yet a great proof that our President is concerned about the welfare of all,  and I wish  to thank him. Thank you,  Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON.  MEMBER:	Mutua!

Let us be frank here;  it  is  because peace,  good leadership and good management that  Kenya 	survives  economically.   Kenya survives economically better than many countries that  are better  endowed with resources. Kenya is not very well  endowed with resources but we manage to do better than ;nary countries that are better endowed with resources.

KIRWA:  Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this Motion. First of all, I would like  to thank His Excellency the President for the great job that he has done for our country.   Many of his statements are very wise and we as leaders of this country,  support him fully. I would like to commend him for the way he has steered this country for the last few weeks when many people here  and abroad thought that we were going  to experience a lot of problems. We are pleased to note that His Excellency the President has been able to safeguard the  interests of this nation. His EXcellency the President made a statement in Kiganjo Police Training College to the effect that the chiefs who had been asking for the payment of Shs.20/- from every member of the society who may want to get a permit or a licence to carry out a particular transaction, must be stopped forthwith. This was every important statement because we know that our chiefs have been harassing our people whever they went to seek assistance from them. Chiefs are the basis of administration in this country and when ever they take it  upon themselves to demand this kind of payment from wananchi,  wananchi have no way of knowing that  this is not a directive from the:	'	: Government.   Therefore,  what they think is that  this is a Government  directive to frustrate their efforts and we are pleased that His Excellency the President has come to their assistance in very good time. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  recently when we had a Harmbee. onPresidential Bursary Fund,  chiefs were told to go round collecting money and  they were using proformal. A lot of money was collected and some Members of the public know that after a chief collected shs. 10,000/-, 	he only surrendered Shs.3,000/-. What I suggest is that whenever there is Harambee fund raising, proper checks must be carried out to ascertain that all the money  collected in every location is surrendered to the district commissioner.This is the only way in which we can wipe out the images that the chief’s have created in the Republic.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am happy about the way we are now doing things together as Back-lenchers and Front Benchers. I was particularly happy this afternoon to note the way that two hon.  Assistant Ministers, namely, hon.  Chesire and hon. Onyancha, answered questions put to their respective Ministries.   These two Assistant Ministers were able to give us elaborate answers to the questions asked to them.   This shows that they are responsible Assistant Ministers because they said they were not satisfied with the answers they had received from the field.   In doing so,  they clearly I showed us a way by which we can stop civil servants from giving false information.   I am sure that the next time these civil  servants would be asked to provide some information,  they will make sure they give the correct information. This is the only way in which we can safeguard the image of our country. 	Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I would like also to emphasize that  this Harambee money should be audited.  At the moment, we know that so many HaraMbees have been conducted in this country but after these Haradbees are completed, nobody knows how this money is. used. _This. money just goes away quietly and we do not know how it is used.   This point was raised here some time back but. the debate just died out  and.therefore,  I must reiterate that if we want to safeguard public funds,.we must.audit every cent that is raised from the public pockets. Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  it is also very important to have a very clear line of protocol so that we do not have three spokesmen in one particular  Government  repartment or.in a M particular Ministry or organization. Today, it is not surprising to hear, particularly from the Kanu Headquarters, 	 somebody issuing a statement saying,  "I am issuing this or that as a policy",however, the following day, somebody else issues another completely different statement. We must have proper guidelines in our protocol because our dignity as leaders Of this country can only be safeguarded by establishing a clear line of protocol in our way of doing things.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, I would now like to turn to the coverage of debate in this House.  I believe we can borrow some m kind of procedure from other countries in doing this, For example,  today if you listened to Radio Tanzania at 10.30 p.m. you would hear some of the voices of some Members of Tanzania Parliament. This is because . debate in the Tanzania4 Parliament is covered live. This is a procedure that the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Should borrow because it would encourage  some  of us who have a problem in speaking Kiswahili to learn more Kiswahili so that our constituents can hear what we are  saying. The other issue that I believe should be brought to the attention of the Rouse is the issue of secondhand clothings. We Should have a consistent policy regarding the  sale of these clothes.  If we do not have second-hand clothes being  sold elsewhere in Kenya,  why ,Should we have them being  sold in Gikomba? With  those few remarks,  I beg to  support</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE(Mr.  Kanes):Thank you, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my colleagues  also  in  supporting the Motion on Adjournment. I would like,  first  of all,  to  thank His Excellency the President for bringing peace back in the country after the nation witnessed  some riots along the streets of Nairobi and some other towns  in this country. We have heard a lot  about the riots and surprisingly, we  have  not been hearing much of thanks  going to His Excellency the President for at  least restoring that peace. 	When this happened,  I was  out  of the  country and I felt  so bad that there riots down at  home.	I was very happy three  days  later when I learnedthat there was peace  in the  country.	I must  commend very highlyour President for doing that. Sir,  a lot has been said  about  the method which was used to restore  peace,  but  I think peace  is  paramount in the  country. We  cannot commromise it. Whatever method could be used to restore peace,  I think,  what is paramount  at the  end of the  day is Whether or not peace  has  been restored. I Would also like to thank His Excellency the President for appointing the Kanu Review Committee. I hope  that every Kenyan who would like  to  air his views  is welcome  to use this forum to do  so. I hope  and  sincerely pray that  there Will hot be  any reports  on Monday papers  about the members  of the clergy going to  the  pulpit and talking anything evil about  our Government because  a for   haq been created for them. 	They  should go ' 	to this  committee which I hear is  doing very well under the wise leadership of His Excellency the Vice-President  and Minister for Finance  and that they are  accommodating all views and taking them very seriously.  Sir,  this  is  a very high-powered democracy that our President has facilitated to this country. 	Any member who has been feeling that his views are not listened to-should use this forum. I would also  like  to  say that members of the foreign community have never been able  to understand our President. OurPresident  has got a unique  characteristic. He  is  a Presidentwho  is  able  to  listen to everybody,  ranging from the biggest to the  smallest. Some  communities may never understand how a :President an go to  a local  church and pray with everybody,  orhow a President can stop on the  road and give  a lift to  a sick lady. Also,  some  people  do  not understand how our President  cansomtimes  stop and listen to  some  oldmen on the  streets. We  havea unique  President. He  has  a lot  of respect all  over the world.Therefore,  there  is no  doubt  that  certain people  are  Jeelous:about our nation and  also  envy the characteristics of our President,  and it  is for that reason that thy want to bring a lot of turmoil in our nation. However,  I am sure  that  our President  can even accommodate the views  of Bishop Dr.  Okullu.  If Dr.  Okullu made  an appointment to  see  the President I am sure  our President will  accommodate him But  he  just wants  to  be  adamant!  He just wants to be adamant. The President has accommodated even Muite. When the  President  annonced over the radio on Sunday that Mr.  Muite should come out from his hiding and apologise to him,  some people thought that he was just joking, but when Mr.  Muite came  out,  he was seen and definitely pardon by the President. 	Today,  we witness  the fact that three lawyers have been released from detention.	This  is  unique behaviour on the part of our President,  but only	a few people  understand  it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MUTUA:	Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I would like to airmy views  on this veryimportant Motion for the Adjournment.	Firstly,  I  thankthe  President  for being merciful  and releasing lawyers from detention. If thepeople of Kenya are enlightened by us, leaders, to love their country like His Excellency  the  President,  the whole  country will be peaceful. (Applause) The  other point relates  to two certain classes of employees  in this  country,  that is  doctors and teachers. 	Their cry, which they make every now and then,  is not heard although they are  important contributors to the development of this country. We  have  some  other people who are being badlymistreated,  that  is  councillors. We  passed a Motion here  asking that councillors  allowances be  increased,  but this has not been done up to now. Why  is  this  so? These  people  live with wananchi every day and we would like those  concerned to remember that these people have a very  important and difficult  task of dealing with wananchi.	My  friend,  the  Minister  for Local Government,  hon.  ole Ntimama,  is here.	He  should  look  into  this  issue.I  have  already said that teachers and doctors are very important because  they teach our children and treat  the sick. I have  a  lot  to  say about this  important issue,  and the Ministries of Education,  Health and Local Government ought to think about the  issue. These  people  need  to be helped In doing their difficult work instead of being expelled from service. We,  as leaders,  should help  the  President to rule  this  country peacefully. At  the moment we  not  doing  this properly.  One  day an hon.  Member  said here  that we  should work together, instead of working individually,  in order to  solve  our problems. 	With these  few words,  I  support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr.MADHUSUTI:	Ahsante  sana,	Bw.Naibu Spika wa Muda,  kwakunipa nafasi i1i nami  niSeme machache.

Through thatConstitution, we have eleCted our President and other leaders.	Nobody has The right to  question what we have done,  as Kenyans.	The  only  thing we must do  is  to show thost Doubting Thomases  that we  are united. Through unity,  whatever  power, be it that of the most powerful country in the world, we shall 	not   be shaken.	This  is because such people fear unity.	It  is true thatthrough unity  a country  like Cuba has  been  able to exist for 30 years  despite the  embargoes  and all  those other things  against  it. Having said  that,  let me add  that here,  in this House,  we have debated on Ministries  Votes and allocated funds. This money  is  channelled through civil  servants  to  implement certain projects.  This  money  should  be used carefully and in a profitable manner.   However,  in many cases, there are occasions when civil servantsdo not use the money properly. 	For  two years now,  if I may cite an example, the road that joins Nyatike to Ndhiwa at a place celled Kalamindi has remained very bad. Every Year when you  look at the money voted to the Ministry of Public Works,  you see money that has been allocated for maintenance and repair of roads that have been spoilt by floods.  However,  this road has remained unattended for two years. I  do not know where the money  alloCated for that purpose goes.  There are a number of projects where you find a contractor coming  in and after doing a shoddy work the job stops and anothercontractior is brought in.   When these gentlemen are questioned about these developments, they normally tell the wananchi, "Mwulize Mbunge wenu", whereas we are not supposed to implement development.   Our job is to approve the allocated budgets and the civil servants implement.   I think it is high time they changed their way of thinking as it looks they are practising that old adage of "Kikifaa ni cha Bw. Sidi na kikiharibika ni cha Bw. Mwalimu". Hon. Members should not be made the scapegoats for the shoddy work that is being supervised by the civil servants.   The civil servants are the eyes of the Government and should ensure that the voted allocations are properly utilised. With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech>(Question put and agreed to) <Header>  ADJOURNMENT </Header><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER 	(Mr. Mahihu):   Hon.
