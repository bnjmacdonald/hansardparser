The Assistant Minister For Culture and social Services (Mrs. Ogot) (ctd):and walked to stay I with his family in peace? He was not even questioned or arrested op to now!Therefore,  Sir,  we   would like to tell Norway to stop offering a denfor dissident from Kenya. It  should also give us the respect we deserve as asovereign state.  Until this  is done,  Norway cannot be  counted as one  of ourfriends but  an enemy who wants to overthrow the popularly elected Government of President Moi. I would like to emphasize here that the behaviour of the Norwegian  Embassador  was mean  to undermine the  confidence  of  Kenyan youth in their  Government. Through his actions,  the Ambassador also indicated that this country did not have qualified lawyers to defend accused Persons in court. This also undermines   the  education offered in this country. I  feel  that Norwayhad intended to undermine  the confidence  of Kenyans in this country. We rejectthat totally. On the  question of portraying Kenya as a country which would collapse if Norway withdrew all its  aid,  I would like  to   tell Kenyans that  this would not be  so. The abuse  that Norway   had directed to us,  should be rejected. Kenyans should also be prepared to tighten their belts by generating their own income and cultivating more food in order to be self-reliant in food.   Even if we do not have enough money to run our projects, we should be prepared our cloth  according to  the material at our disposal. Kenya should take a cue from what Norway has done  to us becauseother  countries might want to take away our confidence by telling us ""We willonly give you this if you can succumb to this and that"". We, as mothers  ofthis country, are  looking   upon the leaders of this country in this respect.It has always been repeated that this is ""The House of Men"" but  I am glad to say that the  Speaker made it clear that the word ""Men"" here includes women. We  should be  self-reliant and use the money we derive  from our ownsuccess to the best  of our ability in order  to ward off the strings andthat  they may come with the aid that  is given to us. We should all  doyou have to fulfill  our  obligations to this country by working hard and holding our unity together. With those  few remarks,  I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER OF STATE,  OFFICE   OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr.  Nabwera):   Thankyou,  Sir,  for giving me  this  opportunity to speak in  support of this Motion. First of all,  I would like to join my colleagues in thanking the hon. Member for Saboti for moving this Motion at an appropriate  time so that the views of this House  can be expressed loud and clear. I would also like to congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs and International  Co-operation for taking a timely and effective action on the question of our relations with Norway.I would not like to blame the NorwegianAmbassador as such. I would like to lay the blame squarely on the  shoulders ofthe Government  of Norway. The Norwegian Ambassador and all his officers were acting on the  instructions of the Government of Norway. Therefore,  it is the Government of Norway whose actions were totally unfriendly and most unwelcome to Kenya. It  is  important   for the whole worldto know cur Position. We are not just talking about Norway but inter-staterelations between Kenya and other countries. We  are  sounding a word of warningto our friends and  enemies alike that we  expect them to respect us as we respect them. If they do not respect us, then it would be very difficult for us to continue with diplomatic relations with  them. Before we  broke relations with Norway,  there was a lot of talk from a number countries friends and enemies alike to the effect thatunless we went multi-party and did this and that , they would not  continue  towork with us. That  is why I  said that let it go cut of this House, loudclear,  that  it was the dignity of  entire nation which was beingquestioned and not  only that of the Head of State or of the Minister forforeign Affairs and International Co-operation. The 22 million plus Kenyansare  telling Norway and the rest of the world that they will not  stand to be  ridiculed   because of aid.  Let the aid that comes to Kenya be one that is going to friends and to equal partners. If you calculate economically,  the  country  which gives us aid gains more  than we do. Countries,  such as,  Britain, United States of America,France,  West  Germany, Japan and  so on,  gain by investing in Kenya more than wedo. Therefore,  it  is  in their national  interest  that  they continue toobserve good relations with Kenya. It is not  only Norway which gains byinvesting in Kenya. Even Sweden makes a lot  of business out of Kenya.Those people who fought  for  freedom in Kenya did not do so that  that freedom can be played about with.  Those  freedom fighters who have passed away and  those who were maimed during the  colonial times would blame us if we  did not  uphold the principles on which the Independence  of this country was won.  Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir, I am told that the population of Norway is some   about three or four million People which is the average population of aprovince in Kenya.  Therefore, I cannot see how Kenya with a population of 23 million People can be a stooge to  Norway.   Therefore,  let me say that a very  grateful to my colleage,  hon. Member for Kisumu Rural for taking that action. I am  sure this House will continue to support him in any other action he takes to  ensure that Kenya's dignity is maintained. Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I would like to make one point before giving  the Floor to my hon. colleagues,  and this is with regard to the amount of aid that Kenya gets from Norway. Here,  I  think our press is to blame because it  seems to  exaggerate the position without endeavouring to analyse the kind of  assistance we receive from this and other foreign countries. I am saying this because when The Daily Nation writes,  ""Kenya Stands to Lose a One Billion Shillings"". However,  it does not endeavour to inform the Kenyan public  how much of this money is returned to Norway and how much of the money is actually  spent here in Kenya. Since we have  a free Dress,  it is important that  the people writing to the press should write the truth in order to educateour people. In fact, yesterday, I was sort of taken a book when I heardthe hon. Member for Kandunyi  saying that the Projects that that were startedby NORAD in Bungoma and Turkana will now come to standstill.  I would like toassure him that those projects will continue. This is to  show that our dignityis not  for sale. Our sovereignty is worth billions and not  of  shillingsbut of pounds.With those few remarks,  I beg   to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION (Mr.  Ayah):  Thank you, Deputy speaker,  for giving me this opportunity.First of all, I would like to thank my  hon. colleagues for their  in Postponing debate on this Motion from last week to this morning hon my colleagues and I are able to participate on it fully.Recently, I wouldalso like to thank hon. Members for their generous work in andGovernment  of Kenya. I am  sure that hon.  Members are very anxious tomake  their remarks on this Motion and therefore,  I will be very briefin my speech. Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I would first of all like to say that Kenya did not  sever relations with the Government of Norway on the spur of the moment. We did not cut off our relationship with Norway as a matter of emergency; nor did we do  this because of Mr. Koigi  Wamwere or because of the presence of refugees in Norway,  but because of the long-standing behaviour of the  Norwegian  Government towards Kenya Government  over a long period. Iwould like this to be thoroughly understood both by ourselves and others. For many years,  Norway has behaved towards Kenya in a manner that would not be  tolerated by any decent  Government. The basis on which any diplomaticrelationship is established has three cardinal points. One,  is that theGovernment concerned must recognize  the  sovereignty of the other Government. The  second point  is that  the  Government must recognize and respect  the Head of State of  with the  Government with which it wants to  establish relationship and this isvery important. Thirdly,  that  Government must  have total respect  to thePeople of the country with which it  wants to establish relations. If wejudge Norway on those three cardinal points,  then  Norway automatically hasfailed.  I am saying this because for the last  six or so years, Norway hasbeen behaving as if the Kenya Government was not a legally constitutedGovernment.  So,  we have judged them on that card which went towards our  consideration for  severing  diplomatic  relations. Secondly,  when we  judgedNorward  on the basis of their respect  to our  Head of State  His   ExcellencyPresident  Daniel arap Moi, we found that  Norway  was lacking  simple goodmanners. As we  all know,  anybody who lacks  good manners would   committhe worst crime possible. I would like to  support my hon.colleague,hon.Nabwera ; that we must make this point  quite clear, and that  is, we cannot,accept  a situation where a wefugeon the own borders,  and then continue  to allow the and throw insults at head whats ofrepresent.  This is another reason why we did not want to continue our relations with Norway. The  fact  that  there are Kenyan refugees in Norway does not mean that  Kenya is not Politically stable,  but the point here is that when the Norwegian Government allows these refugees to insult the Head of State , then this is tantamount  to total disrespect on part of the Norwegian Government and we cannot allow this to happen.  This is what Norway has been  doing  over a long period. They may  say that  their press is free,  but  ours is also free;  they may  say that whoever is in Norway is free, so are we in Kenya here. What  we in Kenya are saying is that we  are  not going to allow anybody to abuse or insult our President  or any otherhead of state,  with whom we have cordial relations.  Whereas Norway has beendoing this in relation to Kenya,  I do not know whether it has also allowedthese refugees to attack other heads of state. So,  this is what  we consideredas the third and most important point in cutting off our relationswith Norway. Mr.Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  Norway has also taken upon itself to tell Kenyans how they can govern themselves and what kind of future they should have and what kind of institutions they  should have. This is not only objectionable,  but completely unacceptable.  If we  judge  "Norway on the respect it has for the people of this country,  then we must find it  a totalfailure as it has been the case for many years in the past. They havetotally rejected the idea that Kenyans are free and able people who knowwhat to do with themselves. They have been telling us what  to do.,  but ifthey telling  the  truth,  are would not mind,  but  they  are not  telling the  truth. "Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  His  Excellency  the  President has  made  it very  clear  that  Kenya rejected maxism,  communism and other  ""isms""  in  preference to  practical  pragmatic methods  of development.  In  Norway,  we  have  had  maxists running  institutions  of  Government  in  the  last  few years,  and  these  are  the  people to whom  some  dissidents  have  been attached to. These  are  the  same  people  who  havebeen  preaching  to  the  people  of Kenya on  what  institutions  we  should  have. Werefused,  and  we will  continue  to  refuse  that  anybody  in Norway  is  capable  oftelling us  what  to  do  with  ourselves  in  this  country. Those  are  the  three  cardinalpoints  because  of which we  severed  relations  with  Norway. We  will  do  the  samewith  any  other Government that  does not recognise  these three principle  upon which diplomatic  relations  are  established. (Applause) It  is  a very  sad  situation  that  in their efforts  to reintroduce maxist  colonialism  among  us  in  Kenya  and  tell  us  what  to  do  in  latter  day colonialism,  they  have  some  partners  with  some  indecency,  one  of whom,   sadly  to say,   is  the  British  Broadcasting  Corporation (B.B.C.). This  Corporation hasbecome  the  voice  of dissidents,  violent  revolution  and  looking  down  on  Africanseven  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  we  have  some  African  announcers  and  correspondentsin the  B.B.C. The  Africa Service  of  the  B.B.C.  has  become  the voice  of  dissidentsand  a  partner  of  Norway  in  the  last  few  years. The  B.B.C.  is  a forum  open  toanybody  who  wishes  to abuse  Kenya  and Africa. It  is  a partner  of this  Service in  trying to disorientate,  disorganise  and  lead us  towards  violence. It  is  sadthat  we,   in  our  normal  generosity,  we  even  have  given  facilities  in Karen  to  the B.B.C. We  could  easily  make  use  of  these  facilities  in  our  Kenya Broadcasting Corporation  and  Kenya  Television  Network,  but we  have given  them to  the  B.B.C. What  is  there  to  stop  us  from  reconsidering our position? We  are  taking  a  very close  look  to  see  whether we  are not going to  be  judged  as  a party  to  the manouvres  of  the  B.B.C.  in encouraging violence  and revolution  in Africa. The  B.B.C.  has  become  the  voice  of old-style  maxist  indecency  in  this  continent.  The  other partner  in  this  venture  has  been our  very  loose-thinking So-called  intellectuals  in this country.  There  are  people  who have,  without any evidence  whatsoever,  decided that they  are  intellectuals  just because they happen to  have  gone  to  school. It  is  very  indecent  for  an  educated person  to feed a hostile  propaganda machine  like  the  B.B.C.  with  information  about his  country when  he  knows  that  this  information  is  false. It  does  not  matter whether suchintellectuals  are  lawyers,  church people  or otherwise. They  have become partnersof  the  B.B.C.  in  making Africa  look  as  if  it has  no owners. I  want  to  say  that,  for  whatever  reason  one  may  not  like  what  is going on  this  country  or  in  his  own country  in Africa,  it  is  the height of folly to go  down  to  the  level  of becoming a betrayer of his  own  country  just because he  wants  to  analyse  things  intellectually. I  was  recently  in Washington and New York where. I  found that some  of our educated people have totally lost contact with the  realities  of Kenya and Kenyans. These  are  the  people  who have become  partners of Norway  in  an  attempt  to  tell Kenyans what to do with themselves. I  want  tobring  it  to  the  attention of hon.  Members that severing diplomatic relations with Norway had nothing with  the  arrest of Koigi Wamwere,  but,  because the Norwegian Government  did not have  any  respect  for our  institutions, Government and people, it was  able  to  tell us  that we  cannot have a fair court and that we have no decent  lawyers  or  anyway of running this  country. It  is  only  to  that  extentthat  we  must  add one  more  element  in the behaviour of Norway  in connection with the  arrest  of Koigi  Wamwere. In  any  case,  we  would  still  have  severed  theserelations  sooner  or  later. When  you  have  a  diplomatic  representative  actuallygoing  to  a  court  of  law  as  a  youth-winger  in  a  foreign country  and walking in the  corridors  there,  thereby  representing his  Government,  no decent can tolerate this  kind  of  behaviour. Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  course  of  its  arrogance,  the Norwegian  Government  even  told  me  that  the Norwegian  Press  is  following the events  in  Kenya  very  keenly  and  that  our relationship with  Norway will  depend on  how we  treat  Koigi  Wamwere's  case. </Newspeech><Newspeech>HON.

In  fact,  I  am told that there were  cases  of  even Ministers  removing  flags  from  their  cars  so  that  they would not be  recognised. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>HON.  MEMBERS: Shame! Shame! </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  MINISTER. FOR FOREIGN  AFFAIRS  AND-INTERNATIONAL  CO-OPERATION(Mr.  Ayah): It  was  the  very  strong leadership  provided by His  Excellency  thePresident  that has  enabled us  to weather  down  a very  organised attempt  toderail  our  efforts  to  develop  our  own  country. I  want  to  say I  am  sure  I  amsaying  this  on  behalf of all  of  us that  we  must  encourage  and  support ourbeing  together  with  His  Excellency  the  President because  he  has  been the pillarupon which  we  have  been  able  to  weather  down  the  storm  that  has  been  heaped  uponus  and  led  by  a  very-disorganised  Norwegian Government. We  must  realise  that we  have  used  our  Kamba, Luhya  and  Luo  witchcraft  here. Because  Norwegians  wereplaying  around with  us,  their  Government has  fallen  to  show what kind of people we  are. It  is  not  that  we  are  devil-worshippers;  we  just  believe  that  if people do  not  respect  the  truth,  sooner  or  later  they  become  disorganised. Mr. Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I want once more to  thank all hon.  Members for  thier great support for what we have done,  and  I want to promise them this,  that on behalf of His Excellency the president,  on behalf of this House and on behalf of  this  country,  I  shall  take any  steps whenever I find that any government  does  not  respect those three principles. With those few remarks,  I  beg to  support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  MINISTER  OF  STATE,  OFFICE  OF THE PRESDIENT (Mr. Kyalo): Thank youvery  much,  Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir, for giving me an opportunity to support thisMotion. The  issue. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY  SPEAKER: Order,  hon.  Kyalo. Order. I  do  recognise  thefact  that many hon.  Members wish  to contribute to this Motion, So,  I will kindly plead  that  those  on  the Floor take as  short  time  as possible to allow other hon. Members  to  speak. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  MINISTER  OF  STATE,  OFFICE  OF  THE PRESIDENT  (Mr.  Kyalo):  Mr.   Deputy Speaker,  Sir,   the  issue  here  is much more  than that of breaking diplomatic norms. To  me,  the  issue  is  that  of undermining  the  policies  and  principles upon which this  country  is  governed  and run. If you  look  at  it,   this country has refused to  recognise that Kenya is  a sovereign  state  and  that Kenya cannot compromise on  the  question  of  its  sovereignty. It  has  even gone  to  the  extent of sayingthat  we  should  be governed  in a particular way. The fact  that  somebody  goes  tothe  court  of  a  sovereign  state,  and  a diplomat at  that,  shows that that country is  not  respecting  the  sovereignty  of  this  country.  I  am  glad  that His  Excellency the  President  has  stood  firm  in  his  utterances regarding  the defence of  the  principles  and  policies  upon which  this  country  is  governed. For  that  reason, we would  like  to  point  out to  the Norwegian Government  that  the  sovereignty of this  country  cannot  be  neotiated  and  cannot  be  a subject of discussion. Mr.Deputy  Speaker,  Sir, ere  has  been  the  question  of how  this countryshould  be  governed. They have been speaking of multi-parties  and  other  things have  to  rethink.  What  Norway  should  be  told  is  that  since  Independence we decided  that Kenya  should  do  away  with  tribal  parties  and  other  divisive  elements that  do  not encourage  the  unity  of  this  country. For  that  reason, I  would  like to  refer  and mention what has  happened  to  other countries,  particularly  the wars that  are  going  on  in  Africa. Those wars  are  being  fought on  tribal  basis. Take any  country  in  Africa,  whether Liberia or any  other,  arid you will  see  that all those  wars  are  being  fought on tribal  basis. What  this  country  is  standing  for is  to  ensure that we  do not  fall  victim  to  things  that are happening elsewhere in  Africa. Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  they  have  talked of democracies  and  that Kenya must  be democratic. The  question  that has  to  be  asked  is  this: Has  anybody  evercounted how many  countries  in Africa are ruled by  the army? We  are  among  thefew  African countries that have  elected  parliaments. The  majority  of Africancountries-are governed  by the army. The  question  that  should  be  asked of acountry  like Norway  is how it encourages the few countries that are having democratic  institutions  to continue so  that they  can be examples  to others. When you  look  at  it,  most of the African countries  are run by the army and nobody talks about  it.  Does  it  mean  that what  these  countries want  is  to have Kenya ruled by  the  army?  Why  are  they not encouraging Kenya to continue  the  system that is existing  for  the  interest of democracy? These  are  the contradictions  that  are difficult  to understand,  and whether people are saying it for the good of any country  is  very  difficult for people to understand. Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  one  of the  principles upon which we base our policies  is  that of  if we get aid no strings should be attached to that aid. We  are  now being told that unless we open up and unless we do certain things the aid  will  have  strings attached to  it. What I  would  like  to point out  is  that we, in  this  country,  stand firm on our  policy that if we accept aid no strings should  be  attached  to that aid and that the aid should be governed by mutual respect.   When Norway says that they are out off aid because of some imaginary  reasons,  are  they not trying to flout our policies regarding aid wherewe have said that no strings should be attached to aid? We  stand  on  defence ofdemocracy and defence of our people's right to live peacefully. When we  do  that,somebody  gets up  and  says that we  should be more democratic and that we shouldnot defend  our  stand on ensuring that the people of this country live peacefully. If  some  country  encourages some people and refugees to create a situation wherebythe peace  and  stability of this  country  is  interfered with,  then it means thatthat  country  is  not respecting us.With  those  few remarks, Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I  beg to support the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

MAHIHU: Thank you  very much,  Mr.  Deputy  Speaker. I  would  liketo continue  and  make  my  brief comments  regarding this Motion. I  join  other hon.Members  who have  clearly  stated  that Kenya's  position cannot be compromised. Kenya's  sovereignty  cannot be  compromised. Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  let  Kenyans take  this  opportunity to  consolidate their efforts  and  their loyalty to His Excellency the President.   Let us take  this  chance  to  consolidate  our loyalty to  our party,  Kanu;  let us  take  this  opportunity to take sure  that  in future,  if we  do not  get  aid as has  been suggested,  we can  stand  on  our  own. I  would  like  to  suggest  that  those  officers of  the  Government  who  go  to negotiate  aid  should  be advised to be very careful. They  should  not  sign aid  agreements which havestrings. No  aid  can  come  without  Government  officers having togo to  the  donor  country to negotiate  with the  donor  Government. Weare  saying that  aid  should  be  given without  strings.  I am therefore suggesting that  our  Government  officers  who  go  to negotiate  Projects should  be  very  careful. Officers  from the  Office  of the  Vice-President  and Ministry  of  Finance  and  officers  fromAttorney-General's  Chambers  who  are  responsible  for  signing loan agreements  and projects should  be careful  in order to ensure  that this  country will  not  be  blackmailed  in  future. Mr.Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  we  should now, as  a nation;  intensify  our  efforts  to  produce  more food. We must  produceenbugh food  for  ourselves  and  for  export  so that we  can  earn foreign exchange. We should  be  able  to  intensify production of coffee,  tea,  wheat,  tea end horticultural  crops. We should be able to expand  our industries;  we  should be able to expand ourhounismso as to earn more foreign exchange.

It is very surprising that	. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Mr. Mahihu, the only littleproblem is that that course of argument you are taking is.

I just want to caution you because other hon. members who have spoken have not touched on that one. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. MAHIHU: Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.

It is important that we go on supporting His Excellency the President and the Party. We should guard Kenya's freedom. This is a responsibility of every one; it is the responsi¬bility of every Kenyan to make sure that civil servants in various Ministries are on the look-out for those who want to subvert this country. The element of subersion must be eliminated.Let me also congratulate our police force and other security forces for capturing these people who had smuggled arms into this country.

I  spoke  here  about  this  in  1986;  that money was  spent badly  everybody in that  programme  had a Mercedes Benz Car  and a lorry.  Now,  Norway is  talking about having given  Kenya Shs.l billion  and yet here technicians,  or engineers,  used the money to buy things for themselves and pay the selves well. I  want  to congratulate  his  Excellency the  President  for having said during his  Kenyatta Day Address that  no  foreign lawyer  will  be  allowed  to come  to  Kenya. I  am told by somebody that the former Norwegian ambassadour, his  children and wife cried because  they wanted to  stay in Kenya. It  is important  to  note  that  this  ambassador went to  court with Mr.  Shamalla. If  you are  an  ambassadour,  and unless you  are a criminal, you cannot go to the High court of Kenya. </Newspeech>- <Newspeech>MR.DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

It  should be known loud and clearthat  those   who behave like the Norwegian Government,  will also be sentpacking. Since the  Scandinavian countries did not  colonize any country,that  is why they are doing what they are doing now. The Norwegian Governmentshould know that Kenya is an Independent country and that we do not need outsiders to interfere with our affairs. The  aid we receive is not much and a large percentage of it goes back to their country.  We do not want to hear about them anymore. We  support the Minister for the action he took   against the Norwegian Ambassador. We cherish our independence and our freedom. We do not owe apologies to any country for the action we took. Some of the countries  which want us to adopt multi-party Politics do not themselves Practice this system. Kenya is one country that is loved and respected. Thank  you,Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.DEPUTY SPEAKER: I will now call  upon hon. Wabuge to reply. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.WABUGE:   Sir, I have no enough, time to reply but I will makeone  thing clear. This country ,is for peace and our President should be support.at  all costs even if it means us dying to preserve peace. We shall all rallybehind the President in fighting the so-called diplomatic war which is beingwalked against Kenya.I beg to move. </Newspeech>(Question put and agreed to) <Header> ADJOURNMENT</Header> <Newspeech>DR.

Now, if  it  is yourwish  to  withdraw  the  Question suppose I  will give you the Floor to make the application. </Newspeech>Question  No. 513<Header> Payment  of  Mr.  Chebogy's  G.M.R.

Claim,  No. 26.0139/7,  amounting  to Ksh.6,375/- since the claim was approved by the  Central  Agricultural  Board. <Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT  MINISTER  FOR  AGRICULTURE (Mr.Ngaruro): Mr.Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,   I  beg  to  reply.There was  no  lobbying  at  all. This  Question  was  asked  lastyear  and my  Ministry  answered  it  in May, 1989. I  wish  to confirm,  onceagain,  that Mr.  Chebogy's  G.M.R.  Claim  of Kshs.6,375/- which  was  approvedby  the  Central  Agricultural  Board  was  settled on March 15th, 1979  andhe was  adviced  accordingly  vide AFC  schedule No. 344/77. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  arap  CHEPKOK; Mr.  Deputy  speaker,  Sir,  as  far  as  I  amconcerdnd,  Mr.  Chebogy  has never taken any other loan. That  is  why  Iwas  saying  that we  had agreed with  the Assistant Minister that he  should go  and  recheck  properly  in his  office about the  loan. This  is  becauseI  now Mr.Chebogy has never taken  any other  loan apart from the first  loan  that he took  and which he has  already  repaid. This  is  why  I  had  requested  the Assistant  Minister  to  sit down with me  so that we can gothorugh  the  previous  recors. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  NGARURO: Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  actually,  Mr.  Chebogyapplied  for  a loan  in 1983  and  he was  given  this 1oan and  I  am  preparedto  lay  on  the  table  the  application  form  and  the  loan  approval  form forthe perusal  of  the House. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  DEPUTY  SPEAKER: What  is your  problem  now,  Mr.  arap Chepkok? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  arap  CHEPKOK: Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  even  if  the  AssistantMinister  lays  the  papers  on  the Table  that does  not mean  that Mr.  Chebogy has  applied  for  the  loan  because somebody  else can  apply  on his  name, or  it might be  a different person because we have very  many  people  who share  the name Chebogy. That  is  why  I  am  telling  him  that  it  is  better for  us  both  to  go  back  to  the  office  to  peruse  the previous  records  because I  cannot believe what he  is  telling  the House. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MUTUA: The  hon.  Questioner  should  not  take  the  House  fora ride. If he  is not sure he  should  not  bring  the Question here.

I  am  not  taking the House for a ride. What  I  am  saying  is  that  since my argument  and  that of the Ministry  is not the same we should review this batter,  I  am  saying  so because even  if the  Assistant Minister lays  those papers  on  the Table he  cannot  be correct because  there  are very many people,  these days  who  apply  for  loans  using other  peoples names. That is  why  I  am  saying  that unless. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY  SPEAKER: Mr.  arap  Chepkok,  I  will  give you  timeto  put  supplementary  questions  and  not  to come up with  an arrangement of  some sort.  It  is  time  for  supplementary  questions  and can you please put  one? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  FALANA:  On  a point of order,  Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir. I  fail  to  Understand why  hon.  arap Chepkok  is making all  this  fuss because three minutes ago,  he was of the opinion that he should withdraw this Question  and  have a private discussion with the Assistant Minister on this  matter. Mowever , you have ruled that he should  go ahead  and  ask the  Question. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  arap  CHEPKOK:  Mr.Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I  do not think my  fellow  friends  are not understanding what  I  am  saying.  We met with  the Assistant Minister himself and he  told me  that we better leave this Question out and  persue  the old  records  first. That  is why  I  disagree with  the Assistant Minsiter  when  he says  he will  lay  papers  on  the Table  to  prove his  case. The  point  is  that  Mr.  Chebogy  has  never had  any  other  loan apart  from  the  first one. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE  DEPUTY  SPEAKER: That  means  that you are not  putting anysupplementary  question? is  that understanding correct? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  arap  CHEPKOK: Yes,  Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  NGARURO: I  would  like  to  clarify  one  or  two  points. Infact,  I  did  answer  a very similar Question  regarding  the  G.M.R  Claimfor  this  particular  gentleman. I  have got  a  copy  of  the  "HANDARD"  herewhich confirms that  the G.M.R.Ciaim  was  actually  settled  against a loanhe  had  taken  in  1977.  In  1983  Mr.  Chebogy  came  in  and  asked  for  a further loan  of Kshs.25,000/= which was granted  by  the AFC.  If  this  is  not  the same Mr.  Chebogy,   I  am  prepared  and  I  have  asked  the  hon.

FALANA: Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to ask the Minister of State,  Office of the President, the following Question by Private Notice. Could the Minister   institute urgent scrutiny of all foreigners in Narsaoit District with a view to repatriating illegal immigrants? </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>THE MINISTER OF STATE,  OFFICE OF TEE PRESIDENT (Mr.Nabwera): Mr.  Deputy   Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to reply. The exercise of scrutinizing all  foreigners in Marsabit  District and, indeed, the entire country, is a continuous function of theGoverment through the  established organs. All Foreigners who haveentered Marsabit District have so far been scrutinised and appropriateaction is being-taken. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.FALANA: I asked this Question for  specific reasons. Is theMinister aware that there are foreigners who have overtaken Kenyans in business? As the President rightly put it, Kenya is for Kenyans and not for foreigners.  Is the Minister aware that there are foreigners exploiting Kenyans in Marsabit town? </Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR. NABWERA: Sir, that is a different question. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  FALANA: Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir, with due respect to theMinister, I think that question is relevant and he should not evade it.Can he please respond to it? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.NABWERA: Sir, The Question I am replying to read as follows."Could the Minister institute urgent scrutiny of all foreigners in Marsabit District with a view to repatriating illegal immigrants?"I have replied to that Question firmly to the effect that the exercise of scrutiny is complete and appropriate action is being taken. The questionI am now being asked is about foreigners engaging in business. That is whyI said that it is a different question. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIILU: On a point of order, Sir. Could the Minister give us the number of foreigners in that district? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Sir, I cannot give the exact number of people but theones we have completed scrutinising were 648. <Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I suppose that number is familiar, Mr. Falana. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: Yes, Sir, but I think the Minister is misleading this House. The figure of 643 is with regard to the current Ethiopian refugees whom I had requested the Government to move from Marsabit. The issue here is with regard to foreigners and not refugees. These foreigners have over ¬taken Kenyans in business and in all aspects of life. The Minister has said that the scrutiny of foreigners was completed in Marsabit. If that is the case, how many foreigners were found to be living in Marsabit illegally, how many had been repatriated and how many were taken to court? He should tell us the nature of the scrutiny and  what  he did. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.NABWERA:. Six, I know why the hon. Member is getting  himself  worked up. Our laws are very clear. We have very many foreigners living in Kenya; some of them are working or doing business legitimately provided that they have work permits and allowed to live legally, with regard to Marsabit District, we are talking about illegal foreigners. That is why I said that if there are foreigners in Marsabit doing business under permit, then they are doing so legally. That is why I said that that was a different question. If the hon. Member  wants me to give him the number of non-citizens in Marsabit District, he should forward  that question and I will reply to it. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR; Can the Minister tell us how many foreigners have been repatriated to </Newspeech>   C...3 31.10.90<Newspeech>MR.  NABWERA: The  ones that arrived are referred to</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR.  KLILU: On a point  of order,  Sir. Was the gesture  made bythe hon.  Member Parliamentary? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.DEPUTY SPEAKER: You, see,  hon.  Ekidor did not utter  a word.He just made  a gesture. Therefore, there  is no way of telling whetherthat was unparliamentary language   or not. I  suppose he meant meanderingwhich is equally unparliamentary. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.NABWERA: I  said that there are  foreigners living legally in almostevery district  in Kenya. The  people that we were  talking about   are illegalforeigners.  If these  are the people  that hon.  Falana had in mind,  then  they number 648 and  the bona fide men refugees have been moved to refugee camps elsewhere  in the  country.  The  children and women are  the  subject  of another question which was answered by my colleague, hon.  Lalampaa. </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR.  FALANA: As you correctly  said,  Sir,  the figure 648  is quite familiar now and the Minister should not keep on referring to  it; What I  am talking about are refugees or  foreigners who have  settled in Marsabit District illegally. We  are not  concerned about  legal  foreigners with work permits. We have  illegal  foreigners who have overtaken the wananchi even in Politics. This is my concern. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.NABWERA: Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not aware ofany other foreigners who have settled in Marsabit illegally</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA:Mr. Deputy Speaker. Sir, I will soon walk over to the Minister and make him aware. Will he tell us the action that he will  take after I have made his aware? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.NABWERA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, any foreigners who are in Kenya illegally are taken to court, tried, sentenced and repatriated. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Sacking of Workers by M/s  Haramayn  industries Limited  (MR.

MAKHANU: Mr. Deputy Speaker Speaker, Sir, I beg toask the Minister for Culture and Social Services the following Question by Private Notice.(a) When is the Minister going to fulfill his promiseto order for the elections of Kenya football federation to replace the Caretaker Committee now that the 1930 soccer season is over.(c)	What are the results of the Committee set up in 1989 on financial and administrative mismanagement by the suspended K.F.F. officials? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT MINISTER  FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mrs.Ogot): Mr.   Deputy  Speaker, Sir,   I  beg  to  reply.(a ) The   Caretaker  Committee  was   appointed   last  year  withspecific   reference   as follows:- 1.2.3.4. To  imProve  the  quality  of  football game;To   improve   the financial  management   and   accountancyof  the  federation;To   improve   the   standard   of  refereeing  in   soccer; andTo   organise   and  promote   youth   football   in  the   country.  The   Caretaker   is   doing  a  commendable   job  on   the specific  references given  to  it  as  set  out  above. The first complete  league  season managed by the  present Caretaker   Committee  ended   just   last  week. The   Ministry  will  usethe   completed  league   as   a  yard   stick  for   analysing  and  evaluation               task. It  is  after  this  that  the Ministry  will  respond   to   theMinister's  Press   statement  released  on 22nd  March, 1990   whichindicated  that  as  soon as  it  is  practical the Commissioner for sports and the Kenya National Sports council will be  called upon to hold elections so   thatduly elected committee, which is answerable to the public, isestablished and  commences   its  work.We  are  now moving towards that direction and steadyprogress   is   being  made. It   is  our  hope   that   this  will  not   take   along  time.(b) The Ministry  has   already  received  the  report  of  thecommittee which was  set up in 1989 to look into financial andadministrative  mismanagement   by  the   suspended K.F.F.officials.          The  Ministry  found  it  fair  to  give  individuals  members of thedisolved Committee   a   chance   to   give   their   side   of the story  and to clear   themselves where they may have been negatively mentioned It  is  in response  to  the  Ministry's  gesture  that  the  former  K.F.F. Chairman has  already given his  defence  in his  letter dated 28th March, 1990. The Kenya National  Sports Council will meet  on8th November, 1990, to  discuss  the report. At  this  same  meeting,the  council will also  fix the  date  on which to call the dissolved KFF  committee  members  to  appear before  the council.  After  these two  mentioned meetings,  we  expect  to release  the  final  report sometime  before  December, 1990. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MAKHANU: Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  while  thankingthe  hon.  Assistant  Minister  for her reply  she  has  given  the reasons for  setting up the  Caretaker Committee, I  was wondering whether  she  is  convinced that  this  committee  has really improved the  standard  of football in this  country.I  have  everyreason  to  believe  that  the  Caretaker  Committee has been an  hindrance  in the  development  of the  quality of football  in the country. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MRS.OGOT: Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, I kindly ask thehon.  Member  to repeat  the  question because  I did not hear it. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr.Makhanu, can you, perhaps, use the microphone? <./Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.MAKHANU: Mr.Deputy Speaker.  Sir,  I  have thankedthe hon. Assistant Minister  for her reply.  But  I was  wonderingwhether  as  a Minister  in  charge  of  sports,  particularly football which is  the  most  popular  sport  in this  country.  she  is  convinced that  the  Caretaker  Committee  has really improved the quality of that game  in  this  country. I  have  reasons  to  say that  the  committee has  been an hindrance  in  the  development  of quality for this country. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MRS.OGOT: Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I  think that theCaretaker Committee  has  done  more  for  footaball  in this  country than for  anything else. I have  examples to  illutrate  this  Point.   Since  this  committee  was  appointed, I has been able to organize quite  a number  of  sponsors  to  assist  in football and improve the  game. The hon. Member will  remember, that  among  the sponsors, who have helped  in the  development  of football,  have  been Bata Shoe  Company,  The Standard Newspapers, who are represented here and the Mational Panasoni Company. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mrs, Ogot,  did  you say The  Standard Newspapers  are represented here? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS.OGAT:Mr.Deputy Speaker,  I  apologise  for that;I justmeant that they have reporters in  the press gallery. As  far  as  programmes  are  concerned,  this year  the  CaretakerCommittee  managed  for  the  first  time to  complete  the  football league  in very good  time. That  shows  that  they have  interest  inthe game. Further,  this was  the  first  time  that  the Myayo GoldenCup was  Played  on the  same  day Myayo Day because  of the goodorganisation of  the  committee. Again,  the  young  footballers,  knownas the  Nyayo  Stars,  which is really the  brainchild of the CaretakerCommittee, have  done  so well  that this year they  even beatA7C  Leopards the  giants. This  shows  that  the committee has donea commendable  job. As  for gate  collections there has been eatimprovement  for  those parties  playing at  the Myayo NationalStadium and elsewhere. This  shows  clearly that  the Committee  hasput  a lot of effort  into its work. The  Division  Two  too League  too has been very well reorganised  throughtout the Republic, The referees courses haveheld;  there  has been improvement  in refereeing and fewer havebeen  going for  appeal.  Therefore,  considering that the Caretaker Committee was appointed only last year,  I  feel that  the  hearts  of the  Caretaker  Committee  members  are  in  the  football. I am sure  they on  their way to  improving football in the  country if we  can give them a chance. </Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI:  Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I  do  agree  with the hon.  Assistant Minister  that  the Caretaker Committee  has  done  a good  job.  But  I  do  have  a small quarrel with the  organsiation  and Promotion of youth  soccer and  other  sporting activities at the  grassroot  level,  where  the majority of our youth live and needsupport  from the  Ministry. I wonder what the  Ministry is  doing to  support  financially and materially football,  volleyball,  netballand darts  at  the  grassroot  level throughout  the  country! Can  the Assistant Minister  assure  that  they are  doing something? I havemany  sports  youths  in my constituency who  need the  support  of  the Ministry. Yhank you,Sir. </Newspeech>    <Newspeech>MRS. OGOT: Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir,  I appreciate the concernof Dr.  Misoi, but I would like to inform him that with the reorganization of Division II League,  things are now going to be different. I am saying this because Division II League is a grassroot league starting from divisions, and onto districts and provinces If extra funds are made available to my Ministry, we shall endeavour to assist these activities right to the divisional level. Therefore, I would welcome  Dr. Misoi to the Ministry or directly to the caretaker committee so that he can share with us regarding certain areas where we could perhaps make  some improvement. We are quite grateful  to hon. Dr.Misoi for this suggestion and we shall our very best to make sure that we tapthe grassroot  footballers and other players. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.KIILU: Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  could the  Assistant Ministertell  the House how this caretaker committee was appointed and how lore it  should be in operation before another one is appointed? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MRS. OGOT: Mr. Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  the appointment of the caretaker committee was done  last year.  Hon. Member would recall that at that time there were certain difficulties in streamlining and running football. There were  also a lot  of squabbles and accusations of mismanagement of funds and the Ministry felt obliged to  assist in  giving advice regarding the appointment  of a caretaker committee.  This caretaker committee was given  three years within wiich they were to complete their work.  They were also supposed to  prepare for the elections of the Kenya Football Federation and I am pleased to note that within a very  short  time,  they were able to do a commendable job and there may not be any necessity for them to carry on until the completion of the three years duration. That being the case. I feel that time is ripe, as I had indicated before,  for another caretaker committee to be appointed. There will be meeting on 8th November and I would appeal to the hon. Memberto  be more patient and wait for the outcome thismeeting. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MOMANYI: Mr.Deputy Speaker , Sir, recently, the Kenyateam went to Cairo and after running by 400 metres relay, they were disqualified. </Newspeech><Newspeech>FALANA:  On a point of order, Mr.  Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the hon. Assistant Minister is making a lot of effort to answer supplementary questions from hon. Members despite the obvious difficulties she is finding in  standing up every time she is asked a question due to her limping leg. Do you, Mr. Deputy Speaker,  not think that hon. Members are being somewhat unfair to her by asking,  too many  supplementary questions? She has been tremendous effort in standing um and I think hon. Members should try and be considerate. </Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR.DEPUTY SPEAKER: Nevertheless,  I think hon. Mrs. Ogot was on her way to answer the supplementary question from hon.Momanyi. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mrs.  Ogot): Mr.  Deputy Speaker, Sir,  I did not hear hon. Momanyi's question and I would like to answer it. Could he kindly repeat  it? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.DEPUTY SPEAKER:  What is it that you said,  Mr.Momanyi? Could we hear you repeating it? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.MOMANYI:  Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir, recently the Kenya athletic team went to  Cairo and competed in 4 by  400 metres relay,  it was disqualified after winning,  could we be told what was the cause of this? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. OGOT:  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are discussing footballand Kenya Football Federation and if hon. Momanyi  cared to bring thatas a  separate question,  I would be prepared to answer him. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.DEPUTY SPEAKER : I am in total agreement with your,  Mrs. Ogot,that  is a totally question. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU:  Mr.DeputySpeaker,  Sir, I  do not know under what rule the Kenya Football Federation caretaker committee was appointed. Iam  saying this because the  A.F.C. Leopards,  were cut on a continental assignment  and within a period of seven or eight days, they are not supposed to play local soccer but a situation arose where they were required  to play two matches in Eldoret a day before they proceeded for their continental assignment.Why was this rule broken. </Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MRS.OGOT:  That  is a very good supplementary question, but unfortunately,  I do not have an answer for it. Perhaps he would care to go to the caretaker committee offices and I am sure he would get a good reply. </Newspeech>POINTS OF ORDER <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS HOUSING (Mr.  Mutiso):  On apoint  of order,  Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  Two weeks ago,  while answering a question No.403 by hon.

I  would  like  to  state  what  allhon.  Members  know. We  are  living  in  a  fast-moving  world,  and  it  is  not  theintention  of  the  people  of  Kenya and the  Nyayo  Government  to be  left  behind. Oneof the  chief  preoccupations  of  the  Government  and,  in particular,  His  Excellency the  President  is  finding ways  and means  of solving the difficult problem we have not  only  in  this  country,  but  also  in  the  whole  world,  of unemployment. Thisproblem  ought  to  be  the  concern  of all  of us. It  is  actions,  rather  than words,that  is  going  to  help  in  sorting  out  this  problem. This, being  a  Governmentof action,  has  taken  the  first  few steps  towards  this goal. One  of  the  verynovel  ideas  that  the  Government has come  up with  is  export  processing zones. Firstly,  however,  what  are  expert processing  zones?  Briefly, these  are  industrial  areas  the  purpose  of which  is  to manufacture  goods  purely  for export. The  advantage  of a manufacturer producing goods  in  an  export procesing  zone  is  that,  firstly,  he  will  be able  to  import all  his machinery 100  per  cent  free  of duty and  value  added  tax. The  second  advantage  is  that he  will  be  able  to  import  all  his  raw materials  free  of tax,  duty  and value added  tax. He  will  also  enjoy  a relatively easy  tax climate. He  will  have  anincome  tax  "holiday"  for 10  good  years.During his  delivery  of  the  Budget  Speech,  His  Excellency  the Vice-President  and Minister  for Finance referred to  the  establishment of export processing  zones  for  the  purpose  of attracting foreign  investment.  To  achieve this  objective,  we  have  to  create  an  export processing zones  authority  from which  the  benefits  to  be  derived  include  the generation of employment  in the short  term. In  the  long  term,  the  country will benefit from the  transfer of management  and technical  know-how as well  as  foreign  exchange  earnings  and domestic  linkages  with  the  economy.  The  purpose  of the  intended export processing  zones  authority  as  provided for in the  Bill  is  the  development of all -aspects  of the  export processing zones,  with particular emphasis on the provision of  advice  on  the  removal  of impediments  to and the-creation of incentives for export-oriented  production  in  areas designated export processing zones and the regulation  and administration  of approved activities within  these  zones through implementation  of an  administration system in which the export processing zones enterprise  is  self-regulatory  to  the maximum extent. The  authority  will  also be responsible  for  the  protection  of Government revenues  and  foreign currency earnings,  and  the  implementation of policies  and  programmes  of the Government with  regard  to  the  development  of export processing  zones. It  will  also  be charged with  identifying and  mapping c. areas  to be  designated  export processing zones. The  said  authority  will  be  expected to  plan  the  development and maintenance  finance  the  basic  infrastructure  up  the  perimeter  of the export  processing  zones. It  will  also  examine  and  process  applications  for  designationof  export processing  zones  and  issue  relevant approyals. It  will  promote  exportprocessing  zones  among  investors  and  act  as  a one-stop  centre  through which the export  processing  zones  enterprise  can  channel  all  applications  for permits  and facilities  not  handled  directly  by  the  authority. As  I  said,  some  of  the  incentives  offered  in  this  enterprise  include exemption  from  registration  under  the  Value  Added  Tax  Act  of  1989,  payment  of excise  duty  as  specified  in  the  Customs  and Excise  Act  and  the  Income  Tax  Act during  the  tax  "holiday"  period of  10 years. The  other  advantage  to  the industrialist  will  be  exemption  from  exchange  control  on  certain  payments. Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  relevant  ,amendments will be  made  to the  Customs  and  Excise  Act  to  facilitate  as well as to control  the  activities  of the  Export Processing Zones. To  start with,  these  Zones will be  in three designated areas  in the Industrial Area  in Nairobi,  Athi  River and  in Mombasa.  I do hope that hon. Members  will  acknowledge the  significance  of this Bill and that they will  have  no  difficulties  in supporting it. With those  few words,  I beg to move. </Newspeech> "  <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS(Mr.Mibei): Mr.Deputy Speaker Speaker,  Sir,  I rise  to  second this Bill. The  passing  of  this  Bill Will  auger well  for the  economic  activities inthis  country. The  establishment  of Export Processing  Zones  is awonderful  idea.  This move  will  create  employment. I  say  this  becausethe  problem of unemployment  has hit us very hard. I think it  was awise move  to  establish these  processing  zones. I  have  not  heard  ofmany countries in Africa which have established export processingzones.  I think this is a sign of maturity in our country. I would therefore  appea1  to the  Ministry concerned to  see  to it that when these  export  processing zones have  been established  in Nairobi,  Athi River  and  in should  also  be  consideration  of extendingand  spreading them to  other parts  of the country. It  is  thereforenecessary to  have  an Authority which will  oversee the  operations of these  export  processing  zones  so that  they will be  able  to  plan the new sites  and  locations  of  other  export  processing zones. After the  establishment  of these  export  processing zones;  we  shall have   created  incentives to foreign investors and by doing we  hope  to  get  some foreign currency earnings. It is important what there should be an Authority to over these.  Mr.Dep uty  Speaker,  Sir,  when these  three  export  processing zones  have  been started  there will be  more  commercial investment agencies who will like  to  start  building some  commercial  enterprises  in this  country. Therefore  there  is  need  for the creation of  an Authority to process  and  issue licences  for commercial investment  agencies to  start their  operations  in this country. Mr.Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I think the  Mover has  summarised the  contents  of the  Bill  and  I do not need to repeat what he has said. What  is  important  to note here  is  that  this  is  an export  oriented, manufacturing and  commercial undertaking. We  are  proud  that we  get knowledge  from different  parts  of the world  and that  we  choose  those commercial undertakings that will promote the  creation of jobs  in this  country. One  of them is what  is before  us  today.  With  those  few remarks  I beg to  second. </Newspeech>(Question proposed)  <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr.K’ombudo): Thank you very much,  Deputy  Speaker, Sir,  for  giving, me  this  opportunity to  say a  few words in  support  of this Bill. First I would like  to  say that  this  is  a verywelcome  move  on the  part  of the  Government. It  is a move  that  willbenefit  the  economic  and  therefore  the  people  of this  country. I   alsowish to  congratulate  the Assistant Minister  for the  manner  inwhich he  has  moved  the  Bill. The  problem facing Kenya  at  the  moment is  an economic  problem although others would want to divert our attentionattention to  matters  political.  But  our major problem which we should  concentrate  in finding solution for is an economic problem.  The  introduction of this Bill is one    necessary for the acquisition of  the much needed imports is scarce. It is hoped that this move of creating export processing zones will promote the availability of foreign exchange.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would urge those who will, in the end, be responsible for the implementation of this project to be on their guard because there will be some unscrupulous business people who would want take advantage each time they see an opportunity to do so. The officers concerned should enforce the provisions of the Act and the rules thereunder stringently. If these rules are not enforced stringently even the benefits which we hope to reap from the passage, of this Bill will not be there, I would like to appeal again to those who will be concerned with, the implementation of the Act when it is finally passed, to seize the opportunity to encourage the participation of indigenous African, people so that our people can also take advantage of the lucrative international trade. So, wherever possible there should be  relaxation in certain aspects to enable the indigenous people to take part in these ventures. It will a very sorry state of affairs if all that we can see in the export processing zones are expatriates. We would like to see our people participate effectively there too.The business people who will be participating in these ventures should take note of the fact that at the moment the cost of Kenyan goods internationally is too high. The money cost of the goods we manufacture is too high and therefore we cannot effectively compete with manufacturers in other nations. They  should  try  as  much as  possible  to make our merchandise  sellable abroad. Ido not know why  goods manufactured locally  in Kenya should be as costly as they appear  to  be  today.  Labour  cost  in  this  country  is  quite  cheap compared  to Europe, America or  even  in Asia,  and yet  the cost of  the goods we manufacture  is  so high even  in the  local  markets. Sometimes  imported  goods  are cheaper  than the  locallymanufactured  ones. One  wonders why  this  should be  so  since we have  the rawmaterials  and  cheap  labour  available. The Ministers  in  charge  of  commerce  andindustry  should  look  into  this  matter. They  can  even  hold  seminars  with  manufacturers  because  if we  continue this way  we  cannot garner enough  foreign exhange. Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  this  explains  the rising level  of unemployment.  We  cannot  sell  enough  in  the  international  market  and,  therefore, our  factories  cannot  expand  and  create jobs. We  should  look  into  this  mater  very carefully. Sir,  one  thing  that  tends  to hinder  the export of goods and services in  this  country  is the  maritime  transport. When  it  comes  to  horticultural  products,we  cannot  afford  enough  airfreight  space  for  our  farmers. If  it  is  manufactured goods,   the  availability  of transport  and  the  cost  of  that  transport  is  not  readily available  to  the  manufacturers. The  Kenya  National  Shipping  Line  should  be  more active  than  it  is  at  the  moment. They  should  pull  up  their  socks. Let  us  findways  and  means  of  putting  our  own  ships  in  the ocean. They  have  done  very  wellin  the  air  business;  Kenya  Airways  is  doing  a good  job. But  we  are  hampered  inthe  ocean  transport. The  shipping  line  which  was  created  a  few years  ago  shouldbe  active  if we  are going  to  get, anywhere. We  should  aim  at  transporting  threequarters  of  our  crude oil  by our own  ships. We  can  borrow money  to  acquire  ships.International  business  is  there  and  I  think  if they  apply  themselves well  enough they  will  make  it. That  is  my  appeal.With  those  few  comments,  Mr. Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,   I  beg tosupport  the  Bill. </Newspeech><Header>QUORUM</Header><Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Sir. May I point out that we have no quorum.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Well, it is true. Ring the Division Bell.</Newspeech>(The Division Bell was rung) /Mr. Deputy Speaker left the Chiar/ /The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mureithi) took the Chair/<Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mureithi): Order, hon. Members. We have a quorum now.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Dr. Wekesa): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I stand to support this Bill on the establishment of export processing zones in Kenya.Sir, this is not a new concept because we have several other countries that have very successfully established export processing zones. I can quote, for example, the case of Mauritius where they have been able to overturn their unemployment problem into a situation where they are now short of labour due to the kind of success they have been able to achieve in establishing export processing zones.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are two major things which all leaders need to take very seriously with regard to the economy of this country. The first one is that we should successfully be able to reduce the rate of our population growth to figures below three per cent. We expect this to be able to happen as the economy expands. The next one is in the industrial front where we must orientate all our industries to manufacture for export.This is a lot more difficult, because of the "bulk of is port substitutionindustries that were oriented towards the domestic market. The establishment cthe export processing zone is a first step to establish in Kenya, industries thatwill be export oriented, competitive worldwide and generate foreignexchange earnings which will be utilised in the process. As of now, theindustrial sector is consuming most of the foreign exchange produced andsupplied by agriculture. It, therefore,  becomes urgent that we shouldestablish an export processing zone and bring into operation a set of incentivesthat would enable international investors Kenyans as well  to utilise thefacilities in the zone so that they manufacture for export.As of now, most of the organs and instruments in the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) are taking shape and it will be possible for the PTA to be one market for most manufactured goods in the region. In fact, as we thin ahead, you will find that as apartheid is eliminated in South Africa,the Republic is going to be a major competitor in the manufacture of goods for expert in the PTA.I would like to consent on the issue of import liberalisation. As far as the domestic economy is concerned, we want to ensure  ether than industries that will be in the export processing zone  that industries manufacturing for the domestic market are equally competitive. Most of them are not because in a way, they have been overprotected for a long time. I want to dispel the impression that our import liberalisation pro¬gramme will be such that we are going to kill local industries. There is no way that we would do so. We would only give the amount of protection necessary for the period that is necessary for an industry to mature enough and to be competitive sufficiently. We would be able to luck into other ways to introduce competition in our economy without causing the damage that a lot of people fear at present.So far, the kind of incentives we should give to industryby way of cash, is not possible because the Government budget is equallyconstrained, we have the tendency of expenditure exceeding revenue. Sowe cannot give out a lot of  money. But we can afford the export processingzone where we free the industries from most of the regulations.I would like to mention something about exchange control. Manypeople have remarked that instead of establishing export processing zones.we should do away with exchange controls all together. When you weigh thisout at this stage, the propensity to import in this country is still so strongthat we would have no foreign exchange reserves if we eliminated as exchangecontrol at ago. But it would be a step when sections of our manufacturingsites are free of exchange control, price control and the other taxes and so on.On an experimental oasis, we will be able to tell how well we fair in ourefforts to reorient our industries towards manufacture for export.I would like to mention here that the ability of Kenyans tosave for investment from domestic sources is currently too small but weare talking of 17 per cent or 19 per cent. With our population growth, Kenyansshould be able to save a lot more money. If I quote a case we experienced inKorea, when they were about where we are now in terms of industrial development their domestic saving was about 2.3 per cent  proportional to GDP. Theyhave now been able to push that figure to 3?j per cent. , We still have a longway to go and we need measures that would stimulate investment and savings in the economy.With those few remarks, I beg to support the Bill and urge the House to pass it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER OF STATE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr.Nabwera) : Thank you Sir for giving me this opportunity. I would like to support this Bill and at the same time make a few observations. As the hon. Mover said, the basic thinking behind this Export Processing Zone Bill, is that it would make it casier and faster for the people who wont to invest in Kenya to come and invest here.The Minister who moved this Motion gave an example of three zones which have to be gazetted namely, the industrial area of Nairobi, Athi River and Mombasa. I would like to urge that when the Minister is thinking of gazetting these export processing zones, he should go provincial because we want to decentralize the industrialisation process in this country. For example, we should have one zone gazetted in Central Province, about two in Rift Valley, one in liyansa Province and another one in webuye, westernProvince.The conditions necessary for establishing these zones are: easier communications, that is, tarmacked roads, and railway line, electricity, land and water. The raw materials for processing and the manufactured goods for export will be transported by rail. This also applies to heavy machinery for setting up industries.Nairobi Industrial Area is over-congested and industries 322 should now be set up in Athi River. That is why I said that Nyeri meets the conditions I enumerated earlier on. The same applies to Hakoru, Kisunru. Embu, Eldoret, We buy e and Mombasa. I am not saying that all the gazetted zones will be operational; at once but we should gazette enough sor.es so that any investor who is, say, interested in investing in Kisumbu is free to do so Knowing that he will enjoy the same advantages that the investor at Athi River will be enjoying. Whoever will invest in Nyeri, will also enjoy the same benefits.	Secondly, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would liketo say that after this Bill has been passed and become law, weshould also consider very seriously the improvement of our agriculturebecause our manufacturing will not be dependent on imported rawmaterials. In fact, right now we do not have very much foreignexchange with which to import many of these things. Many of theindustrialists who coming to invest in Kenya should, therefore, beencouraged to process what we produce locally so that we can getour raw materials and, to a certain extent, fairly cheaply. I amnot just thing of exporting to overseas markets. I am thinkingmainly of exporting to PTA countries, which will require a lot oxmanufactured goods. We should thus be ready to manufacture as much as we can from our local resources and what we are able to import. Our economy is going through difficulties partly because of the increased cost of oil, but also because we have not properly concerntrated on developing our economy. As I had an occasion to say, there is no reason why Kenya should not be exporting cotton. We have, ideal conditions for producing cotton and yet at the moment we do not produce, enough cotton and have to import some of it for our textile factories. In the same breath, there is no reason why Kenya should not be able export many of the other crops that we grow locally. Now that we will have export processing zones, it should be possible for us to attract investors to process some of these raw materials into ±±ms finished goods for our export, With these few remarks, I support the Bill.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MAKAU: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. This Export Processing zones Bill should not be taken as a panacea for the economic problems we are Explore	processing zones are not a new idea in Africa in field of promotion of export business.Togo and Senegal have been grappling with the establishment of export processing zones. Mauritius has been very successful Togo and Senegal are still struggling and we have joined these countries in using these zones as a way of promoting exports.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in our case we are taking of areas like Nairobi, Athi-River and Mombasa that have been set aside. But in talking about these zones we must know that we are talking of a very delicate investment. As I said when we were debating manufacturing under bond (MUB), we should realise export processing zones is a challenge to us: we should not take it that we will succeed just because we have introduce it. It has taken countries that have already started these zones with the object of promoting commercial and industrial take of many years.We are lucky in that when presenting this year’s financial statement, the Vice President and Minister made it very clear that there would be more incentives to ± attract people to invest in these export processing zones. But, as I have said, it is one thing to establish these zones and another to be able to administer them. It is imperative to get somebody who understands what "export processing zones" are This is not an area where you put somebody as a chief executive for political payoff: It is an area which need somebody with the necessary experience, qualifications and is competence in international marketing: it is an area which needs creativity in marketing because we are talking about talking toforeign entrepreneurs to come and invest here. That is why We should have somebody who understands international business regulations and who will be able to identify what we really need and where we have comparative advantage in business. There, is no point of setting up businesses in these zones to duplicate whatever is beingdone in the region.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, although. we are saying that the establishment of these zones will facilitate' the transfer of technology, we should realise that the success of industries to be established in these zones will depend on trained Kenyan manpower, While we appreciate the importance of foreign investors, we should not forget that countries that have succeeded in these export processing zones are those that have encouraged investment in these zones by indigenous entrepreneurs. In thinking about exporting, we should think in terms of our indigenous entrepreneurs who have invested in this country. I would like the Vice President and Minister for Finance to find out why it is that these days we are reading in the newspapers about indigenous businesses that are going into receivership. We should know that while it is important to have foreign, investors, these people have other places where they can invest; they are also seeing that those who have invested here are finding it difficult to survive. In fact, nobody has been willing to buy local firms which have gone under after failing to pay loans from local financial institutions like the Industrial Development Bank and Kenya Industrial Estates.We should thus ask us what is causing problems to those who have already invested in this country; even state corporations are	being liquidated and we should know whether there islack of market. We want to set up businesses in order to create jobs, earn foreign exchange and benefit from transfer of technology, but businesses that are collapsing were started to achieve the same objectives. This is why I am saying that we should look into the causes of this worrying trend.Mr. Temporary deputy Speaker, Sir, the companies that have now gone under receivership, should be a big worry to the Government because this worsens the unemployment problem that we have in the country. This is happening due to lack of transfer of technology, when parastatal bodies like Ramisi and others go under receivership, it becomes even more worrying. I whole purpose of setting up these parastatal bodies was to mobilizefunds to enable the Government to provide more and better services to its people.Having said that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to point out there are certain countries that have already start export processing zones and these countries have been very successful. For example, we have Mauritius, Togo and Senegal. There is one very important thing that we should always think about. First and foremost, we should find outwhere export-processing zone industries are going to be established and Iam sure there would be no problem in identifying these zones. However,I would like to say that the authority that is going to be establishedthrough this Sill, should establish a sector that will be of a comparative advantage to our people when we come, to this kind of easiness. In this country, we have very qualified people, say, in furniture business. Cur people today are manufacturing first-class furniture which could even be exported outside this country. It is one thing to encourage people to come here and invest in these businesses and another to get enough market to sell the goods they manufacture. Under the provisions of this Bill, there will be a moratorium period of about ten years during which investors will not be required to pay any tax. However, what I would like to say here is about the Chief executive and the Chairman of this very important authority. There are times in the past when we have had people who have failed in politics and other fields, being appointed chairmen or chief executives of very important bodies. However, with this particular authority, we cannot afford to do so because this is a very sensitive area.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, one area which is ox" muchconcern is the market to sell the goods that they will be manufacturing.we have at the moment, the Preferential Trade Area markets, which, I amafraid to say, are becoming very unstable. The preferential trade areacountries, such as Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi and so on, offer idealmarkets of our goods. I think it is a high time that we appealed to someof these countries to try and resolve their political differences, so that they can remain politically stable. As we have already heard, there has been an invasion of Rwanda by armed refugees from Uganda and this has caused a lot of instability within the region. Although this has caused a lot of fighting in the region, we have not so far heard of any condemnation by the united Nations or from the Organisation of African Unity. There is no difference between the invasion of Rwanda by these refugees and the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, We have in both cases where people from one sovereign state, have decided to invade another sovereign state. A1though in the case of Rwanda, this has been done by refugees, I do not see how  over 10,000 people could be armed with heavy artillery, if they did not get that assistance from Uganda 'This means that somebody in that country had organized, this invasion.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I touched on this point because it really does affect the stability of the market within the preferential trade area. 'Therefore, something must be done to condemn this kind of aggression. If this is not done, there is going to be a continuous trend of invasion between one country and another. The preferential trade area market as I said earlier, is a market that we should be seriously h thinking about. when it comes to attracting investors to come and invest in these zones, we must go for investors who are experienced in small-scale industries. We should consider  countries in the South-East Asia where people have experienced in cottage industries. For example, if you take South Korea, hon. Minister for Industry  hon. Otieno  has told us how the people in this country have been able to change their lifestyles due to the 332 establishment of cottage industries. One thing what we should know is thataxe going to face from Mauritius, Togo, Senegal and other countries that have established these zones, we are going to face another surmountableproblem as far as the marketing of the products from these zones axeconcerned. Therefore, we should be thinking in terms of establishingmarkets in the European Common Market in 1992. This is very big challengewhen we think of establishing these export-processing zones? we are thinkingabout the establishment of textiles industries which will be manufacturingtextiles in large quatities like Mark Spencer Textile Industries in theUnited States of America. Today, most of what countries in EuropeAre selling has been imported from South Korea, Hongkong and other countries where they have been able to establish export-processing zones.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we should therefore ask ourselves whether we are going to meet the challenges of the establishment of the European Common Market in 1992? This market will be open to many countries and there is going to be a lot of competition. Therefore, we should be thinking about the quality of products that would be made in these m export processing zones. while talking about people to invest in these zones, we should also be careful about international business crooks. These are people who would like to take advantage of the situation because they know that our regulations as fax as business is concerned are not as sophisticated as they are in South-East Asia for Example, or in any other developed countries This is why I am emphasizing on the integrity the qualifications, experience and competence of those that are going to be appointed in the Export-Processing Zone Authority, We have in this country been conned by people who come here and present themselves as experts, only to find out when it is too late that these fellows are conmen. The Ken Ren fertilizer project is a very good example here where people came and told us that they are experts in the production of fertilizer and that they would like to be allowed to start a fertilizer factory here in Kenya. These were international business crooks and by the time we realized what they were, we had lost millions of shillings in the so-called fertilizer plant.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is why I am talkingabout the importance of making sure that those who will he charged withthe responsibility of running this Authority, are people of high integrityI have already talked about, two markets that we are looking forward tosending our products, namely, the European  Common Market which is going to be established in 1992 and the neighbouring P.T.A. market where s we should do everything possible to make it stable. I am saying this because when there is no stability, there will be no market. We should consider the challenges that we are likely to meet in the European Common Market in 1992. At the same time, while we are talking about encouraging foreigners to invest in Kenya, we should not forget that there are also other countries that would like the same people to invest there. We should not forget also that Eastern Europe was once referred to as a "sleeping region" as far as investment was concerned.There is, for example, the recent amalgamation of West and East Germany that has deprived us of would be investors who would rather invest next door where their investment is more secure. There are also the countries that were once communist "satellites" to which many investors would rather go. In most eastern countries, a lot of investments comes from the western world. This why we recently heard people going round talking about the developing countries, especially in Africa, where they even give us conditions relating to their giving us aid. They have now seen that we have virgin countries where they can invest.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, these are the challenges we face, and we should not look at the proposed export processing zones as a solution to our problems. Rather, we should continuously insist that the basic foundation for an industrial and commercial take-off of this country is a strong agricultural base. As I said earlier, we should look at the type of industries that are going to come up in these zones. I has seen very beautiful construction work that has been done near the Firestone Company offices in Nairobi.There is also another element of this Bill that we should look at. There are people who have invested in the buildings that are going to hired out in the export processing zones. We should be careful and see that people do not take us for-a ride by overcharging. The authority that is going to be established by this Bill should make sure that the owners of these buildings does not scare off would be investors. The Bill talks about rental buildings in the export processing zones. We should ensure that the owners of these buildings do not take advantage of would-be investors. As you are aware, many people would like to invest in business in Nairobi, but the newly—created development levy on new buildings discourages would-be investors from investing in buildings. Indigenous Africans are finding it difficult to invest in this kind of business due to this development levy. So, I urge those who will be in charge of the said authority to make sure that this aspect does not affect export promotion zones.One important man—made resources that in goingto these zones is stability. His Excellency the President has made Kenya avery stable country, and we would like to appeal to every leader and mwananchito note that nobody is going to invest in these zones if there is politicalinstability in this country. The political stability in this country isgoing to attract investment. We can say that we are going to give investors a 20 years moratorium during which they will not pay taxes, but as long as the country is not politically stable, we will not attract investors.Another area that should be looked at by the authority that is going to be set up by this Bill is the fact that where there is a joint venture between foreigners and indigenous businessmen, this should be encouraged.In conclusion, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to stress a point that might look as if it is not related to this Bill. "Many of the people who would like to invest in this country need to get information on the Export Promotion Centre. I would like the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance to look into this Centre and the authority that is going to be created and make sure that the personnel in the two institutions is of high integrity, qualified and competent. Nobody should be given employment here simply because he has tried his luck in politics, failed and has to be kept somewhere for his survival because if we allow this, we will kill the spirit of whatever we intend to create.I support this Bill very strongly because, it is going to create employment in this country for Kenyans. We know that one of the biggest problems that the country is facing is unemployment. This is one way of trying to solvethe problem. Another problem with which we should be very careful</Newspeech><Header>QUORUM</Header><Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.

MAKAU: As I was saying, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill because of the benefits that v/e are going to reap when the Bill is passed. The prices of ourtraditional cash crops  tea and coffee  have been going down in the world market. The creation of these expert processing zones will enable us to earn more foreign exchange. With the transfer of appropriate technology we will be able to train people here.Above all, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to support this Bill because one of the areas that have been designated for the establishment of the export processing zones is Athi River in Machakos District. The Government has made it possible for Athi River town to be supplied with water from the Nol Turesh Water Project. This adequate supply of water to the town will attract more people to go there and establish industries. I would appeal to investors to invest in projects like housing in Athi River so as to take advantage of the creation of an expert processing zone in Athi River.	with those fe remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. TERER: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to support this important Bill. Of late we have witnessed the	depreciation ofour currency  the Kenya Shilling  against other convertible currencies. I think this is because we are not exporting enough. With the creation of these export processing zones, I think we will be able to export more so that our Shilling nay become stronger.When the Assistant Minister was moving this Bill he stated that these export processing zones will be established in three cc areas of this country namely, Nairobi Industrial Area, At hi River and Mombasa. But I would like to point out that these three export processing zones are not enough. We need to spread these zone to all parts of this country, depending on the type of industries than are going to-be established.I think it is time we promoted our agricultural products. It is high time that we produced more cotton so that we can produce textiles for export. We should even be producing enough sugar for export if we are really serious with promoting our agricultural sector. We should intensify fishing activities in lake Turkana and Lake Victoria so as to produce enough fish for export. The same applies to tea and other crops. I think this Bill is timely because it will enable us to look at our economic progress afresh. Areas like the North Eastern Province can produce meat and meat products for export. Therefore these areas should be considerDown at the Coast we have cashew-rats and the production  this crop should be intensified so as to enable us to export more of the crop so that in turn we can earn enough foreign exchange with regard to local participation, I think we should take this one very seriously. There is no need for us to borrow a lot of money from overseas to set up industries here only for these industries to consume whatever out of them……….a lot of money We are going to pay heavily in terms of	interestand principal. This Will never allow us to take off in terms of technology and industry.With regard to clause 9(l)(c)  the Government revenues and foreign currency earnings, We should be careful when it comes to exporting our goods. If We allow foreigners to have a free hand in these matters, then we may not be able to earn much because the can under-price the exports and over¬price the imports. In other words we shall be having our foreign exchange money getting out of the country unless we take care of these transactions ourselves.The identification of areas to be designated as export- processing zones areas should be done with a lot of care so that certain areas are not left out. I believe that this Authority will look into these matters in terms of our own economic gains. The Authority will also be able to maintain up to date data on the performance of the programmes in each individual export processing zone. Unless the Authority maintains a register, to show actually what happens, it will be very difficult .for us to gain, out of these creation of these export processing zones.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, stability is a very important factor in the development of any country. I do not think we are going to gain much from the Preferential Trade Area. This is because if our neighbours are not all that stable politically there is little we can earn from exporting our commodities to these countries.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like to mention that before we establish any industry we should actually look for the markets. unless markets are availablethere is no point in starting any production at all because the project might turn out to be a while elephant. We also need to employ experts. Unless we are careful we will be conned by international crooks. We have had that experience before and there is no guarantee that we are not going to have it again in future.With those few remarks, I support the Bill.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND H0USING (Mr. Mutiso) : Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I also rise to support this very important Bill. I think the b± Bill is very much overdue. The creation of these export processing zones will enable our country to move pretty fast. Also the establishment of these export processing zones is a step forward in our national development. This is because when these export; processing zones have been established, the country will definitely benefit from them. This will mean that foreign investors will realise that conditions conducive for investments are available in tills country.Those conditions include peace and stability, which are key factors for develop-ment in any country. The other factor is the availability of land, an area big and spacious enough for the people who would want to come and put up buildings for whatever industrial projects they may want to establish. In my view, the areas that have been chosen for this purpose are quite fitting. In the Industrial Area of Nairobi, the area which is now coming up on your way to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport is quite suitable. It is the area where there are a lot of buildings coming up, and there is enough area for that kind of development. On top of that, the area is near the railway line, which is another conducive situation for this kind of development. There is also electricity nearby and telephone services are also available. The area is also suitable in that there is a police station that can provide security. Indeed, there is also water and other things that would be needed for this kind of undertaking.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, personally, I am very satisfied with the export processing zones that have been so far chosen by the Government. Since we cannot set up export processing zones all over, we must start at a point where we are. sure that all the necessary facilities are provided. Once we get those facilities off the ground and everything is operational, then the investors can spread their wings to other areas in the country. That one is open for future development.Sir, another area to which I wish to draw the Government attention for this kind of exercise is what we need to do to prepare ourselves for this kind of development. First of all, the establishment of the Authority is the key to everything because it is the Authority that will go into all the legal exercises of checking those who will be applying to be accepted for investment in this country. It is the Authority which will make sure, on behalf of the Government; that all the necessary procedures that inventors are required to fulfill are fulfilled and give the okay for the investors to go ahead and establish want-ever industries they may want. Therefore, the first step which this Bill is seeking is to establish the Authority which will begin processing all the other necessary things that are required for this particular kind of exercise.Another thing which I would like to point out is that since' we are now moving towards industrialisation, we must look around and ensure that we have all the necessary factors which go along with industrialisation. For example, when we create these export processing zones, we must be sure that we are going to create a situation whereby we will have raw materials produced locally and also imported from overseas. The attitude that we have seen in this country where people only go for imported products must be discouraged. We must now prepare ourselves to be very competitive because we are now entering into the world of competition. Our locally produced goods must be able to compete effectively quality wise with those which are produced in other countries. We must also encourage our people to produce raw materials. For instance, we must plant cotton in a bigger way. It is pointless for us to enter into this venture and continue to import some of the raw materials which can be adequately produced locally.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, being an agricultural country, Kenya produces a lot of hide's and skins. Therefore, we must ensure that these particular products are of high quality so that we can get high quality products that can compete internationally. That way, our people will not want to buy things like shoes that are made in Italy and elsewhere. These things must be of competitive quality so that we ensure that we are capable of competing internationally in this particular market.Sir, this is a very good step forward for our country because we will not be relying on one particular aspect for economic growth. We are no longer going to be known as an agricultural country but also as an industrial country. We want to produce a lot of the: products that can be produced by industry so that we can generate employment opportunities for our people who are leaving school.With those few remarks, Sir, I beg to support the Bill.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Kibaki): Thank you. Sir, for giving me this opportunity to support this Bill. If Kenya is to benefit, the first change that we must make is to simplify the procedure for getting a licence to strict an industry. For example, if you have money and you want to star an industry in Nairobi, you can take two years struggling with different departments trying to get a licence because there are far too many licences required from too many institutions. We are now creating another institution. In order to benefit, we should remove the other authorities that are involved as far export industry is concerned and have only this one authority to issue licences. If we do this, an individual with money to start an industry, goes to one authority and he gets approval within the same week and sets off his concern. This is the as most frustrating aspect of our administrative structure today. .Due to this frustration, people with money loiter around until they abandon the investment which they had in mind.This is not a theoretical thing; I have seen it. These investors are held up for petty reasons some of them purely of a personal nature or people trying to make side money. This is where this thing is going to matter. This has been the genuine handicap and if it is removed now and licences obtain within one week upon application and the investment takes off the ground, then word will go round and industries will grow at a faster pace.In matters of investment, those who invest do not just believe those of us who are in Government. They will believe some parts of what we say but in the final analysis, the man who is investing believes his£ fellow business¬man who is already inside the economy. He asks his colleague: "How is it in that economy?" If he is told that it will take him two years before he gets a licence, he will not invest in that line and will go somewhere else. This is a fact. We are seeing it in the tourism industry, manufacturing and so on.We should simplify this so that the first few who go into this expert zone are able to tell their fellow investors: "It is simplified. You do not have to wait. You can invent and begin making money." This isbecause we are giving some of the best incentives every to be given since one is free from any form of taxation; even when you begin to pay after, say, 10 years, you will pay only a small proportion of the normal company tax according to this Bill. Therefore, we are giving the greatest incentives that can be given. There is nothing so great for an investor than to know that all the money he makes belongs to him since he will not pay tax for that period of time. That is a tremendous concession.To make this effective, we must simplify the procedures for acquiringlicences and make sure that we do not hold prospective investors.We know one country near here which has been successful in this industry. Mauritius started this industry only a few years ago when we were still debating this same issue. We have now decided to move. Mauritius made a most fundamental decision. They a± said: "Anyone who will be manufacturing for export of the whole of the production is guaranteed that he may keep some proportion of that foreign exchange." So that he does not earn foreign exchange but the next time he wants foreign exchange in order to buy raw materials, he has to apply and wait for four months to be allocated foreign exchange.This is an essential point. If I earn foreign exchange, then I should be assured that when I need raw materials for my industry, I will not end up queueing for foreign as exchange and waiting for six months. It should be automatic. As a foreign exchange .earner, I should automatically  without any question be allocated money to buy raw materials because I have  evidence to show that it is imported raw material and that I am going to earn further foreign exchange. Therefore, I should be assured of allocation of foreign exchange on a continuing basis.If an ordinary business person in the world cannot plan two to threeyears ahead because of question marks in front of him, he will not take action.He needs to ho assured that when he applies for foreign, exchange.	It with be available because in any case, he is earning it.We should make that concession. It need not be in the at least we know that in Nauritius and Singapore, these schemes h successful. That assurance of being sure that you will never foreign exchange to buy your raw materials, has been the most imp incentive. You can plan forward and see how your industry will five years. You can ask somebody to invest, say, Ksh. 3 mil if you cannot see that much future then you will be asking too ; human nature.Human nature is believing but business human nature ale fundamental questions. That is a very important thing.The other point that I want to make is that industrial! not be seen as a. little addition to agriculture Industrialist is now the only answer for the unemployment situation. Even in r the most significant development is where it is almost semi-indu in horticulture. In any case, the two are linked. Let me give to one example.more than Kshs. 2 billion every year in the importation of vegetableI am not talking about petroleum oil but about vegetable cooking oil, Which can be produced regularly by all Kenyan farmers, provide they have the processing capacity. The farmers can acquire the processing capacity if they are allowed to enter into contract with vegetable oil manufacturers to supply them with the raw materialsand be paid for them at an agreed rate without restriction. TheBritish American Tobacco (BAT) company have shown us how this arrangement can workit enters into contracts with farmers and this allows the farmersknow in advance the variety of tobacco they should grow andthe rate at which their tobacco will be bought. This tobacco isthen taken by the BAT, processed and sold locally and overseas.The same thing can be done in this field of vegetable oil.But the manufacturers who get into it require the freedom tonegotiate with farmers directly and freely. This is an examplesimilar to that given by the hon. Member for Yatta about shoes.Since We are the only country with  reasonable processing capacityfor  hides and skins in this region, We have been getting hidesand skins from our neighbouring countries, unfortunately, when weimport these things, some people who do not understand simpleeconomics go on shouting that it is "magendo"' when it is normalborder trade, which is a normal manner of life. If I have a friendwho lives on the Ugandan side of the border and he wants to sellhides and skins to me so that he may acquire Kenya currency in orderto buy cooking fat, say Kimbo  which is what actually happens thisis normal border trade and there is no "magendo" about it. In anycase, it does both economies a lot of good. This is because the personon the Ugandan side requires cooking fat and we require thehides and skins to process and have value added to them here nobody loses; we have exported cooking oil and more ,job may be created.So, this is normal border trade but we have people who are fond of looking at simple border trade as "magendo". But they do not see big "magendo" like in a case where a big lorry is loaded</Newspeech><Newspeech>ME. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Can the Minister elaborate on what he means by “border  trade”? He is trying to say that trade across the border is not "magendo". But We know that without control, things could be going through the border without earning the country any foreign exchange. I myself would call that "illegal trade". Is the Minister really supporting that unlicensed and uncontrolled ordertrade?</Newspeech>		<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Kibaki): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not know whether you can understand why the hon. Member chooses not to understand simple English. The world over, wherever you are, people who live at the border will always trade with each other in the goods they need. This is a fact of life and is not some news. I am not saying anything new, or anything he does not know or anything which he does not see with, his own eyes. But when the hon. Member chooses not to understands what can we do about?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MS. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mureithi): Mr. Malebe you must be aware the first one was not a point of order, but a point of argument. I hope it is ah point of order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir, my point is whether it is in order for the Minister to support unlicensed border trade? Is this not "magendo"?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Kibaki): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as you have understood that is not even a point of order; the hon. Member simply want to pretend ignorance. The Holy Bible says and Shakespeare also repeated it that there is none so blind as he  who will not see. If he chooses not to see, then he is the most blind person because he has made a decision not to see. So even if you continue showing him he will never see. I, therefore, I propose we abandon that cause. In any case it was not a point oforder.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Can the Minister substantiate that I am ignorant? I am so educated that hon. Kibaki cannot say that I am ignorant.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mureithi): Mr. Malebe I did not hear the word "ignorance",</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. When the hon. Minister stated that the hon. Member was ignorant" I am sure he was referring to me. So, can he subtantiate that I am ignorant, or withdraw that statement?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Kibaki): Mr. Temporary Deputy. Speaker, Sir, you and other hon. Members were here and know that I have not talked about "ignorance". In fact I have talked about people who are very knowledgeable but who choose not to see. I am not even saying that they are blind but, as a manner of speech, there is none so blind, as he who willed not to see: he will never see even, if you show him.The point I wanted to make when this matter started is that there is, for instance, in these zones, a major potential for us to process our tea.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the production and management of ourtea has shown  great deal thanks to His Excellency the Presidentbecause he chose a commission that has put forward very practical and constructive proposals.	Consequently, the second payment of tea thisyear: will now he the highest that we have-ever been paid for our tea and for this we are very grateful to the President. In the field of tea, we have a major potential of processing the tea and packaging it for export so that we do not export our tea in its raw form as it comes from the factory. This means that the value added will increase the price by almost 50 per cent. In any case, employment for our people would also be created. This is what Ceylon has been doing with its tea and India has now set to do this and we the third largest tea producer, must take this Iir.3 in future. I am sure we shall do extremely well.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the final point that I would like to make on this Export processing Zone is that it is purely administrative in that thiszone, in relation to the Kenyan economy becomes like another country wherethe raw material will be coming from and no tax will he paid on it, andthen after processing that raw material, the goods so produced would heexported to the rest of the world. However if anybody wantedto sell those goods in Kenya, he will have to be controlled so that he doesnot kill other small-scale industries which do not enjoy the advantage thathe enjoys inside the zone. Therefore, the administration of the zone shouldmake sure that the people inside the zone, remain there, and that these goodsremain inside the zone, until they are exported. If thesegoods are sold in Kenya, the administration of the zone should make surethat the correct taxes are levied. This is the most critical area becausethis zone, if not properly controlled can cripple other industries outsidethe zone, which manufacture goods for domestic consumption.with those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR CO-OPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT(Mr.Cheruiyot):Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me thisopportunity to support this Bill which is very relevant to the problems thatwe have in this country at the moment. This bill has come at a time whenHis Excellency the President has just challenged investors' to invest in Kenya. His Excellency the President has also challenged indigenous entre¬preneurs to be committed and prepared to go x into joint venture, if we have to encourage these foreign investors to come here. This Bill has come at the right time when Hong Kong which is highly industrialized, is going to be handed over to China and at this time, there is going to be very many millionaires and multi-millionaires who are going out to look for countries where investment climate is condusive to investment. There are many people in Hong Kong who would like to go to the third world countries where there is cheap labour. Therefore, Sir, if we pass this Bill, it would be an opportune time to consider these people.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Bill has come at a time when we are having an industrial take off in this country, With the jua kali artisans who have now been trained, and with the graduates from our polytechnics who are very knowledgeable and prepared to work hard, we shall be able to improve on our industrial, development. His Excellency the President has already given us Shs.150 million towards the Rural Enterprise Fund. This money would be used to assist our own indigenous entrepreneurs in setting up small-scale industries in the rural areas. These are the people who are going to benefit from the Export-processing Zone and therefore, this Bill is very timely. This is a very important Bill on which every hon. Member should be able to contribute. I am saying this because this Bill is going to urbanise and industrialize Kenya; it is also going to reduce the unemployment problem that we are having in this country. This bill is also going to give a lot of encouragement to our people so that they area, able to produce more goods for export.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, what is important is that we needto go out even more to see what other developed countries have done. Indiafor example, has come up in the area of industries and this is because theyhave the sort of technology which is transferable. Their technologyis very relevant to our needs here. India as we all are aware, has developeddue to cottage industries and when you look are some of the things they used manufacture, they to used to do it manually and in smaller quantities. However, today; India has become an industrial power. I know as a third world country, we are not looking forward to becoming an industrial power, but we are looking for ways and means of starting our own agro-based industries by borrowing the relevant technology from India.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the mainstay of our economy is agriculture and we are an agricultural country and therefore, we should be able to establish agro-industries and we shall be able to manufacture things like juices and the like. These export-processing cones need not be confined to developing country. In fact, even the developed and much richer a countries could also come to the export processing Zone where they too could purchase raw materials for their products. Howevor, we have our own manpower resources in the form of our university graduates who have specialized in the field of engineering; we also have fellows who have done commerce and so on. These are cur human resources and they are relevant to the export processing zone. I as saying this because these are the sort of people who would understand the procedures that the Minister has just talked about regarding the filling in of forms and so on. They will also understand the problem that is normally brought about the Bureaucratic system that we have here. They Will also be able to understand what is meant by investment promotion centre.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir, we have enough manpower in this country and cur people do know what required of them. We also have people who know how to use money. Sometime ago there were peoplein Kenya is so high that everybody is looking for money and this is the timeto direct these people to the area of export processing zone. Yesterday, somebodytalked about the problem of exports. I know at the moment, we have the problemof lack of cargo space which has greatly affected our horticultural industry, Today we are growing a lot of horticultural crops, fruits and vegetable, flowery and the like, but we are having a problem in exporting these things due to lack of cargo space. I think the time has now come to look at the position of some of the most successful airlines to find out whether we can be able to lease some of them. I am saying this because a country like Israel has a specific plan to export fruits and vegetable to European- markets. If today you went to Amsterdam where they are auctioning flowers from Kenya, you would find the importance of encouraging our people to go into horticultural industry.This country is quite good and the political climate we have here is all right. His Excellency the President has set a climate such that anybody who comes here looks around and sees that he is safeguarded because we guarantee his security, peace and private ownership of property.- So long as one pays the relevant taxes he is sure that his business is going to succeed.It is important that the export processing zones will give investors exemption from payment of all taxes, such as withholding taxes on dividends,Income tax and stamp-duty. As hon.Kibaki told .us, export processing zones aresomething that we should have started 20 years ago, but we are not too late to do so now. We are not growing enough cotton, for example, in this country and yet we have, a fantastic scope and room for the expansion of our textile factories. In fact, the basis of the expansion of industries in Mauritius that many hon. Members have made reference to is textile industries. I encourage co-operators in my Ministry to make sure that they grow crops, sell them and get early payment for them. This will encourage the cotton industry to grow.In fact, it is very embarrassing that animal feed factory owners have to import things like sunflower seeds, cotton seed cake, and so on because we do not have enough of them. This is very shameful. We should be growing enough of such things because we have the right climate, very good soil, a reliable rainfall and qualified agricultural extension officers. So, we have no excuse for not growing enough cotton in this country for our textile industry The problem that we have been having is lack of management. I say so because when you look at the Joint Loans Board, you find that the loans that were given out by county councils and the Ministry of Commerce were minimal. When you look at the history of these loans, you see that there has been a problem of lack of repayment, but I commend the Ministry of Commerce because it is now training the loans who borrow these loans on basic book keeping, accounting and commerce so that they may be able to repay the loans that they borrow.The Industrial and Commercial Industrial Corporation, too, is doing very well and when you look at its records, you see that the lean repayment rate	has improved tremendously because management skills have been imparted to those	concerned and Kenyans are now aware that when you borrow a loan, you must repay	it promptly. This is very important because sooner or later, We are going tocompete with the Asian community, which seems to be talented in the management of property and business.If we are going to have our own entrepreneurs going into the export, processing zones, we must be sure that these people are skilful. We have made quite a lot of reference to Mauritius. . .When you-look at the history of this country, you see that France colonised it for 100 years and the British for another 150 years. French and English are, therefore, spoken so easily and .well there that you can speak them in any corner of the country and be understood. The ability of Mauritians to speak the two languages so easily, has attracted French industrialists to invest in their country, and the same applies to Englishmen. If we are going to create export processing zones in this country and encourage foreign investors to come to this country, we must encourage a bilungual situation. We must encourage our people to speak German, Italian, French, and so on, which are now highly commercial all over the world. In this case, whoever comes to Kenya for investment will know that he can alight, go to a restaurant or another recreational area and hire employees who can speak his language easily. Nothing is worse than being unable to speak certain languages. If you go to a foreign country, you look stupid if you cannot communicate in the language used there.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Bill has come at the right time and formation of the proposed authority should be encouraged. The Bill says that the Minister in charge will appoint people who, in his opinion, have knowledge of business and trade. Among the people to be appointed in this authority, the Ministry of Commerce should take a very prominent position because these export processing zones are really meant to trade and do business. The list of names of the people to he appointed, there are representatives of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and others, but we have prominently emittedrepresentatives of the Ministry of Commerce.With these few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg tosupport.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to support this Bill. The idea of the formation of export processing zones is ideal because these zones will give an opportunity to potential investors in the country to go into joint ventures with experienced foreign investors. Further, the objective-of these zones is to faciliate export—oriented investment and the creation of employment. Today, we have many graduates walking our streets due to lack of jobs. These include economics and engineering graduates, and these would easily get jobs in these zones. At the same time, the zones will be able to create foreign exchange earnings. These zones will attract many investors. The taxation system in this country has been a prohibitive factor in establishing joint ventures.In talking about these zones, we should take into account the incentive that will be given to local investors. The conditions relating to becoming an export processing zone operator stipulate that one has to have capital and expertis- Secondly, one has to be a Kenyan individual or company. Thirdly, one should be able to lease land within the zones for 30 years. This last condition means that the potential investor will have to purchase land in the zones, and this will handicap most local investors because buying land might be expensive and require securities to be provided.So, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would really expect the Minister, when, he stands to reply, to try a to address himself to that particular handicap. This is because in this. particular case, it will be easy for foreign investors to own land here as opposed to local investors. We know that the economy of this country is mainly controlled by Asians. So, these export processing zones will be monopolised by  Asians, So, a provision should be. included here to ca.ter for indigenous investors. So, fiancés and incentives to facilitate participation by local indigenous investors should be spelt out in the Bill or within the regulations of the proposed Export Processing Zones Authority. Ir¬is because once the Authority is formed it will be like any other Government parastatal. So, the Authority should spelt out the qualifications for investment. If some of the sections of this Bill are not amended, then it will be a little difficult for the  indigenous Kenyans to participate in the export processing Zones. The other point that I would like to touch on here, is with regard to the declaration of an area to be an export processing Zone area. Since we have the District Focus for Rural Development Strategy, it would be appropriate although we will begin with the big towns line Nairobi. Mombasa, Nakuru, kisumu and so on for smaller export processing cones to be considered for the smaller towns and municipalities. Each district head quarters should be declared an export processing zone km no matter how small it is. This will enable us to create employment opportunities at the district level. This will  ALSO give the export processing  a meaning.  I say this because the escalating transport costsThis Will make the export processing zones more beneficial to the population of this country. In fact that should be the aim of establishing these export processing Zones.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, on the allocation of 5: plots, I think that provision of	providing securityshould be looked into critically. This is because not many Kenyans are in a position to provide securities in order to qualify to begiven plots in the export processing zones. So, I am sure that the Minister will address this issue and make amendments before this Bill is enacted.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, export and import trade in this country is very lucrative. There is red tape in obtaining licences from the Central Bank of Kenya. The process is really tedious. I am sure that with the creation of these export processing zones, that procedure will ka abandoned and then the Authority which will be established v/ill be dealing with the issue of licences wit ho any restrictions from the Central Bank of Many a and the Ministry of Commerce. At the same time it has been very difficult to obtain these import and export licences because of the financial contraints that are facing us in this country. If a country does not have enough foreign exchange, it is not possible for people to obtain these import and export licences. It would also be necessary to create a fund which will be specifically reserved to facilitate the 22 smooth operations of these export processing cor.es I think this is a very noble idea and we should encourage our indigenous Kenyans to participate in these ventures. The problem we have in this country is the non-availability of machinery. We should be able to start manufacturing our own tractors within the export processing zones.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the production of the Nyayo Car must also be done within the export processing zones. I saythis because  I know that there must be constraints  in the	procurement of raw materials and importation of spare parts. Although we have iron ore deposits in this country, we do not have the smelted iron which could be used in the production of the Nyayo Cars. I am sure that the Government agreed to establish the Mineral Advisory Centre which will facilitate the identification of the areas where we can obtain the raw materials which will be used inthese export processing zones As we establish the exportprocessing zones, the Government should consider speeding -up the establishment of the Mineral Advisory Centre so that it can supplement the requirements of the export processing zones.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to pay my tribute to His Excellency the President for his tireless efforts to make this country an industrial country. That is the reason why the President has been visited industrialised countries like India, South Korea and so on. Everybody in South Korea is employed. In fact the rate of employment in South Korea is 93 per cent while the unemployment rate is only 2 per cent. This is because they have been able to establish their own industries. This has enabled the citizens of that country to get employment I am sure that these export processing zones will create employment opportunities for our people. As I said, capital arid expertise will be required here. By expertise I mean education and the invention of ideas which will make Kenya an industrial nation.our borders. This is what causes insecurity in the country the border trade is regulated to go through the norms procedures it will cause insecurity in the country</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill because it provides the opportunity to expand our economic activities in this country in a way that has not been provided for before.Sir, there has been hue and cry for a very long time that if we had zones in which people could manufacture and export products industry would expand tremendously and this debate has been on right from the late 1960s through 1970s. I am pleased to see that now the Vice-President and Minister for Finance has come forward with a Bill providing for this facility. I would now like to see-whether the facility will really attract the people who were supposed to be waiting, in a way, to take advantage of this facility. I hope there are such people and I trust they will be there. I am saying so because one of the prohibiting factors to this kind of development, as has been pointed out by the Minister for Health, has been the in availability of foreign exchange for the raw materials required for manufacturing commodities that may be exported. This is the critical point. You can set up all these kinds of facilities but if foreign exchange is not avail¬able to import raw materials, then it will be very difficult to expand industry.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Kenya has now got practically every¬thing in place. We have the necessary infrastructure in terms of electricity, roads and public health. We have practically all the infrastructure in place. But we have not got as much investment by foreigners as we should have. We also have the other overall important infrastructure, namely, peace and stability for which we must at all times be grateful to His Excellency the President. He has led the country in a peaceful manner. But I would still want to see these investors who have been waiting for the establishment of export processing zones. I believe that one of the major inhibitors of foreign investment is the in availability of foreign exchange, and I would urge the Vice-President and Minister for Finance that while we support this Bill and pass it, he should also actively look into the possibility of relaxing exchange control regulations in various ways. I say so because every country that has relaxed foreign exchange regulations or removes.did not do it earlier. I am also sure that the day Kenya relaxes its foreign exchange, control regulations sufficiently to make it possible for industrialists to obtain foreign exchange easily, we will then ask, "For heaven's sake, why did we not do it earlier?.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do realised the risks involved in that if you relax exchange control regulations people might take the money out all of a sudden and then the country will be left without anything. But there are also other precautions that a developing country like Kenya, being a country that has a very highly respected President, can take to safeguard against such overwhelming outflow of capital. There can be negotiations with the World Bank to give us a guarantee to say, during this time you will be supported until confidence returns.After all, it is the World Bank which advises us to adjust cur economy. So, they should be in a position to help us. I am quite sure that they will be willing to h9lp us if we were to take that step. It is not a stepthat any Minister of Finance can take easily; it is a step which should be taken with caution and which requires very careful study and consultation. But is it is a step which we ought to consider to take. We should reduce foreign exchange controls to such a level as to enable importers of industrial manufacture, industrial raw materials and machines required for that purpose, to come in without unnecessary control. This is a fact which cannot be over¬emphasized.Kenya is no longer an under-developed country. Kenya is developed. If you go everywhere in the country, you will find beautiful roads, electricity water, medical services and technical schools. We are at a stage in which some countries that are great today were in the 1920s. We are a developed community; let us no longer think in terms of being under-developed because that is no longer there, we have taken off economically. If . we have a stock exchange where shares of Barclays Bank, Kenya Commercial Bank and the Standard Bank are over-subscribed, then how under-developed sire we? It is now upon us to form other companies which will also subscribe shares at the stock exchange. We are able to finance our own development.we have reached at a stage, which we must now consider seriously as a nation in terms of industrial growth. I urge the Vice-Presidcnt and Minister for Finance to consider seriously setting up a committee of experts, knowledgeable businessmen, hon. Members, well selected civil servants, lawyers and bankers to look into ways of reducing foreign exchange regulations with a view to removing them all together.

This ' is because agriculture fee Therefore, the more industries you have, the greater demon agricultural produce.This Will help to develop agriculture and it is a fact that we cannot  over—emphasise; It is so important that I am prepared to spend the whole afternoon repeating that it should be looked into very seriously.The next factor, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, that Will help us, not in the export promotion zones, but ±n generally in developing industry is to examine and see how we can reduce, or remove, price controls from a wide range of manufactured commodities so that industries adjust prices	gradually. What is happeningnow is that a price is held at a controlled level for a long time so that when that price is decontrolled it suddenly rises steeply, and causes a hue and cry. If price control is removed the price £ will increase gar gradually by a few cents and people will not feel the effects of the price 2 increase. Yet these gradual prices will be flexible to enable the manufacturers to know What their profit margins can be in the short and long run and thus be able to make long-term decisions. This will bring industrial stability and in turn industrial stability will result in our political position.This is an area I believe the Minister has to study very c are fully to see whether we need price control on a large number of manufactures goods. I agree that we need well balanced price controls on commodities like unga, maize flour and bread because price decontrol on these commodities can lead us into a chaotic state of affairs. But I believe that pricey on many other manufactured should be decontrolled because this encourages competition.Today, price control inhibits investment; if I were to put my into a business. I must consider the profit margin  would enjoy and this profit margin depends on how I can adjust myprice vis-a-vis the cost of production. Now, if I am unable to do that because of price control, it means that investment is unviable and I will not put my money into business; in this way investment is discouraged. This is why I am urging the Minister to look into this aspect. I am  not saying that price control should be abolished overnight it can only be done gradually over a period of time. In fact, the issue needs setting up of a committee to see how it can be done without disrupting the economy.Mr. Temporary Deputy Spea.ker, Sir, these are some of the things we need to do along with the export zones so that we increase the manufacturing processes and in this way create more jobs. Once you relax price controls and increase manufactured goods, you go into a lot of external business. In fact, notwithstanding the fact that this morning we passed a Motion congratulating our President for severing diplomatic relations with Norway, I believe we can still do business with Norway. But we know very well that Norway has done a horrible thing to us. I would like to say that Norway is not known for anything else others than harassment their historyis full of harassment. First of all, they did not exist as a nation  they were part of Sweden. In their history they have produced sea pirates to harass everybody.They sold their country to Germany through quisling and they are now trying to give us another quisling in Kenya and we are not going to accept that, under any circumstances. These are the sort of things that Norway is well known for. In the middle ages, the Christians had a list of pestilences including hunger and famine, attack by Iccusts. There were also attacks by people who used to come from the north and these people came along and started hitting people's heads and these people from the north were the Norwegians. They came from Norway and were some sort of a pestilence in the middle ages. These people have continued to be a pestilence in Kenya, but we shall not allow them. They must not try to cheat us that they are of any use to us. let them cheat their fellowmen in Norway but not us in Kenya. Ne are saying these things because we have seen them and we are not going to allow anybody to go ever cur heads and say they are going to do things that could be helpful to us.Nr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, diplomacy is a conduct of civilization and it as is only civilized people who conduct their affairs diplomatically which is the acceptable way of doing things. As it is, the Norwegian Ambassador here tried to behave in a manner of disrespect by totally ignoring the normal diplomatic practices. He should not in the first place have gone to court and they ought to have stopped him from entering, the court. However, he was lucky to be allowed in although he had deliberately ignored the diplomatic code. However although they have been so bad to us, if the Norwegians still want to buy our exports, we can sell our coffee and tea from Kenya.Finally, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the operator  of the Export Processing Zone will he handling a let of forign currency which Will include the Norwegian Kroror. They should lock careful in case the Norwegians send us krorors which are false. I am saying this because the Norwegians have been pirates and could as well trade with us by using counter¬feit currency. This is why I saying that these peoples will have to be veryAfter all, they have looked for ways in which to undermine Kenya, but they have failed. They tried to threaten us saying that we should do what they want, but we did not do so. Instead, we beat them, and they are now trying to use other ways to undermine the country. We must all be very careful in ensuring that people like Norwegians do not undermine us. If we sell anything to them, we must be sure that they pay us in good currency and not in counterfeit Kroners. We have known of countries employing thugs and bad business people to try to undermine the economies of other nations. Fortunately, we do not need Norwegian ideals any more, and Norwegians cannot do much damage to us because we have our own (inaudible) in this place.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, export processing zones will be a very important development in this country because they can help us tremendously provided that we use them properly. You will notice from the way this Bill is drafted that most Africans will be unable to benefit directly from these zones safe as employees. I am a property developer and I quite fully understand how difficult it is to develop the kind of thing that is described here and acquire land for Shs.6 million or Shs.7 million.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Could the Mover be now called upon to reply?</Newspeech>(Question, that the Mover be now called upon to reply, put and agreed to)<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Kariuki): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. In responding to the points raised by hon. members, I would first of all like to thank them very much because of the invaluable contribution they have made to the Bill and the very important advice they have given to the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance which, I can assure them, will be taken into consideration in forming the suggested authority.As one hon. Member said, the problems in this country are economic.There are people, however, who would like us to think otherwise. They wouldproblems. Kenya is a united nation under one President and one Party, and we are quite happy to remain the way we are. So, instead of our wasting time creating mountains out of mole hills and talking about, this and that non-existent political problems, let us face this important issue squarely.As I said when I was moving the Bill, one of our basic problems, is unemployment. When we think of unemployment, we have to be creative and innovative so as to come up with new ideas. This is why the Government has come up with this new idea of export processing zones. For the sake of the hon. Members who were not here when I was moving the Bill, I would like to say what an export processing zone is. It simply is an industrial zone for manufacturing goods specifically for export. This means that if any hon. Member here wants to start manufacturing goods for export, he can get his machinery free of all duty.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker: Sir, can get their raw materials freed of import duty, They will be exempted from income tax for 10 good years. What other incentives would one wish to be given? This is a challenge to our fellow z African entrepreneurs. It will be indeed very sad if after giving all these incentives we find that the people who are talking these opportunities are aliens; because these opportunities are open to anybody whether from outside the country or from within the country. So, this is a challenge to our industrialists and to our business community: to take up this challenge and apply to be allowed participation in these industrial zones.One speaker did say here and it is a very sad case that although we try to industrialise and although we try to export, most of our products are not competitive in the international market because our prices are too high. The previous complaint has been that the prices of cur good in the international market are too hi gh¬ee cause of the duty that we pay and because of the Value Added Tar: and the Sales Tax. But now we do have the opportunity to compete with others and I am sure that we shall succeed in competing with other countries.One hon. Member here did make a very valid point; what increased of having these export processing zones in Nairobi. Athi River End Mombasa, they should be spread out to the provincial headquarters. That is a very balid point but we all know that before a baby a learns to run he must first of all learn to walk, let us see theresponse and the effects of the zones that we have sat up in Nairobi, Athi River and Mombasa, With the experience that we shall have from these zones, then we shall be able to think of	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do agree with the hon. Members when they	say that this Authority must be headedby someone who is capable; somebody who has knowledge and experience in international trade. I would like to assure you that the Ministry is very concerned about that and whoever they will choose to head the Authority will be somebody who will have had a lot of experience; somebody who will be able to do the work.Various Members have quoted success cases in Africa and Mauritius was mentioned as an example.

Let us move to the next order.</Newspeech>The Lake Basin Development Authority (Amendment) Bill<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT(Mr. Muturia): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. that The Lake Basin Development Authority (Amendment) Billbe now read a Second Time.The Lake Basin Development Authority (LBDA) was establishedin 1979 by the LBDA Chapter 442 of the laws of Kenya withthe aim of planning and co-ordinating the implementation andco-ordination of development projects in the Lake Victoria catch that area. Since 1979 the LBDA hereinafter referred toas the authority has initiated an number of development projectsm its area of operations and currently employs a staff of over 400 permanent and regular staff members and a further project related talk force of between 1000 and 1200. It has been realised.	however, that the area of operations is limited to Nyanza and Western Provinces only although the Lake Victoria catchment areas	Extend to some districts of the Rift Valley Province. The definitionof development area has givenrise to many practical difficulties and hinders overall developmentof the whole authority, region as A economic and geographical unit.At the moment former definition refers to the Lake Victoriacatchment area while the later refers to Western and NyanzaProvinces only. The first difficulty is that the Authority cannot, in law, implement projects outside the two provinces, thereby leaving many districts falling within the catchment area uncatered for Moreover, catchments are of important national concern and require planning and development through conservation and rehabilitat-ion. This cannot legally be undertaken if the districts within the actual geogra-phical catchment area are excluded as at present from active development programme's of the Authority. The limitation placed on the portion of the region to be covered for development purposes is considered impractical.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the' second difficulty is that the part of Western Province which drains into Lake Kioga is left out too. It is, therefore, proposed to widen the area of operation of the Authority to include Nandi, Kericho, Trans Nzoia and Uasin Gishu district which naturally fall within the Lake Victoria catchment area but which are presently left out of the develop¬ment activities of the Authority and also that part of Lake Kioga catchment area situated within Kenya. When the Authority was established in 1979, a number of ex-officio members were named as members of the Authority. However, there was no provision for these ex-officio members to appoint alternate representatives in case of inability to attend particular meetings due to other official commitments. It is proposed to streamline the position so as to enable ex-officio members to appoint their representatives in the event of their being unable to attend meetings of the Authority.As has been indicated, the spirit behind the establishment of the Author-ity was not only for planning and development activities. The Act, as it is at the moment, however is not fully clear on the implementation role and, at times, this has hindered development activities because some prospective donors and financiers question the Authority's powers to carry out any project apart from planning and study. It is proposed to amend the Act to reflect the ture situation  as Authority is rally an implementing entity as well.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for the Authority to carry out its functions more effectively it requires to acquire land necessary for its develop¬ment projects. Currently the Authority has major farms located in the following locations:-</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Normally, it is the procedure in this House that if you are presenting any speech you do-not concentrate on reading the speech.

In the initial phase, this will cover 5,000 acres. It will also have five plot sites for brick manufacturing in various districts of the lake basin region.Currently, more than small parcels of land of various sizes are scattered all over the region for minor domestic irrigations schemes. In order for the Authority to carry out these projects, it requires statutory authority to acquire the land either through negotiation and agreement with the registered owners or compulsorily through the Minister responsible for matters relating to land.
