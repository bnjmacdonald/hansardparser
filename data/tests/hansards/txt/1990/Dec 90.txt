<newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: What have you got to say Mrs. Ogot?I thought you have a point of ordert.</newspeech><newspeech>MRS. OGOT: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. When I answered one Question this afternoon, I was challenged	by hon. Makhanu that he had information that the meetingof the National Sports Council did not take place on the8th of November, to discuss the matters of Kenya FootballFederation (KFF). I am now happy to produce the minutes ofthe National Sports Council Meeting held on 8th November, 1990 to discuss the matters of the Probe Committe of the KFF. I am therefore, laying them on the table and asking hon. Makhanu to withdraw the remarks he had made.</newspeech>	(Mrs, hon. Ogot laid the documents on theTable of the House	<newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order, hon. Members. You remember as I had stated earlier that you are going to have two hours to discuss the Motion on Adjournment. So, I am giving you two hours from now to discuss the Motion on adjournment.</newspeech><newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: One hour! One hour! MR. SPEAKER: Two hours according to  our Standing Orders.</newspeech><Header>MOTION FOR THE ADJOURNMENT</Header><newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Will a Minister please move that the House do now adjourn?</newspeech><newspeech>THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR FINANCE(Prof. Saitoti): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move:-THAT this House do now adjourn Sine Die. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in moving this Motion of Adjournment I would first of	like to take this opportunity to thankhon. Members for the amount of business which has been transacted # during the course of this Session. it is quite clear that several Bills have already been passed. It should also be taken into account that the business which has already been transacted in this House has been carried out in a farily open and democratic manner arid no doubt the decisions which have been made in this House have lead to the enactment of the various Acts and Laws   which will all go to the services of the wananchi, who elected us to come to this particular House.Mr. Speaker, Sir, this long recession that the House is going to have comes at a time when at a time when there will be no Harambee for quite a number of months. This in itself, will be able to accord the hon. Members the opportunity to be able to go back to their own constituencies to inspect the projects whose financing has very much been a subject of discussion in this particular House. It is important, to remind the hon. Members that when they do go to their constituencies they should^ as much as possible try to ensure the money which has been voted in this House does indeed go to those projects for which they were voted. In the case of the hon. Members who are not awarelet me also bring to the attention of the House, that when we normally prepare the annual budget, it is also desegregated into district budgets so that every district normally has got its own budget. This information is available so that hon. Members , May know how much money is voted for every sector. For example, In case of water project, One can always be able to find it from that particular text. If it is a question of the road, an hon. Member should be able to see the projects which are being financed by readingthat particular district budget.Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important that hon. Members take seriously this districbudgets because it is only by following them closely, we can be able to assureourselves that the money that we normally vote in this House does actually gotowards the implementation of the projects for which it is voted.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wouid also like to inform hon. Members that the fact that we can be able to meet in this August House to transact our business in a fair open manner, is a clear indication of the freedom that we have in this country and of the democratic practice that we have in this country. It should be appreciated that there are very few countries in Africa that are able to have a serious and important House such as this one where law is enacted through all the stages and implemented. This is a very important tradition and we should resolve to uphold it at all given tines. However, even much more important, is that on an occasion like this, we should take the opportunity to thank His Excellency the President for the leaderships that he has offered[to this country. It is through the wise leadership of His iizcellency the Presid that we have been able to enjoy peace and stability in this country which has enabled this country to be able to record unparalled development in Africa.Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the moment, the whole of African continent is suffering the consequence of the Gulf crisis in that oil prices have gone quite high. As a result the whole world is right now experiencing a recession and a number of countries in Africa have virtually become insolvent However, due to the wise leadership of His Excellency the President, this count has remained solvent.With those very few remarks, I beg to move.</newspeech>THE MISISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Biwott): Mr. Speaker, Sir, a I riseto second this Motion for the Adjournment of the House. In secondingthis Motion, I would like to thank hon. Members for the hard work thatthey done during this Session throughout this year. Indeed, this has beer avery busy Session in that we have been able to transact a lot of business and this has demostracted that Kenya is a very nature country which is lead by people who know their responsibilities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the years, we in Kenya have discovered thatOur fortune lies in our national unity and it is for this reasonthat we have been able to ams show to the entire world that we are able to solve our own problems without any assistance from, anybody from outside.	The events that have lead to the appointment of the Kanu Review Committee and the subsequent resolutions regarding all the problems in Kanu and in the entire political field in this country, has indeed proved to rest of the world and to those who would like to meddle with the affairs of this country that Kenya is not the type of country to be taken for granted. Kenya is a country that knows exactly where it is going and  a country with leaders who take the welfare of the state first.Mr. Speaker, Sir, for these reasons, I think we ought to congratulateourselvessince we were part and parcel of what happened at the Kasarani annual Delegates Conference. At this conference, we were able to saxs make resolutions that will stier us through from 1990 and possibly, to the year 2000. We have also in this House transacted a lot of business in the form of passing bills which will become laws. However, I think we ought to explain to our constituents about these laws so that they may know more and more about these laws. These are the kind of laws that we as leaders should practiaily show to our people and inform them fthow these laws affect then. We as leaders should first of all uphold and live by these laws and regulations because we are the same people who have passed them here.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have been able to work a toother as a united Parliament and have been able to oass resultions without so much divisions.Indeed in the recent amendment of the Constitution which introduced the element of Land Disputes Tribunals, the removal of the Attorney-General, the Chief*Justice and so on. We were able to pass this resolution if without any division and this clearly shows the unity within which this House operates. In this particular resolution, we had only one thing to show, namely that Kenyans wanted to amend this law in order to convince the doubting Thomases that KenyaIs not afraid of any criticism. we had removed the tenure of the office ofthe Attorney-General and of the Chief Justice but in any case, there was not inprovision in which we said that the Attorney-General or the Chief Justice was to be removed arbitrarily. We have now formalised the way in which they can be legally removed and this again, is an example, that Kenya is a mature nation which is run by a Parliament which consists of highly educated people and who have the interests of this nation at heart.Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we go out on recess, we should go and preach to the people the meaning of pariotism and nationalism and teach them about the resolutions that we have already passed, we have also the provisions of the Kanu Review Committee and we should educate them about the Report of this important Committee so that Kenyans may be brought to the same level of undarstanding as with the leaders in this House.with those few remarks, I beg to second.</newspeech>(Question proposed)	<newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR MECHANICAL TRAINING AND APPLIED TECHNOLOGY (Prof. 0ngeri): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand to also associate myself with my hon. colleagues in contributing to this Moticn of the Adjournment. First of all, I would like to record my thanks to His Excellency the President for the excellent manner in which he has steered this nation. The results of his leadership are quite evident and it is now quite clear to everybody who has been to this country that His Excellency the President has given us good leadership. We have had problems in the past of people quarreling and I think the Annual Delegates Conference was able to give us another new list of ways which we should adopt to be able to live in harmony and be able to devote our energies for national development.Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the House goes into recess, we, as Members of Parliament, have an obligation to expose to our people what is good and how to double agricultural production. As we know, we have a problem in Gulf region today and getting oil is a major problem for us here. It is important and crucial that our people are educated in this regard. The way we can assist this nation to improve our foreign exchange earnings is to encourage our farmers to grow more horticultural crops, such as pyrethrum, coffee, tea and others. I think we, as Members of Parliament, have a responsiblity of educating our people.I realise that we cannot accomplish everything within this short period of recess, but I know that if we have the best of intentions and think rightly, we can accomplish a lot within this short period of time.I stand here knowing fully that the hon. Members who have Jua Kali artisans in their areas will be able to support these upcoming young people. As a Ministry, we have tried to provide them with the necessary facilities, but it is now incumbent upon hon. Members to guide them properly so that theymay receive the required instructions. We would like to see these artisans being organised into groups that are able to approach banking and other financial institutions for support of their projects within our constituencies. I think this is a positive way of occupying our youth so that it may become both productive and self-employed, thus creating less headaches for hon. Members.I also stand here to urge hon. Members to encourage our womenfolk to join in the development strategies of our nation. As we know, 50 per cent of our school children are women. Therefore, we must make every effort to recruit our women into development projects. It is important that they now be initiated in non women activities, particularly non—offensive ones, that will earn them a decent living. So, I urge hon. Members not to discard women because they are an essential cogwheel in our development. With the little know how that they are getting from youth po91ytechnics and institutes of technology, they should be more encouraged to be more productive in this nation.I wish each hon. Member a merry Christmas. This is a time when we	should create a climate of unity and brotherhood, and any little problems that may have existed among us should now be a matter of the past as we think of the decade of 1991 to 2091. We want to make this nation a living example of unity, peace and tranquility. The President has been in the forefront of maintaining the peace and tranquility that exists in this nation.With these few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. J. MASINDE: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am grateful for having caught your eye so that I may contribute to thsi very important Motion. As we go on recess for some time, I would like to thank His Excellency the President for the way he conducted our just concluded conference, which was very successful and showed Kenyans that we are really united as a country. What is now important is that all hon. Members move around their constituencies telling our people about our unity. It is only we, leader's, who can talk to our people of our being one thing so that Kenya can stand up to whatever opposition we get from outside the country.When we lodged the Nyayo Car recently, all car manufacturing countries, particularly those in the so—called developed world, became very jealous and started accusing us of being too stable and capable of making other countries as stable as we are. So, they said that Kenya should not be a living star in Africa. However, I think we have made a step forward and some of the Press outside Kenya is beginning to say that Kenya is going in the right direction.It is important that when we go on recess, we do not stick only to our own constituencies. They should visit constituencies in other provinces so as to show that Kenyan leaders are united. If leaders do not visit one another, it will be difficult for other people to know that we are all together. If we move together, however, this will bring our people together this is the example that His Excellency the President has shown us by moving round all provinces. Whenever he has visited a place, the whole country has gone out with him in order to support him. This is what we, as Members of Parliament, should emulate.The other point that I want to mention is that there sire many development projects that have been passed and now need to be implemented by Ministries. With regard to Government expenditure, a few Ministries will returning money to the Treasury at the end of this financial year, but this should not happen, this is the time for Ministry officials to see to it that all the money that has been voted for development of roads, health centres, and so on, is passed to implementing officers in the district. It is very sad for a classified road, for example, to remain untarmacked when a foreign country has donated money for this work.We have just passed a Bill to enable every voter in the country to vote without using symbols, and I think this is important. However, I think we should allow candidates to reproduce their photographs to accompany their names because some electors are unable to read. In this case, photographs will assist them.With these few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.</newspeech>MR. KIILU: Thank you, Sir, for giving me this opportunity so that I can join my colleagues in this Motion. I would like to say somethir about the Questions which have been brought by hon. Members to this House.I would like to request the Minister for Technical Training and Applied Technology to get up; etafflination centres in various parts of the count 17, because those students who go to sit for Trade Tests travel long distances in order to sit for these examinations. He, for example, should open a centre at Masinga so that our children do not travel long distances since they cannot afford transportation costs. There are many village polytechnics in my constituency and we deserve an examination centre. Parents would be greatly assisted if examination centres are set up within the reach of students.The other thing I would like to comment on is in respect of theQuestion which I brought to this House about a toll station at Thika whichis too close to another one. The Minister was kind enough by telling us thathe was going to study the issue, We would like one of the toll stations tobe removed because the two are quite close and our people would be verypleased. Since the Minister told us that he will study the situation first before he comes up with a solution, I would appeal to the Government to hear the cries of the people. We look forward to the Ministry to come up with a solution as soon as possible so that our people in Masinga and Yatta do not pay heavily at toll stations.The other thing I would like to talk about is in respect of the Ministry of Health. This Ministry promised as per the Question I brought to this House that it would provide an ambulance to Masinga Health Centre. This health centre is doing a good job but what it is lacking is an ambulance to transport patients to bigger hospitals. Since we are too far from the district hospital and we do not have an ambulance, I would appeal to the Minister to do all he can to provide us with this facility as soon as possible. This promise was made by the Minister when responding to my Question but nothing has been done to date.The other thing is about the Kenya Power and Lighting Company which is occupying land belonging to our people and they were not compensated. I would request this company to compensate the people adequately.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRYOF FINANCE(Mr. Keah): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Sir for giving me this opportunity to support this Motion of Adjournment. I would like to join my colleagues in thanking His Excellency the President for his wise leadership in guiding this country from properity to prosperity.Secondly, I would like to take this opportunity to congra¬tulate all the arms of Government,the Civil Service, industry and everybody for working together for the development of this country. I would also like to congratulate all the wananchi in Kenya, far maintaining peaces and stability in this Republic. I am aware that there are the disgruntled few who are bent on sabotaging and disrupting the development of this country. These ones will be doomed to failure.At this juncture in this festive of Christmas and the New Year it is time to ask those disgruntled few to take a new leaf and be reconciled with the rest of the people of this country and join in the economic deve¬lopment of our country. We have a very tough time ahead of us with the Gulf Crisis and many other crises in the world. We have the European market coming into being and people axe ganging together. It is time for us in Kenya to show the world that we are united, as solid as rock and that nobody can penetrate and woo us out of this development path that we are in.	I say so because with the Gulf Crisis in place, some people are likely to be tempted to think that with the increase in. commodity prices, the Government is not being mindful of the welfare of the people. During difficult times, it is important that we all brave ourselves together and face up with the economic realities that face the world over. At this juncture, I would like to say.that we have just passeda Bill on the Coast Development Authority. I look upon this Authority ?when it becomes an Act of Parliament as the salvation of the Coast people.this Authority	I look at this authority as a vehicle through which the Coast will accelerate in itsdevelopment processes ouch faster than has hitherto been the case; I look at itas a vehicle through which the coconut industry will be invigorated; it isalso a vehicle through which the cashewnut industry will be given a new leaseof life. It is also a means of employing the many jobless people at the Coast.It is also an instrument through which the landless Coast people will besettled and the squatter problem put to an end once and for all. It will assistthe	in the livestock development of the Coast area. We also hope that through this"Authority, the water problem that face many areas of the Coast will come toan end. because it will carry out research accordingly and it will do everythingpossible in order to ensure that the development of the Coast is enhanced.At this juncture, it is time to reflect on our duties as hon.Members of Parliament. We are going back to the land and it is importantthat we participate fully in the activities of the DDCs and more particularlyto visit development projects in our areas and see how the restrained resourcesthat we have are effectively utilized.	Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is now tine for me to wish, ayhon. colleagues in the House and all Kenyans a very merry Christmas and a prosperous new year. Thank you, Sir.</newspeech><newspeech>THE MINISTER EOH HEALTH (Mr. Eibaki): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to join ay fellow hon. Members first in thanking his Excellency President and congratulating him on the leadershiphe provided at the last Kanu Special Delegates Conference; it is the kind of leadership in Africa; it is the kind of leadership we in Kenya are used to. May the good Lord give him strength to continuein that way because that the only way where the future of Kenya lies.The views of wananchi which were given to the Kanu Review Committee were eventually respected. There is a saying that if you listen to the people you will never go wrong; so if we listen to the people we shall never go wrong. Therefore, as we adjourn we should continue to listen to the people and the fears that are in our hearts and souls; we should open our hearts and souls to hear the people in everything they say.During the recess we should strengthens Kanu. Instead of all the talk we engage in regarding the politics, we should realised that we are called upon to make Kanu a strong Party; a Party which people take seriously and a party which is seen to be nothing else other than what it says in its own manifesto; a Party that will gain respect. Since Independence you and I know we have had challenges and every time we have got over them because of unity through the Party; I am sure with this unity through the Party we shall succeed, but we have to strengthen the Party and forgetpromoting the "selves" in us.There is a lot of talk about tribalism; but those of us who have been observing what is going in Africai know one truth itwill not change even if we deny it that tribalism in Africa is noamong the ordinary peasant farmer or worker. These people havecommon problems they live together in slums and work together.We know that it is perfectly true in the whole of Africa thattribalism is at the political leadership level. So, we are serious about about abolishing it, then we have to start withourselves we have to start with the leadership of this country.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will not do this by talking orby pretence but through action. . You and I know that ordinary xza.judge us by our" actions and what we say. This is because we havesaid many things and changed our minds and said different things;some people do not even wait for two days before they contradictWhat they said a day ago. It is our actions that will show that weabandoned tribalism and started practising jskkm nationalism.Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I call upon every hon. Member tobecomea a public health officer during this recess. The pretencethat promotion public health can only be done by a Ministry anda few employees is entirely wrong Yesterday the President said in his Address the basic truth, that the responsibility for health is an for each citizen the state only helps. Therefore, if we can put the message to our villagers that the responsibility for health is for the individual and the state is helping a little; that you should clean where you live, eliminate breedings places for mosquitoes, rats and so on we shall become very good citizens and, as Members of Parliament, we shall be promoting our role. So, you are all hereby declared public health officers and pleasehelp us in that job.Finally I would like to wish everyone here a merry Christmas and a happy New Year. And we should all tighten our belts during 1991 because it will be a tough year we should not start looking for scapegoat; let us tell our people the whole truth. Thank you Sir.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL HERITAGE (Mr. Noor): Ahsante sana, Bw. Spika, k.va kunipa nafasi hii. Naungana na wenzangu katika Ho.ja hii na nataka kumshukuru Mtukufu Rais kva uongozi wake azuri ambao umetufaidi sana katika nchi hii. Tuna jukumu kubwa la kui.jenga nchii hii na njia nzuri ya kufanya hivi ni k.va kufuata mfano wa Mtukufu Rais.Jambo moja mbaya ni kwamba kuna watu ambao wame jitokeza J kupinga kila jambo linaloamuliwa na 3unge hili au Rais wetu. Juzi tuliambiwa 3 mlolongo ni mbaya na tukakaa na kuamua kuuondolea mbali. Sasa tunaambiwa mipango ya kutumia wilaya kama chanzo cha maendeleo mashambani, maziwa ya nzs watoto wa shule na mfumo wa elimu wa 3-4-4 ni mbaya. Ikiwa tutaendelea mbele janbo hili ni lazima likome.             Tuna nchi nyingine ambako Serikali haina wajibu wowote hazijishughuiishikwavwatu wake na elimu au afya ya watu wake. Kwasababu hii shule na hospitali zetu katika sehemu za mpakani zimejaa watu kutoka nchi jirani. Kwa hivyo, inafaa tuyaheshimu maendeleo yetu na kukuza awHai. umoja wa taifa.Vile vile inafaa tuangalie ulimwengu unavyoendelea na  kufanya mabadiliko yatakayochukuana vizuri na matukio mengine iaxiajax ulimwenguni ili tuendelee kuwatumikia watu wetu ipasavyo. Hatuwezi kuiendeleza nchi yetu kwa kusema tu. Ni lazima sisi sote, hasa sana Mawaziri, tutembelee kila wilaya ya nchi yetu na kuwaeleza wauanchi kuhusu n Wizara zao. Hii ni kwa sababu Mawaziri wakitembelea mawakilisho yao pekee sehemu nyingine hazitakuwa na Wa hivyo Bw.Spika, ni lazima tujitolee na kuwaeleza wananchi mat at i so yatakayotukabili siku sijazo. Ni lazima tuwaeleze watu ni huduma gani ambazo Serikali inaweza kuwatolea na wao piawanahitajika kujisaidia kwa njia gani.Utaona kwamba tunapoongejuu ya kugawana gft grama. watu wengine wanatupinga; wanataka kuiwekelea Serikali mizigo yote. Kwa hivyo ni lazima tujitokeze nakuwaambia watu wetu ukweli.'Jainbo la mwisho ni kwamba Varna sisi tunaweza kuitumia mali ya nchi hii kwa njia nzuri tunaweza kuendelea. Tukitumia vyema Trial i ya nchi Mi ha tut awe z a kutukanwa na nrtu ye yote. Hatutawe za kutishwa kwamba misaada tunayopewa kutoka ngambo itakatizwa ikiwa tutaitunza mali ya nchi hii. Mali ya nchi hii ikitunzwa vizuri inaweza kumwezesha Utukufu Rais kuiongoza nchi hii bila shida nyingi. Kwa hayo machache naunga mkono.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER POR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Muturia): Ahsante sana, Bw. Spika, kwa kunipatia nafasi hii ili nami niungane na Wabunge wenzangu katika kuongea juu ya Hoja hii. Kwanza kabisa ningependa kumshukuru Mtukufu Rais kwa kuiongoza nchi hii kwa uangalifu inwingi. Hii ni kwa sababu kuna fisi wengi ambac wangependa kuiangamiza nchi hii.: Hata hivyo Mtukufu Rais anekuwa dereva ambaye anaendesha leva uangalifu sana.Kwa vile wakati ni mfupi kuna jambo moja ambalo ningependa kutaja. Wale waliohudhuria sherehe za Jamhuri Deipale Uhuru Park jana waliona jambo la kushangaza. Ninasema hivi kwa sababu watu wa Kenya wana imani na Mtukufu Rais. Wale waliokuwa pale Uhuru Park jana waliona mambo ya ajabu. Wakati huo mvua i ilinyesha kwa nguvu lakini wazalendo wa Kenya waliivumilia mvua hiyo na hakuna hata mmo ja ambaye alikimbia k.7enda kutafuta .mahali pa kujificha.Wote walisubiri kwa hamu. kubwa licha 2 yaHiyo ni ishara kubwa ya mapenzi ya watu wa Kenya kwa Rais wao.Waandishi wa liabari wa hapa nchini na wale wa kigeni walikuwa pale Uhuru Park. Kwa hivyo ningewaomba waandishi wa habari ya kutoka Ujerumani, Uingereza na Sauti ya Amerika, waandike ukweli ukweli va jana. Yafaa wasijaribu kuuficha ukweli huo wa jana; kwamba wananchi wa Kenya wako tayari kuvumi 1.1 a mvua kubwa ili waive sekuisikiliza hotuba ya Mtukufu Rais. Kulinyesha mvua kubwa usiku wa kuamkia Jamhuri Dei na wengi walidhani kwamba sherehe hizo hazinge hudhuriwa na watu wengi." Lakini watu walifika kwa wingi. Ukiangalia sasa utaona kwamba uwanja wa : Uhuru Parka umegeuka na kuwa nB7ekundu kwa sababu ya matope; nyasi yote ilikwisha. Yafaa picha7ambazo zilipigwa hapo jana i zionyeshwe kote duniani.'Jambo la msisho ni . kwajnba barabara ya kutoka Maili Tatu hadi makao makuu ya tarafa ya Ntonyiri imeharibika kabisa. Kwa hivyc tungetaka ofisa .anayehusika na barabara katika sehemu hiyoajaribu kuirekebisha barabara hiyo. Kuna sehemu fulani za barabara hiyo ambazo zimeharibika kabisa na yafaa zirekebishwe ili wananchi waweze kusafiri hadi Lare, Mutuati Police Station na kadhalika.Sasa tunakwenda likizoni. Kwa hivyo yafaa kila LIbunge  ajaribu kuwasaidia watu wa mawakilisho yake ili waweze kujiandikisha chamaiii kwa wingi ili chama .Kanu kiwe na nguvu zaidi Tukifanya hivyo wakati tutak.wenda  . Kasarani wakati m.Yingine kile nrtu atakuwa ametoshekakwamba ante of any a kazi nsuri ya kuandikisha watu wengi chamani.Kwa hayo machache ,nawataki a nyinyi nyote Wabunge Krismasi yenye furaha nyingi.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TECHNICAL TRAINING ANDAPPLIED TECHNOLOGY (Mr. Nyakiamo): Ahsante sana Bw.Spika kwa kunipanafasi ili nami niseme machache. Kwanza ningependa kompongesa irtokuf".Rais . wetu kwa kazi nzuri ambayo anaifanyia nchi hii.' Jambo la kwanza ambalo ningetaka kulitaja ni kwamba wakati wa ulewa wajumbe wa Kami si si tulipewa nafasi ya kuongea bila woga. Wakati huo pia Mtukufu Rais alisema kwamba yatupasa kuyatoa maoni yetu bila woga ili kuionyesha dunia nzima kwamba sisi tuna demokrasia. Lakini zaidi ya yote matakwa ya wananchi yalitekeleswa.Sisi tuliyaLkubali maoni ya watu wetu. Hata hivyo, Mtukufu Rais, kwa	unyenyekevu mwingi aliuliza hivi Je, wenzangu nikiwaomba mnisaidie mtafanya hivyo?" Watu wote waliitikia"Ndio" Aliendelea kuzitaja shida ambazo zinatukabili na akasema kwamba bila ya sisi kuwa nyuma yake.Sisi tulimuunga mkono Mtukufu Rais. Wakati wa kwenda likizoni umefika na ni lazima tuwaambia watu wetu yale yaliyotokea pale Kasarani ili tuweze kukipatia chama chetu nguvu zaidi.	Juzi naibu mwenyekiti wangu kutoka Mbit a aliniuliza hivi: "Mheshimiwa tutafanya nini ili tuweze kuwaeleza watu wetu mambo ' hay a yote?"  mi nilijibu kwamba si situtakuwa na mkutano kule Mbit a mnamo tarehe 14 Januari, 1991. Mwaka huu tumeona mengi; tumesuiminwa na nchi za ng'ambo wakitwambia "Paryeni hivi na hivi." Nilimwambia rafiki yangu mmoja kwamba ikiwa kiongozi wa nchi hii atasimama imara ataheshimiwa zaidi kwa sababu watu watajua kwamba huwezi kumshika sikio na kumvuta hadi kule unakotaka. Yeye amesemama imara. Yeye ndiye . ishara ya Uhuru wa nchi hii.: Ningeyaomba magazeti yaandike kwa uangalifu sana. Sisemi kwamba hatupaswi kutolewa makosa.Sisi ni binadamu na tuna makosa. Lakini kuna constructive criticism na vile vile kuna destructive criticism.'	Hayo ndiyo tunayotaka basi. Je, ni nchi gani unapata mtu mkubwa akija kunyenyekea ..mbele yako huku akiacha ukubwa wake? Nilifundishwa na Father Omara Mang'o katikaKabaa na Mang'u, na akasema, "All I want from you people is to stand on principle:If you are keeping your religion, make sure it is not deep skin religion, and ifyou are keeping your character, jishinde usinde. Show that you can control yourselfand then you will be able to control others". Ni hivi majuzi tu Mtukufu raisalisema, "Jishinde usinde". Aliposema hivyo nilijivuna sana moyoni na nikasemakwamba waliokuwa wakitufundisha walijua vile walivyokuwa wakifanya.. Hata leo tunaambiwa tuj ishinde tushinde.Bw. Spika, jambo la mwisho ambalo nataka kusema ni kwamba unyenyekevuambao tumeonyeshwa na Mtukufu Rais wafaa kuwa mfano kwetu. Je, tuko tayari kuonyeshaunyenyekevu kama huo kwa watu wengine? Tunaposema Nyayo, upendo na amani, je,tuko tayari kunyenyekea kwa wengine?

I caught your eye just ontime.Sir, let me join my colleagues in thanking His Excellency the President for the wonderful job he has done for this nation, leading us through very trying moments when most of the world was against Kenya If thinking that, there was no democracy in this country. But now the whole world stands to see that thee is a lot of democracy in this country and that the citizens of Kenya are together with His Excellency the President in supporting the Government.Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no doubt that we have been having a lot of criticism coming from no other place but the church. I think we should ask church leaders to concentrate in leading their flock from hell, if anything to heaven, but not leading this nation into the fire of chaos and trouble. Last week I was reading an article in the newspapers where a church member was criticising develop¬ment in some parts of this country, saying that roads should not be constructed in certain areas and this or the other should not be done in some parts of this country. Everybody In this country should enjoy the benefit of development, and every part of this country has every right to be developed by being given whatever infrastructure the Government can afford. Therefore, that particular church leader should be advised properly that all Kenyans are enjoying under the wise leadership of His Excellency the President and, indeed, the direction he has taken towards the development of this nation. We shall stand to support the Government, His Excellency the President day and night and our leadership should be transparent. What someone says during the day should be the same thing that he says at night and there should be no double edge in the leadershipof this country.Mr. Speaker, Sir that which goes with democracy is openness. When leaders speak on issues, theyshould not be told that they are criticising the Government or some other certain leaders. We took an oath of office when we came to Parliament,that we are going to work with dedication and serve the country and, indeed, protectthe interest of the Government. It is that particular oath And in Ukambani we believe very strongly in oath because if you do not live by the word of the oath you die. Therefore, we live strongly to defend the particular oath we took in this House, that we will protect the Government, work for the interest of the citizens of this country and work night and day, supporting His Excellency the President. The whole world should, therefore, know that we stand to support HisExcellency until all the days that God has given him to be alive are over, and we are not going back on that. We continue to thrive under his wise leadership, continue to enjoy the benefits of independence and we will continue to be faithful citizens of this country at all times.Moving briefly from that, I wish to urge all hon. Members to go back to the constituencies, work diligently for the people and also wish to urge allGovernment officers in the field to try and There has been a lot of rumourgoing round that Government workers have a lot of laxity. We know that a lot of them have been doing a very good job to serve this country, and faithfully so. But you find that there are a few elements that cause dissatisfaction. It is those few that we are appealing to so that they can discharge their duties with faith¬fulness and honesty because Kenya is our country. Kenya tommorow will be what we make it today, and all Kenyans should realise that nobody will come and make Kenya a better place other than ourselves. If anything, other people who are envious will try to destroy what we have put up. Therefore, it is important that sill Kenyans must put the interest of this country first before they consider their own interests. Personal interests should come third. The interest of the country should come first, the interest of the people second and personal interests third. That is God's spirit of work. God comes first, your neighbour second and then the person who is doing it comes last. That should be the same spirit that thleaders of this country should adopt.In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Government for all the development it has put in Kibwezi Constituency and request the Ministry of Public Works to try and put more roads in the constituency.With those few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TECHNICAL TRAINING AND APPLIED TECHNOLOGY (Mr. Thuo): Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chance to also join my hon. colleagues in this debate pending the Recess we are about to start.Sir, I would like to start by thanking His Excellency the President for the way in which he has steered this country to higher spirits in development. Every time we attend His Excellency the President's national functions we hear new things. We hear him giving us new spirit. We owe His Excellency the President a lot of things for whatever he has been able to do for this country and for that which he is prepared to do. He loves Kenya and I think we also have a right to also love and help him.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Kanu Delegates' Conference was a case in point. During that day when we adopted in total His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance's Committee report commonly known as the Saitoti Report people realised how much the President is loved. He stood and told the people how much he respected Kenyans. He asked them, "Suppossing I asked you for something, would you go with me?" That is the day that the people who were in that conference realised that the President of Kenya is very much loved by Kenyans because we all answered in the affirmative. And then we came out with somethithat we were discus¬sing here and there, and finally we were able to do away with the issue of mlolongo.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope that by going to secret ballot fairness will be seen to be done. This country will depend by and large on hard work, as we have been told by His Excellency the President. Let us not cheat ourselves or try to think that things will happen because they have to. We have to make things happen.We have a major problem of unemployment in this country.and I do urge that the Ministry of Industry I know the Minister,hon. Otieno,is very capable to expand our industries. Let usnot try to think that industrialisation of this country will helpKenyans the moment it continues to be in the hands of foreigners. ofThe more of our people get involved in commerce and industry the morethey will create employment for this nation. Therefore, all the Finance institutions should help in this area of business expansion.They should also give loans to the farming comr.unity of our people.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to pass a word of "thanks"to people of Kigumo Constituency because they have heeded HisExcellency the President's advice to work hard. They have workedhard and there is a lot of coffee in Kigumo. They have also managed bigto get big bonuses from tea and I urge them to take care of the money because life will be very difficult from January, next year. They have also started horticultural farming which every Kenyan is doing. Let us support, our constituents in whatever they are doing.I wish all the hon. Members a happy Christmas! Thank you. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. ANASWA: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. First of all, I would like to thank His Excellency the President for having given us one very important point. For example, His Excellency the President was moving around in Nairobi recentlyseeing for himself what was going on with wananchi. He came acrosa food kiosk and found an old mama. He was able to share somefood from the kiosk with the old mama. In which country would ycufind a President sharing food in a kiosk with wananchi? None,other than Kenya. Therefore, I would like to congratulate very much His Excellency the President for showing that example and hope that other hon. Members will follow his example.Another example is yesterday when His Excellency the President gave a wonderful speech during the Jamhuri Day. It has been said here that although it was raining heavily many people stood there listening to the speech ana they wanted to go on listening inspite of the rain.	The next congratulations goes to you, Sir, personally. First of all, you have been able to run the business of this House in a most dignified manner. You have been very fair to everybod. In fact to prove this, for the first time, hon. Jonathan Masinde Nominated Member to have spoken today, I give you credit. That was wonderful. Even hon. Nyakiamo spoke today after a very long time I. This is due to your kindness and fairness, and I thank you very much for giving every hon. Member a chance to speak, (applause)Also, Sir, you have been able to lead us, after the morn¬ing session on Wednesdays, to our Parliamentary church or prayers. We have come together and shared the word of God. I thank you very much for this good gesture. Please, continue that way. Next time most of us will be with you to know God more and send our problems to Him.Also, Sir, I would like to thank the Leader of Govern¬ment Business and the Deputy, Ministers and Assistant Ministers and also hon. Members for their co-operation. The way in which we have been looking at the various Motions and amendments hasbeen impressive. There has been a lot of unity in the House.There is a point that I would like to emphasise here.	:This is the idea of unemployment. There is population explosion in Kenyaand it Trill remain there. We are educating very many people inKenya and we shall continue doing so. All these people are lookng for ways of getting their livelihood, mainly through, employment. However, I would like to appeal to our Members that unemployment will always be there and every person is supposed to be able to fed for himsel Tor instance, you will find an Asian with a masters degree work¬ing in a shop. Therefore, self-employment should be encouraged to our people. For instance, you will find that somebody has teni¬ae res of land, he has no employment, but he is not making use of the land. I think it is high time we told our people that self- employment is very important. The Government cannot employ every¬body. Let us become self-employed and earn a living.Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of my people. I want to thank the Government for what it has done for us, and I hope it is going to give us more aid. For example, we would like to have a vehicle at Malava Health Centre. I am appealing to the Ministry of Health to give us a vehicle at Malava Health Centre to help us. Thank you very much.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND HOUSING (Mr .Mutiso): Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opporturd? so that I may join my colleagues to say a few things in support of this important Motion.First of all, I want to take this opportunity to say that blessed is the nation whose Lord is King. I think, through the efforts of His Excellency the President, being a church-goer every Sunday, he has taught many hon. Members to turn to God. Also, you, Sir, in this House, have cultivated a lot of Christianity among the hon. Members. You have actually rejuvenate their faith in that every Wednesday morning you request hon. Membe to go to the chapel here, and by so doing many hon. Members' faith has been consolidated. I Would like to thank you very much for that great effort and service for the Lord. Having said that, let me thank His Excellency the President for the love he has for this country. One thing that people must have a lot of assurance about is security in the country. They know that when they go to sleep there are enough guards to ensure that there is security all round. With that knowledge, one can comfortably sleep and snore. What we saw yesterday was a great demonstration of faith and confidence. Such can only come through a man who has faith in his people. The security of the nation is very important; it is the key to the existence of such a nation. What was demonstrated yesterday was unbelieveable but, because some of these things are invisible, we do not know how we are. A curtain was, however, lifted yesterday and we had a glimpse of how we are protected.Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me say that we are very grateful. That actually consolidates our faith and trust in His Excellency the President because he knows what he is doing. The security of this nation comes first. With that knowledge, we can peacefully go home and sleep soundly because we know that we are protected. Our army personnel are alert and are armed to the teeth. For that reason, our security cannot be played about with. Let me thank God for that and also for having given us a man in the person of His Excellency the President to lead this nation. That is a gift from heaven.Sir, you can not always find good people to lead a nation. A nation with a shaky leadership cannot last and that is why for the last 27 years since the attainment of our Independence, we have peace. The founder of the nation started the leadership well and later handed over the power after he passed away to another more able man, who took the reins of this nation. You can now see what we have around us. You can count very many innumerable developments. We have Nyayo wards, buses,stadia and so on. Beyond that we have what was revealed yesterday. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to say that Kenya is proud to have this great son of this land as its leader. His Excellency the President has given the kind of love that was demonstrated yesterday when that multitude braved the rains at Uhuru Park. You must have seen the down¬pour but the people could not be moved as they were listening to the words of His Excellency the President.MR. ANGELEI: Ahsante sana, Bw. Spika, kwa kunipa nafasi pi a niseme machache katika Hoja hii ya kuliahirisha Bunge. Nitaanza kwa kumpongeza Mtukufu Rais kwa yale mengi ambayo ameyafanyia nchi yetu, na hata hayawezi kuhesabika. Hii inaonyesha kwamba Mtukufu Rais ana roho moja ya kuwasaidia sio tu wananchi wa Kenya, bali hata wengine wa kutoka nje. Mtukufu Rais alionyesha vitendo alipokuwa mwenyekiti wa Muungano wa Nchi Huru za Afrika na watu wa Afrika nzima walifurahia. Ninatumaini kwamba sote tutaufuata mfano wa huyu mwalimu wetu, kwa kuwa Mtukufu Rais ni mwalimu wetu mzuri.Bw. Spika, Mtukufu Rais ametufunza mengi, kati yao kupendana na kukaa na amani. Hata wakati kama huu ambapo kuna msukosuko duniani, Mtukufu Rais ameyatuliza mambo mengi na kutuonyesha njia tunayopaswa kuifuata ili tusipotee. Ninarapongeza kwa mambo mengi sana, na hata nitaje jinsi alivyouongoza mkutano wa Kanu huko Kasarani. Watu wengi duniani kote walingojea kwa hamu kuona ni kitu gani kingefanyika katika ndcutano huo na ni furaha kubwa kwetu kwa kuwa waliweza kuthibitisha	^yote yaliyofanyika huko, tena wazi wazi. Uazungu walialikwa hata kutoka nje ili kufika hapana kujiangalilia jinsi mambo yalivyokuwa yakiendeshwa. Hili ni dhihirisho kwa dunia zima kwamba Watu wa Kenya si watu wa kuwa wakichezewa ovyo.Bw. Spika, hata vibaraka wa nchi zinazotuchochea huko nje, pia, walidhihirishiwa wazi kwamba tuna imani na nchi yetu na Mtukufu. Rais P1aUkitoka hapa na kwenda katika sehemu za mashambani, watu wote huko wanamjua tu Mungu na Moi. Wakiwa na huzuni ama furaha, wana imani ya Mungu na Moi tu. Ninatumaini kwamba sisi sote, kama viongozi, tutajitahidi kuwa tukifanya jinsi tunavyoambiwa na Mtukufu Rais na, kwa kufanya hivyo, tutaweza kupiga hatua nyingi zaidi kuliko zile tulizopiga. Nawasihi viongozi wote kuuiga mfano wa Mtukufu Rais katika mawakilisho yetu na hata kwingineko.Bw. Spika, wakati kama huu wa likizo, lingekuwa ni jambo bora sana kama Mawaziri wangezuru sehemu zetu za mashambani ili kuangalia jinsi miradi mbali mbali iliyoanzishwa inatekelezwa. Kwa kuwa tuna Makamu wa Rais na Waziri wa Fedha, ningependa kusema kwamba alichunguze lile jambo la misaada tunayopata kutoka nchi za ng'ambo ikiwa na masharti mengi. Hatutaki kuona kwamba tumepata misaada fulani ya maendeleo na baadaye pia tunaambiwa ni lazima kuletwe wale wanaojulikana kama "expatriates". Tuna ujuzi wa kutosha kuyaendeleza mambo yetu na, wakati huo huo, ni jukumu letu kubwa kuhakikisha kwamba watu wetu wamepatiwa nafasi za kufanya kazi. Tusiletewe hawa "expatriates" na kumbe ni makachero wa kupeleka mambo huko kwao. Jambo kama hilo likwame.Bw. Spika, nikitoa mfano, tumebaki na shida nyingi sana kwa sababu ya miradi iliyoachwa hivyo tu na Norad. Ningemtaka Makamu wa Rais na Waziri wa Fedha ahakikishe kuwa miradi kama hiyo iliyoachwa na Norad imechukuliwa na Wizara mbali mbali zinazohusika, na pengine kuziongezea Wizara hizo pesa kidogo, ili miradi hiyo isianguke na ikamilishwe ifaavyo. Tusipofanya hivyo, basi itakuwa kwamba miradi kama hiyo itaanguka kabisa.Kwa hayo machache, naunga mkono.Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for giving me this chance to support this Motionfor the Adjournment of the House. I would like to say that we are grateful tonote that His Excellency the President has accomplished a lot of thinjs duringSession. I would like to mention, in particular the annual Delegates Conference that was conducted by His Excellency the President at Kasarani. Today	those people either here or abroad who have been thinkin that our Presidentdoes not have the support of the people, have now changed their mind. sowhat happened at Kasarani Annual Debates Conference, was a good demonstrationto the entire world that Kenyans are ajle to mind their own business.Mr. Speaker, Sir, there has been times in the recent past whan we certainHeard certain people in this country saying that this Parliament should be dissolved.I cannot hesitate to say that the reason why we have some people talking likethis is because they have a lot of jealous due to the process  we have alreadymade a in our development. It is true that we are the true elected representativeof the people and therefore we stand here with the mandate of the people of thiscountry. It therefore follows that whatever we do or say in this House, we doso on behalf of the people of Kenya Nobody can stand on a platform any where in the country and claim to represent the wananchi of this country.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank His .Sxceilencythe President for the successful Haranibee that he conducted in Butere recently. The Butere people do appreciate this great endeavour on part of our President, and they asked me to convey their thanks to him. This was a most excellent Harambee and the Butere people axe most grateful to the President. They were most ratified to have noticed that His Excellency the President did appreciate the taste of Butere kuku and ugali. This was a very great day for us in Butere and we would all like His Excellency the President to ginaaTalj accept our sincere thanks for this achievement.Having said that Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would now like to say a few things regarding a few Government Ministries. I would first like to say somethingabout the Ministry of Health. During the recess which is now in front of us in is my special appeal to the Minister for Health to consider establishing.a parastal to be dealing specifically with the importation of drugs andf pharmaceutical equipment into this country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am saying this became we are at the moment being faced with a very critical shortage of essential drugs in our hospitals. This is because we have left the whole business of buying and selling of drugs to foreign companies which are do in the importation of these drugs for our hospitals. This means we are left at their mercy because they are the ones who decide the price of these drugs and medines. Mr. Speaker, Sir, having said that, I would like to say somethingabout the Ministry of Agriculture. At the moment, the people in the whole of KhwiseroDivision in my Constituency, do not have any cash crop and for thisreason, I would like to appeal to the Ministry of Apiculture to allow the	Khwisero people  to plant tea. These people are very anxiovs to plant tea and we would like the Khwisero area to be gazetted as a tea growing zone.	Mr.	Speaker, Sir, having said that I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to hon. Members to go out during, the recess and tell the Kenyans the truth regarding the oil crisis in the world today is we all know, the oil crisis that we are facing is as a result of the Gulf war.Therefore, we must tell our people the truth. When oil prices are hiked, the price of everything else goes up.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. BONYO: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to associate myself with my colleagues in supporting this Motion for the adjournment. This adjournment comes at a very appropriate time so that the hon. Members of this House may go out and join fellow countrymen in preparing land for next year's crop and participate in other activities that rae necessary in our livelihood.After saying this, I would now like to thank His Excellency the President very much for being responsive to the wishes and aspirations of Kenyans and for being mindful of the welfare of our people. The President has been working tirelessly throughout this year trying to maintain the peace, which we so much cherish in this country and effect development programmes in the country. For this reason, we thank him immensely. The President is far more long sighted than most of us in seeing what is good for us in future. It is because of this that he has always been very mindful of whatever takes place in this country.Throughout this year, we have had a few occasions of turbulence arising from irresponsible utterances by some Kenyans in this country. In this respect, I want to make reference to various utterances that have been made by the clergy, lawyers and other Kenyans which tended to becloud our search for peace.The President, through his wisdom, recently guided Kanu delegates towards reaching certain decisions which will have far reaching effects to this country. The turbulence we have had is now almost gone, but I would like, at this juncture, to appeal to the Attorney—General to make sure that in future people are held responsible for the consequences of their own actions. We would not wish to see the people who mar the good name of this Government either locally or overseas going scot free. We, as Kenyans, know that we are responsible for our own destiny, and we would not like to be told by thouse who do not love this country about things that happen in other countries. Let us remain what we   are in Kenya and lead our own lives, We must not ape what is happening in foreign countries.</Newspeech>  	<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Kachila): Asante sana, Bw. Spika, cua kunipa nafasi hii ili naoi nizungunze juu ya Hoja hii.	TKwanza kabisa ningependa kusema juu ya mambo ambayo yametokeaKatika hiki oh a Bunge tunachofunga leo. Ningependa kumshukuru Mtukufu Rais kwa vile ametuonyesha busaranying i sana katika mambo mengi.Kwa hakika, sisi tfabunge ni lazima tujikaze sana ili tuufuate mfano huu wakuona mbele. Ingefaa pia mazungumzo yetu yawe ya kujenga kama ya Mtukufu Rais.Wakati awingine, mazungumzo yetu yanaleta chuki kati ya wananchi. Nakubalianana.Hotuba ya Mtukufu Rais aliyotoa jana katika Uhuru Park ambayo ilifana sana.Tniirinj sisi sote tujifunze kwa sababu, kwa mfano, sisi kama Mawaziri tunaacha	kazi zetu mpaka wakati Mssx mambo yanaaribika Mtukufu Rai3 anatoa amri amat;anazifanya yeye awenyewe.Hi wajibu sisi kama viongozi tuonyeshe uaminifu wetu kikamilifu na sio kwa mazungumzo tu. Hata kazini inafaa tutumike vyema. Jana na hata juzi tulipokuwa katika mkutana rytalum wa Xanu kule Xasarani, Mtukufu Rais alionyesha busara nyingi. sana kwa dunia nzima na kwa taifa hili la IGenya kwa kutatua mambo ambayo yalikuwa yanatukumba. Tunasukumwasukumwa na nchi nyir.gine za nje ambazo zinataka tuishi vile zinavyotaka. Ni lazima tusimame vile tuiivyo.Kwa hivyo, ninamshukuru Mtukufu ifiais::kva kazi nzuri ambayo ameifanyia nchi hii. Nami nasema kwamba nitasimaari a upande wangu kama vile wajibu wangu unavyostahili kumsaidia Mtukufu Rais. Huu msimu tunaofunfa leo, uliknwa wenye mambo mengi kwetu sisi viongozi. Nakubaliana na yale yaliyosemwa na Mtukufu Rais juu ya mazungumzo yetu hadharani. Nilisema siku moja hapa kwaiaba tukichukuwa wakati mwingi kwa kugombana na watu wa makanisa na watu wengine, hatutafaidika. kwa sababu tutaleta vita vingi. Kama Rais alivyosema, mtu akizidi katika vitendo vyake, basi achukuliwe hatua za kisheria. Mtu akisemajanibo ambalo 1 inaweza kuleta shida na misukosuko, basi afuatwe vizuri na atueleze kile anachotaka kinaganaga. Kwa hivyo, tukubaliane sasa kwamba ingefaa sheria ifanye kazi. Kwa mfano, kama otu amesema kitu fulani, afaatwe ili atoe aaoni zaidi kuhusu jaabo hilo. Ikiwa hawezi kuthibitisha, sheria if any e kazi yake. tfakubaliana na jambo hili kabisa.	Hashukuru kwa sababu Hoja nyingi zimepitiahva hapa na ningependa kuguzia tu juu ya ili tuliyopitisha hapa ambayo ilikuwa r.hini ya Wizara ya Eliioi. Kwa mfano, katika aawakilisho yetu, wazazi havana uvezo wa knwalipia vatoto vao karo. Ingefaa karo katika za taifa zive sawa. Tkiwa kila shule itatoza karo yake, haitakuwa vxzuri. Ingefaa pia wakuu wa shule na board of governors wasiachwe kufanya vile wanavyotaka.Bw. Spika, pia naishukuru Wizara yetu ya Elimu. kwa kazi ngumu inayofanya. Lakini tunataka iengalie mzigo wanaobeba waalimu: inafaa kila mwalimu awe na. idadi ya vipindi..vya masomo inayofaa baadal ya kufunza vipindi vya masomo kama katika siku moja. Mpango wa elimu wa ni mzuri na hatutaki xkf hufunzwe kijuu juu.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFOffilATION AND BROADCASTHTG (Mr. Nassir): Bw. Spika, ahsante sana kwa kunipa nafasi hii ili niongee. Ningependa ku washukuru watu waliohudhuria mkutano maalum wa wajumbe wa Kanu wiki jana kva sababu imani kwao wenyewe na ka Mtukufu Rais. Tuna jua karibu watu wote katika mkutano huo s. waliunga mkono mlolongo. Lakini kwa sababu ya lawama tunazopata magazetini kutoka nchi za nje Rais alitushauri tuuondoe mlolongo. Hakuna hivi kwa sababu ya kumogopa mtu yeyote. Lakini kuna Mbunge mmoja aliyekuja katika Bunge hili na alipokuta wenye viti wa Kanu wameenda kuwasindikiza wajumbe wa mkutano huo akasema watu wa mlolongo wameona haya na kukimbia. Huyo ni Mbunge mdogo wa juzi juzi anayeitwa Kiliku. Lakini nasema hivi</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order, Mr. NassirJ I will never get tiredof reminding hon. Members that they must continue to respect each other. If you want to discuss any other hon. Member, you must bring a substantive Motion.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Nassir): Bw. Spika, nayaondea maneno hayo ambayo ulimi umeteleza na kuyasema.Nina fur aha kuona Serikali imeleta hapa Mswada wa kuondoaalama za uchanguzi. Tumekuwa tunatumia alama za kutuita wanyama kamandovu, nyoka, paka, xsg sungura na punda rnilia. Lakini leo Bungehili leo limepitisha kvamba kila mgombea uchanguzi at a  uli Lean a kva jina lake. Hii ni sababu mtundiye. anayechaguliwa na si mnyama. Hili asababu hatujui Bunge litafunguliwa lini.  Kwa sisi ambao hupenda kusema sana ningependa kusema kwamca yafaa turudi nyxunbani ili tukawazungumzie wale waliotupatia " kura. Katuendi likizoni bali twaenda kufanya kazi; tunaenda kuwatu mikia wale ambao walitupatia kura. Jambo kubwa katika nchi hii yetu ni kunipa heshima anayostahili Mtukufu Rais. Ikiwa tunataka kuishi kwa usalama na kama tunataka ulimwengu wote utupende na kutuheshimu ni lazima tumheshimu	• Mtukufu Rais wetu. KilaRais atakayeitawala nchi hii siku zijazo atastahili heshima ya watu wote wa nchi hii. Watu wengine wanasema kwamba wale wanaosema sana juu ya Serikali hawasemi kwa sababu wanaichukia Serikali bali kwa sababu wanaipenda nchi hii. Huo ni uwongo mtupul Hbona wao hawayataji yale mema yanayofanywa na Serikali? Je, kazi yao ni kutoa makosatu?	Je, wao hawawezi kuyaona yalemazuri yanayofanywa na Serikali yetu?Etfa hayo machache naunga znkono.</Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR. A.K. KINYAN JUI: Ahsante sana Bw. Spika, kwa kunipanafasi hii ili nami niweze kutoa maoni yangu juu ya Hoja hii. Kwanzakabisa ningependa kunrtolea shukrani nyingi. Mtukufu Rais. Hii ni kwasababu kama vile Wenzangu walivyosema, Mtukufu Rais ameiongozanchi hii kwa njia nzuri. Maongozi yake yanewashangaza watu wengiambao walikuwa wananrtilia shaka. Ni kweli kwamba hivi majuzi watuwengi walikuwa wakidhani kwamba Kenya yetu imepotea njia. Hayayote yalitokana na taarifa za kutisha na ambazo hazikuwa na msingi wo wote ambazo zili andikwa na magazeti ya ng'ambo. Hata hivyo, niaceni niseme kwamba Mungu muumba wetu ni mkuu. Hii ni kwa sababuanwezesha Mtukufu Rais kuiongoza nchi hii kwa raakini . na watuwengi ambao wamezoea kuitoa makosa Serikali wameaibika sana. Kwahivyo sisi tunamshukuru sana Mtukufu Rais na tunauyvombeabaraka zake Mwenyezi Mungu ili azidi kutuongoza. Bw. Spika, jukumu letu kubwa ni kumsaidia Mtukufu Rais. Ni lazima sisi tuyazingatie mawaidha yake ili nchi hii izidi kuendelea mbele. Pia sisi kama viongozi tuna jukumu kubwa kuwaunganisha watu wa nchi hii kwa sababu hayo ndiyo	"mapenzi yake Mtukufu Rais.Maneno yetu na vitendo vyetu vinaweza kuimarisha umoja katika nchi hii. Kwa hivyo sisi kama viongozi ni lazima tuungane na kufanya kazi pamoja ili nchi yetu izidi kuendelea.Kwa hivyo tunapoelekea kule mashambani yafaa Mawaziri wajaribu kuzitembelea sehemu mbali mbali za nchi hii ili waweze kujionea maendeleo yanayofanyika. Pia Mawaziri wakifanya ziara kama hivyo wananchi watapata nafasi ya kusema na wao. Kule kwangu lari tuna taabu ya maji. Hii ni kwa sababu ile mashine ya kupiga imeibiwa na sehemu za Limuru, Kikuyu hazina maji.Tungependa kuona Wizara ya Maji sasa ikifanya kazi ili watu wa sehemu za Lari, Kikuyu na kwingineko wafaidike.Bw. Spika, kwa wakati huu tunataka miradi ya maendeleo ambayo tayari imeanzishwa ipatiwe nafasi ya kumalizika na kutekelezwa ili tukipata pesa tuweze kuanzisha miradi mingine. Kwa mfano, barabara ambazo zimeanzishwa kwa wakati huu zingemalizika kabila ya kuanza nyingine. Jambo hilo litatusaidia kwa sababu yale machache ambayo tayari tumeanzisha yatamalizika.Tunajua kwamba ni mwongozo wa Serikali yetu kuhakikisha kwamba miradi ambayo inaendelea kwa wakati huu imepatiwa pesa ili itekelezwe. Kwa hayo machache, Bw. Spika, naunga mkono.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

Members in congratu¬lating His Excellency the President for the excellent, able, wise and devoted leadership that he has exhibited in all these years in his capacity as the President of the nation and as well as the President of the ruling party, Kanu. The depths of his wisdeom were recently shown during the Kanu Delegates' Conference at Kasarani, when all of us heard what we had to say in favour of the mlolongo mehtod of nomination by the Kany system. It was through the President's foresight and understanding of things as they are that saved the day.Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me thank His Excellency the President for whathe has done in enabling the Ministry of Education to start the Kitui Teachers College. All other things aside, this is indeed a great experience. Seeing those machines uprooting trees and moving earth so that the college can be built is indeed very heart warming. I want to assure you that it is great. As we all know, teachers are always very central to the whole of the education system and process, and without them not much can be done in the educational world. But, as we also know, education is the only method or process by which experience is shortened so that mankind can arrive at their destinations sooner than otherwise. In this case,therefore, the Kitui Teacher Training College becomes of great importance to the district. In fact not only to the district but to the nation as a whole. In this respect, on behalf of the Kitui people, I will take the courage to thank His Excellency the President for enabling such an important and great institution to take off.Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me say that my constituency has very good rain, which is indeed a blessing. But, as we all know, the effect of rain is to do harm to the roads; it is to wash away the bridges and, indeed</Newspeech> 		<Newspeech>MR. MANGOLI: Oil a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. In view of the fact that more hon. Members want to speak, canI request that we be added ten sore minutes?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order! I will, in fact, add you 15 more % minutes; up to 9.00 p.m.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MWENIWA: Thank you, Sir.I was saying that the effect of rain is to spoil the roads and wash away the bridges. This has been the case in my constituency and I would, therefore, like to request the authority concerned to ensure that at least the roads are passable. They should see to it that the bridges are there so that communication can take place. It becomes extremely difficult to move both goods and services and also people if roads are not passable.	Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me also express my gratitude to myconstituents for the great efforts they are making in development. Let me say women in particular because, I think they have made the greatest contribution in the development of our country. I get very pleased when I go to some of their income generating projects. for instance, weaving beautiful mats and also mailing cotton cloth. Indeed, this is a tiling that perhaps in the past ten years would have been thought impossible. So, let me express my thanks to them.With those few words, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FCR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES  (Mr. lomada): Ahsante sana, Bw. Spika, kwa kuninatia nafasi hii ili nami pia niunge mkono Hoja hii.	Ningependa kuanza kwa kunshukuru Mtrokufu Rais leva jinsi ambavyo ameiongoza nchi hii ya Kenya. Kila nwananchi aziefuraliia Jjopote aliko kwa sababu ametosheka na mambo ambayo Mtuirufu Rais . amefanya katika nchi hii kwa sababu yote ni masuri. Hakuna jambo lolote lililoenda kombo. Kila jambo ambalo Mtukufu Rais amefanyiaWakenya ni la kuwafaidi. Kwa mfano, mtindo huu wa elimu wani wa kuwafaidi Wakenya wote. ITi mtindo ambao kila mtu aliyeweza kushiriki baadaye anaweza kujisaidia mwenyewe katika maiaha yake.  Pia anawesa kujitengenezea cnochote angependa kuwa nacho. Tena, wasichana kwa wafulana wamefaidi kwa mtindo huu wa elimu ambao ni wazo lake Mtukufi Rais mwenyewe. Kwa hivyo, ningewaomba watu wote wamuunge Mtukufu Rais mkono kwa jambo hilo.Bw. Spika, tukiangalia mambo mengine ambayo Mtukufu Rais ameweka mbele ya wananchi, kwa mfano, mlolongo na kadhalika, niya faida sana. Piani mambo ambayo kila mwananchi anaona ni ya amani kwake.Bw. Spika, tulikubaliana sote kwamba tuuondoe mtindo wa kufanya mlolongo katika uchaguzi, baada ya kuombwa kufanya hivyo na Mtukufu Rais wetu. Ingawaje, sote tunafahamu kwamba watu wengi hawakutaka kuuachilia mtindo huo wa kupiga kura, lakini ilitubidi kukubaliana na Mtukufu Rais. Ninaungana na mhe. Nassir kwa kusema kwamba hayakuwa mapenzi ya wananchi kuuondoa mlolongo, bali uliondol ewa kwa sababu ya mambo mengi ne mengi kutoka nje.Naamini kwamba tuna mambo mengi sana. Tumeambiwa hivi juzi kwamba tuuondolee mbali mtindo wa kuyapeleka maendeleo wilayani. Hapo kesho tutaambiwa kwamba tuutupilie mbali mtindo wa masomo wa 8-4-4, na itakuwa hivyo hata pengine kuwaachilia wote ambao wako kizuizini. Hata tunaweza kuambiwa tusiwe na nidhamu. Wale ambao wanayadai mainbo kama haya wamejitayarisha kuwa na vita vya maneno na wakifunguliwa milango wataingia na kukiharibu chochote kile ambacho kimetengenezwa na kinacho- weza kuwafaidi wananchi. Hawawezi kutosheka hata kama mbingu zitapasuka. Pengine hata wakipatiwa dunia yote, watazihitaji mbingu zenyewe. Hii ni kusema kwamba tungependa jambo lolote la maana likiwekwa liwe tu, na si kuwa tukiyaondoa yale yenye umuhimu kwa wananchi wetu.Pi a ningependa kumshukuru Mtukufu Rais kwa kuwa ndiye anayezi fahamu haki za wananchi.Kwa hayo machache, naunga mkono.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION (Mr. Munyi): Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to make my comments on this Motion. Just to go straight to my points, I would like to join other hon. colleagues who have spoken before me in congratulating His Excellency the President, Daniel arap Moi, our great President for what he has done to guide us so very wisely. I can only add that I agree with hon. Ang'elei that whenever people talk of God, after that they talk about our President. The reason for saying so is that we are all aware that some time back, almost three weeks ago, the weather forecasters were trying to tell us that there would not be enough rains. Through our prayers, Almighty God has brought us rains, so much so that the rains have covered every part of our country. That is very important.It was only last week when we were told that there are about 100 million people in the Continent of Africa who have no food to eat. In his speech, His Excellency the President told us that we have enough to eat in this country in the reserves and silos. We are also expecting a very heavy harvest because of the rains that have started. That is a blessing from Almighty God, because our President loves God and, as a result, when he asks for something in a humble way, it is granted. His Excellency the President did that during the Kanu Delegates' meeting where we agreed with him on his advise to drop the queue-voting procedure. Everybody in the world is now talking in praise of Kenyan democracy and freedom, as well as what our ruling Party, Kanu, is doing in the country.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are most grateful to His Excellency the President for having been any to visit every provincial headquarters and the last visit that he made was to the liakuru Provincial Headquarters, which you also attended, Mr. Speaker, Sir. During that meeting, the people resolved that they wanted only one party Kanu. The sane resolution was passed at the Kasarani Annual Delegates Conference and the entire country supported this resolution of continuing with one party in Kenya. This shows that the entire country love our President and that is why they have been supporting, him all along.Mr. Speaker Sir, yesterday when I was watching the events taking place at Uhuru Park during the Jamhuri d Day, I was gratified to note, that although it was raining nearly the whole 2omk0, wananchi turned up in great numbers to listen to the words of His Excellency the President on that Wananchi braved the rain and sat down juietly until His Exellency the President finished his Speech. This was a blessing from God. We have always said that rain brings blessings and I have no doubt that on this particular Jamhuri Day, God did, in fact, bring us a lot of blessings.Having said that, I would like to say something about RukurireTea factory which in Runyenjes. Recently, there was a commission that wasappointed to look into the affairs of tea growing and marketing in Runyenjes.We have heard that this Commission has recommended that Rukurire Tea Pactoryshould be within the Runyenjes Town council. For the information of thisHouse, the foundation stone of this tea factory was laid by His Excellency the President in 1981. As soon as the Organization of African Unity Delegates Conference ended here in Nairobi in 1981, His Excellency the President went straighaway to Runyenjes and laid the foundation stone in this factory. However, on 29th November this year, the Minister for agriculture, hon. Kwangale visited this factory when he heard that it had been able to pay the largestamount of money to the tea farmers in the whole of Kenya. This particulartea factory even beat all the tea factories ir. Kericho in tea payment andeven hon. Mibei was there during the Minister's visit to this faeotry. This has been a blessing to us and we owe this to His Excellency the Presidentwho laid the foundation stone of this factory.With those few remarks, we shall continue to support the President and stand by him at all times.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TECHNICAL TRAINING AND APPLIED FOR TECHNOLOGY (Dr. Koech): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I woULDId first of all like to thank you for catching ay eye. Having said that, I would like to say that I rise to support the Motion for the Adjournment and in join my colleagues who have spoken on this Motion, I would like to thank His excellency the President for the way he has lea this country both aa economically, socially, politically and otherwise We know that in other countries, be they Europaan, Asian or African, economic social or political development, emanates from the Head of State. Proper advice by the Head of State is what directs the country into peace and prosperity Whenever Iet the chance to speak in this House, I always say that we must respect the idea that the President is the only person who can put together all our ideas into one dynamic idea in order to direct the country in the rioht direction. We show this happening," during the Annual Kanu Delegate Conference when the President actually redirected the country into the right direction with regard to the kind of voting system that we should adopt. For this reason, it is important for us as leaders to rally behind the President and support him to the best of our ability. In the recent past, we have heard of people talking about multiparties and what have you. We have heard a let of statements being issued here and there, but I must say that these kinds of statements have been made by people whose intention is to ruin this country, and these people must be stopped at all costs by all of us.	 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to mention a few things here. Firstly, even though the President has directed this country to drop queue—voting, some people are now talking to us judging the district development committee and the 8—4—4 system of education, which means that these people have not actually left us alone. So, as Parliamentarians, we should stand firm and say, "No, we cannot be coherced to follow things which lead this country to chaos. It is very important to do this thro ughout this country. We need peace and unit here.The other thing is that now is the time for ploughing, our farms for planting. I would like to request the Ministry of Agriculture and the Agricultural Development Corporation to move quickly and give loans to farmers so that they may start planting.I support the hon. Members who have said that we should go to our constituencies, but I speak with embarrassment in that I am going to a constituency where roads are terrible. Rivers such as Nyando that have been overflowing due to the present rains start in my constituency. This constituency is undulating and there is a very big washout of roads. The Minister concerned comes from my constituency, and I should have spoken to him about this. I think the Ministry of Public Works should start looking into the question of these roads because if they are not repaired, our milk is not going to reach the Kenya Co—operative Creameries. Two bridges in my constituency have been washed away, and they have not yet been fixed. So, I am going there with a humiliating feelings due to these roads.However, I would like to thank the Government for a number of things that have been done in my constituency, including the provision of a Kenya Co—operative Creameries depot, installation of postal communication, and so on. However, I would like to remind the Ministry of Public Works that we cannot operate these facilities unless we have good roads.I would also like to support those hon. members who have said that we need peace and traquility during Christmas. We believe in God because we	because we know that he is our Protector who has led us to peace in this country. So, we should celebrate Christmas with thanksgiving. I want to wish everybody a happy Christmas and a happy New Year.Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.</Newspeech> (Question put and agreed to) <Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Finally, hon. Members, I wish you all a very happy Christmas and a prosperous New Year. May God bless you all abudantly.</Newspeech> <Header>ADJOURNEMENT</Header><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Hon. Members that concludes the business on the Order Paper. The House is, therefore, adjourned Sine Die.</Newspeech> The House rose at Nine o'clock.	HANSARDThursday, 13th December, 1990The House met at Nine o'clock/Mr. Deputy Speaker in the Chair/<Header>PRAYERS</Header><Header>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</Header>Question No. 695Payment of Death Gratuity of the Late HajiMR. EKIDOR, on behalf of Mr. Jaldessa, asked the Minister of State, Office of the President what has delayed the payment of death gratuity and other benefits due to the family of the late P.C. Ali Abdi Haji, P.C. No. 21190, who died on 8th December, 1978 while on duty.<Newspeech>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Nabwera): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The workman's compensation amounting to Ksh.29,000/- has already been sent to the beneficiaries of the late P.C. Ali Abdi Haji. However, other death benefits have not been paid due to some delay in my office.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: While thanking the Minister for that reply, Mr. Deputy Speaker, could he apologise to the House for the delay he attributed to his officeand also tell the House the number of the cheque he claims to have paid to thebeneficiaries of the deceased amounting to Ksh.29,000/-?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the hon. Member kindly repeat the question?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister has said that the delay arose in his office. The period from 1978 to-date is a long one. Can he now apologise to the "late man" and tell us the cheque number? (laughter)</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the delay arose because of our failure to locate the beneficiaries. The normal procedure is that when an officer dies, we have to trace and determine, through the district coimrissioners, who the beneficiaries are. In the case of this cheque I am talking about, it has taken a long time lying in the Isiolo District Coranissioner's office. It is only recently that the beneficiaries were traced. One payment has since been made of Ksh.29,000/- while there is still another cheque at the District Commissioner's office for collection by the beneficiaries. Until the beneficiaries could be traced, the money could not have been paid out. We have to be careful on that and that is why there was such a delay while we were searching for the rightful beneficiaries.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for the Minister to mislead the House that the beneficiaries of the late Mr. Haji have not been traced and yet when one is employed in the Government he indicates who the next of kin are in the employment forms? That information must be in the files in the office. Is it in order for the Minister to make such a claim?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have already said that we have traced those beneficiaries and even made one payment to them and others will follow.</Newspeech> Question No. 634 Payment of Gratuity to the Late Chikuta's KinMR. BIDU asked the Minister of State, Office of the President what has delayed the payment of death gratuity and other benefits to the family of the late Mr. R. Chikuta, D.10 P/No. 908896, since his death on 9th January, 1989.<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Nabwera): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Question was sent to us but it is not ours. We had asked the Clerk U the National Assembly to send it to the appropriate Ministry.</Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Nabwera, there seems to be some conmunication breakdown because I am informed that the Directorate of Personnel Management finally accepted to deal with the Question. So, I think the matter is still within the Office of the President. We will, therefore, have it deferred.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Nabwera): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the position is that the Directorate of Personnel Management has sentthe Question to the Ministry of Transport and Comnunications. That Ministry hasaccepted that the officer in question was their employee, and not ours.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Very well, the Question will be deferred. </Newspeech> (Question deferred)Question No. 492Duty Waiver on Imported Second Hand VehiclesMR. MWAMZANDI, on behalf of Mr. S.M.

Mr. Bidu, what is your problem?</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I find it very strange today. I have clearly said that hon. Kiliku hasauthoritsed me to ask this Question. What is wrong with that?</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is wrong with that, Mr. Mutiso?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MUTISO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it seems thathon.

I will now ask Mr. Amin's Question again.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MWANZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Overruled, Mr. Mwanzandi.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MWANZANDI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, our Standing Order say that no Member shall impute improper motives against another Member.Could the hon. Mutiso withdraw because he has degraded hon. Bidu by claiming that he was cheating? Can he withdraw hid remarks?</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order, Hon. Members, let us not labour very much on this point. Imputing improper motive is not an easy thing to prove. I would rather we let matters stay the way they are. Mr. Amin's Question, again.</Newspeech> Question No. 492 Duty Waiver on Imported Second Hand VehiclesMR.

When the House was requested to sit this morning wemade it very clear that Ministers would not be able to attend.You have witnessed, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that threeimportant Questions have been asked, but there were noMinisters to answer them. shall we do? Can you. Then advise us on what we should do because when we go to Questionsby Private Notice we shall come back to ordinary Questions</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT(Mr. Muturia): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, although I am notdefending the Minister, I think the number of Back-benchersand Front-bechers this morning is almost equal. So, I cannot accept that remark.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order! We must get on because we have just past the first batch of Questions. There is no way the Chair will go back to the same Questions; we are now dealing with Questions by Private Notice. Mr. Mwanzandi’s sentimets as well as the rejoinder by the hon.

DEPUTY SPEAKER: Overruled, Mr. Kubo because the agenda is heavy. We should move on to Questions by Private Notice.</Newspeech>  <Header>QUESTIONS BY PRIVATE NOTICE </Header>Reasons for Trespassing on Mr. Mutune1s Land <Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister of State, Office of the President the following Question by Private Notice.(a) Why did Messrs Pelican Construction Company Limited trespass on the land belonging to Mr. Jones Mutune, MR. Ukia/ Kilala/256; and(b) What action is the Minister taking to ensure that Messrs Pelican Construction Company Limited complies with the Ministry's letter Ref. No.16/51 Vol.XX/(40) dated 2nd August, 1991.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>THE MINSITER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Nabwera): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a)	I am not aware that Messrs Pelican Construction CompanyLimited trespassed on land belonging to Mr. Jones Mutune, L.R. No. Ukia/Kilala/256.(b) In view of the answer to part (a) of the Question, part (b) does not arise.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I did not hear the second part of the answer because I do not have a written reply</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I said in view of the answer given to part (a), part (b) does not arise.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have a letter here written by the District Commissioner, Machakos, to Messrs Pelican Construction Company, asking them to comment on the complaints from the owner fo this land. Why is the Minister saying that he is not aware, since the office of the District Commissioner, Machakos is handling the matter. I think the Minister has not bothered to find out the truth of this matter.It is true that the company has entered into this man's land without his authority and scooped 1,500 lorries of sand. The company has also refused to do anything, talk or to compensate the owner of the land. Can, I, therefore, request the Minsiter to go into details and find out exactly what is happening, get a proper reply and bring it to this House?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: It is true that.the gentleman went to complain to the district commissioner who carried out some investigation, but it was discoverd that the district officer, the K.A.N.U. chairman of that location and the chief had gone into .the matter and advised Pelican Construction Company Limited to continue collecting sand from there and that the gentleman inQuestion had no legitimate claims. I would therefore, like to tell the Gracious lady that if the gentleman feels that he has been wronged he can always take the matter to court for adjudication.</Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. For the first time, the Minister said that he was not aware of what was going on in that area. Now he is telling about the person who has gone to see the chief. Now which is which Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is he still unaware or he has now come back to awareness?</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I said that I was not awarethat Messrs. Pelican Construction Company Limited had tresspassed on Mr. Mutune's land.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MRS. NTEDEI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, first and foremost, would the Minister agree with me that according to our Constitution, the property of individuals has to be protected? That being the case, would he tell this House why the chief and the Kanu officials in this area have allowed this company to tresspass on Mr. Mutune's land. Is it not the responsibility of the Government, through its administration to protect individuals property?Why does the Government not come in this particular case instead of forcing the owner of this land to go to court to take his complaints there? The Government should come in and order this company to compensate Mr. Mutune immediately.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, according to the information I have this company has not tresspassed on Mr. Mutune's land but is using a normalroute but if this man still insists that the company is trespassing, he is at liberty to take the company to court .</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, according to an earlier reply aivenby the Minister that he is not aware that this company has been trespassing on this man's land, could he be honest enough and tell this House the truthbecause the hon. Member from this area says that Mr. Mutune is rightly complainin that this company has been trespassing on his land while on its way to scoop sand from another place?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not know whether the hon. Member wants me to repeat what I have already said for the tenth or eleventh time so that he can understand. According to the information available to me, this company has not been trespassing on Mr. Mutune's land because i	it does not pass through his land while collecting sand but uses a normal route to do so.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Minister	in this particular case has not been given the correct information reaardirg,this matter. This company has not only tresspassed on Mr. Mutune's land, but they have gone into his land and scooped 1,500 lorry-full of sand. This is:	the correct information and Mr. Mutune has put this information in writing 	and taken it to the chief and the district commissioner. This is why theDistrict Commissioner wrote to this Company asking them to explain to him whythey have been trespassing on Mr. Mutune's land. Therefore, would the Minister endeavour to re-investigate this matter further and bring a proper reply to thisHouse because this man's property has been interefered with and the Governmentseems to condone this behaviour which is rather strange.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir, the information I have is quiteaccurate and this is why I am saying that if this person still insists thatthe Pelican Construction Company Limited trespassed on his lard, he should reportthis matter to court because as far as Government is aware </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI: On apoint of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Is theMinister really in order to ask a poor man as Mr. Mutune to take this matterto court while he is fully aware that this is a very expensive process. Thisman has made a very genuine complaint which requires the Government to go inand investigate his complaint and tell him what he oueht to do? why is theMinister asking this poor person to take this matter to court while he istelling the truth?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I cannot help the hon. graciousland in this case because this information was obtained right from chief ofthe Kanu chairman and the district officer of the area andaccording to this information, this company has not trespassed through thisman's land and that is is using a normal route to scoop sand from a certain river bed. This river bed does not belong to this person and if this company has been trespassing his land, it means that it has been passing through his land which is not the case here.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KYQNDA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister is not telling this House the truth. This is not the first time that this company has trespassed on people's land. This company has been scooping sand in my constituency and there have been a lot of complaints from people that this company has a habit of trespassing through their land and scooping sand there without permission, but nothing is being done by the administration. The Minister now says that this man does not own the river bed but he knows very well that this company does not own the river bed either. If anybodyhas a right to claim this river bed, it would be Mr. Mutune alone because this river passes throuah his land. Therefore, could the Minister investigate this matter further and give vis a satisfactory answer.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KABWZRA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, If the hon. Member wishes me to cevcry out further investigations, I am prepared to do so. However, I have said that I have no evidence whatsoever that Pelican Construction Company Limited is passing through this man's land.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let us now move on to the other Question by Mrs. Ndetei.</Newspeech> Cash Payee of Cheque Mo.323295<Newspeech>MRS.NDETEI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the the following Question by Private Notice:-Vice-President and Minister for Financewho was paid Cheque No.323295 which was dated 14th November, 1985 worth KShs. 30,000/-, by the Manager, Kenya CommercialBank, Machakos Branch.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Nobody is there from the Office of the Vice- President to answer this Question. Okay, we now move on to Mr. Ndirangu's Question.Reasons for Sacking Mr. Muhino</Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR. NDIRANGU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Labour the following Question by Private Notice:Why did the management of Akamba Public Road Services terminate the services oftheir driver, a Mr. George Mathenge Muhingo?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE A MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Biwott): Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Minister for Labour I beg to reply Mr. George Mathenge Muhingo had his services terminated in August, 1987 for being drunk during working hours, thus rendering himself incapable of performing his work of driving a bus. By the time of terminating his services, he has served the company for a period of one year.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MANGOLI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from the replythe the Minister, was there any documentary evidence to prove that this manwas actually drunk. I am asking this because Asians these days have formed a habit of sacking Africans from their jobs under the pretext of being drunk.</Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR. BIWOTT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the driver, in fact, maintained, that he was not drunk, he should have gone to the police immediately to have his breath tested and obtain a certificate which he would have used as evidence to prove that he was not drunk. However, in the absence of such a document, we have not reason to doubt what the employer's assessment. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: Kr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising am from that reply, could the Minister tell this House whether the man was sacked on the  spot so that he would have gone to the police to have his breath checked? Secondly,is there no way where the citizens of this country could be protected from arbitrary sacking by some of these foreieners. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIW0TT: I am sure that the hon. Member may have employed some people and I am sure he would agree with me that our laws provide that any employee could be sacked if  he is found to be drunk or disorderly during the working hours. In this particular case, this particular driver was found drunk by the employer who immediately sacked him and in 3a absence of any documentary prove to the contrary, we have no reason to doubt the "employer. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIXG'OII: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister is not at tempin to answer the supplementary question he was asked by hon. namely whether this man was sacked on the . so that he could have gone to the police to have his breath tested. This is just another case where an Asian fires an African  and says that he was drunk during working hours. For how long are we going to tolerate this kind of behavior? we demand' an answer from the Minister. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIWOTT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the issue of whether he was sacked on the spot or not does not arise in the sense that the supplementary question asked sought documentary evidence, and I have said that this evidence could have been produced by the complainant or his employer if this had been thought necessary. Since there is nobody, however, to show any such documentary evidence, there is really no reason for hainging on to the issue. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. We have been making laws here and, as the Minister knows very well, an allegation that a driver is drunk must be proved beyond reasonable doubt in our courts of law in order to be used as a basis in handling such a case. However, the Minister is using this allegation and yet the person concerned was not proved guilty in a court of law. Now that the Minister knows that he has been misled, will he apologise to the person concerned who has never been proved built? How do we arrive at the decision that this driver was drunk? This driver must be protected so that his reputation is not completely spoilt. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIWOTT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the explanation given by the hon. Member is completely irrelevant in the sense that neither he nor anybody else can prove that this driver was not drunk at the material time. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. This gentleman is accused of having been drunk, and we know very well that it is an offence to drive under the influence of drink. However, what the Minister is being asked is whether the driver was taken to court and proven to have been drunk? If this was not done, the driver is being victimised unfairly. Was he charged in a court of law or not? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIWOTT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not have any evidence to show that the man was taken to court, but it is proper for any good manager to fire a drunken driver on the spot. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. A court of law is the only authority we can use in this House to prove that a person is guilty of an offence. We would like the Minister to tell us whether this driver was found guilty in a court of law or not. If he was not, is the Minister not misleading the House, having been misled himself? In this case, he should withdraw his answer and ensure that the citizens of this country are protected. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIWOTT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the hon. Member is at pains to drag the issue away from the reality. There is no law in this country that says that a driver must first be proven to have been drunk in order to be fired. However, there is a law in the country that say that drivers must not drink while on duty. Driving</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Mang'oli! The Minister is responding to your point of order. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIWOTT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, driving under the influence of liquor is an offence, and nobody will entrust his lorry to a drunken driver as this would be encouraging lawlessness. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, one subsection of Section 17 of the Employment Act says that drunkenness while on duty can constitute summary dismissal. However, the Minister said earlier on that the question of instant dismissal in this case does not arise, but it does because if an employer finds an employee drunk while on duty, although he does not have to go to the police, he must exercise his own right as an employer to instruct that employee immediately on what to do. If he does not do so, he defers his right as an employer to terminate the services of that employee. Therefore, he cannot do that as an afterthought and he loses his right at that point in time. Could the Minister tell us how the services of this man were terminated? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIWOTT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the hon. Member is partially answering the Question for me. The hon. Gracious Lady is repeating what I said earlier on. I said that I have no proff that this man was sacked instantly or not and stressed the point that any employer will sack his drunken driver instantly. This is what the hon. Member is confirming. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, with all due respect, I think the hon. Minister is biased whereas all that is before us now is the employer's word against that of the employee, and there is no documentary proof available. So, the question of this drunk having been drunk does not arise. The employer says that this man was drunk, and the latter says that he was not drunk. Why does the Minister believe the employer and not the employee? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIWOTT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think this issue is very simple because the driver cannot fire his employer whereas the latter can fire the former. Therefore, there is no bias here. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASIKE—NDOMBI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is one thing to drink, and quite another thing to be drunk. If an employee is suspected of working while having taken a drink, in all fairness, the worker is taken to a doctor to certify that the worker has taken liquor to such an extent that he cannot perform his duties properly. In this case	</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Could you put your question, Mr. Ndombi? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASIKE—NDOMBI: Yes, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.In the absence of a doctor's certificate that this man was drunk, his employer had no right to fire him. Therefore, this employer had no right to terminate the services of this employee in the absence of proof from a doctor</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Ndombi, you are still giving a lecture. What is your question? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASIKE—NDOMBI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Minister tell this House whether there is a doctor's proof that this man was drunk? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIWOTT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it not necessary, nor was it necessary in this particular case, to obtain a doctor's proof because the man himself has no proof that he was drunk, but</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is anyone here from the Ministry of Culture and Social Services? </Newspeech>(Silence)<Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. It is highly disheartening to realise that ray Question cannot be answered now because, although I have a written reply, the two Assistant Ministers for Culture and Social Services were here just a few minutes ago. What is the position? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Just before the Leader of Government Business perhaps takes the Floor, I wonder whether it is possible to trace these hon.

If anybody could trace them, I would be prepared to stand over the matter for the time being.Let us move on to Mr. Makhanu's Question. Sacking of Workers by K.P.C.U. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

KIRWA: We know that the country is secure hut we would like to know the measures the Ministry is going to take to ensure that that meeting of 6th January, 1991 is going to be as orderly as possible so that elections are held? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIWOTT: As I said earlier, administrative measures will be instituted to ensure that adequate security is provided to allow the meeting to take place in an orderly manner. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Next Order. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MHAMZANDI: On a point of order, Sir. When this Question was asked, the Chief Whip l went out and 'arrested' the two Assistant Ministers and escorted them into the Chamber. They had to be traced and 'arrested' so that they can tell the House why they ran away from replying to this Question. Can they tell us why they ran away? The  Chief Whip has done a good job. </Newspeech>(laughter)<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mrs. Ogo) Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I sincerely apologise to the Chair and the House for not being able to respond to this Question. We did not disappear - I know we have been brought back 'handcuffed' - but we had just gone to check with the Ministry where the answer was. If the answer which was given this morning</Newspeech>through collective responsibility is not satisfactory, we could ax add in more this afternoon when we get a reply.I sincerely apologies for this. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mrs. Ogot, is it your intention to add on to what Mr. Biwott has said in relation to this Question? Is it not a little 3trange that the answer is in the House and that the Assistant Ministers are not aware that indeed a reply has been given? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE.ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mrs. Ogot) Sir, that is why I am sincerely apologising to the House. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Very well. I think that Question has beentackled. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Sir. While we thank hon. Ekidor, the self-styled 'police officer for . 'arresting' the two Assistant Ministers, it is very strange that they had to consult themselves outside when one of them could have gone to check far the reply in the Ministry. Are you satisfied, Sir that the reply given is adequate? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. DEPUTY SPEAKER: The Chair is satisfied that the reply isadequate. </Newspeech>(applause)<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Muturia): On a point of order, Sir. I heard hon. Bidu replying that a 'police officer' wassent to .'arrest' the hon. Assistant Ministers </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. Deputy SPEAKER: Did you say that Mr. Bidu was replying? TEE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Muturia): I did not say that he was replying but that I heard hon. Bidu stating that they had sent a 'police officer' to 'arrest' the hon. Assistant Ministers. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I am sure that that was said lightly and the matter should, therefore, be taken lightly. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

The Assistant Minister responsible has given an undertaking that she is a<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr, Biwott): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the answer I gave was very satisfactory and it is the Ministry's answer. The hon. Assistant Minister merely said if there are any unawared Questions they will attempt to answer them in the afternoon because she was not in the House earlier. So, she was not replying to the Question I answered. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.WASIZE—NDOMBI: 9n a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Minister in order to say that he gave us a satisfactory answer when he said that he did not know how the committee was appointed?

OMINO: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The AFC Leopards is, in fact, a society registered under the Societies Act. Therefore,? this Question was the responsibility of the Attorney-General. How come the Question was directed to the Minister for Culuture and Social Services? </Newspeech>. .	<Newspeech>MR.DEPUTY SPEAKER: You see, Mr..0mino, is trying tocompound the problem. The fact of the matter is that the Question has been answered. Whether it was for the Attorney-General or for the Minister for Culture and Social Services the Question has, indeed be answered by the Minister, for Energy and I think Mr. Qmino should be happy with that position. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. Biwott: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is true that the AFC Leopards is registered under the Societies Act, but in terms as of Ministerial functions it comes under the Ministry of Culture and Social Services. Therefore, questions on the  club should be answered by .the person who administers it and not the one who registered it. </Newspeech> to respond to it in the afternoon. Now, shall we not be allowed to the Minister to withdraw the reply he had given earlier on? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS NDETEI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. On Tuesday several Questions, including one of mine, were deferred and I was promised answer £ today. Again, my Question by Private Notice No. 2, among others, has not been answered. Considering that we most likely to adjourn Sine die today can the Chair assure us that these Questions will be dealt with in the course of the day before we adjourn? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Next Order, please. </Newspeech><Header> COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE HOUSE </Header > (Order for Committee read) /IIFT De-outy g-oeaker leftthe Chalr7IN This COMMITTEE The Temporary Deputy Chairman (Mr. Mureithi) took the ChairThe Coast Development Authoritj Bill (Cluases 2 and 3 agreed to)Clause 4<Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, Sir, we a discussion with the Minister in one of the Committee Rooms and we suggested that under Clause 4 the Permanent Secretaris for livestock Development and Tourism and Wildlife be included in the management of the authority to be set up. The reason is that the authority will be concerned with the development of livestock and tourism. We also agreed that Clause 4(h) be amended by replacing the words "six" after the word "President" with the word "seven" and the word "area" in the second last line with the word "district". This is because in addition to the six districts of the Coast Province the authority will also cover the southern half of Garissa and seven members will give Garissa representation. Unless this is done that district will not be represent in the authority. It however, seems that the Minister has not honoured his pledge to bring an amendment to the clause at this stage. Those are the two most important important amendments we had suggested. </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, I accept that we renumber Clause (4) so that the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife, is included. Thereafter the small letters will be renumbered and the thing will be all right. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, it looks as if the Minister has accepted to include the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife and left out the Ministry of Livestock Development. It also looks as if he has not accepted to delete the word "six" and substitute it with the word "seven", and also he has not accepted to delete the word "area" and substitute it with the word "district". Those are the amendments we wanted. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr.Temporary Deputy Chairman, can we hear hon. Mwamzandi again on the second proposal? We are prepared to propose and accept an amendment to include the Ministry of Tourisma and Wildlife in this Authority because it is relevant to its operations. Now, the other one he is mentioning is the Ministry of Labour, and perhaps he can say what he wanted since we did not hear him properly.MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, what I was saying is that the Coast Development Authority will be in charge of total development in the area and I have seen other permanent secretaries included in the Bill. But the most important ones have been left out. For instance, if we plan to have ranches in that area, we should include the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Livestock Development so that he knows what the Authority is planning to do. We had also suggested that we include the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Tourism and Wild¬life because we are also planning for tourist development in the area. Those are the appointments which should come immediately after part (f). Then, in Clause 4 (h) </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr. Mureithi): Mr. Mwamzandi, can you ask one thing at a time? We are now in the issue of permanent secretaries, and I understood the Minister as saying that after Clause 4 (h) he has conceded to add a new paragraph (g) to state that the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry for the time being responsible for tourism and wildlife should be included. Now, what other permanent secretary are you talking about? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, I have repeatedly talked of the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Livestock Development. Permanent secretary wa wanyama: ng'ombe, mbuzi, kuku</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Burukenge! </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Temporary Chairman, as you can see, this Authority is loaded with officials, and we would like to keep it'to the minimum. Only permanent secretaries in the relevant Ministries will be represented. In the case of the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife, definitely there is need for it. I am afraid that the Ministry of Livestock Development cannot be seriously. considered. But should there be any need for development in ranching, no doubt the permanent secretary responsible for that will be invited to the meeting just like any other permanent secretary in any Ministry which may become relevant in the course of time. For now, I am afraid that only the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife will be accepted</Newspeech>.<Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr. Mureithi): Mr. Mwamzandi, did you have any other suggestion on Clause 4(1) (g)? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, the Minister has accepted one, and an assurance has been given that the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Livestock Development, will always be invited. With that, I wish to go to the other point.Sir, you see that the definition of "development area" in Clause 2 means that part of the Coast Province within Lamu, Mombasa, Kilifi, Tana River, Kwale and Taita/Taveta districts, including the Southern half of Garissa District and the exclusive economic zones. These are six districts, and you realise that at Clause 4(1) (h), the Minister says that there will be eight other members appointed by the Minister in consultation with the President, six of whom shall be appointed from the area. He has taken into consideration that there will be six districts, but he has forgotten that there is another district which is also included in the definition. My suggestion was, and the Minister agreed, that we delete the word "six" and substitute it with the word "seven" The seventh member will come from Garissa District. We also agreed that we delete the word "area" in the third license and substitute it with the word "district". That way, it means that the members will be appointed from each district. Otherwise, if you leave it so open, we may have some people who will want to appoint their own relatives. I do notthink the Minister will do that</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr. Mureithi): Mr. Mwamzandi, let us deal with that one first. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, like in all other authorities, we talk of areas and not districts. The represntation on the authority will be done on district level. If we delete the word "area" and substitute it with the word "district", then some parts of the district which overlap will be left out. Hon. Mwamzandi is aware that in all other authorities we have used the word "area" and not "district". The appointment of the members will be done in all the distrticts; it does not matter who will be appointed because we are not going to appoint the district commissioner. We will appoint people from the district. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: If that is the case, then will the Minister accept to delete the word "six" and substitute it with the word "seven" so that one of the members cranes from Garissa District? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): No, Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman. We have said clearly that the Southern part of Garissa District is included. So, the fact that the Southern part of the district is included does not necessarily mean that we have seven appointees. It is covered well enough in the Bill. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. ARTE: Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, Sir, unless the Minister is discriminating against Garissa District, we would urge him to include the southern parts of Garissa District. That should make some sense. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, on second thought, I think we could help the hon. Member by omitting the word "six" so that Clause 4 (l)(h) reads "eight other members appointed by the Minister, in consultation with the President, of whom shall be appointed from the affected area by the operat¬ions of the Authority". That covers everything now. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already explained that there are. instances where the local community donates or are compensated for their land, or where necessary, the Govern¬ment buys land. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MAKAU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, a teacher training college like Kibabii College is a national institution. How come that people in Kibabii area are donating land for a national college, especially now that the Harambee donations have been stopped  until April next year? How will the people collect money? If they do not collect enough money, what will happen to the con¬struction of the college? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the stoppage of Harambee contributions is only temporary; it is only for three/four months MR. SPEAKER: Next Question, Mr. Makhanu. Outcome of National Sports Council Meeting SIR. MAKHANTU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Culture and Social Services the following Question by Private Notice.What was the outcome of the Kenya National Sports Council meeting of 8th November, 1990, which was to decide on whether the K.F.F. elections can be held now or not as per Minister's promise to this House in October, 1990? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AID SOCIAL SERVICES (Mrs.Ogot): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The outcome of the Kenya National Sports Council meeting of 8th November, 1990, is a detailed report looking into greater for football management as a whole.

I, therefore, wish to assure the House and the hon Questioner that every detail will be taken to make sure that this directive is carried out</Newspeech>.<Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the hon. Assistant Minister assure us here that a meeting was held on that day beca¬use I have contrary information to the effect that a meeting never took place? Can we have the minutes of the meeting laid here? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. OGOT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am surprised that hon. Makhany^ays that a meeting never took place on that day. If he is challenging that, with your permission, some time before the House rises, I would like to lay on the Table the detailed report of that meeting. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHAITU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was just requesting for the minutes of the meeting,but the hon. Assistant Minister is talking of a detailed report. Can she confirm that she is going to lay on the Table the minutes of the meeting of 8th November? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. OGOT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was not aware that hon.

DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Ejore): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I.beg to reply.(a)	M/S Comarco Group of Companies of P.O. Box 99111, Mombasa, have not been remitting members' contributions regularly because of financial constraints facing the former management.(b)	(i)	The amount outstanding as at 30th November, 1990, isKsh.376,760.3C.(ii)	A total of KSh.536,069.20 has been remitted to the society since July, 1939.the following(iii)	The Ministry has so far taken/action in ensuring that remittances are made as required:-1.	Made constant and periodic follow-up discussions with Comarco Group of Companies top management.2.	Advised the Chairman of Mawaidha Co-operative Society to write demand letters to the employers, which he did.3.	Approached the Labour Office in Mombasa to follow up the issue of non-remittance through the Employment Act. However, Comarco Group of Companies, now having a newfinancial controller since early this year, have promised to clear  all the outstanding contributions within the next few months. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister says that the money will he remitted because the Comarco Group of Companies have a new financial controller. How is he asso¬ciating the contributions with a new financial controller? Can he assure the House that the Comarco Group of Companies will remit this money to the society immediately so that they can get loans from their co-operative society? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EJORE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is what the Ministry has done now. This money is supposed to be banked or kept in the Co-operative Bank so that it earns interest, but the society is not supposed to keep this money in a place where it does not earn interest. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir,can the Assistant Ministertell the House who has been keeping this money since last year?I am sure KSh. 376,760.00 is a lot of  money ! </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EJORE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not know who has beenauditing the books of this society; because this money 2iad not beencredited to the books of this society. So, if this money had beer.kept in another bank, we are not aware of that in the Ministry, and it is a different matter. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the Assistant Minister associated the new financial controller, it is very confusing. How does he associate the money with the new financial controller? Is he the one who has been holding the money? The money has not been earning any interest at all. </Newspeech>Clause 8: <Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, Sir, here again is another amendment which will accommodate the feelings of this august House. The idea here is to remove the Provincial Commissioner from being Chairman of the panel because of his very busy schedule. He would appoint a chairman from the Gazetted members of the panel. Secondly, I would like to make it clear that the sittings of the panel may not be limited to one. There may be about three sittings as the Commissioner will determine. The amendment is quite healthy and it makes the operations of the 3ill quite easy. Therefore, Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, Sir, I beg to move:-THAT, Clause 8 be deleted and the following new clause inserted -8(1) The Minister shall establish for each Province a Land Disputes Appeal Committee which shall consist of (c)	a Chairman appointed from time to time by the Provincial Commissioner from the panel of elders appointed by the Minister by notice published in the Gazette for purposes of appeals under this Act; and(d)	such persons, not being less than five, appointed by the Minister.(2) For the purpose of hearing appeals from tri¬bunals in the Province for which the Committee is constituted the Committee shall sit in a panel of three as may be determined by the Provincial Commissioner.(Question of the new clause proposed) (New clause read the First Time)(Question, that the new clause be read a Second Time pro-pose(Question, that the new clause be read a I	Second Timeput and, agree. to)(The new clause was read a Second Time)(Question, that the new clause be added to the Bill, put and agreed to) Clause 9:THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli) : Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, Sir, I beg to move :THAT, clause 9 be amended by deleting paragraph (b) and inserting the following new paragraph -(b) prescribing the composition and qualifications for membership of the Tribunal and of the Appeals Committee and the terms of Service of such members all of whom shall be eligible for re-appointment.NEW GLAUSES: 	(a) THAT, the following new clause he inserted immediately sifter clause 6 —Decision of	(1) The Chairman of the TribunalTribunal	shall cause the decision of theTribunal to be filed in the Magistrate's Court together with any depositions or documents which have been taken or proved before the Tribunal;Transitionalprovisions(2) The Court shall enter judgment In accordance with the decision of the Tribunal and upon judgment being entered a decree shall issue and shell be enforceable in the manner provided for under the Civil Procedure Act.(b) THAT, the following new clause be inserted immediately after clause 10 11(1) Where any proceedings to which section 3(1) of this Act applies have at the  of this Act, been filed in a Magistrate's Court, then, unless the Court has at that time heard and pronounced judgment thereon, the proceedings shall be discontinued until the dispute has been referred to the Tribunal end determined in accordance with this Ac(2)	Where the Court, lias, at the comEienoaiaeiit of this Act, her-rd the case and pronounced judgment thereon any appeal there from shall proceed as if this Act had not been enacted.(3)	For avoidance of doubt it is hereby provided that nothing in this Act shall confer jurisdiction on the Tribunal to entertain proceedings in respect of which the time for bringing such proceedings is barred under any law relating to the limitation of actions or to any proceedings which had been heard and determined by any court.Amendment of section 159 of Cap. 30012. Section 159 of the Registered Land Act is amended by deleting the words "where the disputes within the provisions of Part IIIA of the Magistrates Courts Act, in accordance with Part" and inserting where the dispute comes within the provisions of section 3(1) ox the Land Disputes Tribunals Act in accordance with that Act.Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, Sir, Clause 9 is a very important new concept which was not there in the original Bill.Technically the purpose of the amendment is to allow When theTribunal has finished its deliberations no one was provided for to execute that decision. The Tribunal had no institution to assist it in order to enforce its judgments or decisions. The Tribunal is what we call presi judicial; it is not like a complete court with its institution. Only the decision will be filed with the court and there will be no hearing or any other matter dealt with by the court except to accept that decision and judgment in accordance with that decision and then issue the decree which will be enforced by the agents in the normal manner under theCivil Procedure Act. So, that is an addition to give the Tribunal's decision a chance to be effected as soon as possible.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, part (b) of this clause provides for the transitional period in respect of pendingcases; those which have already been dealt with so thatthere is no re-opening of cases. There is also the question offinalizing the ones which are partly heard and be instituted againin the Tribunal. With regard to those which have been concluded there must be a finality to any litigation; therewill be no chance of re-opening old wounds which had already beencured. I beg to move. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr. Mureithi): Hon. At tome yGeneral, do the amendments appearing on page 432 fall under Clause 9? I ask you this question because they do not appear torelated to the amendment to Clause 9. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli) : Yes. But it seems as ifthere is an interpolation somewhere of these clauses. Let me lock at them again please. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (CTD):Mr. Temporary Deputy	 Chairman, Sir,I think it is clear; it is continued. we have Clause 9 being amended by deleting one paragraph and inserting a new paragraph. Over the page there is a new clause after clause six. Maybe there is an interpolation of clauses here. This . part (b) here deals with the decision of the Tribunal and (b) on page 432 refers transitional provisions refers to Clause 10. I think there is a question of re-numbering the clauses. So, the text is all right but there should be re-numbering. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr. Mureithi): Mr. Muli,what you are saying is that part (a) on page 432 will be a part of Clause 9</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli) : Yes. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr. Mureithi): But part (b) appearing on the same page is a separate amendment? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Yes. That is correct. </Newspeech>(Question of the amendment proposed)<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Mwenje): Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, Sir, this refersto Some cases may have been determined and I am referring topart (b)  transitional provisions. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr. Mureithi) : We will come to that later. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, Sir, the new clause on page 432 should not be under Clause 9. Part (a) on page 432 should come Immediately after Clause 6. This is because this new  clause, according to the amendment, should' come at the end of Clause 6 which is amended on page 431. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, Sir, Clause 9(b) reads as follows:-prescribing the composition and qualifications for membership of the Tribunal and of the Appeals i	Committee and the terms of service of such members all of whom shall be eligible for re-appointment."We are deleting that (b) and substituting it with another (b). That is on page 515 of the Bill. Then over the page there is another new clause. There is an interpolation ofthe clauses and as I have already said we will put every clause in s	its own proper place. That deals with the execution of the decree.It will be part of the main clause - the decision ofthe Tribunal. I think that is in clause 6. I  thinkthere is wrong wording on the Order. Paper which we would like to be corrected so that each clause is put in its proper place. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr. Mureithi): I think what Mr. Malebe is trying to say is that perhaps the amendment.in (a) should come immediately after Clause 6 - the execu¬tion part of the Bill. It would also appear that paragraphs (a) and (b) are new clauses because even the amendment appearing there isa new clause	to fall under Clause 10. So, it is not essential!an amendment to Clause 10. So, I think as far as Clause 9 is v	concerned, the amendment only affects paragraph (b). So, the question:should be put only as it relates to paragraph (b) of Clause 9. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, we have already clarified the manner that it should be. </Newspeech>(Clause 9 as amended agreed to) 	<Newspeech>MR. WASIKE-NDOMBI: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary DeputyChairman. In view of the amendment we have just gone through, of insert¬ing a new clause, apparently the new clause becomes Clause 7 and then we have to renumber the others as we go on. </Newspeech>- ^<Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): . Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, I think I have already said it is a matter we are agreed upon. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr. Mureithi): As far as Clause 9 is concerned, this is merely a substitution of part (b) with another 	part (b). The question of numbering will definitely be looked into oncethe new clauses are incorporated. However, we have not passed any new 	clauses and once that is done, the renumbering will be done automatically. </Newspeech>(Clause 10 agreed to)New Clause<Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, Sir, I beg to move:-"THAT, the following new clause be insertedimmediately after clause 6 -Decision of	(1) The Chairman of the TribunalTribunal	shall cause the decision of theTribunal to be filed in the Magistrate's Court together with any depositions or documents which have been taken or proved before the Tribunal;, ~	(2) The Court shall enterjudgment in accordance with the decision of the Tribunal and upon judgment being entered a decree shall issue and shall be enforceable in the manner .	provided for under ths CivilProcedure Act."Sir, this deals with the decisions of the Tribunal. Once the Tribunal has decided, there is no provision as to how that decision will  be enforced and it, therefore became necessary to insert this new clause</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Ctd):so as to allow the Tribunal to send the decisions to a Magistrate's Court, where they will be filed and a decree issued. The Magistrate's Court will have nothing to do with the hearing; it is not an appeal as such. It is purely to complete the records for execution purposes. (Question of the new clause proposed) (New Clause read the first Time)(Question, that the new clause be read a second time, proposed) </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, Sir, if that new clause has to appear after Clause 6, then it should be renumbered. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): I already said we are agreed on the renumbering issue. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Mwenje): Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, Sir, I do not know whether what I want to raise falls under this clause, but I feel like saying it and then the Attorney-General will rise and clarify. There are some cases where the courts have made half decisions—</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr. Mureithi): Order, Mr. Mwenje. We shall deal with that as a new clause after Clause 10. We are now dealing with the new clause at part (a) of the new clauses.(Question, that the new clause be read a second time, put and agreed to) (The new clause was read a Second Time)(Question that the new clause be added to the Bill, put and agreed to)New Clause</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, Sir,I beg to move:-"THAT, the following new clause be inserted immediately after Clause 10—</Newspeech><Newspeech>The ATTORNEY GENERAL (CTD):11(1) Where any proceedings to which Section 3(1) of this Act applies have, at the commencement of the Act, been filed in a Magistrate's Court, then, unless the Court has at that time heard and pronounced judgement thereon, the proceedings shall be discontinued until the dispute has been referred to the Tribunal and determined in accordance with this Act(2) Where the Court has, at the commencement of this Act, heard the case and pronounced judgement thereon any appeal there from shall proceed as if this Act had not been enacted.(3) For avoidance of doubt it is hereby provided that nothing in this Act shall confer jurisdiction on the Tribunal to entertain proceedings in respect of which the time for bringing such proceedings is barred under any law relating to the limitation of actions or to any proceedings which had been heard and determined by any court.Amendment	12. Section 159 of the Registeredof Section	Land Act is amended by deleting the159 of	words where the disputes come withinCap. 300	the provisions of Part IIIA of theTransitional provisionsMagistrates Courts Act, in accordance with Part" and inserting "where the dispute comes within the provisions of Section 3(1) of the Land Disputes Tribunals Act in accordance with that Act."Under 11(3) we are saying that where cases have been finished with, we cannot allow the Tribunal to reopen them. As I have said before, it would be more or less opening old and cured wounds. Finally, it is really a substitution of what was in Section 159 of Cap. 300. We are removing the Magistrate Courts' jurisdiction and replacing it with the Tribunal. With those few remarks, I beg to move. (Question of the new clause proposed) (New Clause read the first Time)(Question, that the new clause be read a second time, proposed) </Newspeech>   	<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING(Mr. Mwenje): Mr. Temporary Chairman, since the Attorney- General has put it that way, it is very good and very clear. There is a very small point which I wanted him to clarify. In case there is a case going on some issues in the court, andsub-divisions have not been effected shall we have to refer the undecided matters back to the tribunal or shall all we wait for all the issues to be determined? What will happen in a case where they have made some decisions on some issues leaving others undecided? What will happen in such a situation? </Newspeech>2	<Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Temporary DeputyChairman, the doctrine of judicature is very clear. The issues having been finally determined and it is okay for hon. Mwenje to appear to say that submissions have not been decided in which case the case will have to be paralyzed at the beginning before the tribunal. This doctrine is very important. The matter having been completed the doctrine of this judicature applies, again also touches on the question of limitation. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, under the same clause, we are also amending Section 159 of Chapter 300. Is it in order to have that amendment endorsed in this New Bill Or the amendment should have been brought under the previous law?	that happens then this Bill that we are passing will	refer to amendments which have been done previously. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Temporary Deputy 	Chairman, I do not follow hon. Malebe points. However, allthat we are coping here is in order to allow Section 159 to allow this dispute. We did so during the Magistrate's Jurisdication Act - we put it under the same clause and instead of now continuing to have that, we have removed the Magistrate's  court and replaced., it with the, present tribunal. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. TEMPORARY DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr. Mureithi): What exactly is your question, Mr. Malebe? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: These amendments refers to the existing Act although we have not amended it yet. Should we assume that the amendments to that Act are being considered here? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Temporary Deputy Chairman, we may have. Section 159 was ammended in l981 to include the Magistrate Jurisdiction Act. We are removing that from Section 15 9 and substituting, therefore, the present tribunal which we have. Where is the problem? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN: I think that is absolutely in order inthat this is not a completely new amendment. We are just removing "the Magistratecourt and putting under the new system and it is therefore important that thisAct be amended at this the when we are establishing the tribunals.(question that the new clauses 11 and 12 be added to the Bill, put and agreed to)(Title agreed to)(Clause 1 agreed to) </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Temporary Chairman, I be to move that the Committee both report to the House its consideration of the lands Disputes Tribunals 3ill and its approval thereof with amendments, (question proposed) (question put and agreed to)(The House resumed)Mr. Deputy Speaker in the ChairREPORT AND THIRD RBADHIG The Coast Development Authority Bill The Land Disputes Tribunals Bill</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MUREITHI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I a be to report that the Committee of the whole House has considered the Coast Development Authority 3ill and approved the same with amendment. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg; to move that the House doth agree with the Committee inthe said Report.<Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (MR.

This clause hasbeen incorporated into this Bill purely for administration purposes. What isexpected to happen is that as soon as the decision of the Tribunal is ready,delivered and signed, the secretariat will take it to the nearest magistratewho will automatically and without question whatsoever, enter judgment in terms</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTOHEZY-CEEERAL (Ctd.):of that decision and from there execution of the decision will follow</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like the Attorney- General to elaborate on the qualifications of these elders as per clause 9 of the Bill. Besides being over 18 years of age, what other qualifications will be required of an elder?</Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is there no definition of the word "elder" in the definitions clause?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is a definition of the word "elder", but this does not touch on the qualifications of an elder.<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Malebe, I beg to differ with you on this issue because that definition has, certainly, to touch on the qualifications of an elder.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES ND MARKETING (Mr. ole Kaparo): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the definition of an elder also includes the qualifications of an elder. This is a person who, by custom, is versed in the law of the community concerned. This also applies to the Nchuri Ncheke.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Does the learned Attorney-General have anythingto add here?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I entirely agree with my colleague, hon. Kaparo. Let me just say that hon. Malebe just refuses to listen. I took about 30 minutes last time to explain this point to him, and I do not know what further explanation he wants on the definition and qualifications of an elder. By using the available definition, I am sure he would be able to pinpoint an elder even without equivocation.MR. MANG'OLI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir	MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Mang'oli, I hope you realise that this is leading to the Third Reading of the Bill./<Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to comment on this issue. There are very many land tribunal cases pending, and we hope that as soon as this Bill is passed, the Attorney—General will institute collective measures to have these cases decided. Land cases are a very touchy issue and, after this Bill is passed, we would like the cases pending both in _	rural and urban areas to be decided. The resultant law should start working immediately rather than to keep it pending until an amendment is called. We have land cases that have been pending even in Webuye for a long time now, and we hope that the Attorney—General will issue directives to have them decided in time.<Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Deputy Speakers, with many sentences, I replied to hon. Mwenje's remarks, but I have been having "indigestion" for the last 30 years in respect of land cases and it is I who would like to have these cases finished. We are moving on towards consolidation of the law of the land so that it may be easy to administer it. So, I request the hon. Member, Mr. Mang'oli, to assist me by explaining to the people what we have done. My hon. colleague in the Office of the President, Mr. Nabwera, should also assist me in this regard so that my "indigestion" may settle.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not want to say much on this Bill except to associate myself with the comments made by hon. Mang'oli. You will note that in the past there have been many Questions here relating to land because the previous land appeal committees had made a mess of such cases, making different decisions and delivering different judgments at every sitting. Our hope is that, after this Bill has been passed, incidents such as we have had in the past will not come into play in determining land cases.With regard to what hon. Malebe asked in respect of the qualifications of elders, we must realise that elders we have at this particular time are not the same ones we used to have in the past. The former elders were mature and immune to influence. This is an area that can cause a lot of confusion and concern. So long as the Attorney—General can instal proper safeguards against unfair influence from any source, be it financial or status, our people will benefit from this Bill.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, these comments are well taken. I would have been happy to see those old fellows back, including my father who worked all his life dealing with land cases in an appeals</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (CTD.):tribunal under the African District Court, but I am afraid they have passed away and we cannot resurrect them. So, we will have to do the best with the elders we have at the moment.(Question put and agreed to)(The Bill was accordingly read the Third Time and passed)Second ReadingThe Non—Governmental Organisations Bill(The Minister of State, Office of the President, (Mr. Nabwera) on 11.12.90)(Resumption of Date interrupted on 11.1290)</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Mutiso, you were contributing when the Housewas adjourned last time.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING/(Mr. Mutiso): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, when the House rose last Tuesday, I hadjust started contributing to this very important Bill. I was saying that theMinister of State, Office of the President should be thanked very much for havingconsidered it opportune to bring up this very important Bill at this particulartime, this is one of the Bills that have been very much overdue.Mr. Deputy Speaker left the Chair .The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mureithi) took the ChairFirst of all, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we realise that the security of our country is very important for our national development. Therefore, the country must safeguard the movements of certain individuals in the country whose motives are not fully defined and whose business is not clearly known. In the past, some people were discovered in Turkana and some other areas communicating with other countries using radio equipment. Some of them even had very offensive weapons. The majority of these people came to this country under the guise of certain mission which are under the umbrella of non—governmental organizations.We also have had a very serious "battle" with Amnesty International, which also comes under the same cover.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND HOUSING (Mr. Mutiso) Ctd:I have gone through this Bill and I am satisfied that the Mini ster has touched on all the necessary areas particularly on the appoint¬ment of the members of the hoard by the Minister and the chairman who will be appointed by the President. This actually gives us security. We wouldlike to know the kind of people we have in the country, what they are engaged in and so on. When we suspect that some of them do not qualify to move freely in our country, then we have the right to deny them that freedom of movement.The other point I wanted to elaborate on is the fact that Kenya is carrying out its projects under the umbrella of the district focus for rural development. If NGOs are serious in aiding Kenya to develop, it is important that objectives be made known through the district development committees (DDC). In this way, DDCs in given areas will check the projects the NGOs have in mind. so that they do not become a duplication of the projects the Government is engaged in.This Bill impressed me a lot and I urge the House to support and encourage those IIGOs which have been doing a good job to go with their work. It is important that we scrutinize these people so that we canknow precisely where they come, what they want to engage in and the compositions of their staff. This is because a person can come under the cover of a particular. . EGO as a researcher or a specialist of some sort when, in fact, he may be a spy; This has happened in many governments in the developing world where there are no qualified  researchers or where there is a new government and its leaders have not come into grips with mechanisms of organizing a government. Such governments may end up with many people .spying an them and they may be plunged into chaos as a result. Some countries are faced with unrests from time to time and the reason behind this may be freedom of movement given to these NGOs. Some of them may be involved inpeaceful missions  whereas they are actually engaged in subversive activities in order to impose leaders of their choice in given governments. This is what  I wanted to highlight on this Bill.When the time comes for the registration of these BGOs, some of them might be denied registration because they will appear very suspicious from the outset. When this Bill becomes law, it will give the Government authority to check these people and to ensure that Kenya progresses without foreign interference. Also, those HGOs which are doing ' good work will be allowed to operate freely but those which prove to be of service to other masters other than Kenyans, the Government will be able to take appropriate action since the law will be there to protect its citizens.Since I know that we have a lot of business ahead of us, and because many hon. Members wish to speak on this Bill, I will give the Floor to the next speaker.Thank you, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AMD BROADCAST HUG (Mr. Hassir Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is one of the Bills which we should be proud of because it is after keeping our country under the Uyayo philosophy of peace, love and unity. These are the kind of Bills which will make Kenya not to be like Sudan. Christians and Muslims in Sudan would like to live in peace but the idea is to make them fight one another. Some of the people want to see bloodshed in Africa. For example, they can give money and tell the people "Be very careful because we do not want to have mare christians in this part." The other group is also given the money and told "See to it that we do not have many muslims in this part." This is why I will keep on saying that we are lucky to have a President who is looking at our future and that of our children. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Bill is not trying to stop anybody from giving help to Kenya; we need the help but not bloodshed. You will find that this Bill will help both christians and muslims But we have money given from different countries to make muslims in Kenya fight one another They do not fight physically but we quarrel in mosques and this spoils the name of our country.It is easy for somebody to give money under the pretext that he helping some organisation while  the; idea is to make the organisation strong politically; we must watch out for such motives.Whenever we are told how to hold elections and run our Government by foreigners we tell them that although we are - poor third world people we are clever and can manage our affairs. This why this Bill has been introduced in the House, we need more Bills like this one in order to protect our unity, security and  peace. Many people in the world had said that Kenyans had quarrelled and they would fight, but after the last Kanu Special Delegates Conference they saw every Kenyan shaking the other. I want to assure superpowers that no leader will ever make a Kenyan tribe to fight another i Kenyan tribe.The foreigners can use as much money as they want but we will remain peaceful because our freedom fighters fought so that we could have freedom, democracy and run our  the affairs of our country for ourselves. The intention of the late  Mzee Jomo Eenyatta and President  has been a secure future for our children and it will remain like that. They can pour as much money as they want in mosques and churches to cause trouble but I can assure them that they will never succeed; even after we are dead they willfind children and grandchildren will continue one another.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have seen peoplewho know better than us looking for guns to shoot one  another.Does it show that you are civilized when you believe in using thegun instead of negotiations to settle disputes? The Gulf crisis is anot a problem for the Americans, Saddam Hussein or Saudi Arabia but for the world. I hope those who think they are educated should  use their brain and make other human understand one another so that we do not suffer a lot v	I hope we will pass this Bill and others like it for thepeace of our country and rest of the world. Thank you, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTERS FOE CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES 	(Mrs Ogot): Thank you, sir. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I amthankful to get this opportunity to say a few words on this very important Bill on Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). For many years now the NGOs have been doing a lot of good work in Kenya. I am sure that the aims and objectives of this Bill is to consolidate the work of both local and international NGOs and make easier for us and them.	A lot of development projects run the NGOs have beenimplemented in Kenya. If the Chair permits me, I will first of alldeal with the international. NGOs.  In page 545 of the BillClause 7(a) says:-"The functions of the Board shall be:-	to facilitate and co-ordinate the work	of all national and international Non-Governmental organizations operating in Kenya"Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, some NGOs have expressed some misgivings as to the effect of this Bill when it is finally passed. I want to  assure them there should not be any fear. This is because in all developed countries there are boards such as the one to be established under this Bill which regulates the work of either the S church, Governments or other organisations. I feel that there has been a delay in introducing this Bill but now  that it has been introduced we are very grateful to the Attorney General for doing that. we are further grateful to the Office of the ,which has seen it fit to put the ac work if the NGOs under one board.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am asking the Minister? concerned that when it comes to appointment of members of this board only men and women of great integrity, whose main objective will be to enhance the work of the NGOs, will be appointed. I am saying this because very many organizations Till come under the umbrella of this board: some whose registration will need to be effected quickly and also facilitating their movement within the country in order for our people to get maximum benefits it of the various activities undertaken by them.THD ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mrs. Ogot) (ctd.):I know this will be done because His Excellency the President, who has spearheaded the development of this country, is speedy and wise in areas of" operation towardsgiving services to wananchi.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to allay the fears of inter¬national NGOs in that this Bill will also give them protection against unwarranted attacks or from areas where, in our own way, we might have delayed their progress. It will also assist them in that all the monies that they intend to spend in this country in various programmes will be monitored, audited and be spent well. So, I think they should not worry thinking that their operations will be curtailed. ;	I think this Bill will enhance and assist their operations.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, turning to the areas where international 	NGOs have assisted this country, I want the House to know some of the areas whichhave been assisted by those organizations in this country. Many programmes which have been funded have been areas of women development. I can think of a few, and one of them which comes quickly into ray mind is where the NGOs have assisted in giving a revolving fund to women groups in several districts of this country. This revolving fund has assisted many women groups to start small-scale businesses which are revolving around their own home areas. The revolving fund has also assisted in book-keeping training and the area of business management, making it a good venture for the whole family.The other area that the revolving fund has assisted is in the training of women entrepreneurs to start small-scale industries, quite a number of whichhave been very effective in all the districts of Kenya. The NGOs have also assisted in maternal and child health programme. This has been very useful in that it has assisted the work of the Government, where the Government has donated enough '	funds to supplement the work.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, international NGOs, in collaboration with the local ones, have also assisted in the expansion of water supply in several areas of Kenya. They have also helped in sinking shallow wells and boreholes and in providing pipes in order to enhance the work of the Kenya Government. The same has been the case in the areas of agriculture and education. I am enumerating these programmes because the board is getting a number of good workers under its umbrella. I know that some NGOs have tried to cause chaos in this country, but those are isolated cases. The majority of NGOs, local or international come out with the sole purpose of assisting. I am saying this because their work has been seen and even praised by the President and quite a number of leaders in this country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the setting up of the board will curtail the working of the NGOs which have different motives other than the original ones. The relationship between the Kenya Government and the donor countries where the NGOs come from should be improved under this board. I am saying this because the Kenya Government offers very beautiful surroundings for NGOs. It offers peace and security which are not known in many African countries. We also offer good relationships since our people are known to be very friendly. I feel, therefore, that NGOs, particularly those from outside this country, should reciprocate in assisting us by being good ambassadors of this country. I am surprised that quite a number of NGOs, which are having a good time in Kenya, did not act quickly to strengthen the relationships between us and their countries of origin when we had difficult times. They did not maintain the good image of Kenya which is being tarnished all the time by saying that we have done well and have co-ordinated the work of our people. I am appealing to those NGOs which will be accredited to Kenya and which will be registered under the board to be our good ambassadors and to say the truth about the development of Kenya and also about the good leader¬ship in Kenya.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, on the area registration, I wish to appeal to the Minister concerned, who has been sitting in the House since the Bill was moved. There has been a little outcry from both international and local NGOs that the registration fees might be a little bit high. But since the Minister, like His Excellency the President, will be mindful of other people's welfare, should consider that point himself in order to make it possible for more NGOs to register. After all, they are bringing their own funds to assist Kenya's programmes. For the local NGOs, I am sure that the Minister is aware that they may not be able to afford a high fee. I am thinking of the small NGOs which are doing a good job but who may not be in a position to afford a high fee.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, turning to the composition of the board, I am not being mean but, apart from the members who will be appointed direct by His Excellency the Present, I hope that the Minister will ensure that quite a of women are appointed to the board. I am saying so because quite a number of the programmes which are undertaken by both international and local NGOs do affect families. I am feeling that by having more women members in this very important board we will be in a position to identify proper programmes and be in a position to assist the NGOs which are going to work on these programmes to prioritize the programmes that will affect and assist the families much more than the others. That is as far as priority goes.On the question of peace and stability, Sir, the money that we get from abroad, be it through NGOs or throguh other organizations should not have any strings attached. I am saying this because when the chips are down, it is probably better to be a little bit hungry than get quite a lot of money which will create chaos.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg &to support the Bill. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Mwenje): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like to speak in support of this Bill because it is very import¬ant and it has cone at the right time.Originally, what was expected of the Non-Governmental Organisation (NGOs) is that if they had any project that they needed to undertake in the country, they needed to liaise their proposals with the local D.D.C.s which has not been happening. We have seen the NGOs coming in and starting certain projects even where they have not been approved by the local D.D.C.s. So, if this procedure had worked well may be it would have not been necessary to have a Board. But now we have seen that this has not worked well. The NGOs, as much as we need them, have not been liaising their projects with the local D.D.C.s. So, I think, the question of instituting a Board has come to be necessary. The hope that once the Board is in operation will solve most of the problems which we have been having. For instance, we find NGOs having started projects in certain areas without even the local Members of Parliament knowing what is happening simply beca¬use they have the money. we hope the Board will, therefore, also realise that they need to liaise whatever projects the NGOs want to do to liaise with the local D.D.C.s so that they are also aware of what might be taking place in such and such a place.Sir, I want to say here that we all do appreciate the assistance that we have be given by the NGOs ,and no country will refuse an honest assistance from anybody. So, we do appreciate what has been done by the NGOs in this country. They have done some very good projects and they have gone a long way to subsidies internationally and locally to come and assist us. we would like  to appeal that they should come and assist us-. .All we are saying here is that there should be a procedure whereby they should be known they are here. They should be registered and their activi¬ties known. And because we believe that they are coming here with honest enterprises or honest ideas to assist our people, then they should be known and registered. There should be a Board to deal with them, and that is why it is important to support this 3ill so that such a Board can established and start operation immediately.There is  fear from some qurters of the churches. They think that the Board is coming to curtail or interfere with their operations, or even possibly to make sure that they do not bring money or control them directly. It is here that we should tell them, particularly the NGOs that are related to some churches that that is not the intention of this Bill at all. I have seen one or two members the churches who have told me that we must not interfere with the NGOs because they have been supplementing a lot of Government efforts in the development of this country. I agree; they have, but it is also good to assure them that the intention of the Bill is not to interfere with whatever they are interested in doing. However, there is no country that will allow money to come into the country without knowing where it is coming from, for what purposes,, and how it is going to be operated. Therefore, this Board is necessary to monitor this kind of thing because, for a long time, they have been left with a free hand to do whatever they wanted to do. In fact, for the purpose of international donors and international NGOs, the Board will also help them to make sure that they are being monitored to use the money for the purpose originally intended for. a lot of work which otherwise the Government would have had to do for the people, if it were not for the NGOs. we do appreciate and we would encourage many more NGOs .internationally and locally to come and assist us. we would like  to appeal that they should come and assist us .All we are saying here is that there should be a procedure whereby they should be known they are here. They should be registered and their activi¬ties known. And because we believe that they are coming here with honest enterprises or honest ideas to assist our people, then they should be known and registered. There should be a Board to deal with them, and that is why it is important to support this 3ill so that such a Board can established and start operation immediately.There is see fear from some quarters of the churches. They think that the Board is coming to curtail or interfere with their operations, or even possibly to make sure that they do not bring money or control them directly. It is here that we should tell them, particularly the NGOs that are related to some churches that that is not the intention of this Bill at all. I have seen one or two members the churches who have told me that we must not interfere with the NGOs because they have been supplementing a lot of Government efforts in the development of this country. I agree; they have, but it is also good to assure them that the intention of the Bill is not to interfere with whatever they are interested in doing. However, there is no country that will allow money to come into the country without knowing where it is coming from, for what purposes,, and how it is going to be operated. Therefore, this Board is necessary to monitor this kind of thing because, for a long time, they have been left with a free hand to do whatever they wanted to do. In fact, for the purpose of international donors and international NGOs, the Board will also help them to make sure that they are being monitored to use the money for the purpose originally intended for. In fact, even for business enterprises, this is alsotrue. The Central Bank of Kenya has also been monitoring theamount of money that come here from overseas, and for what purpose.In fact, all commercial banks are required to inform the CentralBank of Kenya the amount of money that comes here in foreigncurrency, for what purpose and how it was utilized. When we saythat- such and such an amount of money is meant for the NGOs, theactual use of that money after that is never monitored. This iswhy this Board will serve  a useful purpose both to the donorsand the country to know precisely what the NGOs are doing. ThisBoard is, therefore, long overdue. It will assist us a lot toknow, precisely what is being done.Therefore, it is important for the Government to assure the NGOs that we do appreciate whatever they are doing. We are not going to interfere with their operations. In fact, we are not going to tell them that if such and such money had come for a nursery school then they have to put up a primary school. No I But they should take our guidance and bring their proposals so that we can also advise them from our local point of view as to what are our priorities and so on. For instance, I will cite one or two projects in my area which were started by the NGOs but they are no longer operational. The funds got finished. The local had the idea that they were going to be assisted. So they needed not to contribute. But eventually, when they saw that the project was collapsing, the Government was forced to take over. However, if there was somebody monitoring, we would have known that they were running short of money and we would have been informed on time This is why I feel that it is important that we should have a Beard to look into the operations of the NGOs almost immediately.Otherwise, Sir, it is also important for the Board members to visit those projects and establish precisely how the money is spent and whether the projects are useful. They should not just sit and do things from an office. They should go to the fields and see the projects for themselves so that they can assert in advance whether the projects are likely to succeed or not. Sometimes the Government may have a similar project with the NGO and if the intention is to serve the local people, then maybe they could join hands. If there was such a Board monitoring the activities of the NGOs, they would co-ordinate them with those of the Government. They would liaise with the NGOs and see whether the Government could be incorporated and assist one another. So, the NGOs have been left a bit "loose" without any controlling point. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, you will also realise that some of this money which comes here from friendly countriesand also from some unfriendly countries That has been happeningis that  and those of us who have worked in the banks have see it  they open what they call external accounts. The way these external accounts operate is that although that money is in Kenya it is as good as it could have been in a bank anywhere else in the world. This is because that money can be transferredany time to another country without anyone having to seek authority from the Central Bank of Kenya. Although that money is brought here by embassies or non-Governmental Organizations it can be taken away without authority from Treasury.There was a case involving the NORAD. This is a big organization and they have an external account in this country. The money is kept in an external, account in Kenya Shillings. But if you wanted to take that money back to Norway tomorrow morning you could do it without seeking authority from the Central Bank of Kenya. So, the money,  although it is here, is still under theircontrol. I am not saying that is illegal; it is quite legal. It is done in accordance with the laws of our country. You open anexternal account and that money is kept there. But that money can be returned back to that country tomorrow morning. So, even if the money had been brought here to be used on the intended projects it is still under their direct control.Some NGOs are operating external bankaccounts and this is perfectly in order. This is because they have to pay	salaries to	expatriates in foreign currency. Thatis quite okay. But how do you - monitor them unless there is a board to monitor their operation that is why you saw an organization as a big as NORAD with all the money that they had brought her You will find that all that money is not used in this country. Some of it  goes back to their own country because it is kept here in foreign currency; but the account is maintained in the Kenya Shilling. So, the NGOs have a free hand in operating these accounts; they are not monitored by anybody. You may have been told that so many .millions were brought in Kenya butwhere was. the money kept? It was kept in an external account which is under the control of the donors. That money can be taken back tomorrow and you will not be told when that happens. we are told that so much money is coming here through NGOs and through other foreign agencies but we are not told how muchmoney went back there because they did not have to seek authority from the Central Bank of Kenya to return the money back to their country. This is because the money is maintained or kept in an external account. That is quite legal. So, the intention ofopening these bank accounts When expatriates are proceedingon leave or when they are buying cars from abroad then they can pay in foreign currency, without having to look for an import licence. Therefore you are not able to know how much of the money that came was actually spent here and how much went back to the same country it came from. So, the Board that we are seeking to establish must have some kind of authority; to know how much money came and how much money went back, particularly with regard to those NGOs operating	external bank accounts in this country.For those operating local accounts it is easy to monitor their operations because they still have to be authorised by the Central Bank of Kenya; they have to explain why theyneed to transfer that money. But for the NGOs operating external bank accounts in this country, the Board will need to have theThis is because even if that money was used wrongly Peoplehave been moving out of this country to go and settle in other countries and you wonder how they get that money. This is because some of these organizations are operating external bank accounts and they can draw foreign currency and go away with that money immediately. They do not need the authority of the Central Sank of Kenya; they will just draw foreign currency from the external account and go with it and you will have no control over that. These are some of the loopholes that the 3oard will have to look into; to see how much money came into the country and whether it was properly	used; for the intendedpurpose.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I say this because if any of our enemies wanted to use those accounts for instancesending money into this country for dubious means We know wehave a lot of friends but we also have a few enemies. If they wanted to use that opportunity they could use. All that I am saying is that the Board should be able to monitor everything and be able to know whether whatever money came here was used in the right manner or not. They should be able to ensure that the money is not drawn from any of those accounts to assist somebody who is out to mess up this country and run away and so on. So, we hope and trust that the NGOs which will	be registered  by thisBoard will be sincere; with the interest of this country at heart and coming here to assist our own people. We do welcome the; as many of them as possible are free to come here. This is because as much we are inviting investors  to come and invest here equally we should welcome the NGOs. I agree that we had left a loophole which could haveenabled somebody to misuse NGOs, and at the end of the day the wananchi would be told "We have had so much of  this money coming into Kenya" and yet that money was never spent here. Therefore the Board will be charged with the responsibility of telling us what the NGOs are doing; whether they are doing what they had indicated in their application forms.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is for this reason, that I agree with and support His Excellencythe President when he says that when people issue funny statements- Some people have been issuing statements n which they havealmost insulted His Excellency the President. I support very strongly . what His Excellency the  President said; that stem action should be taken against those fellows. You never know; maybe those fellows have been told "Even if things go wrong we l assist you; you will be evacuated." That is why I feel that it isimportant for those people who are uttering some things hisis because what comes out of a man's mouth comes from his heart. That is why serious action should be taken against those fellows who insult this country, the Government, the party Kanu and the leaders of this country. This earns that they have norespect for our country and therefore action should be taken against them. We have seen others who have written before but no action has been taken against them. We hope that in future action will taken against these people. These people must realise that what they say will not be taken as a joke. I do not want to say much on this Bill. I want to give others a chance to speak. we are talking about NGOs andhere in Nairobi His Excellency the President has started whathas come to be known as the Hawkers Fund. I would like to appeal to the NGOs also to come to the assistance of these hawkers by possibly contributing something, through the President, to the Hawkers' Fund. This is  because we need to settle thesepeople. They need to do honest business which we believe they will do. The President has devoted himself to assist them by starting a	Hawkers' Fund. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the non-governmental organizations have been talking about the plight of those whose dwellings were demolished by the Nairobi City Commission and I think they should also come in and assist. They should, perhaps, contribute something to the Hawkers' Fund and even channel any other assistance through the Nairobi City Commission. In this way we will be able to settle these hawkers once and for all within the City, particularly in good environments for them. We hope and believe that the Nairobi City Commission will recipro¬cate by demarcating areas where we can settle these hawkers. Let me cite the case of shoeshine’s who need special allocation for their genuine and honest business.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if possible, the shoeshine’s should, beside being allocated special places to operate their businesses, be assisted through the Hawkers' Fund. They are also important people who should be placed in their right places within the City. I know there are non-governmental organizations that are sincere and who hold this country at heart and that those will sincerely come out and contribute some money towards this Fund that has been initiated by none other than His Excellency the President to assist our people.Even when some of these non-governmental organizations are being registered, they should try to go mainly in the rural areas where we have the unfortunate members of our community. I hope when the Board is formed it will be advising the non-governmental organizations on which particular areas their assistance will be most needed. They should not be left to make independent decisions on where to assist. Sometimes, they make errors by initiating projects in areas where there are similar ones and; hence, having duplication of projects.I also hope that when the Minister comes to reply, he will assure the non-governmental organizations, particularly those attached to churches, that they have nothing to fear. They had been fearing that, possibly, the introduction of this legislation was coming in to curtail what they wanted to do. They are welcome and can bring in as many millions of shillings as they can, so long as they accomplish the intended purposes and not any other sinister motives.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to contribute on this very important Bill. The non¬governmental organisations contribution has been an issue that all of us, as leaders, have always felt that there should be a central mechanism of control. From the outset, let me very sincerely support the Minister for moving this Bill. He has done that at the right time when all of us, as leaders in the various sectors of our country, have been wondering about some of the non-governmental organisations' behaviors.Sir, there are known cases of some non-governmental organisations attempting to question the authority and leadership of our Government. By consolidating the operations of these organisations under one umbrella and having them submitting their proposals for assistance, that means that the Government will be in a position to regulate their operations and supervise their activities* While supporting the Minister for this move, I was wonder¬ing how the Board is going to earn income, because the is an area that shows that they will be preparing their estimates but we cannot see any revenue aspect.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the most important aspect of this Bill is to ensure that all non-governmental organisations are, once and for all, put in a position where they will be regulated and checked. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I happy that the Minister of s State, Office of the President has thought it wise to brine this Bill to the House to make sure that the activities of these non-governmental organisations are monitored. I am  pleased to notes that originations like the Green Belt Movement will, after this Bill becomes law, be monitored by the Government. This organization has  always been talking about planting trees but we do not seem to see any trees. that they are planting. This particular organization was started for the sole purpose of enriching; certain inviduals so that they can continue employing their sisters and brothers in this organization. I am pleased to note that this Bill says that the Minister  shall have the authority  in the employment of our people .in these non-Governmental organizations. Therefore, it is  hope that when these organizations are employing; people, they will be bound by the regulations to give the relevant information to the Government as to whom they are employing. It has been their practice in the past to employ their own people and pay them huge salaries.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is one point which. I would like the Minister, when he stands up to respond to make some clarification This is in Clause 4 which says:-"The Minister any, by notice in the Gazette exempt certain such a non-governmental organization from registration as he may determine"Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the minister who is moving this Bill today, fully supports the President. However, there may be in future a Minister in future who may be working for  other people and not the Government. Suppose we have such a Minister with no interest in the  welfare of this Government? I think he will keep on exempting non-go very organizations from being registered, and these organization could have ill motives of undermining this Government. Something ought really to be done so that any minister in the future does not use this clause to perpetuate his own interest by exempting non-governmental organization from registration because this would  the welfare of this Government. I am saying this because although the minister today is a Minister who fully supports our Government, perhaps there could be a Minister in future who would not have the interest of our Government at  heart and this is by I am saying that if the Minister should execute his duties fairly in consultation with the Attorney-General's Chamber, so that he does not violate the laid down regulation.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, clause 11 talks about fees to be paid. I an sure that the Attorney-General will bear a witness that no specific amounts have been mentioned under this clause which therefore means that the Minister will have to decide how much these nongovernmentalorganizations are supposed to a pay in terns of fees. That means he will call eachorganization in his office and tell them, "You will have to pay meShs.20,00C/-" without following any laid down regulation.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would now like to come toClause 19 which says:-"Any organization which is aggrieved by the decision of the Board	"Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are non-governmental organizationswhich may decide to violate the decision of the board for the purpose of wantingto deal with the Minister directly. Under this Clause 19 sub clause (3), they" The decision of the Minister shall be final". .We honour this fact, but I hope that any Minister who is given these powers will given them on trust and thus made the trustee of these cases. I also hope that he will not abuse the privileged that he will have been given by this Parliament to collude with non-governmental organisations which do not register with this Board and</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as you continue to listen to hon. Mang'oli, you immediately come to the conclusion that he is imputing improper motives to whoever may be appointed Minister in future to deal with this matter. How on earth can this hon. Member say that any Minister now or in future may abuse these powers? This is one of those thing where pessimism is not the answer. Do not look at the black side of things all the time. Optima is better here. So, I think it is unfair and uncalled for to impute a motive to the effect that the Minister who may be appointed in good faith may abuse these powers, because there is nothing to suggest that the Minister may do anything that is contrary to the spirit of the resultant Act. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when I started speaking, I said that I was going to make a cautionary statement. If the Attorney General thinks that I am imputing an improver motive on the Minister, I withdraw my remarks. However, I was only airing a very honest reaction to this Bill. The Bill will be passed sill right, but the Attorney—General and Mang'oli who are here today may not be there tomorrow. We are making laws</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mureithi): Mr. Mang'oli, perhaps the Attorney-General wants you to stick to the Bill without imagining what will happen in future. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, with due respect to your ruling, I want to say that we want the Act that is going to be enacted when this Bill is passed to be implemented. What we are saying here is what will happen once the Bill is passed. All I am saying in honesty is that the Act that is going to be enacted after this Bill is passed will be adhered to because</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER	(Mr.  Mureithi):	Mr.  Mang'oli,   theissue  here  is  that you are  trying to say  that  in  future  a Minister may beappointed  who  may  not  do  his  job  in  good  faith,  and  that  is  the  point  of orderraised by  the  Attorney-General.

If we  are  allowed  to  do  so,  we  will  take  a week  to  finalise  our  discussions  of this  Bill. These  organisations  have  attempted to  sabotage  this Government with  their  finances. 	They  operate  from villages,  and  even  this  Bill  does  not provide  for  the  monitoring of  their  activities  in  sub-locations. 	Some  of  them have  threatened never  to  come  back here  after this  Bill  is  passed. So,  we should  tell  them  that  this  Bill  is  meant  to regulate  their activities so  that we may have  law and  order. It  is  important that all  of us  here  support  this Bill. Some of these NGOs go to the extent	of buying uniforms forschools and yet  their  intentions are not known.   The Government must have records and be  in a position to follow   up such activities. For example, there  is an office of Action-Aid Kenya   in Webuye and yet   we do not see any of their activities in the  area. They operate from Webuye but  carry out projects outside this area. I  support this Bill fully and we  should discuss every bit of it. I realise that we shall have a board and 	a council as far as this Bill is concerned and I feel that there might be duplication of work. We  ah auld   speak loud and clear on NGOs so that we know what they are doing and also monitor their finances. I hope that when the Minister  comes to reply,  he will explain to the House the functions of the Minister,  the board and the Kenya National Council of-Voluntary Agencies. Some of the NGOs can come under  the Agencies' umbrella and go against  the instructions 	of the Minister  or the board.   We must incorporate  our feelings and their feelings as well. Finally,  I would like to bring to the attention of the Attorney-General the fact that when drawing up Bills,  there	is   a tendency of sidelines -some of the issues which affect this nation.	Members of Parliament areknowledgeable   and can deal with these matters adequately.   For example, under the establishment  of the Council we have permanent  secretaries,  provincial commissioners, district commissioners,  chiefs,  district officers   and so on whereas very important persons,  that  is,  Members of Parliament,  are left out. In future,  the Attorney-General</Newspeech><Newspeech>MINISTER OF STATE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT	(Mr.  Nabwera): 	On a point of information,  Sir.   I would not like to interrupt the hon.  Member for webuye but, if he looked at the  composition of the Council,  he would note that the only Government officers in that Council are those whose Ministries very. relevant to the operations of the Board; namely, the Permanent V.2		13-12:-90Secretary in the Office of the President in charge of 	non-governmental organisations, who will be responsible for all the organisations operations; the Permanent Secretary in the Treasury;  the Permanent Secretary for Economic Planning because all the planning in the rural areas come under that Ministry. There will be the Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of Culture and Social Services and then the Attorney-General. These are only six members out of 20. The rest will be drawn from the very group that the hon. Member is thinking of.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR.  MANG'OLI:   Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  all I was appealing for  is that    You know almost all the times, when Bills are passed here creating various councils or boards,  Permanent Secretaries are made members. I am not challenging the Minister but, with all due respect you will find that they are nominated into everybody that is created through an Act of Parliament. So,  we were wondering whether they normally attend the board meetings in person or whether  it is by proxy.	If it is not in person, how effective are the officersthat they appoint  to be their proxies.	I know the Minister's intentions aregood and I  cannot challenge him. I am sure that a lot will be done when this Bill is passed on the regulation of the non-governmental organisations. 	I hope in  the 	20 members he has  talked about,  hon. Members will be co-opted at the divisional tad Ix   level,  so that they can also be seen to be participating in the activities of these organisations,  some  of which are very slippery. 	With those  few remarks,  I  support  the Bill.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR.  TIMER: 	Thank you 	very  much,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir, for going me  this  opportunity  to  express  my views  on  this  very important Bill. I  am  not going  to  take much  time because  a good number of hon.  Members have made their views known. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  on  the  composition of the board,  I think  all  provinces  should be  represented. 	I  understand  that  there  should not be more  than seven members  appointed by the Minister,  and I  think the Minister will  take-provinces  into consideration  so  that  they are  all  represented,  excluding Nairobi Area because we have  a good number  of permanent secretaries  based  in Nairobi  and who  are  members  of the board. The  appointment  of five members  by the Minister,  on recommendation of the  council,  to represent diversified areas of NG0s- I  think  the Minister  should not have  these members  recommended by the  council  and then taken just  like  that. These  people  should be  vetted so  that we know exactly what  they  are  going  to  do when  they  join the  board. 	Turning  to  paragraph  13,  which  says  that every  certificate  issued  to an organization  shall  be  in  the  prescribed  form  and  shall,  unless  sooner council,  be valid for a period of 60 months.	I  think  the period  is  too  longThe  certificate  should be  renewable  after every  three years.	I  hope  that  some-thing will  be  done  about  that one. Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I  agree  that  the  board should refuse -registration of applicants on condition. 	I  think  the  board  should be  having people who  can  investigate why or not  they should grant registration to an NGO. ' I  do not know how the board will be able to determine whether one  is  fit for 	registration or not. Turning to Clause 15,  if an officer has made some mistake,  he should not be  allowed  to join the organization again because such an officer may not be good. 	On Clause-17,  I  think work permit  is a very sensitive area because some of the employees of the NGOs come from abroad. 	I  think  the  Government  should -	vet  them-because  they may be  coming with other motives and  can really bring a lot of problems to our Government. 	Some  of the  people who come  to Kenya under  the  guise  of NGOs may be  trained  intelligence people  from other countries  to cause chaos  or destabilization of our  country. Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  turning to Clause 22 which deals with offences  and penalties,  I agree with the provision that any person who has been convicted of an offence under  this part shall be disqualified from holding office. This  is  a very good area. Turning  to  Clause  32,  when  it  comes  to  importation  of goods  by NGOs, I  think  the Government should verify what sort of goods and equipment  the NGOs will  be  importing  to  the  country.	They may be  importing equipment that may beused  for  subversion.	All  equipment  coming  to  the  country	must be  strictlyscrutinized. Again,  Sir,  when it comes  to  employment,  I  think,  the Government  should have  a deliberate  Policy to have most  of the senior posts manned by  our citizens.	Most  of  the  NGOs cone  fromoutside.	They  are  supposed to  be  helping us  in terms  of economicdevelopment and we  should be very careful with them because  they Maybe  having  "strings"  attached to  their operations. This  is why before  registering them a lot  of investigations  and  scrutiny should-go  into those  organisations. With those  few remarks,  Sir,   I  beg to  support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILDLIPE 	 (Mr.  Gakanju): 	Thank you for giving me the  opportunity,  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  to  speak on this important Bill. Listening to my honourable  collagues,  I find that there is  very little  praise  on the work done  by  the NGOs  in this country, but,  I  think,  in reality,  we  should commend the work that has been done  by  the  majority  of the  NGOs in this country rather than condent them wholesale.	I think we  must  appreciate  the  fact  that theseorganisations  are  non-profit making.	Many of  them are  voluntaryand many  of  our people  have  benefited by the work done and which continues  to  be  done  by the majority of the -11G0s. However,  there maybe  some  of them who may not be very clear in their objectives 	and activities.	But  I think we  should record  our appreciationfor the very good work that has been done by the majority of the NGOs. Another point,  Sir,  that I would like to mention here the  fact  that the  NGOs  do  not necessarily have  to be foreign. There  are  some NGOs which are  local and we,  as leaders,  should encourage  our people  to  form more  and more NGOs to work and assist the  Government  in the work of building this nation. Our people should be  able  to do  voluntary work.  I  think this  is  the  time  to  sneak about  our people not doing voluntary work. The  term of  "being mindful  of the  less fortunate members  of  our society"  should be  seen in Practice  by our people. Cur people  should  form voluntary  organisations  even in the  districts  and divisions  to  help the  less  fortunate  people but not  to leave  all  the work to be  done  by foreign NGOs and the Government. my third point, Sir,  is about the involvement of our people  in the work  of  the  foreign NGOs . 	When  some  of the  NGOs leave  an area the work that they were  doing is discontinued  simply because  the  officer who was handling the matter was a foreigner. Therefore,  the  scheme  or the work that they had started collapse. I  think this  is  an area that we  need to  be  careful and take  safeguards  to make sure that there  is continuity even when an NGO leaves  an  area.   Mr.	Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I think it isimportant  that  the  local committees-</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  KIPKORIR:  On a	point  of order,  Mr.  TemporaryDeputy  Speaker,  Sir.	Since time  is moving so  fast,  would  I bein order to move that the  Mover  	  be  now called upon to reply?</Newspeech>(Question that  the  mover be now called upon to   reply,  Put  and agreed to) <Newspeech>THE MINISTER OF  STATE,  OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT(Mr.  Nabwera) Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,	I would like  to thank hon.Members who have  spoken in support  of this Bill.	I assure  theHouse  that  the  views that  have  been expressed .	will be  taken intcaccount  when the  Government  comes  to  appoint  the Board and  set the machinery into motion. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  just briefly,  I think that what has  been said-What  I would like  to respond to  is what we  think is the  work of the NGOs. I  said  in my  opening re marks that NGOs have  made  a big contribution to the development  of our country and  that  the  Government does  appreciate. that  contribution made by the  NGOs.	We  shall continue  to make  sure  that NGOs arewell catered for and that they do	  their work under peaceful conditions.	But  that  is not  saying that  all NGOs  havebeen blameless.	You can see  the jitteriness  of	  some  of theNGOs  connected with certain.	 	churches.	I would like  toassure the  House  that  once  the Board has  been established scrutinywill be mane	so  that no NGOs	are  allowed to  operate  outside  thesystem which the  Government understands.	This  is  because  if theyare  allowed to do  so-	If certain NGOs  are  allowed to engage  in  activities which are  inimical to the  development  of this  country, then they will  be de-registered. That  is why  there  is  that provision. Broadly,  as  I  said,  there  are  three  types  of NGOs and we  have  completely  exempted the women groups  because  they do  not need  to  be registered  again.	They are  registered under the  Ministerof Culture  and  Social  Services.	Therefore  they will not  beregistered under this Act.	The  ones  that we  are  very suchInterested in would be the  International non-Governmental  Organizations  and  then the national NGOs..I would like  to  state that there  certain	nationalNGOs that will have  to mend their ways.	This  is  because  if theyreceive  money  from foreign  sources,  this  money must be known.	Wemust  know how much money has  entered Kenya and where  this  moneyis  being used to  enable  the NGOs to undertake  the  work they aresupposed to be  doing.	We  will not,  as  a  Government,  allow certainNGOs whether international  or national to pretend .	that  they arecarrying out  certain functions in the  country when in  fact they cannot properly  account  for the  money they have  received. 	The  donor; whether foreign Governments  or our  own Government  or  individuals expect that  the  money will be  properly used  if it  is  for Planting trees,  like  the  Green Belt Movement  in this  country,  then we must see  to  it  that  actually trees have been planted and nobody claims to  be planting trees and we  see none being planted. Sir,  secondly,  I would like. to  say that when we  say that Permanent  Secretaries will be  represented  on the Board,  that  means that  In their absence  there  can be their deputies representing them in the  meetings.  They do  not have  to always  personally attend  the meetings.   For example, the Attorney-General,  in person,  does not have to be attending these meetings.</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER  (Mr. Mureithi):	 Mr. Nabwera, you will	continue  in the  afternoon.</Newspeech><Header>ADJOURNMENT</Header> <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER 	(Mr. Mureithi): 	Hon.

LOTIM: 	Mr.   Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,   it  is  interesting to  hear  that  from  the  Assistant  Minister  because  they  have already	put up  classrooms, this  staff  houses  and  even  dormitories. Why  were public 	funds  used  to  build  this  institution  if  theMinistry  could  not  make  use  of  it  immediately?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.   OGUR: 	Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,   I  would  like  to inform  the  House  that  this  facility was  not  constructed  by as  a  ministry, it  was  constructed  by  the Netherlands  Government and realised  it  is  very  useful  and  we  intend  later  on, to  make  it  look  like  our  own.	This  is  because  it  was  not  putup by us so as to suit out plans and this is why it was not easy to start running it. But, we do not reject it at all. 	However,  we  did not  set funds  aside  for renovating these rooms because they  are  still  adequate. What  the  hon.  Member  is  referring to as classrooms are not  adequate  to  cater  for a nursing training centre.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  LOTIM:	Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  the Assistant Minister has saidthat  those  facilities were not constructed in accordance with their plans.	Ithought  the  donor  came here  through the Ministry of Health.	Why  did  they  allowhim  to put	up  facilities which cannot be of any use  to anybody?	What  is  theMinistry doing  to  see  to  it that the missing facilities are provided so that thenursing school  can be opened?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  OGUR:	Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  in Kapenguria Hospital  there  isa hostel which was  built with  assistance  from the Netherlands Government.	Thishostel  was  built  to  serve  a Catholic Mission Hospital.	Normally,  when a missionapproaches  the Ministry  that  they would like  to-build a mission hospital,  we do not refuse  provided plans  are  available. We give  authority  for  the  to build  it 	and urn  it.	When  they  are  defeated they again approach us  for assistance andthis	is  where  we get  tied up  before we  can get  a solution.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

I know Ortum  MissionHospital  has  a hostel which  is  self-contained,  but  the  buildings  at Kapenguria District Hospital were  meant  for  the Government school  of nursing.

OGUR: 	Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  already  explained  that we were  approached by the Netherlands Mission to put up this hostel and we agreed.    They were  using this  for  their own nurses not Government nurses.	But,  becausethey  could not  continue  to run  the facility permanently,  they approached my Ministryand  informed us  that  they  could	no  longer keep on maintaining  it.	What couldwe  do?	So we  said,  "Well,  if they buildings  are all right,  we will find out ifthey can really  suit our  category".	This  is what we have  done.	We have  foundthat  the  facilities  are not suitable and that we do not have enough tutors,  hostelsand  staff houses.	Before  we  budget  on  this,  we  cannot  tell  the hon.

The  land  in  question which lies between  plots Nos2363,	2327 and	2240 is part of LR No.	4243  and that  is why the  numberto  this  land was not given to Mr.  Saidi Hamadi Tsuma during the land  adjudication exercise at Msatbweni  as the piece of land  does not belong to him.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR.  MWAMZANDI:	Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  arising fromthe  Assistant Minister's reply LR No.	4243  and LR	4743  is not  theissue;  what  is important is why this  piece  of land was not given a number  in  favour  of Mr.  Tsuma. Any  piece  of land  cut into two by a road,  or  path,  has that fact indicated on the map by a comma. In  this  case  there  is no  indication that this  plot  continues from LR No. 4243.

MUTISO: Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  not  correct for the  hon.

That  is why I wanted to inform him,and the  House,  that he  had quoted the wrong number.	The  point isthat  the  Piece  of  land in question was  not  given LR number because it  is  part  of part  of LR NO. 	4243, which is Government land. 	Perhaps, when  the  hon.

MWAMZANDI: 	Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I  think where a  piece  of land  is  divided by a z road  there  is always  something like  inverted commas to  indicate  that  fact.    There  are  no  such commas  on the  this piece  of land which is divided by the 40 mether road to Msambweni  District Hospital;  this  means  that might have It been  an oversight  during the  lard  adjucation  exercise.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

Now that the Assistant Minister has talked about that reference, why can he now not give At? If he has really acted on this matter, he should be able to give the reference and,  at the same-time, reveal the dates when the tenders were awarded for the resealing work and such correspondence on when the contractor is expected to be at the site.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. WAGURA:   Mr. Deputy Speaker, sir,  I e just said that authority has been given and the amount of money is already known; that is, Ksh.100,000/-.  If the hon. Member insists on getting the reference number,  he can come to my office soon after this and I will  give him that number.</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR. MALEBE:   Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I do not think the Assistant Minister is serious.   I am sure the answer he has given is for convenience. If he cannot be able to produce the reference number   of the authority letter written to Maua Town Council  approving the Ksh.100,000/- expenditure on the resealing exercise,  let him be clear on that.   Let him confess that they are going to approve that because as of yesterday there-was no such letter at Maua Town Council. I will  go back on Friday and could check.   So, could he assure the House that there will be such a letter then?</Newspeech> (Mr. Wagura just continued to sit) <Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER:   Mr. Wagura, do you not wish to respond?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. WAGURA:   Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  sir,  I intended to.   What I had said was that the letter is between the Ministry and the local  authority concerned. What the hon. Member is following up sounds like a different question.   However, if he is insistent on getting the reference number, he could accompany me to the office,  soon after this, for that information.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER:   Mr. Wagura,  are you suggesting that hon. Malebe's request for the letter reference is a different question?   It cannot be.  It would be good for you to say you do not know and we get on with it.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. WAGURA:   Mr.  Deputy Speaker, Sir, what I am saying is that if hon. Malebe insists on getting the reference number, he can walk out of the Chamber with me after this and we could go to my office and I give him that number.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER:	Order.   You know very well, Mr. Wagura,  thatthis Question is no longer a property between you and hon. Malebe.	It is theproperty of the House.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. WAGURA:   Very well, Mr. Deputy Speaker. 	I will  bring the reference number to the House.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  P.K.  KINYAJUI:   On a point of order, Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir. 	I think it is very important that the Assistant Minister tells the House when the estimates were done because, if it was made before the rains and Maua is a very rainy area, then the potholes have become worse and the resealing will require more money. Could he enlighten us on that espect?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  WAGURA:   Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  if the potholes have become worse, the Ministry is prepared to allocate more money.</Newspeech> Question No.	684<Header>Permanent Terms of Service for Mr. Wamunyinyi</Header> MR. MAKHANU asked the Minister for Public Works,  since  . Mr.  Peter Wekesa Wamunyinyi  of P.O. Box 1059, Bungoma has worked continuously as a casual  worker on the Rural  Access Roads Programme from 1978 to-date, whether the Minister could consider converting his employment terms to permanent service. <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS 	(Mr. Maiyani):   Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,  I beg to reply. It is the policy within.  the Rural Access Minor Roads Programme to engage casual workers for a maximum of three months.   The engagement cannot be guaranteed beyond that period and it is only done as and when work is available.   Mr. Peter Wekesa Wamunyinyi must have been lucky to have been re-engaged several  times and the Minister,  at present,  is not in a position to guarantee him a continued employment.   In this regard,  his employment cannot be converted to permanent and pensionable terms as no such establishment has been created.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU:   Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for that reply,  I just want to plead with him that Mr. Wamunyinyi  has been working continuously, even if it was on a renewable basis.   He has never missed a day as he has continuously worked from 1978 to-date. I am sure that during all this time there have been vacancies in the Ministry,  and they still  continue to occur.   Will  the Assistant Minister confirm to this House that if any suitable vacancy is found this gentleman will  be considered since he has worked faithfully for all those years?</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI:   Mr.  Deputy Speaker, Sir,  I hope I will  be understood because, as I said, Mr. Wamunyinyi  has been able to be re-engaged from time to time because the temporary nature of his work was recurring.   Otherwise, the idea is to engage a casual worker for three months.   When that period lapses, that is the end of it. However,  if the nature of the work was that it kept on recurring and he was found to be of good character and a good worker, that is why he was always re-engaged. Even as I am speaking now, there is no guarantee that there will be work for him  next month,  or the month after.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU:   On a point of order, Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir.   My point of order is that the Assistant Minister did not understand me.   I understood his answer very well myself. I am now pleading with him for this gentleman.   The Rural Access Roads Programme is just one department of his Ministry and since this gentleman has worked since 1978, could the Assistant Minister confirm to this House that when a vacancy arises anywhere in the Ministry he will engage that person? The gentleman must be of good character since he has worked since 1978. I just want to find out the possibility of the gentleman being offered a job in the Ministry,  not necessarily with the Rural Access Roads Programme.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  MAIYANI:	Mt.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  Mr.  Peter WekesaWamunyinyi will continue to  be  engaged as long as this work is available.	But  I  cannot  say anything regarding the possibility ofplacing him on	permanent  terms  of service.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER:	Mt.

Deputy Speaker,  Sir, I  beg to reply. Home  Loans Building Society is registered as a Building Society with the  Registrar  of Building Societies and its 	registration currently  subsists. Miss  Habiba Mohamed,  should therefore  approach the Building Society  for  a refund  of her deposit.	Should  the Building Societyfail to pay back the deposit to Miss Mohamed then she can file	acivil suit  in a court  of law to enforce the repayment and should this 	action fail to  elicit a positive response then Miss Mohamed can petition the High Court  of Kenya to issue a winding-up order of  the  Society under the Winding up Procedure of the Companies Act Cap.486,  Laws  of Kenya.	The  winding-up  order will enable  theOfficial Receiver	of the Republic  of Kenya to move in and  seize theassets  of the Building Society and release them for the benefit of all creditors and depositors  of the  Society.  Miss Mohamed may also apply to  the Registrar of Building Societies under the provision of  Section 61(1)  of the Building Societies Act  Cap.	489  for the	Registrar to  institute  an investigation into  the  affairs  of the  Society.	At  the  moment  there  islittle  the	Attorney-General can do to assist  Miss Mohamed toget back her deposit with Home Loans Building Society. Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  what  I have  outlined above  is the proper procedure  that Miss Mohamed 	should  follow.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

KYONDA asked the Minister for Transport  and Communications what urgent  measures  the Ministry is taking to replace  the  telephone posts which have  fallen off in Makueni Constituency. <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Mutwol): Mt.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to reply. 	The replacement and maintenance  of telephone posts is a continuous  exercise.	At  the  moment work is going to replace  the90 posts	which have  already been identified as faulty in MakuniConstituency.	However,  due  to the  bad condition of roads  as aresult  of heavy rains  experienced  in the  area during the past two months,  the work is progressing slowly.  Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  expected that this work will be  finalised by January, 	1991.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  KYONDA: 	Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  while  thanking the Assistant Minister  for that reply,  let me also state that the work is progressing very slowly. I was  in Makueni yesterday but  I noticed that  they are  returning the  same  old posts to the holes.  It appears that these posts were not initially properly treated with the right chemicals  because  they are  being eaten by white  ants.	Is  itpossible to replace these posts with more permanent posts?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MUTWOL:	Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I am happy to hearthat  the  hon.  Member appreciates  the  fact  that white  ants	causea lot destruction in his  area.	There  is very little we  can do  aboutwhite  ants.	The replacement  of these posts with different  ones  atthe moment  is not possible  because the  exercise will be too  expensive.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  ANASWA:	Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  the  AssistantMinister is saying that  it is impossible	for the Ministry to dealwith these white  ants.	Could the  Ministry  seek help  from otherMinistries to eliminate  these white  ants?	Could  the  Ministry useposts which cannot  be  eaten by white ants?	I  ask these  questionsbecause  telephone  services  are very important.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  MUTWOL:	Mr.	Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  the hon.Member knows that we were  given white ants by	Mother	Nature.Our posts are  always treated with chemicals but  still we get into problems. The Only alternative  is to use  steel posts  but  these are very expensive  and as a result the telephone  services will be too  expensive  for the  ordinary mwananchi to afford. But  research is on to  find  out whether we  can get  better and  well treated posts  in the  near future.</Newspeech>  : <Newspeech>MR.	ANASWA:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  what urgent  steps  isthe Ministry taking to make  sure that this white ants menace iscompletely  eradicated?	Surely there  must  be  a way  of	dealingwith these white  ants.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MUTWOL:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  exercise  of eradicatingwhite  ants  cannot be  carried out by our Ministry.	It  should becarried  out  by the	Ministry of-Environment and NaturalResources.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  MALEBE:  Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I think the Assistant Minister is misleading the House.	We  know	that  the  Kenya Postsand Telecommunications  Corporation   has a plant  at  Gilgil which treats the  telephone poles  that  are used by the  Corporation. 	Also the Kenya Power and Lighting Company has facilities  for treating the posts  it uses.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER: Are you really  on a point  of order?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  MALEBE:	The  Assistant minister  should not  evade  thequestion by	 	saying that	white  ants  are destroyingtelephone posts.	This  is  because	. thereare  chemicals to  treat  the  posts  so that they  can endure  the variousclimatic  and  soil conditions  in various parts  of this country.	Heshould not use white ants  as an	excuse.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER:	I think he has heard:</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Firstly,  my Ministry is taking a temporary measure which involves the rationing of water from the  pipeline to  ensure that  at  least  there is  some water in all the areas  of Mombasa. The  second measure which my Ministry is taking,  and which is the answer to the Mombasa Water shortage problem,  is to construct the  proposed 217 kilometres pipeline from Mzima Spring to Mombasa.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

KILIKU:  Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir, whenever I ask a Question in this House regarding water shortage in m Mombasa, the answer I get  is that the Ministry is considering the construction of a second water pipeline from Mzima Springs.  Could he tell the House when this  second water pipeline would be constructed and when he  expects this pipeline to  get to Mombasa?</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR.  MWEU: Mr.  Deputy Speaker, Sir,  I remember answering the  same Question from a different Questioner some few weeks ago. F.5. ---11.21.90. In my answer to this Question, I did say that this second project requires Shs.3 billion and this is not little money and at that time,  I said that the Ministry and the Government were in advance stages  of trying to locate donor and making preliminary preparations in terms of designs and so  on. However, before we can lay our hands  of Shs. 3 billion for the construction of the 217 kilometres pipeline from Mzima Springs to Mombasa,  I cannot  say when this project  is  going to  start or  end.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

In  view of the  water  problem  in  this  country  and  the  answers  we  are  receiving  from  the Assistant  Minister,  I  would,  with  all  due  respect,  say  that  this  problem  is perennial  in Webuye,  too. There  is  a  shortage  of water  supply,  and  the  Ministry keeps  on  saying  that  the  pumping pressure  is  going to  be  increased,  and so on. With all  seriousness,  could we  have  a more precise  answer  from  the  Assistant Minister with  regard to  this  problem? We  have  been raising this  Question  time 	and again because  water  is  life,  but  we  see  that  the  Ministry  is  not  taking  itseriously.	Water  has  to  be  available  in Mombasa  in order  to attract  tourists  tothe  area.	At  the  moment,  there  is  no water  in Webuye,  for  example,  and  theMinistry  has  said  that  it  is  going  to  supply  us  with water  pumps,  but  it  has not yet  done  so.

I wish  to make  a Ministerial Statement on the answergiven to  this  House  on 5th December,	1990,  with regard  to Question NO.	670  byhon.  Wafula Wabuge regarding the Soy-Kitale road.	An  impression seems  to havebeen perceived to the effect that the contractor who was supposed to repair and reseal  this road was paid before carrying out the contracted work. It  is  in this  light  that  I wish to give an additional clarification. Sir,  the Soy-Kitale road was contracted as part of a much bigger project,  covering 	some  160.7 kilometres of road constituting 28 percent of the  total  project,  which comprised roads such as B2 Maili  Tisa-Soy-Kitale with a distance  of 53.9 kilometres;  C37 Kapsabet-Awasi  Road comprising of 59 kilometres;  D286 Kitale Township road comprising 1.9 kilometres and C54	-	EldoretNyaru road  comprising 45.9 kilometres.	The contract was awarded the lowesttenderer  in the  name  of HZ  and Company Ltd.  at a tender  sum of KShs.69,024,610. Work  on carriageways  comprised of repairs  to existing potholes and was planned to  be  carried out over  12  months,  between March, 1988  and March, 1989. This was  to  be  followed by a further  12 months of maintenance by  the  contractor and correction of defects which may have  been noticed during that period. 	Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  work was  inspected and  found  completed on  the ground  as  planned by March, 	1989. 	Defects  noted  at  the  time  were  listed and  the  contractor undertook  to rectify  them during  the  subsequent  12 months  period of maintenance under  the  contract. By March, 	1989,  the  contractor was  owed about KShs.10 million worth of work which had been  done. 	However,  in April, 	1989,  he  started  to  rectify the  defects  by  digging  out  affected areas Maili  tisa-Soy road. Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  by September, 	1989,  outstanding payments had not been made  and,  on 4th  October, 	1989,  he wrote  to the Ministry indicating that he had terminated  the  contract on account of payments for work done being delayed for  over  90  days  as  stipulated  in the  contract. He  pulled out of the site  forthwith and  left  the  section between Maili Tisa and Soy dug up and nearly impassable.	Defective  areas  between Soy and Kitale had not been re-opened upat the  time but were  left un-attended.	The Ministry had to move  in over thesection between Main Tisa and Soy  in November, 	1989,  to reinstate the re-opened potholes  and make  the  section useable. The  contractor was paid the outstanding debts  in December, 	1989, except  the  last five percent of the tender sum which,  in accordance with the contract,  can only be paid after the 12-month maintenance period and after all the defects  over  this period are rectified. 	This  amounts  to KShs.3,451,093.25,   which has  not been paid to date because the contractor has not completed his obligation. Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  by not completing his obligation,  the Ministry  is  of the opinion that the contractor failed to perform as expected of him  under  the  contract. 	As  is  usually the practice,  he had deposited a bond for KShs.8,879,460.00 as guarantee for performance on contract award. 	The matter was,   therefore,  forwarded  to  the Attorney-General  in July, 1990,  for recovery of the  bond and associated damages. A  legal  dispute,  therefore,  exists on this project where  the contractor,  on the one hand,  insists that the contract no longer exists  due  to  past  defaults  in payments  and on the  other hand the Ministry  is of the  opinion  that  the  contractor has been paid all  the debts and that he has failed  to  complete  his maintenance obligation and, therefore, retention money cannot be  paid  and  the  perfomance  bond  should be  recovered. Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  in the  course  of this,  we have  inspected the  road between  Soy  and Kitale  and  found  that  six  sections  of the  road are distressed on the edges,  particularly,  but,  in total,  it covers no more  than five  per  cent  of the  whole  road  surface  area. 	Similar  deterioration has  taken place  on  the Kapsabet-Awasi  road  in  the  section  around  Chemilil  Sugar Factory, which  is  also  an old road usually under heavy  sugar-cane  traffic. 	The  Kitale township  and  Eldoret-Nyarua road are  still  in good condition as  they  are  relatively new. In ending my  statement,  I wish  to  say  that  in  an effort  to  keep the  Soy-Kitale  road  in a good  condition,  our  road maintenance units will  resume repair works from two sections around Moi's Bridge. But patches  have  not been finished properly with bituminous  surfacing and have been left with murram only. Separate  instructions have,  therefore,  been  issues  to  the  respective  district works  officers  for Uasin-Gish  and Trans Nzoia for  appropriate  amendments  to  the standard of repairs.	Meanwhile,  funds  are  being  sought  to  rehabilitate  thisroad  to  the  same standard as is be'	done	by  the Ministry  on  the  Eldoret  Turboroad. Mr. Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I wish to thank the hon. Member who brought this Question,  hon.  Wabuge,  and assure him that we shall take all steps to improve the road. Thank you,  Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  sir.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. WABUGE:   On a point of order, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER:	We  cannot allow debate on that MinisterialStatement.	I  think you can sleep over it.	I  suggest  that you sleep overthat and come back   to the Minister in due course.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER,  OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mk.  Keah): 	I rise on a point of order,  Sir,  to issue a statement on behalf of His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance in response  to the point of order raised by hen.  Kiliku in this House on 20th November, 1990 on the public expenditure  cuts relating to the austering measures and expenditure adjustments that are affecting the budget. The proposed cuts in Government spending   as explained in the Treasury Circular addressed to accounting officers,  were necessitated by the Gulf Crisis with the attendant high oil prices.   Kenya's balance of oil position was. already under severe pressure as a result of falling coffee prices and the extra demands on our foreign exchange.  In order to maintain the supply of necessary fuel, urgent action was required. Among this,  has been the need to make  cuts in Government expenditu Hon.  Members will agree with me that  such a measure was prudent and normal to manage the crisis. Such actions have been taken on similar occasions in the past.   The Government radically curtailed expenditure during the oil crises of 1973 - 1974 and 1979 and also during the 1984 draught. The  actions to forestall massive recessionary and inflationary reactions,  were   quickly necessary since the growth of the economy and the price level   will be affected  I   would   like   to   emphasise   that   the measures   taken   by   the   Treasury   were   not   contrary to any   legal provision.   In  fact,   the Treasury  was merely exercising its role  of management  and  control  of  Government  finances  under  the  Exchequer and  Audit Act,   Cap. 412  and  therefore  has  not  only not broken any law  but   is  required  by  law  to  take  such  responsible   actions.   In addition,  I want  to  remind  the	hon.	Members  that  the  currentmeasures will  last as  long as  the crisis  continues.  It  is our  hopethat  the  crisis  will  not  last  long.Mr.  Deputy Speaker Sir, I would assure the hon. Members	that the proposed reductions in Government  spending will  be  broughtto  this  House  and	hon.	Members  will  have  a  chance  to  debatethem while making  their  contributions  to  the 	1990/91  Supplementary Estimates   Appropriation   Bill.   In   the   meantime theTreasury will  continue  to monitor  the unusual  situation and,   if  the current	trend	improves,	some	of	the	proposed	cuts	may	bereinstated. One  impression  I  would  like  to  correct is  that  the  proposed  cuts  are  aimed  at  the  totality  of  Government funding in  both Recurrent  and Development  expenditures for 1990/91. These  cuts  have  been  selective and  directed mainly  towards  certain specific	areas	of	public	spending   which   can	of	necessity	bepostponed  to  the  next   financial   year,   or  until  the   economy  picks  up,	without	any	adverse	consequences	on	the	economy,	whilemaximising  the  relief  to  the  balance  of  payments. To  be  more   precise,	44 per cent	of   the   cutshave   been   proposed   against   those   vacancies   which   have   not   been filled  for  one  reason   or  another  and  are  not  likely   to  be   filled before   the   end  of   this   financial   year.   Mr.   Speaker,   in   times   of crisis,   the  services  of  existing  personnel  should  be  stretched  to 	 shoulder  the  extra  burden  of  work.  A 	25 per cent reduction  on  the  total transport  operating  expenses  budgeted  for  the  year,-will  similarly contribute  more   savings   to  meet  other  high  priority  expenditures and  assist   in  reducing  the  consumption  of  fuel,   which  is  a  heavy drain  on  our  foreign  exchange.  Finally, the  reduction of 	15 per cent on projects  and programmes  run wholly on GOK  resources  would not  significantly  alter   the  pace  of   development  this   country  has enjoyed  for a  long  time.   The  limited  financial  resources  should  be stretched  to  areas  of  high  priority.   We  are  only  trying  to  cut  our coat  according  to  the  cloth  available  while  making  sure  we  do  not damage  the  private  sector's  initiatives. Mr. Deputy Speaker,   Kenya  cannot  operate  in  isolation  and what   the   Treasury   has   done   is   to   respond.  to   economic   pressures being  felt worldwide and to arrest the deterioration which may set in  if  immediate  corrective  measures  are  not  taken.</Newspeech>  <Header>POINTS OF ORDER</Header> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr.  Mutwol):   On a point of order,  Sir. 	I rise  to correct a certain impression that was created and reported in the Press yesterday attributed to two Bishops both of the CPK Church as usual. Rev.  Njoya and Joseph Gichungi made remarks to the effect that Parliament  should be dissolved because	all the current Members wererigged in.	I would like to tell them off that all the hon.  Members sittedhere were Constitutionally elected and nobody was rigged in as alleged by these Bishops. (applause) I would like these Bishops to go back and read what  our    constitution says about the dissolution of Parliament. It  is not within the powers  of the Kanu Review Committee to dissolve Parliament   but within the prerogative of the President.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

I cannot tell the difference because they all come from the  CPK Church.

I would like them to know that we also feel-bad when they say that Parliament should be dissolved just because  of their own selfish ends.   The  current Parliament will continue for five years as stipulated in the Constitution.

To   me,  it appears as if something fish and this is true has taken place  in respect of that road. 	In order to cover up,  they decided to bring in other roads.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

WABUGE: 	Mr.   Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,   could  the Minister  give  us  a  break  down  of  the  cost  of  the  road  from Kitale  to  Maili  Tisa  which  has  not  even  been  done  although payment  has  been  made? 	How  is  he  going  to  recover  the  money which  has  already  been  paid  to  the  contractor  since  the  road has  not  yet  been  repaired?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.   DEPUTY  SPEAKER:	Very  well,   the  Assistant  Ministerhas  heard  that.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  JALANG'O: On  a  point  of  order,  Mr.   Deputy  Speaker,Sir.	I  rise  on  a  vey  urgent  issue  and  I  would  like  the  Ministerconcerned  to  make  a  Ministerial  Statement  on  the  question  of uncollected  garbage  in  Nairobi  City. Uncollected  garbage  in  Nairobi  has  reached  at  an alarming  stage  and  more  so  in  residential  areas  and  there  is  a likelihood  of  an  outbreak  of  many  diseases  occuring  in  Nairobi today  unless  something  is  done  on  garbage  collection. With  the 'current  rains  in  the  city  the  question  of  uncollected  garbage is  acute  and  we  would  like  to  know what  is  happening  to  the service  charges  which  is  being  collected  in  Nairobi  from employees,  employers  and  other  residents? Why  car this  issue not  be  solved  once  and  for  all? I  therefore,   think  it  is  important  that  we  get  a statement  from  the  Ministry  as  to  what  is  being  done  to  collect the  garbage  so  that  the  "city  in  the  sun"   should  no. longer be  referred  to  as  a  "city  full  of  garbage"?</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR.   DEPUTY  SPEAKER:	Mr.  Wagura,   I  sincerely,   hopeyou  are  not  attempting  to  answer  that.	Can  you  say  somethingand  then  sit  down.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT  MINISTER  FOR  LOCAL  GOVERNMENT 	(Mr.   Wagura): Mr.   Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,  a  statement  on  garbage  collection will be  made  on  Thursday.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.   JALANG'O: 	On  a  point  of  order,  Mr.  Deputy  Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.   DEPUTY  SPEAKER: 	Well,  we  must  get  oh.

WAGURA: 	Mr.   Deputy  Speaker, Sir,   I  have  just said  that  I  will  make  a  statement  on  Thursday  this  week.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>HON.  MEMBERS:	On  a  point  of  order,  Mr.   Deputy  Speaker,Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.   DEPUTY  SPEAKER:	Now,   there  are  three  points  oforder.	I  realize  there  are  three  hon.  Members  who  are  standingon  a  point  of  order.	I  will  allow  only  on  from  the  graciouslady.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS.  NDETEI:	On  a  point  of  order,  Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,Sir.	I  am  also  rising  on  another  urgent  point  of  order  on  amatter  of  urgency  within  the  Nairobi  City  Commission.	The  trendhas  been  that  the  Nairobi  City  Commission  Clinics  scattered  all over  the City 	have not been giving adequate services to the mwananchi.  The  population  of  Nairobi  has  increased  tremendously and  you  will  find  that  most  of  those  City  Council  Clinics  are giving  services  from  about  Nine  o'clock  in  the  morning  until about  Two  o'clock  or  Three  o'clock  in  the  afternoon  and  after that  there  is  no  more  services. When  you  go  there  you  find there  are  hardly  any  drugs  and  so  people  are  left  with  no alternative  except  to  converge  at  Kenyatta  National  Hospital which  is  only  supposed  to  be  referral  hospital. We,   of  course, know  that  the  Nairobi  City  Commission  is  now  collecting  a  lot of  money  in  form  of  service  charge. I  would,   therefore,  urge the  Ministry  of  Health  to  make  a  Ministerial  Statement  in  this House  to  indicate-when  some  of  those  clinics  like  Langata  and Embakasi  and  so  on,  which  were  built  and  without  being  equipped or  staffed  so  that  they  can  start  giving  services  and  also  when they  are  going  to  be  opened? Secondly,   I  would  also  like  to know  when  they  are  going  to  improve  the  services  in  clinics which  are  already  existing  because  the  services  that  they  are rendering  are  extremely  poor. Thank you,  Mr. Deputy  Speaker.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER:	Hon.  Members, we must  get  on;  nextOrder.</Newspeech> <Header>PROCEDURAL MOTION</Header> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr.  Biwott): 	Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to  move:-THAT,  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of Standing Order 17 (1),  this House resolves that  a Sitting of the  House  be  held on Thursday,	13th December,	1990  at	9.00  am.That  Standing Order  states that  the House will normallysit  on Tuesdays,  Wednesdays and Thursdays at	2.30  pm to	6.30  pm.,and on Wednesdays  at	9.00  am.	It  also  provides  that  the House  candirect  that  the House  sits twice  in the same  day.	It  is  ourintention  that we  sit  on Morning and afternoon  of Thursday, 	13th December, 	1990  so  as  to  complete  the  business before  us  and,  hopefully, go  on recess. This  is  a matter  for the  House  to resolve:  it  is within the  power  of, the  hon.  Members  to  decide  that we  sit  twice  on Thursday, 13th December, 1990. With these  few remarks,  I beg to move.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL 	(Mt.  Mull): 	Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir, what has been  said by the hon.  Minister  is  permissible under Standing Order No. 	17. 	It was  envisaged,  and indeed  it  occurs, that  the  Sittings  of this august House may be  increased or decreased depending on the  necessity of the  occasion. It  is  laid down that  the House will meet  on Tuesdays, Wednesdays  and Thursdays  in  the  afternoon  and on Wednesdays  in  the morning,  but  the  prefix to  that  provision gives  the  House the  power to  direct  otherwise.	We  are  approaching the end of the year and a lot of business is pending.	You will  see	from the Order Paper we have  several Bills  and there may be  another Bill and  other Motions coming. 	It  is  thus  important  that  we  have  an additional Sitting. Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I hope t that,  in view of the very urgent business  before  the House,  which must be  concluded before  the  House adjourns,	hon.  Members will agree  with me  thatwe  have  a Sitting on Thursday morning.	I  do  not  think in the  pastit has been common for the House to debate  a Motion like  this one   to provide for a Sitting on a Thursday morning. But, considering the business before us now,  I would have  expected us to 	 sit even on the coming Friday so that we can deal with all the business properly and  go home  for Christmas feeling happy with ourselves for having disposed of all the  business  for the benefit of wananchi. 	However,  since  the  Deputy Leader  of Government Business has  asked for a Sitting on Thursday morning only I will support that  and warn hon.  Members  that we may have  to move  on to  the  coming Friday and  even. With those  few remarks,  I beg to  second the Motion.</Newspeech> (Question proposed) <Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: 	Thank you,  Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir. 	At first when  It read this Motion  I thought it required that we  sit on Thursday at 9.00  am and then adjourned only to realise  later on that we  are being asked  to  sit both in the morning and afternoon. We  will start  celebrating Jamhuri tonight  and will continue  doing so  tomorrow.	This means one will be  tired onThursday and will need  to  sleep up to  mid-day.	It  will be awkward  for us to  celebrate  Jamhuri for a whole day and the  following morning we be here  at 1.00 am. Furthermore, normally   in  the mornings there  are Ministers to reply to Questions  and take notes of debates; this will be overworking ourselves.  .. Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  we must realise that we will never  finish in this world   we will die before	finishing thatbusiness.	If there was  need to finish this business be  foreadjourning,  why was  that business not brought  to  the  House  earlier on: 	It  looks as if we are trying to pay for tomorrow’s holiday. I  oppose this Motion  and  suggest  that we  sit  on Thursday afternoon and if we  cannot finish the business  of the  House we adjourn  Sine  die,  and come back to  complete  it next year. With those  few remarks,  I oppose  the Motion.</Newspeech> 	- <Newspeech>MR.  SOI:   Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I have also gone through today's Order Paper and note that taken note of the number of Bills and Motions we are supposed to discuss this afternoon and then again on Thursday morning and afternoon.   It looks to me that the House is being asked to guarantee that Thursday morning sitting, just like that.   I am of the opinion that there must be more time to discuss these Bills fully and exhaustively. If we say we sit on Thursday morning and just pass this and that haraka haraka, I think that will  be very bad.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND HOUSING (Mr. Mutiso):   On a point of order, Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir.   Can the hon. Member speak a language that the HANSARD Reporters can write?   That "haraka haraka haraka	 " has not meaning.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR.  SOI:   Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir, my proposal  to the House is that we give more time for the discussion of these Bills.   What is wrong with having to come back to deliberate on the Bills next week?   We are here to make laws of this country by fully deliberating on them. With those few remarks,  I oppose the Motion.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  MALEBE:   Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I am also standing to oppose this Motion.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  KILIKU:   On a point of order, Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir.   My point of order is to seek clarification from the Chair because you are calling the next speaker when the previous one has not finished his speech.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER:   Point noted,  hon.  Kiliku.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MALEBE:   Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I also feel we are rushing the House because it is just the other day that the Land Disputes Tribunals Bill was more or less thrown out of this House, as it was not perfect.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL 	(Mr. Muli): 	On a point of order, Mr.  Deputy Speaker, Sir.   This hon. Member, Joseph Malebe, leading the others into a wagonband or misleading the House-   The Bill was not withdrawn.   It was deferred for consideration and we are ready to move it now.   He misdirected the House by saying that drafting was shoddy.   He used those words and the Press went on to use the same language, what I call  "violence language."   There was nothing wrong in the drafting; it was  absolutely clean drafting and we are ready to go on.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MALEBE:   Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,  I think I should be given a little bit more time to explain why I am opposing this Procedural Motion.   The Bills we have before the House are not simple. (applause) We have the Coast Development Bill which we have not exhausted at all. This is a Bill that will mean the Government incurs a lot of expenses.   We now are supposed to pass it just like that without considering the public funds that are .going to be incurred after it is passed. Secondly, the Land Disputes Tribunals Bill, although the Attorney-General is a bit keen on it,   has some sections over which there is a lot of information needed.   We would like to know more about the amendments that have been brought to improve the previous Bill  and such things.   Again, this is a Bill that touches on many wananchi  in the country.   Land laws cannot just be rushed through Parliament.</Newspeech> (applause) <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY 	(Mr.  Biwott):   On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker,  Sir.   I thought I should clarify one thing. 	In fact, there has been a misunderstanding.   The idea is not to pass the Bills that are before the House, but to have more time before we go on Recess.   As hon. Mwamzandi said, we can never finish the work of this world.   So, we want to have more time on Thursday so that we can try to go through as much as we can.   However, we have not suggested that we should pass all these Bills at that particular time.   That point should be clear.   We can deal with one Bill the whole day and not finish it, and then go on Recess.   So, all we are asking for is extra time so that we sit the whole day on Thursday, instead of just sitting in the afternoon.   Let that be understood.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR.  KILIKU:   On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker.   Hon. Biwott was out of order by anticipating we are going on Recess.   We normally go on Recess after passing a Motion here.   It is out of order for him to anticipate that we are going on Recess before such a Motion has been passed by the House.   How can L.3	-	11-12-90he be sure that we will  pass such a Motion?   It is out of order to anticipate.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER:   Mr.  Kiliku, you have been here long enough to know that the Deputy Leader of Government Business is entitled to propose that we bring a Motion for the Adjournment.   However,  I am in agreement with you that the House can duly well  refuse to pass such a Motion. I think we are labouring issues here.   We must go on.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MALEBE:   Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir-</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  KILIKU:   On a point of order, Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir.   I quite agree with you that the Deputy Leader of Government Business can move such a Motion here,  but he cannot anticipate the result of that Motion.   So, it was out of order for him to say that we are going on Recess when we have not passed such a Motion.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER:   Mr.  Kiliku,  surely,  it is not your intention that we sit over Christmas.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY 	(Mr.  Biwott):   On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker,  Sir.	I do enjoy the liveliness of the House today and I hope Memberswill continue that way.	I have not anticipated the outcome of the Motion forthe Adjournment.   All  I have said is that we will never finish the work of this House even if we propose that Motion for the Adjournment on Thursday.   This is because we can still meet the following week or in January.   However,  I would like hon. Members to note that in the history of this House, it has not sat up to Christmas time.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER:   Very well.   It is our hope that we shall  not have to sit over Christmas.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MALEBE:   Mr. Deputy Speaker,  Sir, the Standing Order   we are referring to is quite clear on the fact that the House can resolve to sit on times other than the normal  sitting times.   However,  I think if at all we are not anticipating-</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr.  Chesire):   On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. 	I think we have exhausted debate on this  particular Motion.   Could the mover be called upon to reply?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.   While we are discussing such an. important Motion, the Ministers and Assistant Ministers should give ample opportunities to the Back Benchers to peruse through these particular Motions.   How can the Assistant Minister just rise to call upon the mover to reply?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER:   Order, Mr. Mang'oli.   Hon. Chesire was perfectly in order.   It is only that the Chair does not share that view. I will  have one or two other speakers before I call  upon the mover to reply.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MALEBE:   Despite all the interruptions, Sir,  let me say that sitting on Thursday morning will even disrupt our programmes because all  of us know the importance attached to tomorrow. 	It will  be a very busy day throughout the whole day, night and up to Thursday morning.   From our previous experience, Ministers and Assistant Ministers do not normally come to contribute on Private Members' Motions on Wednesday mornings.   How are we now going to be assured that they will  be here on Thursday morning?   There will  be no quorum as usual. With those remarks,  I oppose the Motion.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  BIDU:   Mr.  Deputy Speaker, Sir,	I differ with my hon.  colleaguesand support the Motion.	I have reasons for supporting the Motion.	Firstly,we must understand that we are honourable Members of Parliament; we are the spokesmen of the nation.   I would like to tell my hon. colleagues that a politician never sleeps; he works throughout the night.   Therefore, because of the exigencies of services of this House,  I do not see why we should oppose this Motion.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR:   On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. 	I do not know.   Are we spokesmen of the nation or spokesmen of the people?</Newspeech> (laughter)   <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER:	Order, hon. Members: Just beforehon. All Bidu responds  to  that point  of  order,  by your ownadmission hon.  Ekidor, you admit  that you are  a little  ignorant  ofthe  subject!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  BIDU:	Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  we  should	forgivesuch hon.  Members  of Parliament;  they do not  know where we  are today:We  are  talking on behalf of	the  people  and the people  constitutethe  nation.	I  support  this	Procedural Motion becauseon 4th December we  did not  come here  because we  attended the  Kama.Delegates  Conference  and that was  a day lost.	Tomorrow we	  willbe  celebrating Jamhuri  and we will have  lost  another Sitting.	Weshould not talk of tiredness because we  are here to  serve	ourpeople.  I therefore urge	hon.  Members to reconsider their  standand realise  that we  came here to work for the nation.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  JALANG’O:	Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I rise  to  opposethis Procedural Motion;  on two	grounds.   The  first  one  is that weare  travelling to  our constituencies for Jamburi Day tomorrow.	Wewill be  returning here  on Thursday,  morning.   This  is  the  only opportunity Members  are going to have to talk to their constituents particularly  on the  outcome  of the recent Kanu Delegates  Conference. There  is no  better	 	opportunity for Membersto talk to their constituents than Jamhuri Day which is tomorrow. Most  of us  are	travelling to  our constituencies tomorrow totalk to  the people.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Mutwol):	Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,	I thought that all hon.Members had been invited to  celebrate Jamhuri Day here tomorrow!We were  not invited to  go  and celebrate Jamhuri Day upcountry!</Newspeech> (Several hon. Members  stood  up  in their places) <Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY  SPEAKER:  Order!  Order! 	Order!   Will you allow hon.  Jalang'o to continue!</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  MANG'OLI: 	On a point  of order,  Mr.  Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Overruled!</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  JALANG’O:	Mt.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  with all due respectto  the	Leader  of Government Business,  I would like  tosay that  there  are  four   Bills  and three  Motions.	Even if we  camehere  on Thursday morning and tried to go  through  these  four Bills and three Motions,  it  is unbelievable that we will finish them. Therefore,  based  on experience,  I am appealing to my colleagues-As hon. Bidu has  said,  Members  of Parliament  can work day andnight.   There  is no harm in going on recess  on Thursday.	We  areready to continue  even up to  Christmas!   We are ready to continue discussing important  matters that relate  to the  Government. There is no  need to rush Bills.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTER POR FINANCE(Prof. Saitoti): On a point  of  order,  Mr. Deputy Speaker,  Sir.	It  should not  beconstrued-  I think this  should be fairly clear.	In asking theHouse to pass this Procedural Motion to enable us to meet the whole day  on Thursday,  morning and  afternoon,	doesnot  in itself preclude  the  fact that we  could even meet next week. We  are not trying to rush the Business of the House. But  since we are  approaching Christmas,  we are trying to utilise all the time that  there  is. So,  I do not  think the hon. Member is in order to imply that what we  are trying to do  is to rush all these Bills. Everything on Thursday will depend  on how hon.  Members deliberate  on these Bills;  they may very well be finished on Thursday.  If they are not finished  on Thursday,  we  still have got the flexibility.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. JALAITG'O: In conclusion, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I appreciate the explanation given by His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance. But I still maintain the first point that I raised; that most of us are travelling to our constituencies tomorrow for Jamhuri Day celebrations. We will not be here on Thursday morning. So, I am opposing this Motion based on the fact that most of us will be in our constituencies tomorrow. I would therefore like to appeal that we meet on Thursday afternoon. Thank you.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika) : On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. We are debating a Procedural Motion which should not take all that time. We have heard the views of hon. Members who have spoken. But it should be remembered that from our own point of view, we have to show that we can make sacrifices. I think enough has been said and the Mover should now be called upon to reply !</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for the Minister to stand and make his contribution on the Motion and then move closure to the debate?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Orderi! I will allow only one more Member to contribute on this Motion. Mr. Ominoi!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMINO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was going to oppose this Motion until I heard my hon. colleagues speak. Since they have stated that they want more time that is why we should sit on Thursday morning. </Newspeech>(Question, that the Mover be now called upon to reply put and agreed to)<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Biwott): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not want to say any more on this particular aspect. But I would like to reiterate the fact that the request for more time. The hon. Member for Rarieda wants to go home and no doubt there will be one or two others who would like to go home. I think the majority of hon. Members will be here to celebrate Jamhuri Day with His Excellency the President. I am sure there will be quorum in the House on Thursday morning. So, that to me is not an argument.Also the hon. Member for Msambweni, Mr. Mwamzandi, talked about over-sleeping; sleeping up to 12.20 p.m. is considered to be a beauty sleep and I do not think that</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAZMANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the Minister is misquoting me. It is not I who is going to sleep up to 12.30 p.m. it is the Ministers who do not come here in the morning! They normally sleep up to 12.30 p.m. and come here in the afternoon! That is why every Wendesday morning we are always asking where the Ministers have gone!</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Biwott): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the hon. Ministers will be here in full force on that day. We should not worry about that.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. DeputySpeaker, Sir. I would urge the Minister, while replying, to clari¬fy the issue which was raised by hon. Kiliku; about the alleged adjournment of the House on Thursday.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Malebe, I hope you will be more serious next time!</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Biwott) : Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member should be more serious; he should not dwell on rumour mongeringi! What is important is the fact that hon. Member ought to be serious with their work. We should utilise every minute available to us to develop this country. The Coast Develop¬ment. Authority Bill has already had 18 speakers. Also 14 Members have spoken on the Land Disputes Amendment Bill. So, that is quite a large number of speakers. I am just indi¬cating how much we have progressed in our work. We are not saying that we will pass every Bill that is before us. I am not saying that it is our intention to pass every Bill on Thursday.</Newspeech>As the Vice-President and Minister for Finance mentioned earlier on, we have every flexibility in this House. It is the House that decides. So, why should we be unduly excited about a Bill like this one? I would sincerely urge hon. Members to support the Motion so that we can have that extra sitting on Thursday, bearing in mind the fact that we are losing the whole of tomorrow, Wednesday, because we are celebrating our Independence Day.With those few remarks, Sir, I beg to move.</Newspeeh>(Question put and agreed to)BILLSecond ReadingThe Coast Development Authority Bill(Minister for Regional Development on 28.11.90)(Resumption of Debate interrupted on 6.12.90)<Newspeeh>MR.

Members on this very important Bill.While contributing to this Bill, most hon. Members put in more "meat" into the 3ill which I accept entirely, but there was one erroneous statement made by hon. Nassir that needs to be corrected.It is not true that the Ministry that I am the head has employed people from one ethnic group. This statement was untrue and hon. Nassir should have been here to hear that. I want to confirm that the Department of Fisheries is in the Ministry of Regional Development, and since its inception in 1965,Coast Pro¬vince has had the largest share of money coming from the Ministry to the fisheries development in this country. In fact, Coast Province can boast of 45 per cent of all the money spent on fisheries development to have been spent at the Coast.While contributing to this debate, many hon. Members suggested that the Coast Development Authority should also be involved in the issue of</Newspeech>/Mr. Deputy Speaker left the Chair//The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Muriithi) took the Chair<Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Sir. While I want to go into details of what hon. Nassir said, what he said was in respect of officers within the Ministry that come from one area. But the Minister here says now that 45 per cent of all the money spent on fisheries goes to Coast Province, but we do not have that kind of money spent there. We used to get some money from the Fishermen Joint Loan Board which is no longer there. Could he elaborate? How do we get that kind of money?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): Sir, I wish, the hon. Member who is my good friend would have given me more time to explain.	But there is no point of argument is All I said is that since 1965 when the Fisheries Department was introduced, the money spent on fisheries development alone is as follows:-Coast Province	- 44.3 per centNyanza Province	- 28.0 per centRift Valley	- 9.3 per centCentral Province	- 5.2 per centWestern Province	- 3.6 per centEastern Province	- 3.6 per centDepartmental Headquarters- 6.0 per cent (Nairobi)So, all I am trying to say, Sir, is that the accusation that the Ministry has neglected its responsibility is contrary to what we have. It is a course where we have spent a lot of money and time trying to develop the Fisheries Department. Those were the remarks made by hon.Nassir, but that is not very important.However, hon. Nassir also said that most of the people employed in the Fisheries Department came from, I think, from Nyanza or Western Province. We have records that show that when we spend 44 per cent of the total money received to date, we could not have had all people from Western Province. In fact, some of the people employed in that Department were brought in by hon. Members. For instance, hon. Madhubuti brought some people to be employed and were taken on.Sir, it is true that most of the land at the Coast does not have title deed, and I have already spoken to the Minister for Lands and Housing. We have agreed that land title deeds should be issued to the people at the Coast.When this Bill is passed, Sir, it will take into consi-deration the tourist development which is the most important aspect at the Coast. Presently, most of the tourists that visit this country, almost 80 per cent of them, go to the Coast. My Ministry will take cognisance of that and do our best to ensure that tourist development is encouraged and the local people are also involved. In the past, the tourist industry has been in the hands of non-Africans and the Africans who were involved could only be counted at fingertips. It is the intention of my Ministry to ensure that when Coast Development Authority is put into motion we shall ensure that the Coast people are involved 100 percent. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there was one other orobt; that was raised by some hon. Members regarding the settlement of the landless people from all over Kenya by the Coast Development Authority. I would like to take this opportunity to inform them that the Coast Development Authority cannot be expects to settle landless people from all over Kenya, and therefore, their concept is quite wrong. The intention of establishing this Authority is not to settle people from other places. I am saying this because we have Landless people at the coast who will be taken care of by this Authority. As you know, we have the Lake Basin Development Authority which is taking care of the landless people from Nyanza, Western Province and part of Trans Nzoia. Therefore, it is only fair that the Coast Development Authority concentrates on the settlement of the landless people at the Coast Province. If we imported people from upcountry and settled them at the coast, we would be doing a lot of injustice to the people of the coast. So, we shall develop this areas for the benefit of the coast people and not for the benefit of others from outside the province.(applause)Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, with regard to the location of the Authority's Headquarters, I think it would only be fair to have the headquarters outside Mombasa Town. My Ministry will look into this issue with a view to selecting a suitable place somewhere at the coast for the convenience of everybody at the coast. I am saying this because I do think it would be wrong to concentrate everything at Mombasa. Therefore, I agree with those hon. Members who said that the Authority's Headquarters should be established outside Mombasa Town.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, one of the biggest problems that we have in this country is with regards to the conservation of environment. Hon. Makau made very good remarksabout the pollution of the sea and rivers that lead into thesea. Conservation of environment is a very important matterand we shall take serious measures to ensure that ensure everythingin this area is done in a such a way as to avoid ruining ourenvironment.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the most important aspect to consider is the required capital, to implement this project and I would like to appeal to hon. Members to support the Ministry fully in its endeavour to look for funds so that this Authority can take off. When hon. Galgallo was making his contribution, he said that we should not neglect the cotton industry which can contribute to quite development of this region. It is true that the best cotton comes from this area and as I promised the hon. Member when I was answering a Question in this House regarding this matter, my Ministry will do the best to ensure that the coast people are not denied their rights and that we shall endeavour to develop the cotton industry since it is the main cash crop in the area.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,Sir, with regard to the sisal industry, it is going to be the second important in this region, and we must ensure that this industry, especially around Voi and other places is rehabilitated;and developed, and the people in those areas must be involved in it. Hon. Kubo said that there is a lot of land lying iddle in the coast and he wondered why this land cannot be used. The whole purpose of setting up this Authority is ensure that areas that are potential agricultural areas are fully exploited so that the Authority can obtain raw materials for opening up industries in this area. We are not just going to produce the cotton and the sisal and just do nothing with it. We want to produce these things and process them in the same place.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, some hon. Members did want it to know about the membership of the board of the Authority. I would like to inform them that the Authority will ensure that every district covered by the Coast Development Authority is represented at the Board. There was also another important point raise, I think, by hon. Galgallo regarding the establishment of ranching schemes at the a coast by this a Authority. I have already said, the land to be covered by this Authority is vast and if we are able to get enough water for irrigation, I know that this Authority would create miracles of development at the coast. In this regard, we would become the major exporter of beef in the world. I am sure we are going to get experts to assist us in developing this industry to the full. I would like to appeal to the hon. Members not only in talking about the project but also in assisting wananchi in the area, to make sure that the project works as planned. One of the main problem that we experience in establish. some authorities is that wananchi just sit and watch waiting for somebody to do things for them. This attitude on part of our people as must stop so that we develop this country with the people and not for the people so that they may realize that these things belong to them. Therefore we shall endeavour to establish both beef and fishing industry and this matter ought to be taken very seriously by the people of the coast.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Bidu talked about small men with small canoes being harassed in Mombasa and he complained that these people are not being given their rightful share of the fish in Mombasa. I would like to assure the hon. Member and the House that the coastal strip goes up to 200 miles into the ocean and that the Authority will be responsible for this 200 miles into the ocean and the coast people will benefit from this.If there are any people who are harassing the small-scale fisher-men at the coast, action will be taken against these people if hon. Bidu would come to my office and confirm this matter.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think one of the major problem that we are facing in this country is the unemployment problem. Today, there are a lot of boys and girls who have completed school but have not employment and this is one of the reason that we want to establish this Authority so that these young boys and girls can find employment. Therefore, if we are going to establish all the projects that are going to be identified by the Coast Development Authority, the Lake Basin Authority the Kerio Valley Development Authority and the rest, we shall be able to create employment opportunities for our people. Therefore, we must be able to initiate development in these areas together with the people in the areas to ensure that our young people from the universities are absorbed in these areas.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, most of the projects that are going to be started under this Authority will be agro-based. Perhaps I should repeat this for the benefit of hon. Members. The best cotton produced in Kenya comes from the Hola area and if this industry is neglected, this would be a very sad story for us. Having said that, I would like at this point to say that the problem of settling squatters is not really under my Ministry but under the Ministry of Lands and Housing.However, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we will not allow people to go and squat in an area in order to get land in advance before this Authority is made operational. There are some people in this country who are fond of rushing to areas that they anticipate will be developed in the near future. Nobody should rush to this particular area because when this Bill is passed, we will move in immediately and ensure that the Authority does not involve itself in the issue of people who have usurped land without authority.There was also another point that hon. Members raised in this regard, and I want to assure them that passing this Bill alone does not mean that the intended Authority will work automatically. I want to tell my sisters and brothers in the Coast that we must be adventurous and that when such development is introduced in an area, the people themselves must come up with their own ideas and become very adventurous. In the fishing industry alone, for example, there sure very few Africans involved in large-scale fishing. It would only be fair if our people became adventurous and helped us to help them. They must help the Ministry in order that we may help them by giving us the right information and being directly involved in such development. They should not wait until other people come to disappoint them before they come to us. Instead, they must start from the very-beginning.In this country, we are out to ensure that each place is developed equitably, and this is why I insist that the people from the Coast should be accorded first preference in all the development that will be initiated by this Authority. During the Committee stage of this Bill, we might perhaps make a few amendments, but I do not want to mention them now because quite a number of them are in-built. However, I will assure the House and the hon. Members from the Coast that, given the support that we need, we are keen to see that the Coast Development Authority is made operational as soon as possible. Without going into too much detail, this Authority must be made to work immediately.With these remarks, I beg to move.</Newspeech>(Question put and agreed to)(The Bill was read a Second Time and committed to a Committee of the whole House tomorrow)(Second Reading)The Land Disputes Tribunals Bill(The Attorney-Ceneral on 21.11.90) (Resumption of Debate interrupted on 22.12.90)<Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to continue making my contribution to the Land Disputes Tribunals Bill. I think that, with the new amendments that have been made by the Attorney—General, the Bill is now straightforward. Previously, the Bill was more or less running parallel to our judicial system. One of the new clauses introduced says:—"6 (1) The Chairman of the Tribunal shall cause the decision of the Tribunal to be filed in the Magistrate's court"This makes the decisions of the tribunals judicial because courts of law will now be able to put up an order for the adjudication of such decisions.Even the meaning of "agricultural land" has now been clarified, and it is clear that the Bill is not going to be applied to areas that are under adjudication or demarcation although it might be applied to areas that have not yet been adjudicated or registered, such as trust land and communal land.The only other issue here relates to the appointment of the chairman of a land disputes tribunal by the district commissioner. I am sure that this chairman will be appointed from the list of elders kept by the Minister and that he will be a person who is not connected with land under dispute. He should be independent and should not come from the area under dispute. Even the elders forming the tribunal should be mixed so that they may deliver a fair judgment. If there are elders for and against a case, you will find that there will be a tug of war between the two parties. If you are my advocate in any case, definitely I will pay you to speak good about me. So, this panel of elders should be mixed in such a way that you have elders who know land issues.I have witnessed a case in my constituency in which there was a lot of favoritism, but elders were called together who had no interest in the land under dispute except to satisfy themselves in respect of the real owner of the land, and they adjudicated the case against the fellow who wanted to acquire the land illegally. If these tribunals are properly administered by elders who are not even known to the disputing parties, fair judgement will be discharged.So, although this Bill comes up before we consolidate all the land laws, which are very many. I am sure that since it is dealing with agricultural land Some of these agricultural lands could also be areas where you even have mining and where the Mining Act comes into force. I am sure that as time goes on the Attorney- General will come up with another Bill to consolidate all the Acts regarding land so that we can read all the land Acts in one. According to the Mining Act, the land two feet below the ground is crown land, that is, it belongs to the Govern¬ment. As such, if you discover minerals in such land, even if it is below some¬body's house, the owner of the house is not going to object because according to the Mining Act that land belongs to the Government and prospecting can be allowed.Otherwise, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Bill is going to solve a lot of problems because previously rich people used to take land away from the poor people just because they could go to the courts and do something so that the courts favoured them. Even when the poor man is not satisfied, the court used to take the case back to the elders who, under the chairmanship of the district officer, would allow it to continue for years and years before it could be determined.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other sissue is that I wish to congratulate the Attorney—General for having come up with the amendments that the district officers and district commissioners are now not the chairmen of these tribunals. This would have been a big burden on them. Of course, sometimes the district officer or the district commissioner would definitely favour one side administratively. It is a very good idea to have the administration completely out of the land disputes tribunals. Although this Bill will not apply in my constituency where we are having land adjudication and land consolidation, it will be very useful in areas where land adjudication and consolidation has not been started and also in areas where land has been registered. I am sure that disputes will also be resolved quicker than before where cases used to remainfor years and years before being determined.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as a by the way, I would like to put a practical example to the Attorney-General whereby if an accident is caused in somebody's land, you find the poor fellow who has been involved in the accident being cheated by the advocate, and even by the insurance firms. They connive with the advocates and cheat the poor fellow so that they cannot pay for the deceased. There are cases which I have come up and which have stayed for a long time sine 1979 when the poor families who do not understand the court procedures continue suffering after being cheated by very cunning advovocates in connivance with insurance firms. Sometimes the cases are even dismissed before being heard by the court. This is a practice which has been going on. I have a few cases of this nature in my constituency, and I think the Attorney—General should come up with some other amendments on the Magistrates Act so that these unscrupulous advocates and insurance companies do not work together to deprive the rights of the deceased just because they come from poor families or are not knowledgeable of the procedures to take so as to have the deceased compensated.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Since already 15 hon. Members have contributed to this Bill, and taking into account the fact that much of the apprehensions that hon. members had expressed earlier on have been taken care' of by the Attorney—General's amendments, would I be in order to move that the Mover be now called upon to reply?</Newspeech>(Question, that the Mover be now called upon to reply, put and agreed to)<Header>QUORUM</Header><Newspeech>DR.

Ring the Divisn Bell.</Newspeech>(The Division Bell was rung)<Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mureithi): Order, hon. Members. We have a quorum now. Mr. Attorney-General, it is your time to reply.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.This Bill has been debated exhaustively and, inspite of the dissatisfaction shown at some stage by some hon. Members who, perhaps, had not read it properly, I accepted the challenge that was posed and, indeed, called upon hon. Members of the House informally to meet with me so that we could go through the Bill and I tried to explain to them what the Bill is all about. I am glad to report that my invitation was very well attended by hon. Members who are lawyers as of right and others. So, we had a very good meeting which, I am sure, my learned friend, hon. ole Kaparo, can confirm. The meeting went a long way to facilitate the passage of this Bill and, to that extent, I would be quite happy to say that the criticisms which were or not founded were ironed out and the Bill is now ready for going through the House.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we went through the Bill Clause by Clause and made quite a lot of suggestions and, at the end, we came out with a list of certain amendments of policy; nothing to do with the drafting. We came out with amendments of policy matters which had not been brought to our attention at the time of drafting the Bill. I am very grateful to those hon. Members who formulated the decisions which went in Looking at these amendments, Sir, you will find that we have enlarged the definition of the land as indicated on page 422 of the Order Paper. I do not have to read it because we have already dealt with itand what is needed is clarification from drafting point of view. The defi-nition is satisfactory and we are able to confirm what I said earlier to the effect that title to land will not be the subject of argument before the tribunal.The matters before the tribunals are clearly laid down under Clause 3 of the Bill which include the division of and determination of boundaries, claim to occupy land and trespass to land. These are the only matters of interest over and above the lands far which the tribunal. will be able to adjudicate. I repeat that the title to land arguments are not for this particular tribunal.We have also corrected a few typing, mistakes here and there and came up with clean amendments. These amendments will be intro¬duced at Committee Stage but it is important that I mention a few points which have brought in new concepts.First of all, the Chairman of Lands Disputes Tribunal will be appointed from gazetted officers by the Minister. As far as Land Disputes Appeal Committee is concerned, the Chairman will be appointed by the Provincial Commissioner. He will not be chairman. This is because we found that it was quite impossible for the Provincial Commissioner to preside over all disputes that may come by way of an appeal. To alleviate that hardship, we came up with a proposal which was also accepted by my informal committee.It has also been argued that there would be only one sitting of the tribunal. The answer here is 'no'. There can be as many sittings of the tribunal as so long as they are within the district. You can haveseveral sittings provided you have enough elders to sit and a chairman appointed from gazetted officers and no one will be able to challenge the Act.The other concept which we had forgotten to include was on who is going to enforce the decisions of the tribunal since they do not have an institution upon which they can enforce their decisions. It would become more or less decisions without a bite. We thought carefully and came to the conclusion that these decisions must be placed before a magistrate of the area for the purpose of entering them as a decree of that court. The court will not hear one party or the other. Once the tribunal has concluded the disputes, its secretariat will pass it on to the magistrate of the area who will endorse the decisions, judgement or decree. From there, the Civil Procedures Act will apply for execution so that the decisions do not remain in the air. That is very important.The other thing is the transitional, provisions which I attempted to bring earlier but it was, perhaps, a bit too earlier because officers passed them on to Parliament before I had seen them, We have now provided for these transitional provisions to. deal with cases pending before the court, cases pending before a magistrate and those that have already been decided upon. Decisions having been made, there would be no room for parties to bring in new disputes since they will be dealt by transitional provisions under the doctrines of this judicature. The matters will have been decided upon and they cannot be taken up by another tribunal. That is very important. It brings to finality what we call litigation. You cannot have endless litigations since it causes confusion, hardships and animosity. It very ideal to end litigations as soon as possible.Therefore, those cases which have decided upon will not be subject to be re-opened under the tribunals and the axs principle ofjudicatures (?) will apply in that case. Other pending cases will be freezed and the parties will institute fresh proceedings before the tribunal. These provisions are very important since they have more or less streamlined those loopholes which were apparent in our original Bill. We will move these amendments at the Committee Stage so that the Bill can be complete.I thank all the hon. Members who contributed to this Bill andall those who suggested means and ways of improving it. We are all inagreement that land is very important since it is the backbone of our economy and existence. This is because anybody without a piece of land is suffering because he cannot get his living unless he is a working person. We cannot take land disputes lightly; they must be adjudicated quickly so that theparties can settle down on their lands and be able to reap necessary benefits.Whoever was suggesting that we are not serious with this Bill erred because it has taken us months and years to prepare. I confirm that there was nothing wrong in its drafting and the violent language used by certain hon. Members and the Press were uncalled for. I beg to move.(Question put and agreed to)(The Bill was read a Second Time and committed to a Committee of the Whole House tomorrow)	BILLSecond Reading<Newspeech>The Non-Governmental Organisations Bill THE MINISTER OF STATE (Mr. TTabwera): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move that The Non-Governmental Organisations Bill be now read a Second Time.In moving this Bill I would like from the start to pay special tributes to all Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) in this country for their contribution in one way or another that they have made to the development of our country since Independence.I Before I define NGOs I would like to say that these organisations are in three categories. The first category are those NGOs that are international in character. These NGOs are formed by various groups, or countries, and operate in this country. This particular group brings in substantial sums of foreign exchange earnings to effect the various activities that they undertake in this country. An example of these would be Action-Aid, World Vision International and so on.The second category consists of the national NGOs.. These are formed by our own people and sometimes appeal for donations from various sources, including the international NGOs. Examples of these are our own freedom from Hunger Council, the Green Belt Movement, the Kenya Non-Governmental Organisation (Kengo), which deals mainly with water, and so on.The third group is the commonest; it is found practically in every part and facet of our lives; these are the small-scale organisations like the women groups.The enactment of this Bill will not affect this third category for it deals exclusively with the national and international NGOs. We have so many of these NGOs that it is very difficult for me to say with any exactitude how many we have in the country they have sprung up and are to be found registered under various Ministries; some are even not registered. There are NGOs that deal with health, shelter, economic projects and so on.This Bill aims at bringing all these NGOs under one Ministry. So far it has been difficult to know where these NGOs can be found. This Bill aims at establishing two very facets. One is that al1 the national and international NGOs in Kenya will now apply to the Government for registration for five years and apply for renewal of registration if they want to continue operating in Kenya. Since the NGOs operate throughtout the country under the rules which will govern their administrative operations, we will require that their applications to the director of the bureau to be establish under this Bill for registration are made with a copy to the district commissioners. Therefore, if an NGO wants to operate in Lanru, Mandera or Sambura, as the case may be, it will have to be interviewed by the district development committee so that it satisfies itself that the particular activities in which it wishes to engage will supplement development in that particular district. In this way the NGO will be known both nationally and locally.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in short I want theHouse to understand that all NGOs in Kenya - except in very special. circumstances will have to be registered. We will have three very important bodies that will govern the existence and operations of NGOs in Kenya. On the Government side there will be a board of NGQs whose chairman will be appointed by his Excellency the Presides, That board will consist of three groups of people: First there will be members of the board who will be appointed by the Minister  in charge of NGOs. Secondly, there will be Permanent Secretaries, including the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury, of the Ministries concerned with the operations of these NGOs. There will be another five members appointed by the Ministers from the NGOs operating in Kenya, because we want NGOs to be also represented on on this particular board.There will be the Director of the Bureau. This Board will deal with policy matters that affect the non-governmental organisations and it is the one that will receive applications and consider them; it will recommend the deregistration of any non-governmental organisation that will be found to wayward. It will usually meet four times in a year, unless it holds a special meeting. There will also be a Secretariat Bureau under the Board which will be headed by the Director who will be the Chief Executive. This is the person who will be respon¬sible for the day to day operations of the non-governmental organisations in the country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the non-governmental organisations, as a group, will also want to make rules and recommendations to the Government to help them regulate themselves and, for that, there will be an AdVisory Council of all voluntary agencies in Kenya whose duties will be to discuss whatever matter they wish to discuss affecting their welfare and, as I have said, to do with their self-regulation and any other issue that they may wish to raise to the Government. It is the intention of the Government that on that Council, the Government will be represented by a few officers to make it easier for the smooth running and co-operation between the non-governmental organisations on one hand and the Government Board on the other.(The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mureithi) left the Chair)(The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Wabuge) took the Chair)Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I said, the main intention of bringing this Bill is to ensure that there is a systematic organisation in Kenya for the non-governmental organisations so that they can continue to make positive contribution to the development of our country. Up to now it has been difficult for the right hand to know what the left hand is doing and, to-date, some non¬governmental organisations have not been registered. However, after the House passes this Bill and it receives Presidential assent, it is the intention of my Ministry to move with speed to ensure that all such organisations are registered so that, come January, the non-governmental organisations in Kenya will have a proper machinery for working in the different districts of our Republic. I want to emphasize that it is the wish of the Kenya Government that as many non-govern¬mental organisations as possible will come to Kenya and participate in the develop¬ment of this nation.On behalf of the Government, I would like to thank the non-governmental organisations, especially the individuals and governments that contribute money to those organisations to enable them to operate in Kenya effectively. It is the hope of the Government that those organisations will continue to do so and that even the volume of funds coming into the country through them will increase. As I speak close to US$ 300 million enter Kenya through the non-governmental organisations and, therefore, it is apparent that they are making a very signi¬ficant contribution to our development.I wish to appeal to hon. Members that when the Bill is passed, they should make sure that their district development committees are very active in clearing applications from the non-governmental organisations that would want to operate in their districts, as fast as possible so that there is no delay in their starting to operate.There is another matter I wish to refer to, before I conclude. There is the question of where the Bureau will be located. I would like to inform the House that the Bureau will be in the Office of the President and it will be under the Provincial Administration for the time being. I think that being under the Provincial Administration the Board will be answerable to the Minister of State in the Office of the President in charge of Administration. This will make it easier for the non-governmental organisations to operate throughout the country. The Bureau will be able, for example, to advise if there are very many similar organisations in a particular district and there is another district that needs the help. The Director of the Bureau will be able to advise on such needy areas so that they can be spread out.In conclusion, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to emphasize that this is a very straight forward Bill that is seeking the approval of the House after which the Government will be able to co-ordinate the activities of all the non-governmental organisations in Kenya. In that way, we will be able to proceed with our development in a very smooth way, without some of the difficulties we have experienced in the past.With those few remarks, I beg to move.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (Mr. Muhoho): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, sir, I rise to second the Bill before the House. In so doing, I would like to congratulate the Minister of State, Office of the President, hon. Nabwera, who has moved this Bill for the manner he has moved the Bill and, also, thinking of bringing it to the House at this time.At the outset, let me join the Minister in congratulating the non-governmental organisations in Kenya for the very good job they have done. The history of Kenya stands out and; indeed, it will always pay tribute to the contribution of the non-governmental organisations in terms of offering services to the wananchi of Kenya, particularly the religious organisations, which have done wonders in the provision of educational, health and other welfare facilities. Some of the organisations started rendering such voluntary services long before we attained our Independence.Indeed, Sir, the work and success of the non-governmental organisations is so great that it has necessitated the introduction of this Bill for discussion by the House. As the mover has told us, we do receive a colossal amount of money through the non-governmental organisations and, indeed, a lot more through the personnel who are working in the rural areas and among our people. So, the contri¬bution has been tremendous.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the contribution has been tremendous precisely due to the success  of the work of the non-Governmental Organizations. That is why this Bill has been brought here. It has been necessitated by the fact that we do need a machinery to enable the Government to co-ordinate the work of non-Governmental Organizations. I say this because there are very many non-Governmental Organizations coming into the country and it is now necessary to establish the number of measures this Bill is seeking.In the first place the Bill seeks to have a machinery through which non-Governmental Organizations will be able to register themselves. There is really nothing very new in this. This is because most of the non-Governmental Organizations will already have been registered with the various Government institutions. But now there is going to be a specific central office where these non-Governmental Organizations can go and register themselves. That is where one will be able to get the inventory and where one will be able to check and know who is doing what in a particular area. That will ease the management of these non-Governmental Organizations. It will also enable those non-Governmental Organizations from overseas who wish to come to Kenya to know who else is in Kenya and in what field he is working.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Bill also seeks to bring about co-ordination of the work of non-Governmental Organizations. It also seeks to ensure that there is co-ordinatior between the work of the non—Governmental Organizations and the work being done by the Government in various areas of the country. The composition of the Board is such that there is a formal machinery which will enable the Government to consult with non-Governmental Organizations. The non-Governmental Organizations will also beable to consult with the Government Ministries that are concerned. I commend the Minister for having made the composition in such a way that the relevant Ministries; the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance; the Provincial Administration . and the Ministry of Planning and National Development. These Ministries usually have the whole idea of what is happening in the country. On the other side the non-Governments Organizations are involved so that you bring in the best from both sides. This will enable the Government to know what the non-Governmental Organizations are doing also the non-Governmental Organizations will have a formal machinery of knowing Government thinking and planning. The other feature that this Bill seeks to bring is the establishment of the Council for the non-Governmental Organisations This is a very important forum for the non-Governmental Organizations themselves; to be able to meet and consult with each other so that they can make the Government know their views. Indeed, I do believe that this is a very, very important feature in this Bill. The other important aspect that I would like to touch on is the link between the non-Governmental Organizations and the District Development Committees. Some of us have had an experience in the past and it has worked very well. We in Kiambu have been working with Plan International and all their programmes to us through the D.D.C.; they report regularly back to us. We have had very, very good relationships with them and I would like to commend both the organization and the D.D.C. This is because unless the people who are in a position to be helped knew what is being planned and unless the leadership of the district is associated with the activities of the non-Governmental Organizations, then you can see that there could be possible conflicts. But the linkage, to my experience, has been able to assist a lot more in the smooth administration and implementation of the programmes.So, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do hope that other non-Governmental Organizations coming into Kenya will see the Bill in that spirit. This is a very good and straightforward Bill. The intentions are very good and I am sure that they are as holy as the intentions of the non-Governmental Organizations. So, I urge this House to pass this Bill. I also urge the non-Governmental Organizations to see things in the spirit that the Government sees _ them.With those few remarks, I beg to second the Bill.</Newspeech>(Question proposed)<Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER(Mr. Wabuge) : What is your point of order?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, since this is a very straightforward Bill, would I be in order to move that the Mover be now called upon to reply?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): It is a bit too early to do that Mr. Makau please!</Newspeech><Newspeecch>MR. MAKAU: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I am surprised that when we are discussing a Bill that is so important to this country there is someone who feels that we should not air our views on the Bill.First of all I would like to congratulate the Minister for moving this Bill. During the recent Kanu Delegates Conference held at Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani, His Excellency the President told the 3,600 Kanu delegates assembled there that this Bill be soon Tabled in Parliament. That in itself shows the importance of this Bill. His Excellency the President was so concerned about this whole issue that he told the Kanu dele¬gates who had attended that special conference that there is a Bill that is going to govern and regulate the operations of non-Governmental Organizations. I say this because as the Minister of State, Office of the President, has said, an amount of US$300 million comes into this country annually through the non- Governmental Organizations. Non-Governmental Organizations are very, very important. Their services are very important to us particularly at this difficult time when it is so difficult to obtain money from outside the country to come and fund projects i this country. Therefore, this Bill is very welcome. I say so because the operations of non-Governmental Organizations have been run	haphazardly for many years. Nobody had any idea as to how the operations of these non-Governmental Organizations were to be regulated.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that at this time when most people are envious of the socio-econo development of this country, a lot of non-Govemmental Organic at can be used to destabilise the Government. Also some people could form some non-Governmental Organizations just as a way of channeling funds into this country in order to estabilise the country. That is why I said that this.Bill is seeking the formation of a committee that will be scrutinising the applications of non-Governmental Organisations. This will enable the Government to know whether the particular non-Governmental Organization applying to be registered will be operating for the benefit of Kenyans or not.Having said that, let me also mention that we have a lot of projects that have been initiated by non-Governmental Organizations. We should commend the non-Governmental Organizations that have done a lot for this country. We have for instance the African Medical Research Foundation which has done a lot for this country. When you visit Kibwezi you will find that they have constructed a hospital there. There are also other non-Governmental Organisations that have done a lot as far as the provision of water is concerned, We have others which are engaged in matters relating to energy and sources of energy. So, while discussing this Bill, we should also bear in mind that non-Governmental Organizations, apart from a few that might have operated against the wishes of the people of this country, have done a very important job. The majorityof the non-Governmental Organizations have done a wonderful job for this country.Sir, one other point that we should hear in mind isthat Non-Governmental Organisations (NGO's) are formed to lookfor resources from outside so that those resources could be usedfor economic development of this country. This Bill is very important because it is going to regulate and monitor the activities of the NGO's. The problem that was faced due to the NGO's operating without control is that they solicit for funds, start projects, but because those projects are not syncronised with the D.D.C.'s projects, when the funds are not available, those projects are left hanging as white elephants. So, by syncronising and co¬ordinating the activities of the NGO's with the D.D.C.'s the Ministry can continue with them. It is embarrassing, say, for a water project to be abandoned as a white elephant simply because the funds are not there.Sir, another area that is of concern is the method of soliciting for funds by the NGO's. Many at tines some of these NGO's will go astray and take some photographs ox people who are supposed to be suffering, and in such marketing of their projects, they end up by discrediting this country. We know that there are those people who would like to take photographs of suffering Kenyans and then go and solicit for funds. In fact, there are some religious organisations that will portray a very bad image of Kenya. We have heard of these stories and also of films shot in the country and then shown in the Western world, showing the suffering of the people. The method used by some of these NGO's to solicit for funds from overseas should be under control so that they do not use methods that look like blackmailing Kenyans. I am very concerned about this aspect of the NGO's. The image that is left in overseas of Kenyans suffering, that integrity of a Kenyan is spoiled by whatever is shown by those people.In fact, some of them go as far as making films showing how people are suffering, but some of these actions are just stage managed and can discredit the image of Kenya. So, I would like to request the Ministry concerned to make sure that the method of soliciting for funds should be approved so that we do not have people presenting the negative aspect of Kenya. 	Another area that needs to be looked into is the use of funds that have been solicited by those people. It is very import ant to monitor to know how much has been given by those people or donors. I say so because the Minister said when moving the Bill that about 300 million dollars enter this country, but you will find that the amount of work done does not match the amount of money mentioned. For instance, there was a case in the newspapers in London whereby the World Vision was said to be having a project in Nakuru, but the people who had donated the money found it difficult to tally the amount of money spent in the project and the amount of money reportedly spent by the World Vision. So, this question should be looked Into.Sir, while administering and controlling the NGO's, the committee that will be set up should be careful because the NGO's ' are very sensitive. We should not scare them off by shewing that we want to examine everything in details about them. The NG0's that are already operating here, their registration should be done very fast so as to avoid a time-lag.There was a case that came up in Machakos recently, but I would like to warn the Machakos D.D.O. not to be taken for a ride by the proposals of NGO's. There was a case that was brought up to the Machakos D.D.C. by Co-operation of American Belief Everywhere (CARE), Kenya. They said they were concerned about unemployment in the country and they wanted the Machakos D.D.C to endore that so that they could go and look for money.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, some of these projects should be presented to the District Development Committee so that members of the D.D. C. can scrutinise whatever they are doing in these projects. This would ensure that the District Development Committees are not used as rubber stamps when it comes to deciding which projects should be implemented first when funds are made available. So, I urge the Ministry concerned to ensure that they do not scare off these non-Governmental organizations. With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION (Mr. Munyi): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute on this very important Bill. First of all, I would like to that the Minister of state in the Office of the President, Mr. Nabwera for introducing this Bill at the right time. I am saying this because during the Kanu Delegates Conference, the entire delegates were very happy to hear that this Bill would be Table in Parliament. The delegates felt sure that this Bill would be passed by this House and I have no doubt myself that we are going to pass it. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, all we would like to tell to the world and the no-governmental organizations is that we appreciate the good work that they are doing to assist us in the development of our country. We appreciate whatever efforts that these no-governmental organizations are doing or intend to do for the benefit of our country. However, the only thing that we cannot support is their subversion activities. Therefore, the most important thing is the monitoring of the activities of these organisations through the Office of the President and we have not doubt that the provincial administration will continue to monitor their activities. We all remember a time when people used to come in this country as researchers and nobody asked them when they were doing. These people just came in and were not registered, but we are glad to note that all people coming into this country to do any research work, are going to be registered. Today, if a foreigner wants to do some research work in the rural area, he will first have to register himself through the Office of the President. There was a time when this country was full of foreigners who maintained that they were here to do research work. However, if you asked one of them what kind of research he was doing, he did not seem to know what he is talking about. We are now pleased to know that any foreigner coming here for any research work will have to first register himself. More important still is the fact that even after registering to himself, he is going to be monitored so that the Government know what he is doing. This means when these foreigners are out in the district or in the province, Government would be aware that they are there and would, be knowing what they are doing there. I am saying this because at the division level, there will be an officer of the Government to monitor their acez activities and in the location, there will be the chief to also monitor them, and the assistant chief in the sublocation. In this way, the assistant chief	would be able to report the activities of these people at the location level.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, today, if a stranger entersa sublocation illegally, the assistant chief may want to know who this strange ,person is. If you went to a country like the United Kingdom and want to settle in a certain town, you will find some people doing intelligence work in that particular town. This is happening in Japan, In America and so on and these intelligent officers must know what is going on in their area of operation. Today, everybody in Kenya is identified through his identity card. However, during the colonial period, an African was not regarded as a human being and therefore, he was not registered. Africans used to be given cards to enable that government to collect tax from them. However, under the Registration of Persons Act, every Kenyan is registered. Similarly, when somebody dies, there is proper record which indicates this. Today, if you went to the office of the President, you would find records cases where, some of those old people who did not have identity cards have been trying to make their own birth certificates when they notice that their retirement age is nearing.However today because you are registered at birth, you cannot do anything to alter your birth date. We are not more civilized and we thank the Office of the President took the necessary action to ensure that when these non-governmental organizations come to Kenya, whether through a religious organization or otherwise, they must be registered. Today, if you went to the Office of the President, you would know what non-governmental organization is operating in Lodwar, in Embu, in Machakos, in Baringo, in South Ilyanza, in Siaya in Meru, in Makueni and so on. These non-governmental organizations are properly recorded and we very much appreciate this move. In this way, even our enemies and friends will appreciate that we as Kenyans know what is going on in our country as far as the security of their country is concerned. Today, we have locational security committees in the locations and even in the sub-locations there are security committees. All these committees are dealing with, security. In addition to this, we have Kanu youth wingers whose responsibility is to report any supicious characters right from the sublocational level. If they see anybody strange, they are expected to go to the assistant chief and tell him, "we have seen some very strange character in such-and-such a place". Can you check on him". This means that no supicious character can hide himself in any place and not be known by the Government. I am sure that these Kanu Youth wingers are doing a very important job of maintaining the security in this country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we would like all non—governmental organisations to increase their operations in Kenya. At the moment, they are using U.S. $300 million, but we would like them to double this amount because they are welcome in this country. We have peace and stability in our country, and we want the British Broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C.) to know this. This is why many non—governmental organisations are coming to Kenya. They are not going to other countries around us at the same rate as they are coming here. If the B.B.C. does not know this, our Kenya News Agency should tell it that we have stability here and that we love our country, our President and Kanu. This is why we unanimously passed a resolution to carry out good reforms, which move has been welcomed all over the world. We will continue to have one Party, one leader, one Government and one Parliament.With these few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY (Mr. Kiplagat): Thank you very much, Mr. temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to contribute to this very important Bill. First of all, I would like to thank the Minister concerned for his timely action in moving this Bill. I was very pleased by the comments made by the Minister in moving the Bill and the remarks made by the Seconder, hon. Muhoho, because they emphasised that this Bill is being moved because the efforts and the work of non—governmental organisations in this country are highly appreciated. I appeal to non-governmental organisations themselves to take the Bill and the subsequent Act in good faith. This law is not meant to censor these organisations or to control them in the negative sense, but to co-ordinate their actions. I think this is only natural because, as the organisations become larger, they become more complex, in which case, there is need for co-ordination. So, I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to these organisations to note that it is more for their own good than anything else that we are debating this Bill.The Bill will assist these organisations to account for the funds they obtain from donors. As it becomes more difficult to get funds, it is very important that those who give the little they can afford to give be assured that their money is going to well—intended beneficiaries. It will, therefore, be very important for these organisations to co-operate in this respect in order to be able to explain how the various resources put before them are utilised.I think that we need to caution non-governmental organisations to ensure that they are not infiltrated by people who are biased, negatively-inclined or, to put it bluntly, dissidents. It has been known that in some countries, non-governmental organisations have been used to subvert the government of the day, which has been legally constituted. So, it is for their won good that our non-governmental organisations ensure that they do not have elements who do not support the Government because, after all, development is a partnership between non-governmental organisations, the Government and local leaders. This is why it is very important for such organisations to liaise very closely with district development committees and sub-district development committees in divisions and locations in order to ensure that their projects are discussed fully.The local intricacies and the local conditions should be taken into account in formulating their policies so that when it comes to implementation then they do have something that is applicable, reliable and implementable.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in this time of posterity when everybody is saving money, it does not give a good picture to find non-governmental organizations living a life that is extremely luxurious such as having new cars and staying in big hotels when the beneficiaries for which this money has been sought are suffering in the rural areas of this Republic. It will therefore be very important and useful for them to be seen to be sharing our problems and our difficulties, especially at this very difficult time. I think that it would ensure that they get more funds. If the donors get to know that non-governmental organizations spend their money mainly for themselves, then their cause will not be served in the long run. It is very important, therefore, that non-governmental organizations are seen to go by the objectives for which they obtain the funds in the first place. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are grateful to many non-governmental organizations. In particular, I would like to mention the Christian aid because they have helped to finance a hospital at a place called Kisanana in my constituency. I thank them because they have completed the hospital. But one thing they should do from now on is to involve local leaders so that they can be given the best advice in the circumstances. Where they just go out of the blue and decide that they want a project in a certain area may not be in the best interest of that community; perhaps it is too far from the majority or the people, perhaps there is lack of water and so on. So, it is very import¬ant that close collabroation between the non-governmental organizations, the local leaders and the Government is enforced. I think this will help us very much in future if we can ensure that everything through the district development committee has had all critical aspects examined exhaustively  us now. When we have this council, the bureau and the board, Kenyans will be manning them and they are there to facilitate the working of the non-governmental organizations. I would urge the Minister, when it cooes to this, to ensure that we have patriotic Kenyans. Not only that, we should have people whose integrity is beyond reproach because it is very easy for the non—governmental organisations to say, "Look before we had this Act we used to function much more efficiently; now we have these bureaucratic hurdles delaying us and we cannot implement our projects in time, it would be better for us to go back to the days before the Act".. That will be very sad. So, I would urge that the selection of the people to run these organisations be done very carefully because, in the end, it will reflect to the foreigners how Kenya is.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,I beg to support the Bill.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS,HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Mutiso): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Although I see that I have very little time, let me see how much I can grab on it.First of all, I would like to support this Bill very strongly and also thank the Minister who has moved it for I think it is very much overdue because we have had non—governmental organisations operating in this country for quite a lot time without there being any check on them.As such, Sir, very little is known regarding their activities. I think it is very important for us not to allow foreigners to. move freely and engage themselves in various activities under the umbrella of NGOs and nobody s scrutinised exactly what they are doing especially at night. This is because you may see them moving around during the day with cameras and we may not know what they do in their own homes. It was discovered some time back that some of these foreigners had radio communication systems and other things in their possession. They were using these items to relay information to their countries. This amounted to engaging in subversive activities or espionage of some sort.When we welcome these people into our country, it is important that we check and control their movements. There are some places in his country where they must not be allowed to set their feet for security reasons This is because nobody can read their hearts, inspects their documents and no one nay know exactly what they are reporting. We know for certain that some of these foreigners can engage themselves in subversive activities and maybe they sire the source of the problems we are having in the country, say, the criticisms that are directed to our Government by our own nationals. This may be due to incitement that they get from these NGOs.We would like them to come here and help the people of Kenya. If they are so sympathetic that they would like to help Kenya in development matters, it is my view that their movements must be checked by the Government. We could not have done so in the past because we had no law which could enable us to check their movements adequately. That is why I congratulate the Minister for seeing it fit to bring this Bill at this time. It is very much overdue any country worth its salt cannot allow foreigners to move freely and do whatever they want. It is not a swimming pool.</Newspeech><Header>ADJOURNMENT</Header><Newpseeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Hon. Mutiso, you will continue with your contribution next time.Hon.

Questioner had not informed me, being the Member for the area that he was going to raise this Question in the House. I had sometime back raised a similar Question and I was overruled. However, Mr. Speaker Sir, going by practice and previous rulings, I do know that it is always a matter of courtesy that if an hon. Member wants to ask a Question relating to another constituency that Member should have the courtesy of informing the hon. Member for that constituency so that there is no conflict in this House. I do not want to object to anybody raising Questions on any area but, there has to be some courtesy. We have constituencies that everybody represents and as a matter of courtesy, the hon. Member for the area ought to know when a Question is being asked in the House in advance. I am seeking your further guidance because we have rulings that have been made in the past and it should be of benefit is hon.

SPEAKER: Well, I am placed in a very difficult situation. I do know in the past we have requested hon. Members to consult each other before they raise any Questions that touch on other Members constituencies. On the other hand, it is not also mandatory. There is practicaly nothing the Chair can do if a Member of Parliament chooses to insist to ask Questions that touches on other hon. Members constituencies. It really shows that you are a hon. Member is you extend that kind of hand of friendship to the other hon. Member.As far as this Question is concerned, I do agree with what hon. Ekidor has said that it touches on the issue of Kenyanization. To me, it appears safe, the policy itself has not boundary and you can ask any Questions on it.</Newspeech><Newpseech>MR.

Because of that, the second part of the Question does not arise.</Newpseech><Newpseech>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we are talking now, GK 255W, which is normally for the District Officer Kanduyi Division, is parked on top of stones outside his office. That has been the case for the last one year. Which transport is the Assistant Minister talking about as having always been attached to that office? My Question sought the information on the transport the Kanduyi District Officer is currently using, but GK 255W is hoisted on stones outside the District Officer's office.</Newpseech>	<Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Kanduyi District Officer is under our office and if his vehicle got spoilt and may not be moving right now, that officer is never left without a vehicle. In fact, when that happened, he was given alternative means of transport. I have never heard of any problems. In fact, we are surprised that such a Question is coming up in Parliament because we have confirmation from the officer himself that he has no transport problems.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have been told by hon. Makhanu that GK 255W is resting on stones, which means it is immobile. The Assistant Minister says that there are alternative means. Could he tell this House the number of mobile vehicles that office has?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, the Land-Rover that has been mentioned is not the vehicle attached to our officer there. The correct vehicle is GK 231S. Secondly, I am not going to quote the registration numbers of all the vehicles at the Kanduyi District Officer's office which are available to him at any time he makes a request.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am raising this matter because twice the Kanduyi District Officer has had to travel with me in my Peugeot vehicle to attend barazas and public meetings. This is not a very healthy situation because I am not supposed to be providing transport for the officer. Can the Assistant Minister tell us when the GK 255W is going to be repaired because, as I am talk¬ing now, the same is resting on stones outside the District Officer's office at Kanduyi ?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am saying that vehicle GK231S had a problem and unless it is repaired, the officer is fully catered for. We do not have to give another vehicle until this one is repaired. However, he is all the time having alternative transport.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We have some confusion here between the hon. Member and the Assistant Minister. Hon. Makhanu is talking about GK255W while the Assistant Minister is talking about GK231S. Which is the correct vehicle attached to the Kanduyi District Officer?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already attached which vehicle is attached to our officer at Kanduyi, and I know better.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, either way, the Kanduyi District Officer is in trouble, as he has no trouble</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister has not responded to my supplementary question. He knows better, all right, being in the Office of the President; there is no dispute about that. However, since he knows better, which belongs to the Kanduyi District Officer? Is it the GK255W or the GK231S? Let him be specific.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was very clear on that.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may use a polite language, that is a very smart way of avoiding to answer questions. Could the Assistant Minister be made to respond to my supplementary question?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said that the Land-Rover which has been attached to our Kanduyi District Officer is GK231S.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I was interrupted, I had said that either way, the District Officer has no transport. As hon. Makhanu claimed, GK255W is resting on top of stones but the Assistant Minister claims that GK231S is out of order. That means that the District Officer has no transport. We are being made to understand that there are very many other vehicles there which the officer can just pick. We know that that may not be true, as we are talking about other Ministries vehicles and, when such vehicles are busy and the District Officer wants to travel, as the hon. Member has said, he ends up having no transport and has to seek assistance from the hon. Member. Can the Assistant Minister now tell us when the officer is going to be provided with transport?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the officer has had means of transport all the time. His Land-Rover</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. What the Assistant Minister is saying is not true at all. The hon. Member who brought the Question told us that he has had to ferry the District Officer to barazas twice, so that claim is not true at all, on having transport all the time.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, sir, I was responding to his supplementary question. I had not finished replying. The Land-Rover we are talking about got into disrepair only a month ago and that is a very short time back. Arrangements are being made to have that Land-Rover brought back to the road. Until we do that, the officer is from time to time being provided with alternative means of transport.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like the Assistant Minister to believe what I am saying here. There is a growing discontent among some heads of departments in Bungoma because the District Officer's office has the habit of grabbing vehicles from other Ministries to enable the officers to move, thereby disrupting the normal work of those other Ministries. The one the Assistant Minister is claiming to be serving the District Officer may be from the Ministry of Agriculture. I have instances which I can quote here any time. Let him, therefore, answer correctly on when this vehicle is going to be repaired.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member is making a very serious allegations that the Bungoma District Commissioner normally grabs vehicles from other Ministries in order to give to the district officers. Can the hon. Member tell us which Government vehicle, and cite its registra¬tion, was grabbed and given to some officers? Can he substantiate that serious allegation?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MIS0I: Mr. Speaker, Sir, whereas I do sympathise with the hon. Member for Kanduyi, the word "grabing" that he has used, according to me, is not appropriate. What I want to say is that the District Commissioner was simply trying to utilise the means of transport available for priority areas. Whereas I do not want to condone that habit</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: What is your point of order?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am just making a clarifi¬cation. I was saying that in order to utilise what is available for priority services</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: That is a point of information.

MATE asked the Vice-President and Minister . for Finance by what percentage has the prices of essential commodities such as milk, flour, bread, cooking fat, soap been increased since the last Financial Statement in June, 1990.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Kariuki) : Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The prices for milk products have not been increased since January, 1990, and therefore no percentage increases have occurred during this Financial Year. Consumer prices for various brands of wheat flour have gone up by 20.71 per cent during the current Financial Year, beginning in June, 1990, and therefore the price of the popular 500 grammes loaf of bread has gone up by an average of 30.33 per cent Mr. Speaker, Sir, the prices for fat and edible oils have not been increased during the current Financial Year. Soaps and detergents are commodities whose prices are no longer controlled. Therefore there has been no price restriction on these commodities. These were decontrolled by Legal Notice No.192 of 1988.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I	thank theAssistant Minister for that reply. I hope that the Assistant Minister has noticed that I did not want to put down the essential commodities in the Question. I was also looking at essential commodities like sugar and the others. Since the Assistant Minister has accepted that there have been substantial" increases in the prices of some of these commodities, does he not agree with me that the price increases have really eroded the purchasing power of all the workers in Kenya for the period under review?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARITJKI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is obvious. Any increase in commodity prices will hurt somebody's pocket. There is no denying that. But we would rather be in a situation where" bread is a little expensive but available.Mr. Speaker, Sir, bread comes from wheat flour;wheat flour comes from wheat and wheat is grown by farmers whose production costs have gone up. Therefore if we are going to satisfy the farmer and if we are going to make sure that the farmer continues producing wheat we have got to give him a good price. If we give the farmer a good price then we have also to increase the price of wheat; if we increase the price of wheat we shall have to increase the price of wheat flour; if we increase the price of wheat flour we have to increase the price of bread. So, I do agree with the hon.	Member that the hon. Member that the price increases have hurt the pockets of the consumers but This is inevitable. I would also like to tell hon. Members that we have been able to avoid by so doing shortages and queues that are becoming very common, not just in Kenya or in Africa or in the Third World but all over the world. I would like to tell the hon. Member that the only solution to this problem is to increase our productivity. There is no other solution. Thank you.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we indeed do appreciate the answer given by the Assistant Minister. But in view of the fact that oil prices have forced the prices of fuel to go up, which has affected food production, what is the Ministry doing to ensure that the farmers who feed this nation are given adequate incentives so that from the incomes they get they will be able to prepare their land for planting next year? This is a critical matter. If we do not do it now, then we will face serious food shortages next year. So, would the Assistant Minister tell this House when the Ministry is going to increase producer prices so that farmers get more motivated to produce food?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARIUKI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the answer to that question is that the steps we are taking. We have taken steps and that is the reason why this Question has been asked. If we had not taken those steps, then this Question would not have been asked here. Hon. Mate's complaint is. that the price of bread has gone up. However, as I have already explained, the price of bread has gone up because the price of wheat flour has gone up. The wheat flour price has gone up because we are paying more to the wheat growers. That is the incentive we are giving to the farmer. That is one of the incetives we are giving to the farmers; making 3ure that the farmers get the right prices for their products. I must warn here that we have not even increased the prices of these commodities as a result of the Gulf Crisis. Therefore I must warn all the hon. Members and all Kenyans that we indeed have to tighten our belts because the times are going to be very difficult.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASIKE-NDOMBI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, before the price of wheat flour went up there was no wheat flour available in the shops. You will also find that Kimbo is beginning to disappear from the shops. What steps is the Ministry taking to make sure that there is no hoarding of essential commodities before the prices are increased?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARIUKI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am afraid I am unable to hear what the hon. Member is asking because there.is too much noise in the House.</Newspeech>	<Newpseech>MR. WASIKE-NDOMBI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was asking the Assistant Minister to explain the House why there, was a complete shortage of wheat flour just before the price went up? Also, at the moment, Kimbo is beginning to disappear from the shops. What steps is the Assistant Minister taking to make sure that there is no hoarding before the price of any commodity goes up?</Newpseech><Newpseech>MR. KARIUKI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the price of wheat was increased there was a timelag between the increase of the price of wheat and the increase of the price of the wheat flour. Consequently, the millers did find it a little difficult to buy wheat at an enhanced price and sell wheatflour at the old price. This could be one of the reasons why there was a shortage of wheatflour for some time. However, I did not discount the factthat some unscrupulous millers could have kept supplies from theconsumers in order to wait for the price increases. I would liketo assure the House that the Government is aware of this state of affair and whenever we have any proof that any miller, or supplier is holding commodities just to wait for a price increase, action will be taken. Indeed, in many instances, action has been taken.</Newpseech><Newpseech>MR. MATE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the original Question, the Assistant Minister agrees that we are talking about essential commodities in general. Can he agree to stop any further increases until the workers salaries have been increased because we know that the workers salaries were increased or reviewed about five years ago?</Newpseech><Newpseech>MR. KARIUKI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, no one with sane mind would give such an undertaking. Under the present economic circumstances that the world finds itself in today, it- would be sheer madness to give such an undertaking. We do not know what is going to happen to the Gulf area tomorrow. While the price of oil at the moment is about 35 dollars per barrel, tomorrow it might go up to 70 dollars per barrel. So, if I stand up here now and promise, lie and cheat that there is not going to be any price increase, I will be doing this country and the House a lot of injustice.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. we are talking of the same Government which has a collective res-ponsibility of taking care of the workers and people in general. Can the Government make sure that before it effects any changes in prices of essential commodities which may be necessitated by economic circumstances people are not punished unduly by the increase in prices of these essential commodities?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARIUKI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, all I can say is that the Government is very conscious of the difficulties that theconsumers are undergoing as a result of these price increases, before,But like I said Sir, we would rather have bread that costs a little more than having no bread at all There is no use of having cheap bread which is not available at all in the market. It is better to have a slightly expensive bread which is readily available in the market. These are the steps that we are taking at the moment. However, I would like to assure the hon. Member that the Government will do all that is within its power to see that whenever there is an increase in price of essential commodities it is only an increase that is justifiable and unavoidable. But the crucial issue here is that we do not want to get ourselves into a situation where we promise cheap commodities which are not available. We are not that kind of Government.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WABUGE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the Assistant Minister aware that in order to have this commodity all the time at reason¬able prices, the productivity must be stepped up in the country? What incentives is the Ministry giving to farmers in order to step up production of this commodity throughout the country so that it can he available at reasonable prices?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARIUKI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think I answered that question before. I said that one of the incentives that we are giving to farmers is, in fact, what has led to this Question being asked here. That incentive is the fact that we are constantly reviewing the prices of this commodity, and the hon. Questioner is quite aware of the recent increases of the producer prices for various crops, say, wheat, maize, sugarcane etcetera. This is a major incentive to farmers. This is the reason why I said that so long as we continue giving incentives and better prices to farmers, there is no way we can. promise that there will not be a price increase of these commodities.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WABUGE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, what is the Assistant Minister going to do during this season in order to encourage farmers to produce enough wheat because they are going to pay more for fuel, fertilizers, chemicals and so on?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.KARIUKI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in August this year. So, when we talk of the Gulf crisis, we are just talking of that period between August and December, this year; that is only three short months. After the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, there was an increase In oil prices. I agree and since then, the Government has not been asleep. It has been working day and night.Mr. Speaker, Sir, price increase is not something that can be worked out within a day or a week and a lot of parameters have to be considered. I would like to assure the hon. Members that the Government, is considering this matter and whenever a solution to the problem is found, this will certainly be announced.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KY0HDA:Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the Asssitant Minister aware that after the increase in price of things like sugar, wheat flour and the rest, there are unscrupulous traders who keep on over-charging wananchi? What action is the Ministry taking to make sure that wananchi do not continue to be exploited by these unscrupulous traders?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARIUKI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, for any com_modity whose price is controlled and gazetted, it has a legal price and any trader who thus tells any commodity which is price controlled at a price above the controlled price, is contravening the law and if found that person should be dealt with in accordance with the law.Therefore any shopkeeper who decides to over charge wananchi is contravening the law and will suffer the consequences if found out.If anybody has information regarding any trader who over-charges wananchi, be he a shopkeeper, a supplier or a trader, he should report this matter to the authority and action will certainly be taken.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATE: Mr. Speaker,Sir, since the Assistant Minister has agreed that the Ministry of Finance has punished workers very many times in the past, could he consult his colleague in the Ministry of Labour so that they can increase the salaries of workers which were increased five years ago?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. KARIUKI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did not say that and I would like the hon. Member to withdraw that remark before we continue. I did not stand here and say that the Ministry is Finance is punishing the workers in this country and therefore. I would like the hon. Member to withdraw that remark before I response to his question </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. MATE: Mr. Speaker,-Sir, I beg to withdraw that remark, but I said that workers in this country have been punished for a a long time because they have to dig deep into their pockets to be even able to afford a decent meal. I am still appealing to the Ministry of Finance to consult with the Ministry of Labour with a view to increasing the salaries of workers because they have suffered enough.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARIUKI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am quite sure that the Ministry of Labour is aware of what is happening and the problems that the workers in this country are undergoing. I have no doubt in my mind that the Ministry of Labour is taking the necessary steps towards this direction. Therefore, I do not think it is necessary for the Ministry of Finance to advise the Ministry of labour as to what to do.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question! Mr. Kyonda.</Newspeech>Question No.656<Header>Electricity for Matiliku- Haalth Centre.</Header>MR. KYONDA asked the Minister for Health since Government has provided a generator to Matiliku Health Centre, what urgent measures the Ministry is taking to ensure that the centre is provided with electricity.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Dr. Godana) : Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. I wish to inform the hon. Member that my Ministry has no immediate plans to provide Matiliku Health Centre with electricity. The nearest electrical service lines are at Small, a distance of over 30 kilometres from the Health Centre.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant Minister's reply, is he aware that the Government provided Matiliku. Health Centre with a generator because it recognized the need for this health centre to have electricity? At the moment, the nearest electrical service line pass through Matiliku on the way to Kalamba. Is the Assistant Minister really serious in saying that the nearest-electrical service lines pass at Emalia distance of 30 kilometres away from Matiliku? Would he tellthis House when his Ministry is going to provide electricity tothis health centre? Although there is a generator, we need to have electricity.</Newspeeh><Newspeeh>DR. GODAM: Mr. Speaker, Sir, with all due respect to my hon. friend, I think he should be clear as to what question he wants to ask. If he is not satisfied with the generator, definitely, he should ask a question about it, but the Question on the Order Paper today is not asking about the generator. The Question is asking about the supply of electricity but it is not the business of the Ministry of Health to take electricity to that particular place. However, if and when electricity does actually go to Matiliku, we shall be ready to put an electricity line to the health centre, but at the moment, I think the hon. Member should ask the Ministry of Energy to take electricity there.</Newspeeh><Newspeeh>MR. KOBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Questioner has stated very clearly that there is a generator which has already been provided by the Ministry and according to this Question, itappears that the generator is not working. Could the AssistantMinister tell this House whether that generator is working or not.</Newspeeh><Newspeeh>DR. GODANA: Mr.. Speaker, Sir, if that is the case, it is quite obvious that this Question was very badly drafted. The Question states:-Since the Government has provided a generator to Matiliku Health Centre, what urgent measures is the Ministry taking to provide the health centre with electricity.If the hon. Member is dissatisfied with the generator, I amafraid that is a different question which he ought to reframeand bring it here again. We cannot at read the Questioner's mindand we can only go by the wording of the Question as it appears.However, the Question as it appears does not seem to imply that the Generator is not working.</Newspeeh><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZAUDI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It has become exceedingly difficult to follow what is being said in the House. There is far too much noise particularly from the Front Bench. Could you please, Mr. Speaker, bring the Front Bench to order? If they cannot be brought to order, perhaps we can have a few of them going out so that we can have some peace in the House.</Newspeech>(laughter)<Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant Minister's reply that this Questions seems to be improperly worded, that is his problem if he a cannot understand what the Question is all about. As far as I am concerned, this Question is very clear. It is saying that although the Government has provided a generator to this health centre, there is not electricity. The generator cannot be there for any other purpose. The Assistant Minister should have understood that the generator is not working. The Question is seeking to know from the Assistant Minister when his Ministry is going to provide electricity; to Matiliku Health Centre because although the generator is there, it is not working. This is what the Question is saying.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. GODANA: If that is the case, Mr. Speaker, Sir, then the hon. Member should have simply asked in a straightforward manner when the Ministry is going to repair the generator which is not in operating. As far as we are concerned, this is news to us and it is the first time I am hearing that the generator is not working since we provided it to this Health Centre. Definitely, this is not what the Question is talking about. So, if the generator is not working, I am afraid to say that that is how he should have framed his Question in the first place, but unfortunate. I cannot answer that Question now since I was not prepared, for it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALAHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is quite obvious that the hon. Assistant Minister is not being honest with   this House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: But he is a lawyer!</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. G0DANA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I do not think it is in order for the hon. Member to impute improper motive on me by saying that I am not being honest with   this House. Is he really in order to say that I am not being honest with this House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALA11A: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will substantiate why I said that the hon. Assistant Minister is not being honest with this House. When he first answered this Question, he said that the nearest electric service lines pass 30 kilometres from Matiliku Health Centre at Email. However, the hon. Questioner says that the nearest electric service lines pass through Matiliku. In any case, the Question is quite clear. It is  talking about the Government having provided a generator to the health centre. It is common knowledge that generators are used for providing electricity. In this particular case, since this gene¬rator was provided it has never worked and this is why the hon. Member is asking when the Ministry will provide electricity to this particular health centre. That is a very simple question!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Jibu Waziri!</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are two language which hon. Members are free to use in this House. The meaning that hon. Members want to impute to Questions can only be judged from the words they use. This Question, as it is, does not tell us that the generator in question is actually not working. In fact, we feel that the hon. Member should have first thanked the Government for providing the health centre with a generator and then said that he would like the health centre to be properly electrified. That is really what is now asking for.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Before the Assistant Minister came here to answer this Question, he should have got in touch with his field officers and known the reason why the hon. Member wants to ask this Question, what the position of the generator was and what quarrel the hon. Member for the area was. Is the Assistant Minister in order to come here and say that he is hearing about the generator for the first time here? Does this not mean that he did not take any trouble to do his homework and that he just came here to argue on semantics and syntax?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: What is your point of order?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think we have a problem in this House. From time to time, hon. Members shoot up claiming to be on points of order and start giving us lectures or asking wrong questions. I have not heard any point of order in the hon. Member's intervention.However, let me tell the House that we, in fact, got in touch with the people on the ground and told them that the hon. Member wants us to electrify this health centre. We then asked them how feasible this was, and we were told that the nearest electricity lines were 30 kilometres away. In any case, it is not the business of the Ministry of Health   and I am sure hon. Members know this  to rural electrification programmes to rural areas. As soon as hon. Members approaches the relevant forums and departments and gets electricity.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: On a point of order. On a point of order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order, hon. MembersDr. Godana, what the hon. Member is interesting in knowing is what the generator in question is doing?</Newspeech> (Applause)<Newspeech>DR. GODANA: Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir. That is what I said very early when the hon. Member made it clear that he should have asked that Question. That is not the Question which we were prepared to answer. The one we were prepared to answer is that which was asked originally. Going by the wording of the original Question, we assumed that the generator was working and did not inquire as to whether it was working or not because we were not told that it was not working.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASIKE—NDOMBI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Here is a whole doctor of law and an Assistant Minister who does not know that a generator produces electricity. Is he in order to continue arguing that the hon. Member has only asked when electricity will be provided in this health centre? Does he not see that the hon. Member wants to know when this generator will be active in producing electricity?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is precisely because I am a lawyer that I am very particular about the meaning of words. The hon. Member should understand that when he uses one language, it is judged by the ordinary meaning of the words he uses. This is simple logic.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I want to remind my learned friend of a certain legal maxim. There is the principle of law against absurdity. So, when we interpret any document or question, as learned lawyers, we use this maxim in order to give a rational meaning to any statement. Assuming that my learned friend is using this law against absurdity, could he now answer this Question properly and forgive the hon. Member for his language?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if my hon. colleague and learned friend is now asking that I forgive the hon. Member, who is a layman, for the language he has used, this is a different matter and I am prepared to forgive him.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

After the members of the Joint Loans Board are gazetted in two week's time, a meeting will be convened for the purpose of issuing loans to deserving applicants.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, Shs.80,000/= is not enough for the traders in Elgeyo/Marakwet. Could he increase this sum since it is only enough for one trader?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KOMBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, joint loans boards are operated by the Central Government and local authorities. Elgeyo/Marakwet Joint Loans Board is constituted by three Government nominees and three councillors. As yet, we have not received the contribution that comes from the local authority of Elgeyo/ Marakwet. When we receive this contribution, the amount to be allocated to this joint loans board will become good enough. For a long time now, we have not received this contribution, but we cannot force the local authority concerned to give us the money if it does not have it. At the time of giving the local authority Shs.80,000/= the outstanding balance against the local authority was Shs.671,238.95. If this balance is paid, there will be some good money available even without the amount from the Ministry of Local Government.</Newspeech>  Question No. 641K.N.T.C.

Member who wishes to ask a Question relating to another hon. Members constituency consults his colleague.Sir, this is not the first time hon. Okondo has behaved as a jirani mbaya. The other day, in a public rally, hon. Okondo claimed one of my islands, the Island of Ayasi, and we nearly fought with him on the issue. I would request that hon.

OKONDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Minister because I have a copy of his written reply, which is an elaboration of what he has just accepted. He says that he agrees to do so provided that funds are available. Now, the hon.

In fact, we have even found some donors, including Japanese, to see if funds can be made available for thisproject. The funds required amount to no less than KShs.l billion and, in the meantime, I would like to ask hon. Okondo and hon. (Dr) Oluoch that they need not quarrel. We will do our best to develop the area. I would particularly ask hon. Okondo to help us by asking the wananchi in that particular area to start doing some voluntary work in terms of digging trenches. This is a country of Harambee and we should show examples ourselves in a small way. I hope that hon.

If the Minister will provide the. labour intensive means, as he has agreed to do, the majority of the people who will be employed in the project will be from Bondo Constituency.

MAKHANU asked the Attorney-General what progress has been made in settling Mr. Jotham Furamba Ludebe on Plot No. 436, Kamukuywa Scheme, in Bungoma District, as per his reply to Question No. 80 of 1989.<Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The judgment of this case was delivered on 28th February, 1985, and   the eviction order issued on 18th February, 1987. However, the respondent, Mr. Willy Kisaka Baraza, filed an application of stay of execution and had the matter referred to the District Commissioner, Bungoma, for arbitration. However, again, the plaintiff had all along refused to participate in the arbitration process by the panel of elders. Whenever he was summoned by the district officer to appear before the panel of elders, he refused and went on refusing and seeking for assistance from the provincial commissioner’s office or from the district commis¬sioner's office. Since now he has agreed to have the case arbitrated, the case is scheduled for arbitration on 19th December, 1990.</Newspeech>(noise)<Newspeech>ME. KIRWA: On a point of order, Sir. I do not understand what the excitement is all about. We can hardly follow what the Attorney- General is telling the House. Why do Members of the Front 3ench not learn to sit in Parliament and keep quiet?</Newspeech>(applause)<Newspeech>MR. MULI: I had concluded my reply. I thought hon. Makhanu had heard what I said. Dh_lesQ any  hon. Member wants me to repeat  the reply.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: While thanking the Attorney-General for that reply, I would like to know whether he is aware that a panel of elders composed of Ex-chief Richard Kaxani, Joram Katoi, William Mitole, Wilson Amatsatsa, Edward Warurengo, Henry Wakhungu, Ben Mujunju, Simiyu Wangusi and Japhet Lisuma sat and determined the case on 16th February, 1982. It was that determination which formed the basis for the High Court judgement and subsequent eviction order. Now that the Attorney-General has said that the matter will have to he referred to the panel of elders, what will become of the judgement of the panel of elders arrived at in 1982? Is the panel of elders being required to review its own judgement?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MULI: I have not heard what hon. Makhanu has said in total but I have information wh_ich was sent by telex to the effect that this case will be arbitrated by the district commissioner's office on 19th December, which is not very far from now. I would urge hon. Makhanu to be patient until the outcome of that arbitration is known. Otherwise, we may prejudice what may happen in this pending matter. I did not use the word sub judice because it is an arbitration.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: I quite agree with what the Attorney-General is saying and I am thankful for his promise but what I am questioning is: If the panel of elders sat on 16th February 1982 and they are being asked to sit again   I have these documents which I will lay on the Table are they being asked to review their own judgement?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MULI: I think the hon. Member would be fair if he can submit the documents he has and I will look at them again. But there is no objection to a tribunal reconstituting itself again to look into certain matters which it may not have adjudicated during the first hearing. I am not aware of what hon. Makhanu is saying to the effect that there was another ruling. Perhaps, he can lay the documents he has on the Table I will undertake to give a further reply should it become necessary.</Newspeech>(Mr. Makhanu laid the documents on the Table)<Newspeech>MR.

NDETEI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister of State, Office of the President the following Question by Private Notice.Why was Mr. David Kimanthi Ndavi arrested by Administration Police, under the orders of the Chief of Ngwata Location, on 25th September, 1990, at Machinery Market, Ngwata Location, Kibwezi Division?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Nabwera): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.I am not aware that Mr. David Ndavi was arrested by administrator police on the  orders of the Chief of Ngwata Location on 25th September, 1990, at Machinery Market in Kibwezi Division.What I am aware of is that Mr. Ndavi was summoned to the district officer's office in Kibwezi to explain allegations which he and some other people had made in a letter.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI: I am surprised to hear the Minister say that he is not aware of the arrest of Mr. Ndavi on the orders of the Ngwata Location Chief. Mr. Ndavi was, in fact, arrested on 25th at 4.00 p.m. and was remanded in the chief's camp far 17 hours and was handcuffed the following day by the administration police and taken to the district officer's office. Those are the summons that the Minister has agreed with. There is an entry in the chief's office that Mr. Ndavi was actually brought there on 25th and not on the 26th. I wonder if the Minister has bothered to do his investigations   properly on this matter.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the gracious lady made similar remarks in my office. I set into motion investigations to find out the truth behind the allegations. What I have given here is the truth I have come out with.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI: Mr. Speaker, sir, the Minister says that Mr. Ndavi was arrested to answer allegations he had written. Mr. Ndavi had written this letter as an ordinary citizen to complain about something that had been done by the chief. The letter was addressed to the District Commissioner and on to the Office of the President, with a copy to the Provincial Commissioner, the Kanu Sub-Branch Chairman, the Permanent Secretary in the Office of the President in charge of Administration. Instead of the Administration insti¬tuting investigations on these allegations, it embarked on harassing those who had written the letter to alert the Government on what had gone on. Can the Minister now assure this House that he is going to set up a committee to carry t	out investigations? I do not want to bring those findings to the House as there are serious allegations. As Mr. Ndavi had claimed, he was complaining of the sale of identity cards, which is a very dangerous thing, as these  identity cards can easily be sold to dangerous people who would come here and destroy the Government.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, my investigations show that when Mr. Ndavi and his colleague were asked by the Machakos District Security Committee to give the facts of the matter, they said that, in fact, the author of the letter was the gracious lady. She had authored it and asked the gentlemen to sign it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I would like to categorically deny what the Minister is saying. As you can note, there is this letter written by Mr. Ndavi on 22nd August, 1990 and another written from the Kanu office, of which I was not party. I am not the Kanu Chairman of Kibwezi Constituency. The Kanu officials wrote that they visited the area  where the identity cards were being sold and sat on their own. I was not there and, therefore, could not write the letter. They wrote and sent their   letter without my knowledge. How, then, can the Minister claim that I am theauthor of such a letter? Am I mad? What crime do I have to hide? If it was me who authored this letter, is there not a case preferred against the registra¬tion officers, and is before the courts, on the same issue? Why does it have to be claimed that I wrote the letter when the Government has already preferred charges against its officers for the crime alleged? This is a cover-up by the Administration officials, the district commissioner, district officer and the chief. The chief said that he had been authorised by the district officer and that the district commissioner knew about the sale of the identity cards. I have a letter here showing that the district commissioner went to the Kibwezi office and summoned these officers in the office. The letter is written on the divisional letterhead. Why did he have to do that, if it was not a cover  up? The district commissioner also forced other people to write letters to 7 deny that they participated in this. These people were handicapped as they were told that if they did not sign the denial letter, they were also going to   be reported to the police and put in the cells. Why does the Ministry have to embark on an exercise of obstructing the mwananchi, when the mwananchi is complaining on a genuine case? We know that those identity cards could possibly be sold to the wrong persons, who can easily enter the country and disrupt our affairs. Why do we have such a cover up?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point  of order, Mr.  Speaker Sir. I think the allegation that has been made by the hon. Minister against the gracious lady is very unfair. That shows that there was one sided investigation. There is no reason why the Minister should come to the House with such a conclusion when proper investigations by an independent person have not been carried out. Could the Minister withdraw that remark until proper investigations are carried out?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: .Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said that the allegations which the gracious lady made to my office, for investigations, were acted upon. During the  time I was carrying out my investigations, this issue came to the House and I wanted to know the truth. I do not know what I have to withdraw because that is  the report we have come out with.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We are reque¬sting the Minister to withdraw the allegation he has made here to the effect that the author of the complaints' letter was the gracious lady and not the complainants themselves. That is the allegation we want the Minister to withdraw.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order. You are all very familiar with our Standing Orders.

My point of order is that this is a very important Question but there is a lot of noise in the Chamber. Could you kindly direct that we listen to the reply in silence?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order, hon. Members. Let the Assistant Minister reply in total silence.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Kamuren): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.My Ministry has instructed all district commissioners to implement in full the Treasury circular entitled District Focus for Rural Development, account and take into custody all Harambee funds and other resources  and all accountable documents necessary for accounting.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Question is very specific. Apart rom just merely instructing them to adhere to the circular from the Treasury, what tangible steps have been taken in all the schools in various localities?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Speaker  Sir, may I further give the following information to the satisfaction of the Questioner? The first letter was written under Treasury Circular letter Ref. XAS  20/047/111/37 of 10th January, 1986; to the district commissioners. A second letter, Ref. OP 138/009/TY/11 of 3rd August, 1990, was also sent to the district commissioners in all the districts asking them to place orders for receipt books and all other accountable documents with the Government Printers. All these documents are centrally produced and controlled Internal Auditors have been sent to most of the districts in the country.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think it would be more important if firstly, the Assistant Minister could tell us what those particular circulars contain for the benefit of the House and the public because not all of us have read these documents. Secondly, the kind of auditing or accountability that he is talking about pertains to collection of money that involves the district commissioners, but there are a lot of Harambee activities that go on in every school for collecting money from the members of public Once the money is collected how are you going to ensure that the money is accounted for?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, any money collected in a school in any district has to be accounted for. Every district commissioner, as I said, appoints an officer to audit all the money collected right from the sub location up to the district level. This auditor operates from the district commissioners office.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question.

Kati ya Januari na November, 19 90 kesi 49 za watu walioumwa na mbwa ziliripotiwa katika hospitali ya Msambweni. Kati ya hizi watu sita walikuwa wanaugua maradhi ya kichaa cha mbwa hal wengine walitibiwa na kwenda makwao. Kati ya hawa sita waliolazwa tano walipona na wakarudi nyumbani hali mmjo alichukuliwa na jamii yake kinyume cha maoni ya wauguzi kutoka hospitalini na tukasikia baadaye alifariki nyumbani kwake.Kati ya Januari na November, 1990 pia, kesi 49 ya watu walioumwa nanyoka ziliripotiwa katika hospitali ya Msambweni. Baada ya uchunguzi hospitalini werige walipatikana walikuwa wameumwa na nyoka wasio na sumu yaani non poisonus snakes, hali wale wengine walipatikana wakiwa wana shuku tu ati  wameumwa na nyoka yanisnake bit phobia. Kati ya hao wengine, mmoja alifariki na wawili walichukuliwa na jamii yao kinyume cha maoni ya wauguzi katika hospitali na wakaenda nyumbani.(b) Ofisa wa matibabu katika Wilaya ya Kwale yaani (MOH) amejulishwa kwamba kama mtu akiwa na kichaa cha mbwa au kuumwa na nyoka anaweza kupata dawa yaani antirabbies vaccine au anti snake venom kutoka kwa National Public Health Laboratory Services (NHLS), mahali ambapo dawa hizi ninazohifadhiwa.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Bw. Spika, Waziri Msaidizi anasema ya kwamba waliwatibu wagonjwa, wengine wakachukuliwa na jaama zao na wengine wakafariki. Je, anafahamu kwamba wale waliochukuliwa na jaama zao walichukuliwa kwa sababu wanalazimishwa wanunue dawa ambazo ni gali sana? Hiyo ndiyo sababu waliwapekeka wagonjwa wao nyumbani. Waziri Msaidizi anaweza kuhakikisha kwamba hivi leo dawa zitakuwa zikipatikana badala ya wagonjwa masikini kulazimishwa kununua hizo dawa katika duka za dawa?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DRJ B.A. GODANA: Bw. Spika, laa. Sifahamu kwamba watu walilazimishwa kununua dawa. Ningependa kumhakikishia mhe.

LEWA: Jambo la nidhamu Bw. Spika. Waziri Msaidizi •	hakujibu vizuri hili swali. Swali hili: Dawa ziko katikan hospitali hii au haziko? Waziri Msaidizi anaonyesha kwamba dawa haziko kwa sababu anasema kwamba zinapatikana katika NHLS. Kwa hivyo, yeye analipotosha Bunge hili. Aneweza kutuambia kama hizi dawa ziko katika hospitali au ziko katika NHLS?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: Ndiyo, Bw. Spika dawa ziko. Ofisa wa afya anaweza kuagiza dawa hizo kutoka NHLS. Madaktari wetu wanosimamia mahospitali wakiona kwamba ile stock ya dawa inapunguka wanajulisha NHLS na kupata dawa. Kwa hivyo, dawa ziko.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDIt:  Waziri Msaidizi anawesa kulieleza Bunge hili, ni maili gapi kutoka Msambweni mpaka NHLS? Kutoka Msambweni kwenda Mombasa ni maili zaidi ya 50. Dawa hizo ziko mahali gani Mombasa. Je, dawa zinaweza kupatikana wakati gani mtu akiumwa na yuko mahututi na dawa ziko Mombasa; tutafanyaje?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: Bw. Spika, inaonekana kwama mhe. Mbunge  	hakunielewa au hataki kunielewa kwa sababu mimi si kusema ati kila  	wakati mtu fulani akiumwa na mbwa au nyoka ati ndiyo wakati huo ndipo daktari atakimbia kutoka Msambweni hadi NHLS, Nairobi. Laa. Bali nilichosema ni kwamba dawa tunazo na madaktari wanaosimamia hospitali zetu wanajua mahali ambapo wanaweza kuzipata na tunaamini madakitari wamezichukuwa na kuna stock ya kutosha.

KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Labour the following Question by Private Notice.Following the change in the shareholding of M/S Wiggles Worth and Company Limited of P.O. Box 89268, Mombasa, what is the fate of the company.' s employees and when will they be paid their terminal benefits.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT! MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. D.M. Amin) : Mr. Speaker, Sir, I  beg to reply.M/S. Wiggles Worth and Company Limited carries out three distinct types of businesses and it is only one of these  businesses   machinery and	equipment   thathas changed in shareholding. However, the change in shareholding did not affect the management and as such the workers were promised through their trade union  K.U.C.S.A.W.   that their services were to. continue unaffected. Those who were affected by this change due to one reason or the other   nine employees in Mombasa and another eight employees in Nairobi  were paid their full terminal benefits which amounted to KShs.477,000.00. In accorance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement, between the union and the management, those who remained in employment had their services treated as continuous and therefore the question paying them terminal benefits does not arise.Mr. Speaker, Sir, this change took place in June, 1990, but there was no change in the terms and conditions of employment for workers.1 Like in any other situation, where shares of a company  change hands, the workers are not necessarily affected.</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR. KELIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have evidence to prove that M/S Wiggles Worth and Company has sold the company to other people. The employees want to be paid their terminal benefits by their previous employer. But the higgles Worth has threatened the employees to make them accept the terms and conditions set out by the new employer which is not proper. I am therefore appealing to the Ministry of Labour to make sure that these employees are paid their terminal benefits by their previous employer before they can accept the terms and conditions of service being set out by the new employer who has bought all the shares of the Wiggles Worth and Company  limited?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMTN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Labour is quite mindful of the welfare of workers in this country. There¬fore we shall not allow any	employer to act contrary to the interests and welfare of workers. If there is anything irregular in this particular case we shall take the necessary action to correct the situation.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EXLIKU:- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister says that if there is anything. I have already said that there is something wrong.

I was worried because on  16.11.90 it was reported that a meeting was convened by the administration to attempt to alter the composition of the board of governors.

LEWA: Mr.: Speaker, Sir, this is a very serious matter. This is just one of several examples where people who originate from this area are being displaced by people from other parts of Kenya.  Mr. Harrison Ndundi has been living on this plot since 1979.  I have a letter here from the District Commissioner, Kilifi, which recomme-nded that the District Settlement Officer allocates this plot to Mr.  Harrison Ndundi. Here we have been told that another Kenyan was given this plot. Could the Assistant Minister explain the circumstances that led to Miss . Mary Xerubo being given this plot	 rather than Mr.  Ndundi?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the hon. Lewa to lay that letter from the District Commissioner on the Table so that we can follow up the matter. This is because the information I have is that Mr. Harrison Kenga Ndundi is a casual squatter on the land and that Miss May Kerubo Areko was allocated that plot on 12th February.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MAIS: On a point of order, Mr.  Speaker, Sir.  The Question we are discussing touches on a very sensitive issue but there is too much noise in the Chamber.

We either suspend the Business of this House or Members agree to be orderly.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Can you proceed, Mr. Mutiso?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MOTISO: Mr.  Speaker, Sir, I was saying that the information I have is that Mr.  Harrison Kenga ITdundi is a squatter on that plot and that Miss Mary Kerubo Areko was allocated that same plot on 12th February, 1987, and was subsequently documented as owner of that plot on 23rd</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEWA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is misleading this House. How can somebody "be said to be a squatter when he has lived in the plot since 1979?  In 1934 the district commissioner who is the chairman of the allocation committee, recommended . Mr. Ndundi. Now another Kenyan came  only 1987 and, for some  mysterious reason she was allocated this land. It is daylight robbery for the Assistant  Minister to stand up here and say that Mr. Ndundi is Squatter.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have just asked the hon. Member to lay the information he has on the Table so that we can investigate whether it is true that   particular person was recommended by the district commissioner, who is the chairman  of the allocation committee. But further to that my information is that Miss Areko was given that land on 23.2.87. If the hon. Member has contrary  information, he should pass it over to us and we shall investigate the matter.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will lay the document on the Table because it right in front of me here. But I want the House to know that we are getting fed up with this practice in KLlifi Recommendations were made   by DC, as the chairman of the allocation committee, for people who had lived in the settlement schemes   which were allotted in 1933.  For unknown reasons records are plucked out and we then see allocations coming directly  from Nairobi. I do not want to be seen to be saying the current Minister for lands, Housing and Physical Planning is doing these things, but there  is a lot to be undone that happened before 1988  this is one example.</Newspeech>(Hon Lewa laid the document on the Table)<Newspeech>MR.

In the same Question I sought to know how many teachers were promoted this year from Tharaka Constituency. I have risen because I have not seen anybody rising to live to the promise that we were given yesterday.

Nafikiri kwamba baada ya kupitisha Mswada huu ingefaa Serikali ichukue hatua kutokana na mapendekezo yaliyotolewa kuto  kana na ripoti ya ukaguzi wa matumizi ya fedha za Serikali.

Mtu akifanya maombi kama hayo kortini, mara nyingi kesi hizo hazisikilizwi mpaka kikao fulani cha Bunge kinakaribia kumali zika. Tunatumaini kwamba sasa, kwa kuwa Mkuu wa Sheria ana uwezo zaidi sasa, atafanya hima kuliharakisha jambo hili.Jambo lingine ni kwamba kumesemekana kwenye Mswada kwamba umri wa. kustaafu wa Mkuu wa Sheria utashughulikiwa na Bunge. Tungetaka kufafanuliwe Bunge litakaa lini ili umri huo wa kustaafu ufikiriwe na kupitishwa.

Madhubuti was contributing. Is he here Okay, Mr. Galgallo.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GALGAHO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to very strongly support the establishment of the Coast Development Authority. It is the hope the. people of  Coast Province that this authority will assist in the development of the region. I would urge the Minister to look into developing both human and physical resources in that province. The province is very potential but due to lack of technical support its  resources have  not been tapped. I, therefore, suggest that the Minister looks into intensifying cotton, cashewnuts, sisal and mango production. Sir, the Ministry should think seriously of assisting cotton farmers. We have seen that the establishment of industries and other infrastructures that assist in offering employment are mostly based or centralised in urban centres. I want the Mini¬stry to realise that the only industry that we have offering some employment outside Mombasa is the Kilifi Cashewnut Industry and also the Bixa Industry in Kwale District. All those other areas do not have employment generating industries. Sir, the Kilifi cashewnut Industry went under receivership and the farmers suffered a lot until His Excellency the President came to their rescue. Currently, we are experiencing serious setbacks in the cotton Industry, particularly in the Tana River District. One of the first cotton irrigation scheme   Hola   is completely "dead" because the river changed its course. I am sure the technical division of the National Irrigation Board (N.I.B.) should have foreseen this aspect of the river a long time ago. The river changed its course leaving the Hola Scheme 100 meters away. As a result of that, about 6,000 people who were employed in that Scheme and who earned their living out of that cotton production have now been thrown into wilderness. They have no water, food and so on. They cannot even send their children to school. I want to urge the Minister to take serious view of the situation. This Scheme must be revived as fast as possible.Sir, three seasons have gone without any cotton being grown in that area. Those families, most of who were taken there during detention or were people who were detained there during the emergency, are the ones who actually started that Scheme as a pilot scheme. However, the locals who were integrated into that Scheme at a later date had alternatives because they had	clan farms and so on. Some of them had livestock and so on. But the people from up-country  who are there  the cotton farmers   are really suffering. I would, therefore, urge that since the employment opportunities have been lost due to negligence on the part of the technical division of the N.I.B., the Ministry should take action to assist the farmers.We have been promised and we have been given a hope that beginning from next year the farmers will be able to plant cotton crop. Up to now, nothing is in the foresight. V7e do not  see anything happening. I even doubt whether we shall have anything in the financial year 1991/92. Therefore, the Ministry of Regional Development should take a serious view of reviving the Hola Cotton Irrigation Scheme. Secondly, Sir, in the Bura Irrigation Scheme which was also involved in cotton production, we have had failures of machinery which has resulted into failure of crop. This is the fourth timethe Scheme has experienced the failure of the crop. I am sure something is wrong somewhere, and I would like to urge the Minister together with his staff to take appropriate action to rectify the situation. Already frustrations are there. But knowing that the Minister is capable of handling the situation, I hope he will take the necessary action or positive steps to rectify the situation make and make the farmers in those areas happy people.Sir, we used to produce between 6 and 8 million kilograms of cotton every season, but this year we have less than 3 million kilograms. This is very bad. This was as soon as the Ministry had increased the cotton price to KSh. 10/- per kilogram and the people had all the hopes and expectations of making something out of their hard labour, but the whole thing was grounded. It is a very had situation and I hope that the Minister will seriouslyundertake some measures to improve the situation. It was our hope too that the area that remained outside the Scheme  because part of the Scheme has not been developed yet, it would be appropriate if the Ministry would consider growing cotton on commercial basis. If the technical officers are not able to man the cotton industry, let it be grown on commercial basis. Let it be given to a contra¬ctor and then the Government levies the necessary tax. I am sure the production would be high and there would be a guarantee ox the crop being there because nobody would want to lose. Then people develop the attitude of  do not care  because it is Government property, it is very bad. So, I urge the Ministry to consider allowing cotton production on commercial terms.Further, Sir, part of the area that has not been used could also be leased to private firms so that more people could be hired into the service. This reason is very good for cotton production, and I am sure the whole district could be converted into cotton production. 3ut because of unnecessary delays and legislation, even when the Government schemes are "dying" people still say, "Look, they will" not succeed on their own . If the Government cannot ensure successful production of cotton, what can an ordinary person do?Thirdly, Sir, I would like to urge the Coast Development Authority to bring about the improvement of livestock production. I say so because Coast Province is infested  with tsetse flies. For instance, we have the East Coast Fever disease trypanosomiasis and so on. I would like the Authority to engage researchers to find a way of overcoming the tick borne disease.   Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I hope that the Authority will also assist: in the conservation of water resources.In Tana River District, we have several dry rivers . whose valleys lead into the main river valleys. During the rainy seasons, these rivers come to live with heavy torrential floods which cause a lot of havoc in this area. I would like to appeal to the Authority to construct dams which would hold "back this water with a view to utilizing the water for irrigation and for other purposes. We have for example, rivers like Kokarne, Hilmani, Galole, Kamunyu, whose waters could be harnessed for various purposes. It is incumbent upon us to teach and encourage our people to grow enough food for domestic consumption so that they are able to become self sufficient in food. Therefore, the Authority should take up the responsibility of encouraging wananchi in this entire region to grow more and more  food. This, they can only do, by harnessing river water which could in turn be used for providing irrigation water to farmers.Mr. Temporary  Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also liketo urge the Authority to devise a positive approach to avoid duplication of responsibilities. Already, we have the Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority (TARDA) which is covering some of the areas supposed to be covered by the Coast Development Authority.This particular Authority is starting a rice scheme at the dealt as of these two rivers. However, we now hear that there is no money to proceed with this project. This is a situation in which people have been given the hope that a rice scheme is going to be established but now the Government comes up and says that there is no money to carry out this project. It is our sincere hope that the Coast Development Authority will not move into that kind of direction. We hope that this Authority will come up with specific programmes conducive to self-sufficiency in food production, to developmentthis area.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am very grateful to Government for coming up with, the idea of starting the  Coast Development Authority. This will go along way into developing the arid and semi  arid areas that were left behind during the colonial government. I am saying this because the colonialists were only interested in the coastal strip and we  hope that most ox the arid and semi arid areas, will be reclaimed for development. This would assist the Government in solving the squatters problem at the Coast Province. I am saying this because at the moment, we have a lot of squatter problem in this area, and this problem can only be solved by  developing the x hinterland of  the Coast Province. For this reason, I would like to call upon this Authority to concentrate its efforts on the hinterland of the Coast Province for the welfare of the people in this region.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, we are all grateful to the Government for being able to come up with very positive policies regarding the development of this country, and we therefore, expect to share the national cake to wananchi throughout the Republic. However, we must share this national cake in the right way. When   recruit¬ment for people to man this Authority is being done, for example, people from Coast Province should first be considered. When I talk about the people from the Coast Province, I do not mean people from Mombasa alone. At the moment, we n know that the people of Mombasa, Kwale and Kilifi have taken a monopoly in the running of the Kenya  Ports Authority. One notices that people from Tana River, being quite far, are never given this opportunity . For this reason, we do not expect the people of Mombasa,aa Kvvale and Kilifi to be the only ones to be considered when it comes to recruiting those who will man this Authority. I hope the Authority will be able to employ the quota system when it comes to recruitment so that the people of Tana River and Lamu will also have a good share of employment opportunities in the Authority.  I have every confidence in hon. Midika and therefore, I have no doubt that he will ensure that people of Tana River   and Lamu Districts, will  a]so be given a chance for employment in this Authority. I therefore urge the Minister to take this point seriously.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is also my sincere hope that this Authority will devise policies that would assist the Government in generating employment opportunities and maximising production, both in the area of cash crops and  subsistence crops. We hope that the Authority will also assist in village development by providing social amenities.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION (Mr. Munyi): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, with all due respect to my good friend from Tana River, is the really in order to say that at the moment job  opportunities at the cost are dominated by the people from Mombasa, Kwale and Kilifi Districts while people from other Ares are left out? Is he really in order to make such a serious allegation?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika) : On a point of information, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would, like to inform the hon. Assistant Minister that hon. Galgallo is making a very useful contribution and is making his own opinion and I am afraid if somebody interrupts him, he is likely to interfere with the flow of his ideas. I personally fully understand what he is saying and I will comment on it when the time for replying to debate on this Bill comes. However, at the  moment, I would, urge hon. Members is not to interrupt him since he is developing a very good  argument.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GALGALLO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am indeed very grateful to the Minister for   that piece of information. To my good friend hon. Munyi, I would like to say that he ax does not seem to be serious in what he is saying. I have no doubt that he understands what I am talking about Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I was interrupted, I was saying that this is a very important   stride in our programme of development and we are most grateful to the Government for having thought it wise to establish the Coast Development Authority. I would like to urge the Minister to concentrate just on one place, such as the lake basin. It has been reported in newspapers that the Minister has always been in that place, which I am sure was for the good of the Lake Basin Development Authority and the people of the region. We hope that he will exercise the same initiative and advice in the Coast Development Authority.I say this, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, because Ministers always act very fast when the situation is critical. I pleaded with the Minister to visit Bura Irrgation Scheme when things there were very bad but, because of his commitments, he could not do it. I urge t6hat the Minister doubles his efforts to ensure that the cotton zone in that area is not destroyed. It should be revived and effectively utilised. I know that this falls under the Ministry of Regional Development and that is why I am appealing to the Minister. I have my good people who are hardworking and produce the best cotton in the world.Sir, I suspect that the cotton failure in Bura Irrigation Scheme is due to sabotage. That is a project that has been employing nearly the entire population of my constituency.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. The hon. Member must not try to insinuate things he cannot substantiate. He claims there is sabotage in his area, ad he insists on that claim. That being the case, the House might want to ask him to substantiate and name the saboteurs, if he knows of any, so that I can take action today. If hon. Galgallo, who is my friend and has attained the age of an Alhaji insists on that sabotage, then he mjust substantiate that and tell that and tell the truth.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GALGALLO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to repeat what I said, that that is the case. In fact, that project is so vital and import¬ant to my people.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Hon. Galgallo, you are not allowed to make claims that you cannot substantiate; otherwise, I will ask you to substantiate those claims.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GALGALLO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not want to argue with the Chair. I want to say that this is a very important project and for all machinery to fail at the same time, and no action is taken, leaves a lot to be desired. All four pumps failed concurrently and that is what is raising my suspicion and that of my people. Here is the Government and there is no lack of spare parts. When that happened, an entire crop got lost as there was no water in the Bura Irrigation Scheme for nearly two months. The whole cotton crop dried. That must arouse suspicion. This is the kind of situation we must fight against.Sir, the reason why I said we should use commercial planting of cotton is that if it was a businessman, he would not have allowed any such failure. But, because it is a Government project, there is an I do not care attitude  and that is what made that to happen.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, sir. No Government can have an  I do not  care  attitude. That is a very serious statement. The hon. Member is claiming there is such a Government attitude and I am saying we do not have any such atti¬tude. In fact, I thought that the hon. Member had said we are serious and quick. He was right when he developed the argument that we should visit the place. I do not want to argue with him, but let me tell him not to use words which will mar and distort his very good arguments. He is now spoiling an argument that he had started very well. To say that the Government has an  I do not care atti¬tude is to make a very serious allegation which we cannot have; otherwise, we would not be seated here.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GALGALLO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not want to have a confrontation with the Minister because it is the same man I am pleading with to bring about changes different from what we are experiencing now.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Respond to the point of order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GALGALLO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will do so, SirI am not repeating what I said but stating that the technical officers could foresee the breakdown of such machinery but take no action and that is what I call an I do not care attitude among the staff. That attitude has actually eroded the basic concept of instituting such a project. I am not trying to create suspicion amongst the officers but, the problems we have in some of those areas is that the spare parts are not there. They have to be purchased in Nairobi and they do not have a representative here. So, an officer has to move all the way to Nairobi and then take those spare parts back there. Let there be repre¬sentatives based here, so that when a phone call is made, purchases are made at this end. That coordination is very important.With those few remarks, I support the Bill.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Mweu): Ahsante sana kwa kunipatia nafasi hii ili nami niweze kusema machache kuhusu Mswada huu na pia kumtolea shukrani Waziri anayehusika na Mswada huu kwa kuuwasilisha hapa Bungeni ili tujadiliane kuhusu maendeleo katika Pwani. Sababu yangu ya kusema hivi ni kwamba ni jambo la maana sana kwani watu wa sehemu hii ya Pwani, kama inavyoonekana kama katika kifungu cha kwanza cha Mswada ambako kuna sehemu inayoitwa development area, inasemekana ni Lamu, Mombasa, Kilifi, Tana River, Kwale na Taita Taveta. Hizi ni sehemu ambazo zinafaa kwa kilimo cha nafaka na mazao ya aina mbali rabali.Kabla ya kusema mengi, ningependa kusema kwamba sehemu ambayo imetajwa katika kifungu cha l(iv) iko karibu sana na Kitui ambako kuna sehemu ambako wengine wetu tunawakilisha. Kama tujuavyo, Tana River inapakana na Kilifi na kwenda juu mpaka sehemu za Tseikuru, katika Kitui Magharibi. Hapo katikati kuna Kitui Mashariki, na pia Kitui Kusini, kama kule mawakilisho yanayojulikana kama Mutitu na Mutomo. Sehemu hizo.zinapakana na Wilaya ya Tana River. Ni sehemu ambazo zinajulikana kama stateland. Sehemu hizo zingefaidi sana kama zingewekwa ndani yamipango hii ya maendeleo tunayojadilia katika Mswada huu. Hii ndiyo sababu nina  sema kwamba Bw. Waziri angelichunguza jambo hili na kuona kama sehemu hizo zinge ingizwa kwanya mpango huu.Halmashauri hii ikianzishwa itaweza kuanza kazi haraka na kutekeleza mipango ya maendeleo ili sehemu hii iweze kuwa ya manufaa kwa Serikali ya Kenya kwa upande  wa ufugagi na kilimo.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, nataka kumwomba Bw. Waziri achunguze uwezekano wa kuiunganisha Wilaya ya Kitui katika mpango huu kama vile imefanyika na sehemu za kusini za Wilaya ya Garissa. Ninasema hivyo kwa sababu isipokuwa watu binafsi wanaofuga mifugo katika sehemu za Wilaya ya Kitui, hakuna kazi nyingine inayoendelea. Kwa hivyo, badala ya kuziweka sehemu hizi bila mipango yoyote ya maendeleo, naomba ziunganishwe na sehemu zitakazohudumiwa na halmashauri hii ili ziweze kutumika na kutuletea manufaa kama vile Serikali inavyofikiria kuhusu sehemu za Kwale, Kilifi, Tana River na nyinginezo, hasa zile zilizo karibu na Mkoa wa Pwani.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, sehemu hii inayozungumzwa ni tambarare na ambayo inaweza kutoa manufaa mengi sana maji yakipatikana. Kwa hivyo, halmashauri hii ni lazima itafute njia ya kupata maji aidha kutoka Mto Tana au mahali pengine popote. Maji yakipatikana sehemu hizi zitafaa sana kwa kukuza mimea kama vile mahindi, maharagwe, mpunga, pamba na mimea mingineyo ya matunda. Hivi majuzi tulitembelea Wilaya ya Tana River na kitu kimoja tulifurahia kuona ni kwamba kwa sababu ya maji ya Mto Tana sehemu hiyo ina matunda ya maembe masafi sana. Tuliona kwamba wenye maembe hayo huwa wakiyaleta Nairobi ili kuyapeleka katika masoko ya nje. Kwa hivyo, ikiwa tutaweza kuistawisha sehemu hii kulingana na Mswada huu, tutaweza kuzalisha mimea zaidi na kuzidisha eneo ya kukuza citrus fruits pamoja na mboga. Tukifanya hivyo, tutaweza kuihusisha sehemu ya Matuu ambayo kwa muda wa miaka kama 20 iliyopita imekuwa haitoi mazao yoyote, ingawa lara wakati huu sehemu hiyo inapata pesa nyingi kwa sababu ya kuanzishwa kwa mpango wa kunyunyizia maji mashamba. Hii ni sehemu ambayo inakuza mimea ya matunda na mboga na kuiletea Kenyapesa nyingi sana za kigeni.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, sehemu inayotajwa hapa, hasa Wilaya ya Tana River, inaweza kutoa mavuno mengi hasa ya mboga na matunda. Tunajua kwamba nchihii inanunua pamba kutoka nje kwa sababu hatuwezi kukuza pamba ya kutosheleza mahitaji ya viwanda vyetu.  Bw. Naibu Spika wa Linda, tunajua kwamba aaji yakipatikana huko Hola, tunaweza kukuza pamba ya kutozelesha viwanda vyetu na hatutakuwa na hag a ya kununua pamba kutoka nje. Kwa hivyo, huu ni Mswada wa maana na ningependa Waziri anayehusika atilie jambo hili maanani ili pamba ichukue nafasi ya kwanza mara tu ma mi aira hii itaanza knfanya kazi. Sehemu ya Gar sen ina maji katika eneo kubwa na ingefaa maji haya yatumiwe kwa kuzalisha nrpunga. Hii ni kwa sababu maji si shida katika . sehemu kwa vile inaponyesha Kirinyaga, Muranga, Kiambu, Embu, Meru na kadhalika, maji yote   huteremka hadi Mto Tana na hatimaye baharini.Pia maji yakipatikana katika sehemu nyingine, tunaweza kuwa na TiHanja vya kulisha mifugo. Tunaweza kuzalisha mifugo wenye nyama tamu ambayo haipatikani katika sehemu nyingine. Tunajua kwamba nyama ina soko kubwa katika nchi za nje. Hii ni kwa sababu kuna nchi, kama vile, Saudi Arabia, ambako huwezi kupata ngombe za nyama kwa sababu hawawezi kulishwa huko isipokuwa kupitia unyunyiziaji maji mashamba. Hii inawesa kuwa na gharana kubwa.Tunaweza kuwa na cooperative ranches   tuweze kupata nyana ya kutosha hapa nchini na ya ziada kwa mauzo katika nchi za nje   .tuweze kujipatia pesa za kigeni. Uinaamini kwamba tukiwatunza wanyama wetu vizuri, tunaweza kuwa na nyama nzuri ya kuuza katika nchi za nje.Kwa kumaliza, ningependa kusema kwamba wale amcao walifikiria kuanzishwe mamlaka hii, walifikiria jambo la maana aana na najiunga nao kikamilifu. Tunataka rnami ajca. hii ianze kufanya kazi mara nioja baada ja Mswada huu kupitishwa katika Bunge hili. Ingefaa pesa zitafutwe haraka ili huu mpango huu uanze kutoa matunda kwa inanufaa ya Serikali na wananchi. Sifikirii kwamba mpango huu utalegea kama vile mhe. Mbunge ambaye ni jirani yangu alivyo sema.Kama nilivyosema mheleni, niipnWnnHa. Hola,. hilisikitika kwa sababu yale mashamba  ambayo yalikusudiwa kutumiwa kukuza pamba, yamekaukana maji hayaonekani tena. Hii ni kwa sababu zila canal3 ambazo zilikuva zikileta maji katika mas naaba haya, hazina faida tana kva vile ato sasa umegeuza njia yake. Lngefaa tujange ranal. kubwa ambayo inaweza kusambaza maji kupitia nguvu za gravity badala ya kutumia mashine.</Newspeech><Header>ADJOURNMENT</Header><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Hon.

Ex-Senior Seregeant Ongeto, P/No. 101123 was not paid total benefits as  recommended by the Medical Board held on 3rd June, 1982, due to unfortunately some delay within my office. I wish however to inform the hon. Member that the claim has now been finalized and forwarded to the Treasury for payment.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

NABWERA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I cannot tell off hand the total amount, but whatever was left as his balance this is  being done by the Department of Defence  will be paid.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MOMAYI: Mr. Speaker Sir, the Minister that gentleman is question has not been paid some of his dues. I would like to conform that he has never been paid anything. This man was burnt in 19 8 2 while he was on duty. Can the Minister tell us  why he is saying that he has been paid part of the amount when he has not been paid anything? Why should he be paid some of the money when he is supposed to be paid the whole amount?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, my understanding is that gentleman in Question had been paid, part of his claims, I think  this covers the salary.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are not talking about the salary. We are talking about medical benefits. With regard to pension, that is all right but we are talking about medical benefits.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to give an  undertaking that whatever is due to Mr. Ongeto, will be paid.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NDZAI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the Minister apologize for the  delay, because in his answer he sand it is his office which caused the delay since 1982. Can he therefore, apologize for delaying the claim?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said it was unfortunate because, the correspondence between different departments of my office caused the delay.

MATE asked the Minister for Agriculture, whether he could consider instituting an authority to monitor the buying and selling of tobacco in   the  tobacco growing  areas in  the Republic.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Gachui) Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. The Government is satisfied with the performance of the tobacco industry in the Republic  and therefore, My Ministry does not consider it necessary to establish an authority or a parastatal for the sole purpose of monitoring, the functions of buying and selling of tobacco in the tobacco growing areas in the Republic.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATE: : Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for that reply, is he aware that the British American . Tobacco (B.A.T.) does the pricing and grading of the tobacco in this country and that it is the view of the farmers in this country that there should be a body. to control the buying and selling of tobacco in this country? That being the case  would the Assistant Minister agree with me that it is unfair for the B.A.T. to keep a monopoly of the buying and selling of tobacco in this country?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GACHUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the tobacco industry,  there are 17 grades of cured tobacco, 15 grades of fired tobacco and 8 grades of varied  tobacco. The pricing of tobacco in a free economy like the one we have in Kenya is determined between the  buyer and the seller. Therefore, it is not appropriate for the Ministry or indeed the Government, to come into the question of control or determination of prices of this product as it is freely being traded. As far as we in the Ministry of Agriculture are award the farmer is satisfied with the level of grading that exists  because the increase in the level of tobacco  production in this .  country is a clear indication that more and more farmers are entering in the field of tobaccon growing.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATE:  On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am a tobacco farmer myself and what I know is that all the activitiesof tobacco grading buying selling and pricing is done by the B.A.T company and farmers are not satisfied with this arrangement. Is the Assistant Minister therefore in order to say that the farmers are satisfied, with the present activates of the B.A.T.  which is tantamount to a monopoly of the  whole business.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GACHUI: Mr. Speaker Sir, this is the result of an open economy where. the producer is not  in a position to determine the market  price of his produce. In this case the market price as well as the grading to determine the price has to be determined by the buyer.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in view of the answer given by the Assistant Minister, could he direct the B.A.T. to co-operative a few farmers in the panel that determines the grade, and price of tobacco?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GACHUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, unfortunately, in a free economy like ours, we can only advise the company concerned, if they deem it useful for the promotion of good, relationship between them and. the farmer, to create such mechanism as would be able to achieve this objective. However, we are not in a position to direct them to.   determine an institution that would be able to organize the price structure.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question! Mr. Ndirangu!</Newspeech>	Question. No.625Extra Telephone Booths in Nyeri Town MR.  NDIRANGU. asked  the Minister for Transport and Communications what steps  his Ministry is taking to install telephone booths   Nyaribo, Muruguru,  Kihuyo and Ihwa trading centres.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT7MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND C0MMU1TICATIONS  (Mr. Mutwol): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Corporation has plans provide public telephone booths at uruguru, Nyaribo and Ihwa trading centres as follows: (a) Plans are  underway to instal a public, telephone call box at Muruguru by  mid February, 1991. (b) Nyaribo trading center will be provided with a public telephone call box by mind March, 1991. (c) Kihuyu Trading Centre is programmed to be provided  with a public telephone. call box by the end of August, 1991.  (d) Ihwa Trading Centre is programmed, for the provision of, public telephone service  by mid 1992.</Newspeech>	 <Newspeech>MR. NDIRANGU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is my sincere hope.  that the Ministry will-live up to their  promise without  having to be reminded.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MATE: Mr. Speaker, Sir. arising  from  that good reply from the Assistant Minister that these telephone services will be provided next financial year, and in view  of the fact that the  Corporation-is now in a very good position of collecting all the  outstanding-telephone bills, would he consider carrying out the work he has promised even earlier than the specified dates.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR; MUTWCI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the  Ministry would be willing to carry out this promise even by next month, but there are certain things that are required before we can instal these £ telephone facilities. At the moment, we do not have the call box which we  have to import and this definitely takes a bit of time. However,  we hope to get them and  instal them in the places I have mentioned at. the specified time.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Mr. Kyonda's Question.</Newspeech>Question No. 655 	Staffing Position in Machakos SchoolsMR. KYONDA asked, the Minister of or Education:-(a) what the current staffing position of allthe primary and secondary schools in Makueni vision is, and(b) whether he could provide a breakdown  of the  trained  and runtrainedr&eachers in all the primary and secondary schools  in the divi¬sion.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER F0R EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): Mr.  Speaker, Sir,  I beg to reply.(a) My Ministry has posted a total of 1,912 primary school teachers to Mk Makueni Division of  Machakos District to man  l,915 .classes. There is therefore, an  under staffing of three teachers.(b) The  Teachers Service Commission has also posted 347 teachers to teach in 35 secondary schools in  Makueni Division.  The  current staffing position in Makueni Division is as follows:-In primary schools,, there are 1,292 trained teachers, 620 untrained teachers making a total of 1,912. In secondary schools, there are 154 trained teachers and 193 untrained teachers making a total of 347 teachers.<Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank .the Assistant Minister for this elaborate answer; but. I do not agree with  him that this division is understaffed by three primary school  teachers  Could he tell us what he  is going to do urgently to  make sure  that there are enough  teachers for all classes?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member should be grateful to. the Ministry because if a whole division is understaffed only by  three  teachers, this is negligible.  However,  we will  try  to post more teachers there when they graduate from college.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we know that there are many young people looking for jobs. Could the Assistant Minister assure this House that all. primary schools  will have  enough teachers, by the beginning, of 1991?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  KARAURI: Mr.   Speaker, Sir, if we recruit, untrained teachers in January, 1991, we will fill these positions.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA:  Mr.  Speaker, Sir, I did not hear what the Assistant Minister said.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr . Speaker, Sir., I agreed with the hon. Member that the three vacant position will be filled in January, 1991.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the secondary schools in the division are the ones that are badly hit because there are only 154 trained teachers and 194 untrained teachers, which is a very bad situation. However, before we go into that, could the Assistant Minister tell us how many Teachers Service Commission teachers any given school is supposed to have?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI:J Mr. Speaker, Sir, that depends on the number of streams a school has and the subjects it teaches  So, we cannot say how many teachers are required in any school.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell us how many teachers, a  singles stream school is supposed to have?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir  in primary schools  we post one teacher per class. If the school is big.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker Sir, I am interested in secondary schools because we have already stalked; about primary schools  Could the. Assistant. Minister tell us how many teachers, a single stream, secondary school  is. supposed to have from  the Teachers Service  Commission?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.KARAURI:  There is no definite number, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because this depends on the subjects being offered in the school.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA:Mr.Speaker Sir, you will agree with me that the  Assistant. Minister is not serious.  Is he telling us that  the Ministry has no  policy regarding  the number of teachers single stream secondary school is  supposed to have?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I  have   always imagined that the hon.  Member was  a  teacher before he came to this House  but I now have doubts. If a  school is offering, say, domestic science, we will post a teacher there to teach this subject. If it is offering art and craft, we will post a teacher there to teach. the subject. Different schools, offer, different subjects, and we cannot determine the number of teachers each class requires.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ANASWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, from  what the  Assistant Minister has said, we have very many untrained teachers in that division. What arrangements is the Ministry making to improve the quality of education in the division by providing trained teachers?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we talk about untrained teachers, we include even properly educated teachers, such as graduates, who have not done education in the university. I can assure the hon. Member that untrained teachers in secondary schools can teach almost as well as trained teachers. In any case, we are continuously training more teachers to replace untrained teachers in schools.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER:  Let us go on to .the next Question, Mr. Lewa.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA:  On a point of information, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.. SPEAKER: Nobody is interested in your information, Mr. Kyonda.</Newspeech>Question No. 672 Settlement of Shariani Village SquattersMR. LEWA asked the Minister for Land, Housing and Physical Planning whether  in view of the fact that  there is  some*Governments.land still available in Kufuitu  area of Bahari Division, he could .make immediate "  arrangements to settle the families in Shariani Village. Who have lived. in this area as squatters for more than   60 years.<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LANDS HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PUANNING;(Mr. Mbela): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.  I  am aware   that  there ,is  some Government land available in Kuruitu area of Bahari Division  but the Government has definite development  plans for the land.   I am also aware that most of the squatters on the land  moved there   just  recently . and should actually be  advised to  return to their original places of residence.   The genuine squatters should apply, for settlement plots at Magarini Settlement Scheme through the District Plot Allocation Committee for consideration.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir ,  the  Question addresses the squatters in Shariani Village specifically. This village has been in existence for God knows how. many years   more than 400 years - but most of the people there have been thrown out of the village because most of the land there belongs to private landlords. Next to Shariani, there is Kuruitu where, as the Minister agrees, there is some Government still available. The question of people having gone to this place recently does not arise because I am talking about the people in Shariani Village, some of  whom are now being evicted by private landlords. So, what plans does the Minister and other Government machinery have to settle these squatters on the existing Government land in Kuruitu, 80 per cent of which belongs to private landlords?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MBELA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said that I have no plans to settle  Shariani squatters on the  said  Government land because we have other plans for it. The other alternative that these squatters have is Magarini  Settlement Scheme which they can take if they are interested.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it would be interesting if the Ministercould tell us what definite plans the Government has for this area.  We   know  that Magarini  is about 105. kilometres from Shariani  and   there is every chance  that this  and will be given to-other Kenyans who may even sell it later for  their own personal  gain while these people, are in need of land   right now.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MBELA : Mr. Speaker, Sir, this land is fairly close to. the sea  front and we expect it  to be  used in the establishment of supporting industries for tourism.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.. NDZAI: Mr. Speaker, Sir in his reply the Minister, said that these squatters settled in this area recently and that they should go back to their original places of residence. Could he tell us .which these original places  of residence are since.  he seems  to know where, these  people came from?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MBELA:	Speaker, Sir, I speak with firs hand knowledge of the area. I personally visited the area 18 months ago and found that less than one third of the land had been occupied by squatters. There is currently a big influx of settlers who hope that they will be treated as genuine squatters. They must have come  from  somewhere else, and I suggest that they go back where they have come from.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEWA: Mr.  Speaker, Sir, if I heard the Minister well, he said that this Government land is going to be developed for tourism, which development is made by Kenyans. We have Kenyans in Shariani who could be given the land to develop for tourism. What problem is there in allocating the land to these people to develop for tourism?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MBELA: I have not received any application, from the Shariani people who are interested in developing tourist industries, When they do so, their applications will be processed in the normal manner.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.SPEAKER: Next Question.</Newspeech>Quest ion No. 667<Header>Repairs to Ramisi-Kikoneni-Kigombero Road</Header>MR.

MWAMZAUDI: It is true that there is too much noise in the House and we request that it be brought to order. I wonder if I can be heard by the Minister because his colleagues are too noisy.My question is Since this road has protruding stones that are dangerous to car tyres, would the Minister consider instructing a grader to do this road because 12 people cannot cope with levelling them?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIBEI: I. will look in to that, Sir.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MHAMZAHDI: I am glad the Minister has said that he will lookinto that. When the Minister leaves this House, will consider instructing his officers at Kwale to do this work?

JALAUG’O: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to inform the Assistant Minister that there are 12 fishing beaches in Rarieda ran by three cooperative societies. In 1939* the fishermen lost about 30 per cent of the fish output valued at over Kshs.2.5 million. Since the Assistant Minister has said that funds are not available, what, specific plans does the Ministry have to avoid this recurrent loss which is estimated at Kshs. 3 million this year?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKMRA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I appreciate the hon. Member.concern, would like to inform him that the fishermen have been encouraged toform strong cooperative societies.

What, are these  proper channels</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKHSRA: If this kb& co-operative society has money and we havethe Co-operative Bank of Kenya, surely there is no reason why they should not be assisted. If there is, any problem, they should come to us and we shall assist.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.JALAHG'O:The Assistant. Minister is talking about, the availability of ice at Mbita which is very far from Rarieda- in fact they are in separate provinces. How does he expect us to get ice from Mbita to preserve five tons of fish daily? Can he explain how this can happen? Does he know the geography of Mbita and Rarieda?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. OKWARA: MR. Speaker, Sir, although I do not come fromRarienda the hon. Member is fully aware that I accompanied my     Minister whenche went to open the ice storage in Mbita.

What is essential sould receive priority in implementation. So, when the Assistant Minister says that the rehabilitation of this facility will be done when funds become  available, then he is down grading the essentiality of the airstrip Could he tell us, in view of this facility being  essential, why itShould not be rehabilitated and developed in a particular period of time? When will that be done?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

(Mr.: Ogur): Mr. Speaker, Sir., I beg to reply,My Ministry, has set aside KShs.400,0.00.,00. in 1991/92 Financial Year to purchase an ambulance for Kapsara Health Centre.My Ministry has put a type one health centre with 12 beds in Kapsara. Here too we have set aside. KShs.35,000.00.thrpugh the Trans Nzoia District Health Management Team to buy beds forthe health centre.

KIRWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want a specific time when these beds are going to be provided.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very difficult for one to know the specific time when he would go to a shop and buy things and complete the work. However, since the money is available, the exercise will be done very soon.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: When?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Either Monday or Tuesday. It will be done.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not know whether the Assistant Minister is catching me. When are they going to provide the beds for this particular health centre?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am saying that the beds are not with us they are at the shops and we will, have to-send our people to purchase them and deliver them to the health centre. That is only when we can say when we .will take them there.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.ANASWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, hon.Kirwa has clearly asked a question in terms of time factor and the Assistant Minister	talking about shopping.  What duration of time is likely to be taken by the Ministry to buy that vehicle and deliver it to the health centre? We are talking about the question of time and ot Shopping.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR.OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir , with regard to the vehicle, IDid indicate that it will be purchased during  the 1991/92 Financial Year.

It is only then that we should be able to say the time when patients Will be able to sleep there.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.KIRYA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I. think the AssistantMinister is not taking the Question seriously. Why is he creat¬ing a controversy; out of a straight forward Question? Is the money there or is it not there? If it is not there he should tell us.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we. have said that we are going to buy the beds, and this is to prove that we have money.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR.MISGI:  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I agree, with, the hon.

MWAMZAMDI:  On a point of order, Mr.Speaker, Sir.You have called out .three times for a Minister to respond, to the Question and yet we have an Assistant Minister Mr.Omido here who does not want to stand and respond to the Question. Is the AssistantMinister hot deliberately not ignoring the responsibility bestowedon him by the President? This is very seriously.

This is the second time I am telling the Housethat the answer is not adequate, but it is a fact. It is truethat I have an answer to the Question, but in my view, it is notadequate.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. TERER: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Sir. I think this explanation is not enough because both Assistant Ministers were in the House, and when you asked them to respond to the Question, they deliberately sat down; or rather they were hiding. So, I think, they should give us further explanation as to why they did not respond to the Question?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMIDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was seated in the Front Bench and, therefore, there was no question of hiding at all. I am being sincere to the House.

So, I do not know what I am supposed to do with it?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMTDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not denying the fact that there is an answer to this Question.

OMIDO: Mr.Speaker, Sir, this answer was only brought to my desk, just a few minutes before I came into the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: 0n a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Earlier on, the Assistant Minister had promised to give the House</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Mwamzandi The Assistant Mini¬ster has promised to give a very satisfactory answer tomorrow. So, next Question, Mr. Wabuge.Remittance of K.A.R.I. Sacco Funds</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WABUGE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Ministerfor search, Science and Technology the following Question by Private Notice.Why did the Director of K.A.R.I. not remit money contri-buted by members of Ukulima Sacco to their society for the months of July, August and September, 1990, amounting to KSh. 12,000,000.?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR RESEARCH SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (Prof.Oluoch):  Mr.Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. The Director of K.A.R.I. did not remit money, contributed by members of Ukulima Sacco to their society for the months of July, August and September, 1990, amounting to KSh.12 million because the  Institute had a shortfall in personal emoluments  for the said months. However since then the institute has remitted money to the society for the months of July and August. Arrange¬ment are also underway to have money for the month of September, remitted to the society.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.WABUGE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the Assistant Minister aware that non remittance of that Shs. 12 million has resulted in suspension of loan advances to the members? If so, when the KARI director finally remits that money to the cooperative society and at what rate?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR.OLUOCH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am fully aware of the consequences of not remitting these funds. I am inviting anybody who is hard hit to come and talk to the Ministry and some arrangements will be made to sort it out.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WABUGE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in view of the AssistantMinisters reply and reaching that the members contributed the money which hasnot been fully remitted, to the co operative society two years backcan he tell this House specifically whether this money will carryinterest and the rate of the interest? Will he also instruct thesociety, to give loans</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.KERWA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Whilewe appreciate the consultations the hon. Members are making, I thinkit would be in order for us to do so in low tones. Furthermore,I think it is anomalous for two Ministers to standingwhen hon. Wabuge was raising his supplementary question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Wabuge, just continue.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WABUGS: Mr. Speaker, Sir, since this money, whichhas not been fully remitted to the cooperative society, wascontributed by members two years ago and, as a result, the societyhas stopped giving loans to the members concerned, will theAssistant Minister instruct, the cooperative society to give loansto these members and also ensure that when this money is finallyremitted it carries a substantial interest rate?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. OLUOCH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not true that thismoney was contributed two years ago; it was contributed only a few months ago. For the benefit of the hon. Questioner, perhaps, I	should give more information. The institute, was underprovided  for in personal emoluments, It is actual payroll amounts to Shs.l9,686,233i45 per month but it receives Shs.16 million per month This leaves a short fall of Shs3,686,238.45. As a result of this shortfall the institute has been unable to remit its statutory deductions in goodtime. The deductions involved are for Ukulima Sacco Society, NSSF, NHIP, PAYE and so on. Theshortfall therein referred to has arisen due to three factors, namely:The implementation of a scheme of service for research scientists. .This scheme of service for 432 people came into operation after the draft estimates for 199091 had already been submitted. Their actual monthly salaries is Shs.3,685,830 but the institute receive Shs.2,910,150 leaving a difference of Shs.775,680. There are five centres which	 were transferred to the  institute this year  without funding. These were the National Agricultural Research laboratories, the Chief Grader of Inspectors, the National SeedQuality Control Service, the Macademia Project in Thika and the Plant Quarantine Station, Muguga.3. The third factor is that the institute also implements the salary review of staff in Job Groups “A” to “G” and has far not received additional money to effect this expenditure.The situation is being rectified and we have made adequate provisionin  the revised estimates to cater for the under provision; we havealso remitted to the instituted the under issues to the time of Shsl2,080,230to be used for payment of the deduction which have not been paid sofar. So it is only three months for which deductions have notbeen remitted and arrangements are being made to cover them. Ifthere are any problems arising out of this the Ministry has undertakento make it good.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. WABUGE: Mr. Speaker, Sir the Assistant Ministeris  Saying that only money for three months has not been remitted.Is he aware that if this money was deposited in a fixed depositaccount at a rate of 15 per cent it would have earned a lot of money?If so who will pay the interest that has accrued from this money?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. OLUOCH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are fully aware of the consequences of not paying this money, interest included. Ihave undertaken to make good any necessary shortfalls that arisesas a result of this.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Next Order, please.Second ReadingThe Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, Ibeg to move that The Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill be now a Second Time. The Constitution is a substantive law of this land, which cannot be erased. It is common knowledge to everybody that before 1963 we had no constitution but were governed by the conventions applicable to the Sir British people; we were a colony and as such we had no constitution of our own.Now on snatching our Uhuru our sovereignty wasEnshrined that document known as the  “Constitution of Kenya”.	Mr. Speaker Sir this Constitution is the substantive law of this land and being a very important document it is a document that cannot. afford to be tampered with or amended without any just cause; just like any other Act of Parliaments It stands by itself and as such it must be respected and it must be given that sanctuary of its existence as the document of our sovereignty.Indeed Mr. Speaker Sir, in order to be able to touch thisConstitution one must go a long way in order to alter the Constitution. Nevertheless it was envisaged at that time that events may arise or necessity may arise to make it essential for the alteration of the Constitution. Indeed that independent existence of the Constitution was to a certain extent reduced so that it can only be amended by this august House and no other. I will repeat that due	to the independence and sanctity of thisdocument no one else can amend it like any other Act of Parliament but by a procedure that is provided for under the Constitution itself. I can only remind hon. Members that Section 47 of the Constitution makes very clear the procedure to be adopted for amendment or alteration of this Constitution. Section 47(1) of the Kenya Constitution reads as follows Subject to this section Parliament may</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Omido)  On a point of order Mr. Speaker Sir. The Attorney-General is making a very important concerning the Constitution of this country but the consultations amongst Members of Parliament seem to be a bit too loud and as a result of this the Attorney-General is inaudible. Could hon. Members please tone down their conversations so that we can hear the Attorney-General in absolute silence?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY GENERAL(Mr. Muli) Mr. Speaker Sir I was  referring to the method under which this Constitution can be amended. It is only this august House which can amend the Constitution in a manner quite different from the way we deal with amendments to the other laws which are indeed subject to this Constitution. As I was saying before was interrupted by hon. Omido	Section 47(i)of the Constitution of Kenya readsas follows :-Subject to this section Parliament may alter this ConstitutionIt is only then that this very vital and essential document called the Constitution and which is the basic and substantive law of this land can be amended Not only that Section 47(2) of the Constitution reads as followsA Bill for an Act of Parliament to alter this	Constitution shall not be passed by the National   Assembly unless it has been supported on the second and Third readings by the votes of not less than sixty-five per cent of all_ the Members of the  Assembly  (excluding ex-officio members)Of course this exclusion. Mr. Speaker Sir touches theAttorney-General and Mr. Speaker. So you and I Mr. Speaker Sircannot vote on the Constitution  But the rest of the Members mustconstitute not less than sixty-five per cent of all the Members ofthe National Assembly I therefore plead with the hon. Members tobear with me and with us right through this procedure becausefrom time to time you may wish to order a Division as the mode ofvoting. Therefore in order to make the Bill pass through its Secondand Third readings no doubt a Division will be ordered and sixty-five per cent of the Members of this Assembly must be present Having given that outline Mr. Speaker, will now turn to the substantive point that we are dealing with, We are dealing with, the officers known in the Constitution asConstitutional Officers. Who are those Constitutional officers? Among them are the Judges of the High Court and the Court of Appeal The others are the Controller arid Auditor General, the  Attorney General and members of the Public Service Commission and the members of the Electoral Commission Mr. Speaker, Sir,you are familiar with that group of people called the Electoral Commission They are the ones who look into the alteration of boundaries of constituencies. They did go round the country in 1987to find means and ways off remapping constituencies, Those are the  	 Constitutional Officers for whom I have the honour to move certain amendments to the Constitution in order to deal with the tenure of office of these officers. The tenure of office of these officers must be, by nature, of their constitutional setup, in away protected so that they may feel quite free and uninfluenced by other Considerations or pressures like removal from office  so that they can discharge the duties of their office without fear or favour.Having said that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it does not mean they cannot be removed when	the time comes We will be seeingin a minute how or why it becomes necessary that they be removed But before I do that, I must say that in our Constitution we have Section 24 which gives the President the power of creating offices and the power of abolishing offices within the Republic and the power to make appointments to any of those offices and terminating any such appointmentsThat is vested as an absolute prerogative right rover and above even the officers I have mentioned.Mr. Speaker, Sir,	Section25(1) of the Constitution of Kenya reads as follows Save in so far as may be otherwise provided by this Constitution or by any other law,every person  who holds office in the service  of the Republic of Kenya  shall hold, it hat office during the pleasure of the  PresidentSo the holding of these public offices including the ones I have mentioned is at the pleasure Of the President. The President has that power of appointment creation of offices; abolition of offices and termination of all such appointments. That is very. fundamental in the Constitution.	 ~Having said that the main object? as will be seen in the Memorandum of Objects and Reasons is to restore the security of tenure for the judges the Attorney-General the Controller and Auditor-General and members of the Public Service Commission. You will remember that in 1986 and 1988 there were amendments which went a long way to reduce that security of tenure. The Constitution of Kenya.(Amendnient)Bill before the House sets out amendments to the Constitution which if this Parliament elects, will restore all the security of tenure for holders of these Constitutional offices which was removed in 1986 and 1988. The Bill therefore provides that the holders of these offices can only be removed from office for inability to perform the functions of their respective offices or for misbehaviours.Sir I would like to stress that the officers may be removed from office because of their inability to perform their duties illness and other reasonable causes or are guilty of misbehaviour. That removal will only be legal—if—recommen¬dations by a tribunal appointed by the President to investigate the matter recommen¬dations that such an officer be removed.Let me now take hon. Members to the case of the judge. The judges are appointed under Section 61 of the Constitution. The particular section reads as follows.61. (1) The Chief Justice shall be appointed by the President.	(2) The puisne judges shall be appointed by the Presidentacting in accordance with the advice of the Judicial 	Service Commission.(3) A person shall not be qualified to be appointed a judge of the High Court unless(a) he is or has been a judge of a court hav.ing unlimited jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters in some part of the Commonwealth or in the Republic of Ireland or a  court having jurisdiction in appeals from such a courts.Now, if the appointment is perfect,legal, and well under the Constitution then should the officer or judge become unable to discharge his office due to inability or performance that is to say, illness or matters connected to inability on, misconduct, he may be removed. I would like us to take Clause 3 of the Bill which talks of how. a judge, who has become unable to perform or is guilty of misconduct can be removed from his office.Clauses3 and 4, under Sections 61 and 62 of the Constitution make the provision which will of necessity, apply for removal  of a judge from his office. Let us look, at Clause 4 closely. A judge of the High Court may be removed from office only for inability to perform functions of his office, whether arising from infirmity of body or mind, or from any other cause, or from misbehaviour and shall not be removed except in accordance with this section.Section 62 (4) says, and I quote:  “A judge of the High Court shall be removed from office by the President if the question of his removal has been referred to a tribunal appointed under subsection (5) and the tribunal has recommended to the President that the judge ought to be removed from office for inability as aforesaid or for misbehaviour.”One has to note immediately that there has to be an extra body. If welook back, we note that the appointment is also by the President on therecommendation of the Judicial. Service Commission. Now, the question ofremoval will not be by recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission.It will be by another tribunal, that will be set up, and I will be tellingyou more about its set up.Under Section 62 (5), the Chief Justice is considered as follows“If the President considers that the question of removing the Chief Justice under this section ought to be investigated, or if the Chief Justice represents to the President that the question of removing a puisne judge under this section ought to be investigated, then	 (a) the President Shall appoint atribunal which shall consist of a chairman and not less than two other members	Selected in accordance with subsection (6) from among	Persons who hold or have held office as a judge of a	 court having unlimited jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters in some part of the Commonwealth or : 	a court having jurisdiction in appeals from such acourt."Let me explain that a little.I would like to explain that a little. During the colonial times, up to very recent time we used to have certain senior officers who had done a commendable legal servicer being. appointed during the colonial, times by Her Majesty the Queen and Queens counsels. The Queens appointments ended; we do not stem for Her Majesty’s Government and I may say that all the Queens counsels who existed in Kenya have all gone to rest, so we have no Queens counsels (QC)And I am happy to say that we will not be worried about the rank of a QC. Instead, the Advocate Act provided that the President in his own wisdom may consider lawyers who have contributed commendable service to this country and confer letters of appointment on them as Senior Counsels. So, in future, we expect to have those people and the President can appoint one or two of them to assist in the event that a judge has to be removed.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the tribunal, must met and inquire intomatters that it has to go in connection with the judge and thattribunal shall inquire into matters and report, on the facts thereofand recommend to the President whether the judge ought to be removedunder this section. You can see there is an extension now. Althoughwe still say that a judge holds his office at the pleasure of thePresident and that The President has the authority to either fireor hire a judge a tribunal has to be set to enquire into theinability of the judge or his misconducts and then report to thePresident for his removal or reinstatement. The Bill goes on to say what such judge will be doing during that time. Now, where the question of removing a judge from office has been referred to the tribunal, the President acting in accordance with advice of the ChiefJustice may suspend the judge from Exercising, the function of his office In any suspension may at time he revoked by thePresident acting inaccordance, with the advice of the Chief Justice and shall in any case take effect, if the tribunal recommends to the President that the judge, ought not to be removed so that there will be no embarrassments  whatsoever that a judge who is  subjected to the tribunal’s enquiry cannot perform his functions and must of necessity. With the recommendations of the Chief Justice be suspended until the inquiry, is over to recommend whether the judge must be removed or not.Mrs. Speaker, Sir, that is a very exhaustive procedure  which in itself upon security of tenure of judge sothat when they are acting or performing their duties as judges they can do so without favour of Fear of being removed or sacked immediately or molested by any other person, 	  Mr. Speaker, Sir I would like to recommend that to be the modelthat we are going to use in respect of the other constitutional	offices. It is very important to grasp this very important conceptthat is once a judge has been appointed he has that security often years in office by virtue of the fact that he cannot beremoved by any other means except by going through the exerciseof inquiry by the tribunal which would in turn recommend to thePresident. The President would then decide whether or not thejudge should continue to Perform his duties. So far we havedealt with the puisne judge. A puisne judge means the judge ofthe High Court. What about the Chief Justice himself. The firstthing. one would say about the Chief Justice is that he is a humanbeing just like anybody else. Therefore he can commit amisconduct and he can also fall sick and be unable to performhis duties. So we shall provide. For him under Clause 4 subsection(7). One other question arises as to whether the chief Justicehas become unable by reason of his physical or mental inabilityto exercise the functions of his office or whether his conductought to be investigated. In such a case the President shallappoint a tribunal consisting of five members	in a manner provided here down below namely:The tribunal appointed under subsection (7) shall consist of the following members(a)	a person who hold or has held office of Speaker of the National Assembly who shall be the chairman(b) two persons who hold or have held officeas judges of appeal(c) one per son upon whom the rank of Senior Counsel has been conferred by the President under section 17 of the Advocates Act 1989 and(d) the chairman of the Public Service Commission.Mr. Speaker Sir, as you can see  that will be a verypowerful tribunal and it will be the only tribunal that canrecommend to the President that the Chief Justice be removedfrom his officer either for being unable to perform his functionsor for having been proved guilty of a misconduct. That provisionwas not there before but it can been seen at the back of the draftBill. We are happy to  note that the Speaker of this House will also take part in that tribunal as the Chairman which will  recommend or not recommend the removal of the Chief Justicefrom his office for misconduct or his inability to perform histask.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, subsection (9) then concludes When the question of removing the Chief Justice has been referred to a tribunal under this section, he shall not exercise any of the functions of his office  pending the decision of the tribunal but he will resume those functions if the tribunal recommends to the President that  the Chief Justice ought not be removed from officeMr. Speaker Sir that is the exercise that will take place in respect of removal of the judge of the High Courtor the Chief Justice whichever the case  may be on the groundof misconduct or  inability to  perform the functions oftheir offices.It is my sincere hope that this House has grasped theactual concept of the removal of the puisne judges and the ChiefJustice. I do not intend to go through the same exercise in respect of all the other constitutional offices. However Iwould like to say that in the subsequent clauses where it becomesnecessary to amend the same tribunal would be used to deal withthese offices. Let us take for instance the members of thePublic Service Commission. We know that the  Members ofthe Public Service Commission are appointed for  three yearsand their constricts are subject to renewal after the expiry ofthe three year period. However in between the appointmentand the expiry of there. contract, it may become, necessary to remove a member of the Public Service on the ground of misconduct or inability to perform his duties. The procedure  to be followed again will be similar to that applied to the judges. Therefore, there will be a tribunal but this time, the tribunal will be headed by a person who will have held the office of  a judge of the High Court or a judge, of appeal or a Senior counsel. This tribunal will perform the same function as inthe case of a judge and will recommend to the President whether or not a Member of the Public Service Commission should be removed from office.Mr. Speaker, Sir, from there, we shall move on to deal With other offices which I mention earlier on. One of these offices is the Office of the Attorney-General. When dealing with the office of the Attorney-General, we should not think that the Attorney-General is Mr. Muli. This, is an institution and although at the time being ,the Attorney-General is incumbent of the office, is moving this will. However, I would like to inform hon. Members that I am not scared whatsoever in moving this Bill. As I said, some three or four years ago, when we removed the securityof tenure, I am not considering myself ,but the office itself.Mr. Speaker Sir coming to the removal of the Attorney General, I would like to say that here again, the same procedure as in the case of a judge will apply, that is to say, as provided  under Clause 6, subsection (5):“The Attorney-General may be removed   from office only for inability to exercise the functions of his office (whether arising from, infirmity of body or mind or any other  cause) or for misconduct, and shall not be removed except in accordance with this section”The Clause goes on to say:	Mr. Speaker, Sir clause 6, (c) (6) says:“The Attorney-General shall be removed from office by the President if the question of his   removal from office has been referred to a tribunal appointed under subsections (7)and the tribunal has 	recommended to the President that he ought to beremoved for inability as aforesaid or for misbehaviour.”So, a tribunal has to be setup to inquire into matters connected with theremoval of the Attorney-General.Clause 6 (c) (7) says: If the President considers that the question of removing the Attorney—General under this section ought to be investigated, then(a) the President shall appoint a tribunal which  shall consist of a chairman and four other members selected by the President from amongperson(i) who hold or have held the office as judge of the High Court or judge of appeal or_ (ii)  who are qualified to be appointed as judges  _of the High Court under section 61 (3) or(iii)  upon whom the rank, of Senior Counsel has _  been conferred by the President under section 17 of the Advocates Act, 1989 and  	(b) the tribunal shall inquire into the matter andreport on the facts thereof to the President and recommend to him whether the Attorney—General   ought to be removed under this section.Clause 6 (c) (8) says:—If the question of removing the Attorney-General has been referred to a tribunal under this section, the President may suspend the Attorney-General from the exercise of the functions of his office and any such suspension may at any time be revoked by the President, and shall in any case cease to have effect if the tribunal recommends to the President that the Attorney General should not be removed.In essence, that, clause runs right through judges, members of the Public ServiceCommission, the Attorney-General and the Controller and Auditor—General. Clause 7 (b) (3) says:Subject to subsection (5), the Controller and 	Auditor-General shall vacate his office when he attainssuch age as may be prescribed by Parliament.	Clause 7. (c) (4) says:	  	 		"A person holding the office of Controller andAuditor-General may; be removed from office only for inability to discharge the functions of his office	 (whether arising from infirmity of body or mind or any other, cause) or. Form is behaviour, and shell not be so removed except in accordance with this section."The tribunal to recommend the removal of the Controller and Auditor-General willinclude a judge of the High Court of a judge of appeal or a person qualified tobe appointed, as a judge and a senior counsel as provided for under the "AdvocatesAct.	Having dealt with these offices, I do not think I would be of any muchassistance except to commend this Bill to the House. We have gone through it inthe past and we are now going through it once again. As I said, if hon.-Memberstake the concept of removal from office in one case and apply it to the rest ofthe offices, there will be no difficult. If it becomes necessary to remove fromoffice judges of the High Court, the Attorney-General, the Controller and Auditor-General or members, of the Public Service Commission, the President will be advisedin the case of the Attorney—General by the Chief Justice. The same will apply tothe Controller and Auditor—General. The composition of the tribunal to makerecommendations to the President is slightly different in various cases, and Irequest hon. Members to familiarise themselves with the provisions of the Bill.In any event, these people will not perform the functions of their offices duringThe time of inquiry or suspension.This is a healthy Bill which conforms with the Saitoti Committee asrecommended in the report presented during the Kanu Delegates Conference. Itwas difficult to say one thing or the other, but there is now jurisdiction hereto solve that problem. Nevertheless the Saitoti Committee noticed that therewas need to return the security of tenure of these people and the Presidentdirected that this be done. That is why we are now formalising that sort of lacuna which came in our Constitution rather inadvertently, if I may soIn conclusion, I recommend this Bill to hon. Members. With the permission of the House, we hope to go to the next stage of the procedure today.So, I beg to move, hoping that I will be seconded by His Excellency the Vice President and Minister for Finance.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE VICE PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR FINANCE (Prof. Saitoti): Mr. Speaker Sir. I beg to second this Bill that has been moved by the Attorney General in respect of amending the Constitution! of Kenya The Attorney-General has been very comprehensive in his exposition of the objectives of this Bill. I Will, therefore, not take time unnecessarily to go through all these things. It suffices to say that the Has Been brought here is essentially to restoreConstitutional offices That is the rest orate of security of tenure far the members of the judiciary, the office of the Attorney-General, the office of the Controller and Auditor-General, members of the Electoral Commission and. the members of the Public Service Commission.	 I am sure the hon. Members will recall that we had earlier dealtwith an amendment to this particular aspect of the Constitution some time back When we moved that amendment, which was unanimously approved by the National Assembly,  we did so due to the original structuring of that position because it was seen by the hon. Members to be completely outdated. It made it extremely difficult to discipline those particular members holding constitutional offices. This country was being subjected to having to resort to drawing members from outside this country.The reason why that decision was taken by the national Assembly was to remove something that was completely irrelevant to up—to-date Kenya. We are an Independent country and, therefore, decisions should be made here. Even much more important is the fact that the President of the Republic ofKenya should lead this country in accordance with the * wishes of the people that he leads. That was fundamentally the position. Unfortunately, that amendment was misconstrued in various circles. Indeed, a propaganda campaign, was wedged against this country. We know it is a part of a major propaganda campaign to damage the image of this country. An impression was created that because we had amended that particular aspect of the Constitution relating to the tenure, of those constitutional offices, the judges, for that matter, could not adjudicate with fair conscience. It was felt that theywere insecure in their positions.This propaganda was pushed, even further that the judges, intheir process of work, were subjected to the influence of the Executive. We all know that was a lie. We do not know of. Any judge at all who was ever removed by the President because he failed to comply with the Presidential directives. We do not know of any instance when the President  has ever influenced, any decision by the, judge as a result of that particular amendment (applause)It was also construed that as a result of that amendment, theAttorney-General could not be in a position to give proper legal advice .to the Governments, it was, then argued that such an Attorney-General was   insecure and was, therefore, always acting under the dictates of the President and the Executive and that everything he did was meant to suit the Executive. We work with the Attorney-General in this House and we follow his work. I am sure no member of the public has ever complained in this country that the Attorney-General has been influenced to take a certain decision against his conscience. I challenge one to come up with an example.It was even further argued that because the provision withrespect to the office of the Controller and Auditor-General was also amended,and since he had to expose, certain irregularities in respect of Government expenditure, he would lose his job. Therefore, the accountability of public funds was not transparent. This National Assembly is in receipt every year of the Report of the Controller and Auditor-General. It is known that if youpick any one of them and you flip through various pages, you will see wherethe Controller and Auditor-General has criticized certain aspects of theexpenditure. He has been very explicit on this one. I am sure, that the hon.Members are aware of this since they have always debated the Report of theController and Auditor-General exhaustively. Where necessary, the hon. Members have offered their criticisms which have always been published widely. That In itself gives a lie to the propaganda.		 I would like to take this, opportunity to thank the Presidentfor his recent directive that security  of  tenure in respect of those offices be restored as contained in this amendment. 	 (applause)  That directive was made by the President in his characteristic wisdom, foresight and statesmanship that he has demonstrated throughout his leadership. This has continued to make this country stronger and stronger.We want the whole world to know that the President decided to make thatDirective not because those criticisms were there but because he saw the pace at	Which this country Was moving. 	We want the whole world to know that the role of the ChiefJustice and judges in this country is separate. The principle of theseparation of the Judiciary is fairly clear. It is enshrined in cur. Constitution and we want them to know that the Executive does not in anyway influence the decisions of the judges or the Chief Justice. We want to make it transparent in this particular document today:  Equally, we wantto make it explicit and transparent that the Attorney-General who is also thedirector of public prosecution is not threatened in any way. He has neverbeen threatened in any way in the discharge of his day to day duties.At the same time, we want it to be seen also by the whole worldthat the Controller and Auditor-General should be in a position to undertakehis work without any fear. I would like to make it clear that he has alwaysdone so in spite of the lie.(applause)Essentially, we want it to be known that Kenya has got nothing to hide. It conducts its affairs in an open manner be it its public affairs, discharge of   justice, public expenditure and so on. Things are done in an explicit manner. It is for that reason that in his own wisdom, His Excellency the President saw it fit to restore the security of tenure of these	Particular offices and it is not under any pressure that we are doing this. We are an independent country. Mr. Speaker Sir, this change ore amendment should  also be seen within the same context of the manner in which Kenyans deliberated on the various reforms under the able Chairmanship of His Excellency the President I hope that hon. Members will join me ,in congratulating  commending His Excellency the President for the able manner in which he chaired the two day session of the Kanu Review Committee. If anything was demonstrated to the whole world in the last two days, it is the freedom of expression which exists in this country. It was also the maturity of our people that counted most to be able to look at the various problems and to discuss the matters and debate them freely and in a mature manner.Mr. Speaker, Sir I also personally want to thank the 3,600delegates who demonstrated to the whole world that Kenya is an independed country that Kenya is a mature country and that Kenyans are able to sit down together and in a very open manner be able To debate issues and arrive at unanimous conclusions. Above all, Kenyans yesterday afternoon demonstrated To The whole world The confidence That they have in His Excellency The President. I do not think there was any doubt about That. We were able To rally behind His Excellency The President and To demonstrate our confidence in his leadership we Told The whole world That we stand firmly behind The President because he knows that any path That he charts for us is for The betterment of This nation. That message was clear and we hope That those foreign correspondent is who, for a number of months have tried to paint a negative image, that this country	ris a totalitarian regime, have now seen  that is not the case at all . And  I want Compose , the following question: Had Kenya been	a totalitarian country as has been alleged, before, could we then  	have set up the Kanu Review: Committee to listen to the peopleIf we were a totalitarian regime then we would have been afraid  to go all over the country, and listen to the people because no totalitarian regime cares at all about the views of the people.Mr. Speaker, Sir, had we been a totalitarian regime as our detractors always like Co depict us, could we Chen have had a conference like the one  which was chaired by His  Excellency for thelast two days in the open and people allowed to debate issues openlyand in a free atmosphere? We want those foreign correspondents to 	tell us where, elsewhere in Africa, this has been done. And weknow that that has never been the case before in many other parts of the world. We hope that our friends, the various foreigners, wil1 understand that whatever decisions we are making in this august  	House are made to mirror the feelings and the wishes of the Kenyan people. That is important. We want them also to take note that whatever we decided for the last two days were the wishes of the Kenyans and they should respect us for that.So, in the same spirit, Sir, I want to commend the Attorney General for having moved very fast in preparing this amendment. And since all hon. Members know the basis of this amendment, I hopethe House will be able to pass this particular Bill without taking too much time. I believe that the issues at stake are clear. We	are going back to where we were but, even much more important, weare also making sure that we are refining our situation because we can no longer go back to the so-called Commonwealth countries: Itis just important that the tribunal, consisting of a chairmanand members who are fairly distinguished in their own careers arethe ones who will be able to determine the worthiness of a judge an attorney-general a controller and auditor general and any  other officer of that category in the event of some misdeeds.  Speaker Sir I urge hon. Members to deliberate on this Bill expeditiously and to understand that this is something that we are doing as part of our own reforms. And as I have said the reforms that we are undertaking are the ones' that are conceived by Kenyans. They are the reforms that we wish and we do not want them to be imposed upon us. Just like we said here the other day Kenya is not on sale independence is not on sale either.We shall accept the assistance from our friends and we thank them,but we are not going to be willing to trade our independence forbondage.With those few remarks Mr. Speaker Sir I beg to second the Bill.</Newspeech>(Question proposed)<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Biwott): Mr. Speaker Sir I rise to support this amendment which has become a subject of many a writing either in the law reports international papers or every other form of agitation without necessarily explaining exactly what the problem was and what the situation is at this parti¬cular moment.Mr. Speaker. Sir it is easy for people to convenientlyride over a vehicle for purposes other than the genuine reasons for the movement of that particular vehilce. In our case whe we amended the Constitution. in 1986 in respect of the Attorney-General and the Controller and Auditor-general there was never a sinister motive in that amendment. It was an amendment that was intendedto bring into line, what obtained elsewhere. If you look at the    Constitution of Kenya, Sections 24 and 25, you will find that the  Power for hiring and hiring is vested in the President. Section  24 states, in part, that:-			“Subject to the Constitution and any otherlaw, the powers of constituting and abolishing offices for the Republic of Kenya, or	" *making appointments to any such office and terminating any such appointment shall vest	in the President".So, there is no doubt as to who does the appointments. When youlook at the position of the Attorney-General, we find that in the earlier Constitution which everybody has been talking about the appointment For example, in the case of the Chief Justice, Section62(1)states that the Chief Justice shall be appointed by the President That is all.The President decides to appoint Mr. X as the Chief Justice andhe is so: appointed, and he, becomes the Chief  Justice.  Likewise,the President appoints the Attorney-General in the same manner. He decides: that Mr. So-and-So shall become, the Attorney-General.And he becomes the Attorney-General. He also decides in theConstitution, as it was originally without, any amendments, thatHe wants somebody, to become the Controller and Auditor-Generaland so he becomes. The same goes, for the Chairman of the PublicService Commission. Those are the Constitutional. Offices thatare appointed directly by the President Right from the beginning,the President has been the sole arbiter as to who becomes , the Chief Attorney-General the Controller and Auditor-General, and the Chair¬man of the Public Service Commission. That part of the Constitu¬tion has not been amended.However, what we did at that particular time was to remove them. Obnoxious sections that subjected this country into a role of insurbordination. That was ridiculous in the eyes of everybody. We had to go to other countries to seek for members of a tribunal to come and advise our President as to how he should remove an individual he had, by virtue of Section 24 of our Constitution, appointed to a particular office. In fact, that meant that our own people were incapable of deciding the fate of a public officer who enjoys Constitutional protection. That also underrated usbecause it meant that we, as Kenyans, did not have Judges, orpeople who were impartial and genuine citizens of this country.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will read the relevant section that made us at that particular time amend the Constitution, although.  it was subsequently amended in 1989. This concerns the appointment ofthe Chief Justice. This is Section 65(5), and I quote: —	  “The President; shall appoint a Tribunal that   will consist of a Chairman and not less than twoother members selected in accordance with Section  Sis from among persons who hold or have held office as a Judge of a Sourt having unlimited jurisdiction  	in civil and criminal matters in some parts of theCommonwealth; or a Court having jurisdiction appealsfrom such Courts”..		It was that aspect that we had to remove and make KenyaA place where we enjoy the same sovereign privilege as others do. We amended the Constitution at that particular time. We left theremoval, of a Judge the Attorney-General and the Chairman of the  Public Service Commission silent. We did not say that the President shall remove a person at will, as we were unequivocal in the appointment We just said that the President shall appoint; the Chief Justice, the Chairman of the Public Service Commission and the Attorney-General. We just left it at that. We just defined the duties and left it at that.Therefore, this became a fertile seedbed for those people who want to insinuate everything evil about this country; for those people who see nothing good in this country; for those people who think that the more they please the outsiders the more their fortunes grow, and for the people who have no particular regard for this country. Those people exploited this section.Let us look at the section in practice, Mr. Speaker. In practice, there has never been harassment of the Attorney General, Judge, the Controller and Auditor-General or the Chair¬man of the Public Service Commission. If anything, the President has continued working as if the section dealing with the Tribunal never existed at all, and it was so assumed. The President has been fair. The President, as we know him, is a man who loves justice, other people and also a man who cares about other people’s welfare. He is a man who is never arbitrary in his judgment.So, we could not have doubted his integrity. In fact,if Kenyans doubted the integrity of the President, they would nothave elected him unanimously as the President of this country.There is so much trust in him that we know that everything he doesIs just and fair, and never ever fictitious. This has been thePractice. But in order to ashame the devil and also to allay .any fears and to lay in state any possible seed so that that evilseed shall never germinate again; we are now writing it and spelling it out clearly that there shall be a Tribunal composed of Judges.   I believe we had Judges in the past too. So, that Tribunal willadvise the President on the question, of removal of Chief Justice.,the Attorney-General, the Chairman of the Public Service Commissionand so on. This is what we are trying to do today. We are trying to create in our Constitution a provision whereby a Tribunal In fact, I will read the relevant section that may actually crystallize  the work before us today. I hope that everybody will understand. It says, and I quote:“When the question of removing ;the Chief Justice_ I am taking the Chief Justice as an example, but the rest applies equally; the same provision applies  has been referred to a tribunal under this section he shall not exercise any of the functions of his office pending the decision of the tribunal; but, he will resume those functions if the tribunal recommends to the President that the Chief Justice ought not to be removed from office.If, after the due deliberations, the tribunal finds that the Chief Justice should not be removed from office, they should . report the same and the same shall hold. But if they decide that he should be removed, he shall be removed.  The President Will have been protected from the kind of accusations that everybody, is trying to level at him. However; let me say that it is only those people with that kind of mentality, people who can never.protect anybody, people who are arbitrary in their own nature and people with sinister motive that think that the President  will be removing people at will because of dictatorial authority.Mr. Speaker,  Sir, all of us were present at Sasarani  and I think everybody saw how the President conducted the conference It was very democratic; it was not dictatorial at all. That is how Kenyans govern themselves and that, is how the President has been conducting the  affairs of this country with all due diligence and care for our people.So, Mr. Speaker, Sir,	appeal to the hon. Members todeliberate fully and understand	clearly what the provisions of thisSill are for. We are trying to stem the arrogance..and the diseasethat those who have been publicizing and damaging the name of this country have been using. They have been accusing our President of removing people from their positions at Trill, but there was never a provision for the President to remove people from their positions at will. Everything rested on Sections 24 and 25 of our Constitution which empowers the President to appoint people to those offices; we know that the President never thought of removing people from their positions.I think today will be a sad day for those who have been thriving on this particular aspect of our seas Constitution: We will plug that loophole so that they will never dream more about it. We hope that if they are sincere they will now forget maligning the name of this country and change to support their motherland the country they ought to be defending all their lives.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIRUKA-OWTJOR: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to contribute to this important Bill However, before I say anything about it I would like to take this opportunity and join my colleagues in congratulating his Excellency the President for the manner in which the Kanu special delegates conference was conducted. I would also like to thank his Excellency the Vice President and Minister for Finance for having piloted the Committee which enabled the delegates to meet with a successful outcome.In supporting this Bill I have one or two observations tomake. Kenya has, no doubt, demonstrated clearly that it is ademocratic society based on the rule of law. Now the rule of law hashigh prices to be paid. First of all, one of the fundamental requirement is that there should be independence of the judiciary.and I congratulate the hon. Attorney-General for introducing this Bill in the House. We debated this matter in 1983 and, as thehon. Deputy Leader of Government Business has said, there was agood reason for amending the Constitution at that time: There wasa provision which required that  a tribunal composed of peoplefrom all over the Commonwealth be constituted to recommend the removal of a judge;that provision was repugnant to our Independence. I would thus saythat the 1938 Constitutional amendment was fully justified.Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the debate on the 1988Constitutional amendment I cautioned that you cannot have a democratic society based on the rule of law unless there, is provision forthe independence of the judiciary. I would like to re-emphasisethat the security of tenure for judges is fundamental to the veryexistence and operation of a democratic society based on the ruleof law. Cases come before judges where a an ordinary mwananchi the so called the underdog face the mighty, which may be aMinister, a senior Government officer or even the Government itself. So,the judge has to be fully satisfied that he will not be in anyway affected as a result of his decision. This will enable him to actwith full conscience.In a democratic society based on the rule of law thereshould also be a free and unmolested legal profession. At thisjuncture I should say that I know that many members of the legal profession are patriotic and supportive of the Government, the President and Kanu. There may be cases of one or two dissident legal professionals, but those are found in all sectors: among the church and among an other people. So, that one person is a dissident does not warrant the whole community to be  lumped as being anti-Government. So, it is important thatthe hon. Attorney-General emphasises that there should be a free legal profession. He should also establish communication between the legal profession and the Government to eliminate misunderstanding. Recently the Law Society of Kenya visited his Excellency the President at State House and had very useful discussion with him, which was good for both the country and the society.Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I pointed out, the 1988 Constitutional amendment was introduced because of the provision which required the establishment of a tribunal composed of people from the Commonwealth; this negated our Independence. Otherwise, I would like to state that so far  I am speaking from my knowledge there has never been interference with the judiciary. I have been associated with the legal profession and the judiciary for a long time and I know that there has never been interference. The hon. the Chief Justice recently said in Nyeri that there has never been interference with the work of the courts and I would like toconfirm this. I have myself worked as a judge in charge of Western Province and I was never interfered with; and the Government ought to be commended for this.Turning to the Bill itself, if you look at Clause. 4(3) of the Bill; you will find that it states as follows:A judge of the High Court may_ be: removed from office only for inability to perform the functions of his office (whether arising frominfirmity of body or mind or from any other cause) or for misbehaviour, and shall not be removed  except in accordance with this section.Mr. Speaker, Sir, removing   a Judge of the High Court fromoffice is not a light matter. A Judge plays a very important role inour society. So, this provision here is not an adequate provision.I say this because the egression any other cause is not clear tome. Also misbehaviour should be explained. What constitutesmisbehaviour? It should be clear when there is a move to remove aJudge. We should be told clearly the grounds upon which aJudge can be removed. It is said that all that is required is forthe Chief Justice to make representation to the President. In mysubmission, that is not sufficient What will happen if theChief Justice runs berserk or becomes deranged or for any reason hehas got a grudge against a Judge? Will it be enough for him tomake representations to the President so that the Judge is removed?As I pointed out earlier, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question ofremoving a Judge from office is not a light matter. For all that Iknow if there is a move to remove a Judge and at the end of the dayit is found that he was not at fault, such a Judge may not wish tocontinue working again. So, what I am suggesting here is that thegrounds upon which it may be sought to remove a Judge fromoffice must be specified; they Should be known; not because he hasgot a grudge against the..Chief Justice and then the Chief Justicemake representations to the President and as tribunal is constitutedto look into the activities of the Judge...What I am saying is that the grounds upon which it is sought toremove a Judge from office must he specified. It is not enough to just say for any other cause. There must be clear grounds The alleged misbehavior must be clearly spelt out what the Judge has done to warrant representation being made to the  President.</Newspeech><Newspeech>The Assistant Minister For Lands And Housing(Mr. Mutiso):  On a point, of order. Mr. Speaker Sir. I think the hon. Member on the Floor is misrepresenting the Sill. I say this because the grounds of removing Judges and these other gentlemen from office are specified here in the Bill. Why is the hon. Member complaining that this provision is not there?MR. MIRUKA-OWUOR: I thank you, Mr.	Mutiso, for yourenthusiasm, but I would like you to listen to me. What I am saying is that the provision here says infirmity of body or mind or for any other cause. What is	any other cause? What ismisbehaviour?Assuming that the Judge! Does not say “Hello” to the Chief Justice? That may constitute misbehaviour in some cases. There must be a clear provision here. This is because a Judge is an important person discharging a vital, role in the society. You should not seek to disturb him without good grounds. That is all I am appealing for Somebody may not like a Judge for deciding a case, in one way or the other. Also Clause 4(5) states:If the  _ Chief Justice represents to the President that the question of removing a puisine judge under this section ought to be investigatedMr. Speaker, Sir ,I am also submitting here, that this provision is inadequate. There Must be clear grounds as to why the  Chief justice wants a judge to removed from, office. The President, before appointing atribunal, ought to be satisfied that there is really a ground to remove, that judge from office That is what I am appealing for.	   The other point that , I want to touch on is that when His  Excellency the President is satisfied that a tribunal ought be appointed to investigate the conduct of a judge This Bill does.  not provide the rights of the judge before the tribunal the judge who is accused., What are his rights? Is he free to appear by aLegal representatives.?Is he going to submit his memorandum in response to the accusations? Furthermore the tribunal will deliberate on the matter they may find that the judge should be removed or reinstated If they find that the judge should be removed what are remedies  open to the judge? Can he appeal to any other court? Can he appeal to the President? There is no provision to cater for this.	The Bill is silent onthis matter. So, this is a matter which ought to be looked at.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to comment on Clause 4(7). I notice that there are a lot of spelling mistakes here. I will read a part of this clause to the House.Where the question arises as whether There isa mistake here. I believe it should read Where the question as to whether the Chief Justice has become unable by reason of physical or mental infirmity to exercise the functions of  his office, or that his conduct ought to be investigated, then the President shall appoint a tribunal consisting of five, members appointed by him in the _manner provided 	under subsection (8)Mr. Speaker, Sir I would also  like to say that this Clause leaves a lot to be desired There and how does the  question arise  The Chief justice is an important employee of the Government There must  be a clear provision as to where and how the question arises.. There Should be a clear provision in relation to that. This provision relates to the hon. Attorney-General as well and also to the members of the Public Service Commission. The provision here reads :“Subject to subsection (6) the Attorney General shall  vacate his office, when he attains such age as maybe prescribed by Parliament.”Mr.Speaker,Sir, I do not know whether Parliament has .prescribed when the Attorney-General is going to leave office. Why is there no provision for it now? What I am saying is that the age at which the Attorney-General may vacate office should be provided if there is need to change it. Apart from this one the provisions relate to Judges, Members of the Public Service Commission what I am objecting to is that there is a vague provision relating to the grounds upon which a judge may be sought to be removed from office. I am appealing to the Attorney-General to consider providing clear provisions regarding theseissues. We are making laws for posterity; not for today’s use only. This amendment is coming only about two years after the previous amendment because perhaps we did not consider the implications. In relation to that I would appeal to the Attorney-General to move very slowly regarding the amendments to our Constitution. It has got to be considered and reconsidered before it is rushed.So. Instead of rushing such a Bill it must be considered several times and weighed so that all shades of opinions from wananchi are incorporated in the amendments.With those few observations, I would like to say that I am in support of this Bill, which shows the good intentions of the republic as was demonstrated yesterday at the Kanu Delegates meeting at Kasarani. I am only appealing that we have a Clear provision related to the reasons why a  judge can be removed from office. We can see a situation where the Chief Justice, or somebody else, may victimise a judge. The mere representation to the President should, warrant an appointment of a tribunal That is what I am objecting to. I am saying that there should be grounds specified in the Bill, which could be communicated to His Excellency the President, who will have to be satisfied that there are such grounds, upon which he will appoint a tribunal. Now, before the tribunal is appointed, such a judge should not be removed but should be given full opportunity and, if possible,, represented by a legal counsel. Following the outcome of the tribunals findings, the judge should be given, an opportunity to appeal</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): On a point of information, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think the hon. Member has repeated himself about four times on this particular case. The hon. Member is a lawyer and is aware of the rule of justem generisu (?)  For instance, if a man disappears from our country and goes to Europe, while still on our payroll, that absence must be read in the rule I have referred to. I think the hon. Member is aware of that. The ages of the Attorney-General and the Controller and Auditor-General have not been fixed by an Act of Parliament. Those are provided for. In the absence of that, retirement age of any other civil servant would apply to them. However, for the judges, the age of retirement is 74 years.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIRUKAOWUOR:  What I am suggesting, Sir, is that there is an intention in this Bill to give the Attorney-General longer time. We under-stand that civil servants retire on attainment of 55 years. However, he hasbrought this quietly because he wants the period £o be extended I am suggesting to him that this is the right moment to extend it. If the Attorney-General is working well he should continue to begin office up to the age of 70. With regard to the justem generisu (?) rule, I would like to suggest that my appeal is still valid. What I am submitting is that there should be no move to remove a judge from his office without specified grounds. That should not be left that vaguely. It must be spelt out what the judge has done, which is deemed wrong. When we talk of misbehaviour, misbehaviour is not beyond human imagination and, the Attorney-General should tell us what constitutes misbehaviour. If I may cite an example I have known, a judge in this country Civil Service rules stipulate that all civil servants report at 8.00 a.m. in the morning, but this judge used to report to his office at 9.00 a.m. and leave the office at 1.00 p.m. When statistics were taken, it was found out that this particular judge used to do more work than those judges who would go to their offices at 8.00 a.m. and leave at 4.00 p.m. In other words, I am suggesting that’s the judge who works for three hours per day may be considered to be misbehaving when the output of his work is more than the one who is in the office between 8.00 a.m. and 4.00 p.m. . There should be a clear provision, therefore, as what constitutes misbehaviour.With those few remarks, I support the Bill.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to air my views on the amendments, brought through this Bill. To start with I would like to say that we are very thankful to His Excellency the President for having felt the need to bring this amendment. I know there have been divisions in the country regarding that problem. We should, therefore,  thank the President for having accepted this idea Before I make my contribution let me say that I am also, very grateful for His Excellency the President for the manner in which he conducted the Kanu Delegates meeting which ended yesterday.	Sir, the meeting ended very well and congratulate all the teams which attended, all the delegates as well as the team lead by the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for the recomnendations that were brought to the meeting. Let me say that I congratulate the Saitoti Committee, because the security of tenure of Members of  Parliament was not guaranteed. By saying so, you were always under threat that at any time Kanu can meet at the district level and decide that a certain hon. Member be kicked out of the Kanu Party, and he be kicked. So, in view of the fact that disciplinary action of removal of hon. Members from the Party has been removed, I must say that I am very grateful to the Saitoti Committee There was a tendency of using shortcuts, to undermine hon. Members who were not liked by certain individuals.  I am one of those hon. Members who were saved from such action. That was only because I was alleged to be saying irrele¬vant things in this House. I am grateful that I am now safe from such action. Most of us here used to live under fear.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am saying so because we are guaranteeing the tenure of office of some individuals in the House Our tenure was also threatened, but we are happy that it is now secure. We are talking about the tenure of office of the Controller and Auditor-General, the Attorney-General, judges and members of the Public Service Commission. While we agree that we should protect the Cont¬roller and Auditor-General, it appears as if we will never appreciate his work in this House, or that the country does not appreciate the work of the Controller and Auditor-General. This is because the wonderful reports that he writes are always discussed by the Public. Accounts Committee and brought to the House, but we never see any action being taken against those who are mentioned therein.(applause)Time has come when we should take action and even prosecute those who are recommended to the House for such action or to be surcharged by the Cont  roller and Auditor-General.	   Also talking about the security of the judges we are very grateful but, let me tell my 1earned friend the Attorney-General that the conditions under which judges serve are hot all that1 good because we can see that it is the same old High Court building in Nairobi which has been there since the attainment of Independence from which they are operating. I am calling upon the. Attorney-General to ensure that the conditions of the High Court are improved to make sure? that the judges are working under favourable conditions. Let me also appeal that the Attorney-General improves the secretarial services in the courts and to ensure that there are up to date law reports.Sir as of now lawyers do not normally have up to date law reports. While they should be printed every year there is a backlog of about 10 years which has not been printed. This is because there has not been any monetary provision to have the law reports printed. So judges and lawyers would do  their job better if these law reports regarding the important judgements that have been passed in our courts were in proper records and that all the lawyers have access. What happens now is that lawyers rely on veryoutdated law reports. If we want to improve the legal services we shouldnot only look at their tenure of office but also to make the terms to be conducive so that they know exactly what they are doing.Mr. Speaker, Sir I now come to Clause 6 whichtalks  about the tenure of office of the Attorney-GeneralAlthough this Bill was drafted on the 14th November this yearIt was a the only the other day that we had the Report of theKanu Review Committee and it appears that the recommendationsof this Committee and this amendment Bill are not in line withregard to the office of the Attorney-General If you lookat page 66ofitheKanuReviewCommittee Report they talkspecifically about the office of the Attorney-general andother constitutional offices In the case of the AttorneyGeneral this Report says as follows;  In the Case of the Attorney-General it was suggested that a political section of the office should be separated from the nonpolitical section This will necessitate the appointment of either a Minister for Justice or the creation of the office of the Director  of Public Prosecution who would exercise the  powers conferred on the Attorney-General by section  26 of the Constitution of Kenya; This would lead the Attorney-General to exercise his other role as a Members of Parliament and a Cabinet MinisterMr. Speaker Sir here there is an anomaly about this officeof the Attorney-General in that it is the only officer wherethe holder is an executive a Member of the Judicial ServiceCommission a Cabinent Minister and Member of this House Sothe idea of separation of powers does not apply to the officeof the Attorney-General and this is why I am saying that thissection is very anomalous What the Report says is thatthe holder of this officer should either be a politician inwhich case he could be appointed a Cabinet Minister as to holdthe office of the Minister for Justice or be entirely in chargeof prosecution and hold the office of the Director of PublicProsecution I would like to take this opportunity to appeal tothe Government to carefully review this position becauseWe have had some misuse of this office in the past. We all rememberA time when Members of this House were not at peace because any 	time they spoke their mind , they used to be threatened with    prosecution. Although I know that this is not happening, we all remember when it used to happen. Therefore, if in future we have an Attorney-General who likes misusing powers, as the Attorney-General we once used to have in this He public, this   could happen again. For this reason, I am appealing to the  Government to seriously look into this matter so that, we can have an  Attorney-General—who advised the Government oil legal matters as the Minister for Justice. This means that the other task of prosecution would be left to somebody else who would be completelyimpartial.		 —Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know that at the time that this 	Report was that this Bill was being drafted this Report had not 	been made, public, but now that is has been made public, it should  be consulted. I am saying this because we would like to see in   future an Attorney-General and a Director of Public Prosecutioneach playing a different role. On the other hand, we wouldlike to have an ft him Attorney-General who would be answerable to this House and who will be appointed when a new Parliament comes into office. I am saying this because we have an anomalous situation whereby all the Ministers are appointed at the beginning  	of a new Parliament, but the Attorney-General continues unchanged.Since the Attorney-General holds the powers of a Cabinet Minister, there is no reason, whatsoever as to why he should not be   appointed whenever a new Parliament comes into office. That would be a very logical thing to do. I am not talking about any. particular. individual but about the office of the Attorney-General.I hope that the Government is seriously going to look into this matter.Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the other hand, while we all agreethat the office of the Attorney-General is a very important; office.I would appeal to the Attorney-General to make sure that in, future, when he presents Bills in this House, to make sure that he has done, a thorough scrutiny of the Bills. He could possible    appoint a committee of the Members of this House to discuss the  Bill in advance. I am saying this because when we were discussing  the Land Tribunals Bill, we noticed that there, was a lot of embarrassment to the Attorney-General. This is because the Bill was very poorly drafted.  So, we would like the Attorney-General to be more prepared when he comes here to present his Bills, because we would not like to see the kind of embarrassment that we witnessed a few days ago. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have stalked quite a lot about	_	_The security of tenure of office of the judges, I would like to appeal tothe judges to be careful in their private and social lives,not to discuss matters that would prejudice, their positions.We would like our judges to continue in the way they have beencarrying themselves. I am saying this because it is possiblefor a judge to be tempted into doing things that could be prejudicial to their offices. I am saying this because judges are humanbeings like us  While I am not saying that they have doneso in the past, I am only saying that they could easily be attempted to carry themselves in a way that could be detrimental to theiroffice. They could even go to the extent of discussing caseswith the parties involved. If a judge visits a night club andmisbehaved there, that would obviously be a misconduct on partof the judge which would warrant his removal.Mr.Speaker, Sir, as one of my hon.colleagues said earlier on, we would like the Attorney-General to give some form of guidance to these tribunals as to what constitutes a misbehaviour by the judge. I am saying this because if the situation is left as open as it now is, perhaps the tribunal would becalled. Upon to start investigations on a very trivial matter and this would not be in the interest of justice. So, I think  the Attorney-General should specify the kind of misconduct to be investigated.	 Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me say that it is my sincere hope. That Government has listened to our views very carefully and those expressed in the Kanu Review Committee, namely that we need the separation of powers of the Attorney-General into two offices. We need the office of a civil servant and another for a politician.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Dr. Godana): Thank you very  much Mr. Speaker? Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this Bill. First and it foremost, may I take this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency the President for the manner in which the Party’s Delegate Conference was conducted over the last two days. I would also, like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Committee, for having done a thorough reportand submitted a wonderful Report.  I say this because in a sense this Bill, which His Excellency the President directed earlier on be brought to the House is a part of the new spirit of reconciliation and self—reexamination which, under the able leadership of His Excellency the president the country has embarked on.Having said that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would now like to turn to the provisions of the Bill itself. All sovereign states have the right to decide what law is best for themselves. When we became independent we had. bestowed upon us alegal system by the colonial power which departed, and that system had certain in—built inhibitions. Among them was the concern by the departing colonial power that young societies like ours may not be mature enough to be given freedom of legislation in total. So,this power brought into the Constitution certain, restrictions on our freedom to determine the terms of service of: particular officials the security of this service, and so on, in terms which a few years ago we felt were incompatible with our sovereign existence. In particular, there was. reference to officers from other commonwealth countries whenever we were to decide whether a particular judge, the Attorney—General or other legal officers were competent to hold office.  In my view, it was, therefore, right to depart from this policy, and make our own law. Since then, we have come under criticism within our own society and outsiders, most of which I think was not justified. I believe that no judge, Attorney—General or Controller and Auditor—General has either in the past or since we made the amendment that we are now reversing has been forced by the Executive or those in political power to depart from what they would have otherwise done. What I am saying is that we have no evidence of interference with the independent operation of these offices. However, as lawyers, we say that it is not enough for justice to be done; it is even much more important for justice to be seen to be done.It is in this light that we are now saying that perhaps it is not enough to say that we know we are doing justice by sticking to the principle of separation of powers; it is also important to satisfy cur critics by letting them see that this is being done. Therefore, I welcome the spirit in which thisAmendment has been introduced. In our country like ours which practises the principle of separation of powers, I think the impartiality of these offices is important not just in the letter, but also in the spirit. Indeed, the competence with which judges, the Attorney-General and the Controller and Auditor—General depends, a lot on the integrity, of the individuals occupying the offices rather  than on the letter of the law itself.Having said, that, I would now like to refer to the provision of clause 6 (c) (4), which says:Subject to subsection (6), the Attorney—General shall vacate his office when he attains such age as may be prescribed by Parliament.I think it would have been useful if the Attorney—General, in his introductionof the Bill, had given, us some ideas on how he intends to see the fulfillment ofthis provision. Perhaps he intends to introduce this along with a generallimitation of age of the occupants of other offices. I think it is legitimatethat we be concerned about the manner in which this provision will be fulfilled.I do not see why we cannot have this, provision made here as it will involve aminimal amendment of wording.Mr. Speaker, Sir, an hon. colleague and lawyer who spoke before mereferred to a number of clerical errors which I think I need not repeat. So,I would like to say in conclusion that we pass this Bill — I hope the House willpass it bearing in mind that we are the supreme lawmaking body of thiscountry and, as such, we have the primary responsibility of continuously examiningour laws. Indeed, it is inherent in us to make changes in all directions at alltimes. We are free to make a change today and, if after two or three years, wediscover that this change may not have been well advised, as is the case here,we are at liberty to revise it. As a distinguished English Parliamentarian oncesaid, Parliament has the authority to make anything except to make a man a woman or a woman a man.With these few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES~AND-MARKETING (Mr.ole Kaparo)Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir. I would, like to support this important amendment Bill If our hon. Colleagues give us a. little audience, we will all be exceedingly grateful to them because we a discussing a matter of moment. A constitutional  amendment is not a light issue it is a very important, issue. I would like to congratulate the hon. Attorney—General, on having eloquently these, several important amendments. The essence of the amendments is to restore the position as it was in 1988 with regard to the security of tenure of constitutional offices of judges of the High Court, the hon. Attorney-General members of the Public Service Commission and the Controller and Auditor—General. It is important that those exercising those various offices do so without fear of being remove from office. It is also important that they know that in the exercise of their duties, they will not be subject to any reprisal. An important aspect of the impartiality of the Judiciary, is the knowledge that its officersare secure in their job irrespective of what decisions they deliver. This also applies to the hon. Attorney—General because, as you know, he is the, director of 	prosecutions in this country and he may decide to lay a charge against anybody. He should do so without any fear at all, and this is what the Government is requesting the House to authorize. This should go a long way towards allaying any fears in any quarters that may have been there. The Government of Kenya does not and will not want to remove the separation of various powers in the Government.	We would like this House to debate this issue because it isimportant. We should, also give constructive ideas. We have, heard certaincomplaints by some hon. Members about what constitutes a misconduct. That is being a little bit too legalistic because you cannot anticipates any form ofmisbehavior Consequently, you cannot put it in the statute book. Therefore,Misbehavious is seen and recognized where it is and what it is for I think that should be left as a matter of interpretation by. a court. If anybodywas to challenge that a certain form of behaviour does not constitutemisbehaviour, it should be a matter for the court to decide in appropriate cases.  I do not think it is proper to ask the hon. Attorney-General to.Specify in the body of the Constitution what a misbehavior in any given situaticwill be interpreted to be a misbehaviour for the purposes of that provision.I think it is sufficient that the said misbehaviour that is not befitting a member of that rank or profession 	 We will always be able to recognize a mis¬behaviour if we see one.I support the various amendments that have been moved and I urge the House to accept all of them.	With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Mibei): Thank you, Sir, far giving me this opportunity to support this Bill. I will be brief because my colleagues who have spoken have touched on very important points which I would not like to repeat.I wish to thank the Attorney-General for the way he has explained thoroughly, Clause by Clause, the provisions of this Bill. As we know, we have three arms of Government, that is, the Executive Judiciary and the Legislature. It is important that separation of powers. of the three arms of Government , should be seen and known so that one section does not interfere with the functions of the other. In the present case, there could arise these constitutional offices a situation where the holder is required to be removed, say where hairdos not carry but his function properly due to insanity ordue to other causes which we cannot foresee now.  He can also be removed for 	 misbehavior. I do not see anything wrong With the phraseology used here because the Tribunal will be the body to find out whether the holder of any of these constitutional offices has been unable to  perform his duties This 	is because the Tribunal will be composed of very highly qualified people 	like judges of the high Court or a judge of the court of Appeal or any other 	person qualified to be a judge of the High Court and also senior advocates  Who have been honoured by His Excellency the President with the rank of  Senior counsel  In another situation Where the position of the Chief Justice is initial  the Speaker or any other person who has held that position would also participate in the Tribunal in order to see that justice is done. After going through all these provisions  I find that justice will be seen to be done_ In spite of the absence this provision guaranteeingthe security of tenure of the offices of the Attorney General, judges, Controller and Auditor General and the Chief Justice, the holders of these offices have worked very hard and very well without saw concerning themselves with the absence of this provision. I wish to take this 	opportunity to thank the Chief Justice, Justice  of the High Court  the Controller and Auditor General and the AttorneyGeneral  because those of us who have been following what they are doing are satisfied that they have been doing good work.  At present, all the wananchi  Look to the High Court for justice.	Where they are dissatisfied in the  lower Court in relation to 	decisions made  they have high hopes in the High Courtand in the Court of Appeal.	In	cases  the wananchi have been satisfiedand we are pleased with the holders of those offices.	We would like to urge them to continue rendering good service to this country. What we are doing here is only filling the gap that would cause  Psychological fear when in fact nobody has actually been treated  unfairly  because of the. absence of this provision Because there is some psychological effects somewhere and the world_ is also _becoming so small that people	_elsewhere in this universe also peruse our laws we _se e no harm An  providing their provision so that we can continue to shine as a _country that upholds the rule of law In this way can be an example to other countries of the would so that can come to Kenya and copy our laws with those remarks I beg support.</Newspeech>• 	<Newspeech>MR.

The reports which have been filed in this House,   even up to this _ year  and which are all up to date show clearly that the controller and Auditor-General has been doing his job just as he should be able to do.  We have sen that wherever he has not been satisfied with any use of money within the Government system he has put it to light and the report has been tabled in this House.  Therefore, his work has not been affected. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe that we should support this Amendment for same very reason that it may give those who criticsUs less things to say about our system of government. In  theOffice of the Attorney-General, the Attorney-General who moved the previous amendment is still with us. He is the one who has moved today's amendment. In the circumstances, I believe that once again it shows that within-our Government there had been no intention at all to victimize anybody. Even the provisions that establish the tribunal are proper. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the various tribunals, except the one to be headed by the Speaker of the National Assembly   the one touching on the office of the Chief Justice  the others are to be shared by judges of the High Court who are still holding office or who have retired. I would submit that the various members of those tribunals should be competent people by qualification. We believe that they will be competent people to look into any question that. may face them. Sir, I would further say that If there is an representation that the various holders of those offices who may be subject to an inquiry are liable, then perhaps they may also get the benefit of being represented by counsel of their choice That would give   them adequate representation within the tribunal.  Mr. Speaker, Sir let me take this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency the president for the way he conducted our Special, Delegates.

WAMBUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the last time I asked this Question, I was assured that road signs had been placed on both sides of the bridge, but later on, the Assistant Minister withdrew his answer and said that these signs had been destroyed. This Question has been raised in this House about five times now and I have always been promised that this bridge would be repaired and road signs placed on both sides of the bridge. This is the place where 70 lives perished some time back. Is the Ministry waiting for another accident to occur before it quickens the process of repairing this bridge? When is this work going to be done?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is true that this Question has been asked here before. We did not have the necessary material at that time, and I stated last time that road signs are made in a special way, but the people who do this work did not have the necessary materials. We have been assured that these signs are being prepared and that they will be placed beside the bridge immediately. I think the hon.

LEWA asked the Minister far Public Works when the Kilifi Bridge will be completed and opened for traffic. <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Maiyani):  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.  The Kilifi  Bridge is expected to be completed and opened to traffic	in April,	1991.MR. LEWA:  I thank the Assistant Minister for that reply. As the House is aware, after April, there will be a lot of traffic flowing through this bridge and since this project has been done on record time, I assume that there were borne savings from the funds set aside for the project. In view of this, can the Assistant Minister tell the House the arrangements his Ministry has to ensure that approach roads, particularly from the southern part of the bridge between Mtwapa and Kilifi, are  repaired since they were last tarmacked way back in the 1960s?  Can the Ministry use the savings from this project to re-surface these approach roads so that the increase of traffic can be accommodated comfortably for the benefit of tourists and wananchi?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI:	Sir, I appreciate the sentiments of the hon. Member but until we come to the end of the project,	we cannot know whether we shall have savings  or whether we shall require further funds to complete the work. However, if there will be any savings after the bridge is officially opened, we will take care of the mentioned approach roads. Meanwhile, we cannot commit any savings because we do not know whether we shall have any.</Newspeech>  	 	<Newspeech>MR.

In his own Question he says that this was under Minute	8	(b)	 of the Settlement Committee, but the councillors have been replaced so many times that it is difficult to trace the records.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think a week ago a laid on the Table the relevant minutes from the council. If I got those minutes from the council how come the Ministry cannot get them? Did the file get lost or how could the Ministry not trace the file?</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MBORI:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, with your permission I will narrate very briefly what transpired.	In 1960 Iten Township was under	then African District Council of EIgeyo/Marakwet. Further	changes took place between1963 and 1971 when Iten was the jurisdiction of Sirikwa County Council, which was composed of a number of other councils. In 1971 it came under the control of Keiyo/Marakwet County Council. It is, therefore, possible that the file could have been misplaced, having passed through many hands as I have narrated.</Newspeech><Newspeech>CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for the Assistant Minister to mislead the House that the file got lost when I made a copy of the Minutes from the records of the council?

WABUGE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from theAssistant Minister's reply, and in-view of the fact that almost - KShs.65.6 million was paid to this contractor, is the Ministry £ satisfied with, the work done on that road and that the work donewas worth, that amount of money? </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, my Ministry was not, satisfied with the work that was done, and some retainer  fund were held . we decided to tell the contractor to go back to the site but he refused because of delay of payments and my Ministry is planning. to have another contractor to complete the	work. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.WABUGE: Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir, I am very surprised that the Assistant Minister is saying, that the work, done was not  satisfactory and yet a sum of about  KShs.65.6 million was paid.Could I be in orders Go ask the Assistant Minister to ask that this  money be paid back  to the Treasury? </Newspeech><Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, when I said that the work was not done satisfactorily I, meant, that the workwas not properly complete  Therefore the money  which was paidwas according to work. done. We decided to hold the balance so that 	the contractor does not get it. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: Mr.-Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the Assistant Minister has to be consistent How did the Ministry calculate the percentage of work done on that particular road so that the contractorpaid? That road. is -now full of potholes and there are a lot of depressions on either side of the curves</Newspeech>.<Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Soy-Kitale 	road work was awarded to a contractor called H.A.Z. Company Ltd.for repair and resealing for a period of 12 months, beginning 10th March, 1988. The contract included several other roads and covered 1 a total of 160.7 kilometres as follows:—B2 - Maili Tisa-Soy-Kitale - 53.9 kilometres; C37 - Kapsabet-Awasi :- 59 kilometres; D286 - Kitale township road 1.9 kilometres; and C54 - Eldoret-Nyaru road - 45.9 kilometres This tender -sum -was- KShsT69,024/610.00. To date the contractor has 	Paid KShs.65,570,771.75 for the whole project A sum of This contractor wrote to the Ministry in October, 1989,indicating that he had. terminated this contract with the Government on account of payment for work done being delayed for more the	than 90 days  stipulated in  the contract. At this time, there  was work outstanding to. be done particularly on Maili Tisa "SoyKitale  Road Maili Tisa Soy Kitale section of theroad was left opened up and in much dangerous condition that	the Ministry had to repair  the section so that the road couldremain passable.During the subsequent financial year in 1989/90, the outstanding debts were paid but the contractor did not move to complete the outstanding work and maintenance obligation, but instead he insisted that the contract no longer existed. A Performance 3ona is being held by the Government for the sum of KSh.8,879,4-60.01 in this project  and the Ministry is of the opinion that the contractor has failed to perform his obligation. Consequently, payment has been withheld,, or the rent ion money amounting to KSh.3,4-51,093-25. The matter has been referred to the Attorney- General for recovery of the Performance Bond money and associated damage. Records are now under review by the Attorney-General from July, 1990. Meanwhile alternative arrangements are being made to repair and resurface this section together with the Kihindo Kitale and Kitale - Kapenguria road. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. WABUGE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, today we are being given a very interesting reply, and it demonstrates, how the  Government funds are just being thrown to waste just like that without any due regard or respect. The Assistant Minister willagree with the that there was no repair work done at all on this particular road which warranted the contractor to be paid. Now, if the work was not done or if this man did not honour the contract and, on the other hand he has been paid. I would like to, know who authorized the payment of ksh 65 million.? If so. can we demand these refund: of* this, money with immediate effect to the Government? </Newspeech><Newspeech> ARCHBISH 0P0NDIEK: Mr,.Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have made my statement very clear that the matter has. been, handed over to the Attorney General who is in charge of prosecutions I am sure acting is being taken. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: Mr.. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are two issues that the=Assistant Minister has not made clear to ,us He has given us elaborate explanation on a network of. roads that were to be done by this particular contractor Now, my specific concern is on Kitale  Maili Tisa road. How much was that section of the road supposed to cost because even if we have elaborate network of roads, we must have specific details per road.?  Again, when the Assistant Minister tells us that the road was done by the  Ministry of Public works because the contractor did not do a good job, does he want to tell us that the contractor did not set his foot of chat road? </Newspeech><Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I said that the distance of the road covered was 160.7 kilometres and the tender was awarded for KSh. 69,224,610.00. So, the ^question of working out a figure for a particular road, I do not have that kind of information at the moment. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.FALANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is a very good example of waste of public funds. I am sureKSh.65 million is a lot of money by any standards. The Assistant Minister here agreesand confesses that this money did not do the work it was intendedHe said that he was not satisfied with the job done. The issue .of saying that the matter is with the .Attorney General is not enough at all. Although. I am hot a lawyer, I. am sure there what is called a breach of contract and somebody must be held responsible. Now, KSh.65 million has been wasted and the Ministry is going for another contractor, to do the job The House here does not tolerate public, funds being wasted. can we be told who is answerable for this—breach of contract?. Is it ±he Ministry, or the contractor? Who is going to pay; this money? </Newspeech><Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon Member knows very well that the only action my Ministry can take is to refer., the matter to the Attorney General for the necessary   action for a breach of contract  That is exactly what my Ministry has done!. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR.BOY: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.	I think the Assistant Ministry is trying to take this House forand Before any money for contract work is paid, there isthe quantity surveyor who certifies that the work has been donein accordance with the terms of the contract Also, before any arepayments made vouchers are prepared and gone through all the people concerned. Now, does the Assistant Minister want to tell us that the money was paid without involving any of these people? 	What action is the Ministry taking against these people whocollaborated to swindle the Government this colossal sum of money? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK:  Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir as far as  my Ministry is  concerned, there was no fraud The  amount that was paid  was equivalent to the work that had beendone But-the contractor did not complete the work to our satisfaction and<Newspeech>	<Newspeech> MR.FALANA: 0n a point forgery Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir Is the hon. Assistant-Minister in order to mislead this House? He says that they paid KShs.65-million for the job done.  But you will recall that just a while ago he said that the contractor did not do the job to the satisfaction of the -Ministry. Is he in order to mislead the House? Why is he now contradicting himself? </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>ARCHBISHQP-ONDIEK:  I am not misleading the House; maybehon. Falana is the one who is misleading the House. The amount was paid because the engineers who went there to issue thecertificate were satisfied that the work was properly done. I wasjust saying that the work was not properly completed; to cover the total sum of KShs.69 million that was tendered for. That is why  we ordered the contractor to back the site and</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! I think hon. Members wantto know whether the Ministry is happy with the KShs.65 million already spent. </Newspeech><Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,when the KShs.65 million was paid, my Ministry was of the opinion that the work was properly done and that the contractor was going to complete the work But when we discovered that the contractor did not complete the work we decided. to withhold a certain amount of the money until he  completes the work. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.WABUGE:Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir , I would like the Assistant Minister  to be, specific I want him to give a specific answer,  I say this? because nothing was done on the roads he has mentioned. In view of the fact that the Kitale-Maili Tisa Road was contracted forK2hs. 69 million and in view of the factthat the work was not done  The work was not done because thework was supposed to start from  Maili Tisa to Kitale The contract  was-unable to do the job. and as a result, of this the Ministry of Works went there and did the job to ehable is Excellency the President to pass through that section of the road. That was done last week Could the Assistant Minister, now. give, a specific  answer to minister House?Who did authorise the payment of KShs.65 million out of the total	contract sum ofKShs.69 million? Is that person going to be surcharged and reprimanded— for having swindled the Government? </Newspeech><Newspeech>-ARCHBISHOP.ONDIEK: Mr. Deputy. Speaker, Sir, that is a different question The Ministry of Public Works has carried out investigations into TO this. We have handed over the matter to the Attorney-General. If the Attorney-General discovers inhis investigations  that there was an officer in my Ministry who did authorise this payment without finding out whether the work was properly done, then definitely such a person is going to be surcharged,</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

The Assistant Minister must withdraw his remarks because this is not a matter, of thinking. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR.DEUTy speaker : Hon.

DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Hon. Mbori had concluded his remarks. Mr. Lotiau</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LOTIM: Thank you-very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, ;Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my colleagues in airing my views on this; Motion. I would first of all like to  thank the Mover of this Motion so that we can reduce the burden that parents have to . bear in educating their children. 		Deputy Speaker, Sir we know that education is a funda¬mental aspect in this country Harambee funds should not bring about the reason for curtailing education for any child  in the country. The parents in the country have done a lot to uplift the standards of education through-Harambee contributions and the cost sharing aspect. All the physical facilities in our educational institutions have been provided by the parents through those means. The parents have gone as far as providing the learning facilities. However, we have the problem of continuously rising fee charges to subsidies the. boarding -and tuition facilities.Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to request the Ministryof Education to come in and assist the parents, especially those withpupils in boarding schools. As the Motion itself stipulates, the Govern¬ment should come in and assist-in the payment of salaries to those staff members employed, by the boards of governors. This will help to lessenthe burden that is currently sitting on the parents.	 (Mr; Deputy Speaker left the Chair)(The Temporary-Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mahihu) took the Chair) Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is another anomaly which I think should be corrected." Once a bursar, or an accounts clerk has been employed-in a school, such staff are not transferrable and, as a result, get ways and means of stealing the schools' funds. These type of staff-should be transferrable to stop any such possibilities of theft in the schools they work in.The other thing I would like to highlight here is on the funds from the Ministry of Education to subsidies boarding and tuition as well as in paying-salaries .to the school employees -Such funds-are normally delayed and, at the same time the figure is getting less and less. I think the Ministry should realise that the parents are very over-burdened If a parent has up to four, pupils. in a secondary school., he can barely afford to educate them and Some times you will find the some of his - children have to-drop out of school for flack of school fees The Mini¬stry should seek for  funds so that it can pay all the employees in the given-schools,  say right from the bursar to the grounds man.Currently, the grants are normally sent to schools in four quarters. That being so, let them be sent at the right time so that the boards of governors wi11know what to do. At the same time, let there be auditor of books in those secondary, schools. There is a bad laxity on this To cite an example, I know of a secondary school which, in the whole of Rift Valley Province, has not had its books of accounts audited. This is Chewoiyo High School. Since 1976 to date, the books have been at Nakuru and have not been audited. Nobody has bothered to follow up and we should be told why: Auditing should be carried out annually.I must take this opportunity to thank His Excellency the President for the directive he made recently to ban civil servants, chiefs and Admini¬stration officials from being involved in the collection of Harambee funds. <Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: Wo wamekula sana. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LOTIM: His Excellency the President has assured that every Kenyan in the village, or any part of the country is protected, and every¬body is very happy about that directive. Every week we hear of a project needing Harambee collections, but all such money does not end up being used for the purposes it was meant for. I, therefore, feel that all receipt books given out to collect money should be returned to the project committees. I know that this has not been done, particularly in Kapenguria in West Pocket. I know of a school where books were given out for collection of Harambee funds. The books were we in all but, in the long run, only four Harambee books, were retuned Where are the 36 other books?; This is :respect    :of Ngalai Primary School in Riwo Location of Kapenguria Division This show people e" steal money from wananchiThe board of governors and parents teachers associations should be considerate in their deliberationsr’to set up how much a   ''parent should contribute" We know that; for sure, we should assist '  by contributing some money but ? we should not be: asked for thousands  of shillings per term and then the following term we are asked for more You find that other than the normal school fees, you have to payanotherextraKsh3000 or more per year A n that form? Where do we expect parents to get such money from? Some of the parents' incomes cannot allow them to pay such money and,, eventually, a pupil who  given the opportunity to complete, his education  would be an	 asset to this country, an academician of the future, has his education curtailed I hope the Ministry will take note of this and assistThe other thing I want to touch on is the science equipment When the "0" level examinations were about to be done recently, there was a rush for examination equipment, on practical subjects  is the only firm given the contract to supply the whole Republic with science equipment What we found out was that some schools were being told to buy some equipment, some of which they already had, instead of being advised to buy modern ones That made some schools to incur extra costs that were not really necessary Secondly, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I said, at one time, hon. Mang'oli said, that the decentralization	'of the school equipment scheme for sciences "should 'be done. For example, they" should "Have offices "in Rift Valley  Western Province '.and other-provinces so that teachers can travel short distances to acquire these equipments.	 ."Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir, the other point is on books.With those few remarks, I support. </Newspeech>. <Newspeech>MR.A.K KINYANJUI: Thank you Mr. Temporary DeputySpeaker , Sir to have given me a. chance to contribute on the Motion.The speakers who have spoken on this Motion have very rightly said that the purpose of the Motion is to review school fees paid in all our schools and which are beyond what an ordinary mwananchi can afford. I, therefore, thank the Mover of this Motion because he has given hon. Members a chance  to de-Merete on that very important point. Time and again, we have said that it is important that any child in Kenya be given a chance to continue with education so that he can help this country at a future date. These very exorbitant fees are defeating the idea.First of all,-we should look at the income of anordinary mwananchi in Kenya. There are very, very few and organizations that pay reasonable salaries. For example the salaries paid are in the region of Ksh.1,000/=, Kshs.2,000/=, Kshs.3,000/= and Kshs.4,000/=. If you look at the fees charged in Harambee schools even in the Government schools you will see that  the ordinary wananchi cannot afford to pay such fees those who have spoken on this motion have given very good examples for example alliance high school which is a government school is charging Kshs .-11000/per student. An ordinary personwith two children in a secondary school will need to pay over"Kshs . 20 0,00/= in form of fees leave alone for maintaining thosechildren. He will therefore, be required for-pay over Kshs . 25 , 000/in a year. How. many ordinary people- earn Kshs. 3 ,000/. per month?How, many people in the rural area are able to get such incomefrom cash, crops like tea or  coffee How-many of them are ableto get-can income of- Kshs . 25 . 000/ =  If there are there are veryfew  So we should review school coffee charged in our schools .We should therefore, look at the in totality all fees and otherpayments paid in our schools. It is, therefore, only right thatwe pass this Motion.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. for the last two days,we were at Moi Kasarani Complex Centre, I noticed that one ofthe. points that was included in the-recommendations presented byHis Excellency the-Vice-President and Minister of Finance was onthis particular issue. It is therefore, important-that we lookat it. School fees have gone up because of mainly four things;the first one being the cost of books. We have time and againrepeated in this House that it is very unfortunate to have people who are always working on changing the syllabuses or the books required in schools. Most of us can remember the particular reference books that were used in teaching mathematics. For a period of 15 to 20 years you could find children reading books that were used at one time by his-parents. These days once syllabuses are changed, new set of books are .recommended. Thishappens every two or three years. This means that all the booksthat we have in the country .will, be abandoned in the next two .or three, years.  This is ridiculous. So, it  is important  for us to know what kind of books arerecommended for use in our schools I am saying this because thetype of books that are used by our children will very much determinethe kind of education we are giving to our children. For thisreason, it is important to consider the kind of syllabus thathas been provided for .the, learning, of our  children  and be ableto recommend the ideal books for covering that syllabus.textAt the moment, one notices the change of books year after year and this matter must  be looked into by the Ministry concernedwith all seriousness.Having said that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Iwould now like to turn on to the state of our  school equipmentAs has been rightly said by. a number of hon. Members who have hada chance to speak on this Motion, the state of equipment in ourschools  is in a very bad position. The type of equipmentwe have in our  schools  will also to a-large extent, determinethe type of education we are going to  give to our children. We have been talking about  supplying,  the right type oftext books to our schools, but this would be meaningless to do alsoso without providing the right type of equipment in these schools.Therefore, it is most important for the Ministry to come out andlook for ways and means of providing the right type of equipmentto our schools. This would go along. way to subsidizethe parents who are at the moment being asked to buy these things.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if we could have theMinistry supplying both books and. equipments. in our schools, thiswould reduce the amount of fees now being demanded by the Boardof Governors from poor parents who cannot afford these very highfees The other aspect that I would 1ike to tax talk about, is thebuilding facilities in our schools. At  the moment, parents are called upon to put up school buildings like laboratories, assembly halls  classrooms, and so on It -is true that, whatever we do we must—have adequate facilities in our schools for the proper running of these schools The Ministry would also assist if they could formulate always of assisting in putting up these facili¬ties instead of relying on; the poor parents to construct these facilities. At the moment, the normal practice when a schoolwants to put up classrooms or any other building, is to divide the estimated cost amongst the parents in  that school and this has proved to be a very unpopular way  of doing things  There areraise the amounts demanded from them and  their children end up being sent away from school Therefore, a system where all of us are involved in putting up these facilities must be found by the ministry so that this burden can be. lifted off from the shoulders of the poor and few parents.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, we are pleased to note that when he was responding to this Motion, the Minister did indicate that the highest amount that ought to be demanded for a parent for development purposes should be Shs.1,00.0/-. That is very well, but if say, a school wants to put up . five classrooms, a laboratory or a hall, how will this be worked out? How will the Board of Governors now go overt this problem? Those of us who sit in those boards clearly sees this as not being a solution to the problem? We have to go a bit deeper and find : ways and means of assisting these poor parents.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </><Newspeech>MR. TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER: It is. now time for the Moverto reply. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,Sir, for giving me this opportunity to respond-to the various pointsthat were raised by hon Members in their contribution to this Motion. The first thing that I would like to do is to refer to the Report; which  we have been debating and  which we concluded yesterday If you refer to this Report, you would find it to be very clear particularly Chapter nine which is talking about Education, generally. ln this chapter, the question of school fees has been raised and.-this is what this report saysMany of the members of public who presented their. views to the,. Committee felt that parents were suffering because the amount of  fees. being charged in-schools. They argued that the current method of repaying school fees is exploiting parents. They said it was not clear when the parent is contributing -to Haranibse or clearing his or her statutory school fess Several parents expressed their  wish to pay school fees whose package. includes 	development fund rather than the parent being subjected to unlimited Harambee contribution."This is a problem which has been worrying the whole, countryand therefore take it report unity to point out what paragraphNine (4) on school books and equipment says  -t- says "as follows:-"The Committee was informed that the changing of the text books yearly, is costing parents a lot of. money. Publishers on the other hand, are; enriching themselves-at the expense of the' parents. The members of the public-suggested that the Ministry of Education should decide-on the essential -book list and give this  list out to schools This list should not be changed by the teachers at their convenience'.'Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir these are the views of the public,If you look again on page 62, you will find this is what it says:-"Since Kenya accept the philosophical basis of 8-4-4 education system which is broad-based, practical and which emphasizes that acquisition oil marketable skills, and having noted the problems arising out of the implementation of the system, the Ministry of Education should establish a panels and workshops to examine the system and recommend on how best it could be implemented."  Mr. .Temporary Deputy. Speaker.; Sir paragraph 4 says:: "The Ministry of Education should re—examine the exorbitant school fees being charged. by certain schools and the method of- admission to. schools. in urban areas."Having .realized: that this is a very  matter, I request theMinistry, to make sure that it reads. this report properly and do what the reportrecommends because this has-been one of the problems that really affects the whole country I take this opportunity to thank the, President for having realisedlast year that there was this problem and held a mammoth rally during..which heraised a lot of funds for helping poor students. All I plead is that this moneybenefits students from various districts  who genuinely require it. As humanbeings  some., of money although we do notdeserve it because we have good income. So those of us who are going to be allocating this money should make sure that we do so fairly.I also thank the President because he said yesterday that he hadreceived a donation of Shs.10 million, which he is going to contribute to theFund. I thank him for his wise leadership and for seeing that we .help the poor students in this country. I accept the fact that most headmasters have a problemin administering their schools because of lack of adequate funds. On the other"hand, however, we should not punish poor parents just because we do not haveenough funds. What I am saying is that the Ministry of Education, and theGovernment as a whole, should- look into ways and means of raising extra funds.It has been suggested by other hon. Members in their contribution that we canestablish a special education fund. In the same way the Ministry of LocalGovernment charges services charge, we could have similar funds being chargedto every mwananchi and set aside this money for school development.Another problem that has been raised by almost all hon. Members isnon availability of grants to schools I know that this problem is not reallyin the Ministry; it is the Treasury that does not release such grants to schools.So,. I appeal to the Treasury to make sure that it gives these grants to schoolsin time. The problem of employees of boards of governors  has also been raised. In reviewing the system of funding education today, I support the view that has been aired by many hon. Members to the effect that these employees should be paid direct by the Government because, most of the money that is paid as "school fees goes. into: paying these employees Right now, I know that some schools have not  managed to pay their boards of governors employees such as cooks and accounts  clerks. So, I appeal to the Government again to consider the idea of making these people civil servants so that, they may be paid direct by the Government and thereby reduce the burden on school teachers and parents.The suggestion, that bursars and accounts clerks should be made transferrable is a point that should be taken very seriously by the Ministry.  Most-headmasters are not trained-accountants  and they do not know how to fiddle with figures. So, what normally happens is that figures are prepared for them by bursars and accounts clerks Unless these people are made mobile, they will continue to play about with figures while headmasters take the blame. It is in view of this that we-are saying that bursars and accounts should be-transferrable.The point of auditing Harambee funds has been taken seriously and is also contained in this report.  According to the Saitoti Report, all Harambee funds should be properly audited, and the Ministry should take this opportunity to make sure that it asks for a bigger allocation of funds to enable it to employ auditors. Speaking from my experience when I was an Assistant Minister in the Ministry of Education, I know, that there used to be a problem with the provision of funds for employing. more auditors. I hope that the Ministry will continue to look for more funds to employ more auditors; This problem was realized many years back, but, unfortunately, there were no sufficient funds.i hope that all hon. Members will support this Motion because it is timely and a matter of. national importance. The matter has ."been mentioned in the Satiety Report. I appeal to the Ministry once more to make sure that studentsfrom poor families are not harassed. The idea of sending such students to consult- - - -their parents from time to time is not good because there is no point in consulting a parent who  has no money, because even if you consult him l00 times, he willnot  cough up anything It is. a waste of time-for headmasters to send studentsaway from time to time and,  in any case some of the students, have no-bus "fare,and they end-up borrowing  money repeatedly .It. is with this ingrained that werequest the Ministry to .be very serious Although there may be. lobbying byboards of governs here, and there trying to .persuade the Ministry to withdrawthe directive which the Assistant Minister promised to make. I would urge himto be vigilant in making, sure that this directive is implemented and that wekeep a ceiling of Shs.1,000/= as the Assistant Minister said.With these remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. </Newspeech>Question of the Motion as amended put and agreed to)	 	 Resolved  accordingly:THAT, in view of the fact that most parents whose children are in secondary schools belong to the low income group, and realising that most bards—of—governors in these schools have raised the fees payable in 1991 in the form of various extra payments in addition to tuition, boarding and examination fees, thereby making it difficult for most . students to pursue their .studies, this House urges the Government to review the system of charging extra fees by . boards of governors and parents-teachers associations for development and maintenance.<Header> PROCEDURAL MOTION </Header ><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Kamotho):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Leader of Government BusinessI beg to move the following Procedural Motion:—THAT, this House orders that the. following Business appearing on today's Order Paper be exempted from the provisions of Standing Order No. 33, being Wednesday - Morning, a day allocated for Private Members' Motions.Since we have no more Private Members' Motions on the Order Paper and, as allhon. Members are aware, we are in December and we would like to finish theBusiness of the year before we proceed to our constituencies, I would appeal tohon. Members to accept this Motion so that we may carry on with the Business intoday's Order paper.	With those :few remarks, I beg to move. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE .ASSISTANT-MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING(Mr.. Mutiso):  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to second the Motion before the House  I wish  to state that since this is a Procedural Motion. and, as  the Mover has said,  each of us is geared towards going home  and enjoying Christmas with the wananchi there, I believe it is the-wish of this House to speed up our Business for this year so that in 1991, we start afresh the Business of the House. I think the-country has a. new inspirit after the events of yesterday and the day before. Many people will be jubilant and  the hon. Members  of this- House in particular would like  to with. their electors to try to put across to the latter the feelings of the conference that ended yesterday.  Sir, for this reason  it is my feeling that this Motion will  be supported by the hon. Members so that the House can do away, with this Motion before we proceed to other businesses.	.I beg to second.   Question proposed) </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT.

KUBO: Thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity tosupport this Motion which is straight forward; On  the other hand, there is animpression which I wanted to correct because it had been  said that hon.Members of the Back Bench have not brought enough Private Members* Motions.I commend hon. Members of the Front Bench because I have seena big change particularly in view of the fact that they even supported myMotion There has been a problem in the past where hon. Members of theFront Bench gang up to Private .Member Motions,. contrary. .to Members wishes as indicated in the Motions. The hon. Members of the Front Bench have now realised that we are all trying to look in to the problems of the wananchi. That is the spirit which  we want to continue because some hon. Members have been a bit apprehensive because they always assume that  if they bring Motions, they are likely to be amended. But we have seen a good change within the last few weeks and we commend the Government and hon. Members of the Front Bench.I hope that during the next Session, hon. Members will be encouraged to bring many Motions because the spirit of working together in there now. Since .we have, just ended the Kanu Special Delegates Conference where we. resolved a lot of things for the benefit of this country, I hope thatwe shall start the next Session .on a better spirit and work hand in hand. with the.hon. Members of the Front Bench.	Those are my remarks. </Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Sompisha):  On a point of order, Sir.

MOTION\.THAT, this House adopts the Report of the Public Investments Committee on the Accounts of the State .Corporations laid on the-Table of the House on 7th . November, 1990</Newspeech>(Dr. Misoi on 27.11.90)(Resumption of Debate interrupted on 27.11.90)<Newspeech>DR. MISOI. Sir, I thank you for giving me this opportunity tocontinue moving this Motion on the Report of the Public Investments Committeeof 1989 I have already outlined the general aspect of this Report and alsotouched on a few specific Corporations pointing our the areas where theCommittee found a lot of weaknesses in the management of national resources.I will be very brief but before I do that, I would like to referthe House to the deliberations of the Kanu Special Delegates Conference which took place on 3rd and 4th of this month. As Kenyans are aware, the member of this Conference arrived at very ,important decisions which pose a challenge to this nation. It is also a challenge - to those would wish to see this country progress united and live in peace. It is equally  a. Challenge to those with a different opinion as to how., this  country's affairs should be managed.  The resolutions  which were  passed were great indeed because it confirms that the Nyayo Philosophy of being mindful of other people's welfare It alsoconfirms that this  is a democratic country which takes care of the interests  of the majority while at the same time considering the views of the minority That is exactly ;what..democracy, is. It should not discriminate against anybody. I wish to congratulate His Excellency the President for the wayhe handled and presented views to the delegates. That was a character of a statesman in this continent who has managed to handle all the challenges and in the end united the people of this country  I would like to suggest that allleaders, be it in the Civil Service?: private sector  or Kanu, should start a new league of understanding,  compromising and-accommodating each other views for the sake of building this nation.I will now move to this Report. I will start off by mentioning one aspect in relation to exemption of. State Corporations-from the provisions of State Corporations Act.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Sir, those corporations  which want, to just if  their existence must comply with, certainrequirements and provisions. They want  to be exempted from theserequirements but they  must show- that they can- do the job withoutsupervision  It is thus  very important for the  Office of the-President to look into this point before granting these corporations their requests.Most of these state  corporations-are answerable to this. House  It is this  House. which approves  their budgets and loans  and it would be out of place if any corporation, whose funds have been acquired through this House, does not present its report to the same House.  This -House should be able to how these corporations perform regardless of whether they are doing well or not we should be able to highlight examples of corporations . that have very well so that the other corporations can emulate the well-performing corporations.There is a  Parastatals  Advisory committee but we do not know what it id doing, particularly now when many of our state firms have not been very well. If this committee is still operational we must see the results of its activities. I believe it is composed of civil servants and other public figures whose experience should be able to guide this country to  greater heights . of development,  This committee is supposed to be operating under the Inspectorate of Statutory Boards. This would mean that it has qualified inspectors who. inspect the accounts of the corporations and also carry out  consultations with them. If this Committee is  still there and it is not producing any results then it is as.  good as a  "dead" body. This point need to be looked into.I have already mentioned that for people to be appointed...to high positions in state firms they must meet certain criteria.  We cannot even advertise all the chief executives posts in the he best people to run our state firms and-also avoid-personal influence which tends to spoil the image of the corporations. This  is important because we are still creating more state corporations the in the  process of creating-the Coast Development Authority, the hon Governmental Organisations Board and, so on and we must _ensure that they do  the job for which we are„ setting them up.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir., the other aspect that I would g touch oh briefly regards the need for civil servants and state firms employees to declare their interests. It is important for those who run state firms to..separate. their own  interests from public interests This is because an influential  person like a Permanent Secretary can ring a chief executive and ask him to award a tender to so and so for 10 per cent commission, which-is a very serious matter. We found-Chief executives owning  under a  different or disguised names agencies which dealt with state firms, they head; it is 5 such boards, or state firms, which are not. doing well a chief executive cannot, do good, job when he wants to make a profit. This affects Permanent Secretaries, directors and even Ministers-because  everybody wants to exploit the situation. I know have become rich in this way, but want the law totake its course. It is also very important for the civil servants</Newspeech>QUORUM <Newspeech>MR. EELIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary DeputySpeaker, Sir. . I do not know what is wrong today: After the goodnews resulting from the scrapping of queue-voting hon. Members have.not come to the House. Are they protesting the scrapping of thequeuing system and yet this was very good news to this country? </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY-SPEAKER (Mr. Mahihu): Mr. Kiliku,what is your point of order? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. Kiliku: It is that there is no quorum in the House. </Newspeech><Newspeech>The TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER(Mr.Mahihu): you are right Ring the Division Bell, please.(The-Division Bell-was rung)  Order, hon Members We have a quorum now You may  proceed, Dr. Misoi</Newspeech> <Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Thank you, Mr. Temporary, Deputy Speaker, Sir. As I was saying, we  as leaders must separate our roles and not  confuse them As I have always said, we should, not use  our position to the detriment, of public, interest.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, recently Hi s Excellency the Vice—President and Minister for Finance pointed out that there will be a new rule to guide state corporations. I hope that those rules and guidelines will put our state firms, on the right footingSir, there is something that I want to say especially in connection with the role of chief executives and the respect they give to Parliamentarians. It cam to our attention that if an.hon. Member of Parliament goes to an office of a chief executive sometimes he is not given-the attention he deserves. Members of Parliament-are the leaders of this country; they formulate all the laws and –they approve all the budgets of this country therefore, deserve to be respected by civil servants. Members of Parliament also deserve respect from chief executives and all other leaders because, otherwise, you are undermining the Constriction of this country. Members are here constitutionally and nobody should dilute their role, whether in business, public or politics.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have said before her that even Kanu chairmen should respect Members of Parliament because they are elected according to the law When Members of Parliament have been elected, they should not be down .graded. When there are public functions hon. Members have a role to play; do not put them aside; otherwise, what are you telling the public when you ignore Members of Parliament? We must cultivate a new spirit now that-everybody has a role and let him play . that  role and now. what he is, supposed to do. Unless we do this, we  to confuse .our roles again You-even, hear of  somebody sitting-on-the head of a Minister. A Minister has a flag and he must be respected. And as a. Minister with-, a flag, you should do your job. It. is in Prof Satieties Report that if- you cannot do your job then-you should quit and; others will do it. Whatever you are given do it well. If you are a Minister or a permanent secretary, do your job and if you are a Member of Parliament do  your job too Donot be like somebody who does not speak If you are like somebody dense who does not speak and you look like a fish, then retire and go back home YesMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, what I am- saying is that our roles should be seen to be what they are and not otherwise.	I agree that we are here by right; we were sent here by the peopleWhen we go hon on Recess we want to hear that Members of Parliament are speaking and defending the country and not leaving His Excellency the President alone to do everything, from initiating, collecting and solving people's problems when he has people who he has given the job. What are these people? People are saying that they are helping you and yet the President is doing everything. If it i were not for the President yesterday, where would you be? Yes.Why sing one song today here and then go back and sing something else? We are not-doing-justice to this country. If we are to take  care of Kenya, let us all speak one language; respect .the headof state, give him his rightful position and do what he tells us	to. do You, should not be told to do this and go and do something 	else. That is-out of place. Hon. - Members are the. watch  dogs and if they keep quiet they are letting this country down  Mr. Temporary. Deputy Speaker, Sir, having said that I wish to say something about the role of the Treasury. The treasury is the institution which .gives money to state corporations; it is the one which gives loans to these institutions for use. From our findings, sometimes money is. given as loans without guidelines to  be Strictly  followed. That is why everybody..is complacent "and"  why every body does not care  When you give. money. Go a para s t a t body, you should tell the chief executive that the money is on lend and specify the terms and conditions. That is how business should ..be ;.done We cannot blame her people; at the bottom when ourselves, are responsible and: want to create-scapegoats. We must start from the top so that the people at the bottom can follow what we are doing. We cannot be double dealers by employing double .standards. That is the problem with this country; the leaders are not showing the way.  They talk and what they do is different: Show the people what to do. The public is not stupid; they are not foolish. They are enlightened are  able to analyse and understand who is not truthful and who is a man of false pretences.<Newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Mutiso): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. With du(e, respect to the hon. Member speaking, I think he is using very unparliamentarily language. The word "stupid" is not-Parliamentary and, therefore, should be. withdrawn. He should use proper -language. </Newspeech><Newspeech> THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mahihu): Yes, I think hon. Mutiso is right; -Hon; Members should refrain from using unparliamentarily words, especially the word "stupid". I hope that the hon. Member will withdraw that remark. </Newspeech> <Newspeech> DR.MISOI: Sir,I meant to say that our people are not thick I think that is not un parlianientary. </Newspeech><Newspeech> THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY. SPEAKER (Mr .Mahihu): Hon.. Dr.Misoi, if you look at our Standing Order No., 73 (3),it say3 and I quo be:-it. shall be .out of order 'to use offensive or -insulting language whether “in respect of Members ofthe House or other persons".So, you have an obligation, to withdraw that word "stupid".</Newspeech><Newspeech> DR. MISOI: .Thank you, Sir I did-not accuse anybody -of-being stupid, and if it; is not. unparliamentarily, I would like to say that they are not "uninformed".</Newspeech><Newspeech> THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mahihu): Order, Dr. Misoil . The., ruling still-stands-that-you-withdraw the. word. </Newspeech><Newspeech> DR. MISOI: I withdraw the word, Sir, that our people are not "stupid".</Newspeech><Newspeech>  THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mahihu): Order, Dr. llisoi! Withdraw the word "stupid" unconditionally</Newspeech><Newspeech> DR. MISOI: I  withdraw, the word, Sir. But I will continue to say that our people are "well informed"; they are "intelligent". They know what is right and wrong.  This is what I was saying.So, the fore of the Treasury is very important. Public funds must be used for the intended purposes, and unless we start from there-, we shall be singing a song with no end.Sir, in conclusion, I would like to say that we are very fortunate to have had two great leaders, one who coined the Harambee spirit which is still going on and our current President who coined the philosophy of "Nyayoism". This is the philosophy which binds us together as a nation.Sir, referring to the Kanu Review Committee Report, thereare many-things that were recommended. If most of us could spend time to look into them, that”. would lead to how dedicated we arenot only to. following the Nyayo Philosophy-of Excellency thePresident but also in serving the people of this., country. Sir,. we., a leaders, should not be, seen to be at .variance with the demands of the country. Behave to be true to ourselves	and what, is true today; should also be true tomorrow. Tie cannotbuild nation if we are not stable. This, is serious especially with -leaders I think we must. show the, way and follow the goodsteps of His Excellency the President.During the Kami Special Delegates Meeting, somebody saidthat let us give our President mandate to govern. the. country.Let us do our part and that-is why we are here That is why also	everybody is somewhere If we do that then we can multiply the productivity of this country many times. If we do that then this country will progress. So, we do not have to keep-on crying all the time. Even-leaders are crying too. The are at a very difficult juncture,. Sir at the moment.So, leaders should be what they are expected to be. If you area politician, do not pretend to be something else. You have tobe somebody somewhere. So, if you have assumed  a wrong role, move slowly backwards. Also, if you have been challenged by the*public that you have done something wrong - we have never' had ?	many people who take the courage to say "yes"  accept the verdict,and go back. The mast now create a good image for our people.Do not stick to something because you will cause more damage and confusion, or even losses.Sir, in ending, I will only pose one simple question: 	How truthful, are we? Also, to what-extent do we have confidencein the system we are serving in? That will determine how productive , we can  be Our output will depend on that commitment and goals that we have set for ourselves. That is what will determine how  well we are able to serve in the positions that we are in at .the moment. Sir I am sure hon Members could like  to  contribute to this Motion and, therefore; I would like hon. kiliku to second it. I am sure hon. Members, have gone through it and the issues that have "been highlighted will be exposed so -that those who are res¬ponsible know where their weaknesses lie and how they  can correctthose errors	With those few .words, Sir, I beg to move.</Newspeech><Newspeech>  MR. KILIKU: Thank you very much,. Mr .Temporary Deputy Speaker for giving me the opportunity to second the Motion.First and foremost, I would like;, on .behalf of myselfand the residents of Changa we. Constituency, to thank His Excell¬ency .the President for saving the country from the. pretenders. For the last two days, the pretenders have, been contributing in support of but they are not -prepared to face the public. However, the President of this country realized what the people wanted and saved the day. I thank him very much for that. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, unless we change our attitude towards .the management of our economy, whether in theprivate sector or the  Public Sector, we are not going to realise any economic development in this country; no matter how many loans  or  grants we are going to get from the donors no matter how much coffee we are going to sell on theworld market Unless we improve on the management of our parastatals we are not going to develop.! Corruption is very rampant and the money lost runs into millions and millions of kenya shillings if there was proper management in our parastatals, we would .not be looking for foreign aid. The Public Investments Committee and the Public Accounts Committee Reports reveal	huge sums-of money that have been embezzled or misappropriated in both the	 Ministries andparastatal organizations. That money is enough to run this country and with that Kind of money there would be no need to seekfunding from outside. How are we going to develop this country without proper financial management. let us be  frank here. The problems that we face in this country today are as a result of economic mismanagement. The problems we are facing today have not been caused by. external economic forces. Tie have problems because our. own State corporations have been mismanaged.Mr. Temporary Deputy..Speaker, Sir, I will cite specific examples here. I will start with the Kenya Airways Limited. During the 1986/87 Financial Year there was an agent who was working fer¬tile Kenya Airways; to sell air tickets for the airline. The agent was collecting the money and	giving Kenya Airways dishonoredcheques. Mr. Temporary: Deputy Speaker Sir, you will find that : between 18th July, 1986 and. February, 1937, the Kenya Airways lost KShs.6 million. Although- the cheques issued by the Agent were dishonored, the Kenya Airways Limited continued to give them, the .work. That is a big shame. As at 13th July, 1986, thecheques which had been dishonored amounted to	KShs.2.5 million but the Kenya Airways Limited continue to give.thi:agent work until February, 1987 when-they realized that the money lost amounted- to KSEsi'6588 668.00 That was donedeliberately; it was intentional. This is theft! I say this because the cheques were dishonored but the airline continued giving, they agent work. The officers who were involved. were. given a six months suspense, each. They were never surcharged and this money has never been recovered. I think the officers have now back to work. You will find this  information on page 77 of the Report,Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Corporation also deposited KShs.240,370,520. on short-term deposits at a very low interest rate. Who was getting the difference between this lowinterest rate and the prevailing market rates at thattime? The actual amount deposited  was KShs.559,936.45 and the same amount was under-stated in the Corporation's annual report and accounts. I am a Member of the Public Investments Committee and I am speaking from experience. You, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, are also a Member of that Committee. They under-stated the amount in the bank; they, under-stated the amount by KShs.15,576,867.00. Who made that decision? Why was no action taken against those responsible? Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,  in the 1985/86 Financial Year, the Kenya Industrial. Estates deposited about  KShs.71,594,000.00 in financial institutions which have since collapsed.  You will find that an amount of KShs.ll,484,000.00 and another one of. KShs. 1.5 -million cannot be recovered because those .financial- institutions have collapsed.:Mr .Temporary Deputy Speaker," Sir, another theft occurred in the National. Irrigation Board You can see this. on page 35 of  the Report This involved building materials for Bur a Irrigation Scheme This is a very interesting case. The National Irrigation Board-decided to sell government materials to  a  private company on credit They sold materials  worth KShs.930,000/- on credit, to a private company. The funny thing about , this whole transaction is that although the price of the materials was KShs.930,000/- in 1983, the company did not pay the National Irrigation Board until 1985 .when-the company paid only KShs.50,000/-. Where did the KShs.880,000/- go? who authorised this transaction? We are not developing at all if this is the kind of work we are doing  No action has been taken against those responsible..Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in 1984/85 theAgricultural Finance Corporation disposed of 11 vehicles at a total cost of KShs.330,000/- You will find that they sold each vehicle at a . price of KShs.30,000/-. I wish I was there to buy one? I do not Know what	 type of vehicles theywere. No open public tenders were advertised. Of the 11 vehicles to be sold, eight of them were sold to the staff members. I am just trying to give a few examples on how we are losing public funds; I will be quoting  from the Public. Accounts Committee reports, as I go on.Sir we have the local tendering system in which local tenders are locally advertised. I  am calling upon the Government to ensure that all tenders are advertised internationally if they are meant for international involvement. It is very unfortunate to allow just a handful of officers to have the onus to give such tenders to the international renderers. Before any Government guaran¬tee is made by any parastatal organization, such a guarantee must come to this Houser I am appealing that we must now use our supremacy the National Assembly, not- to accept to guarantee any Government loan unless and until we are told how the tenders will be awarded and how the funds will be utilized. Since we have the power to guarantee, in turn we must have the power to ask how such money we have guaranteed is going to be spent and how international tenders will be awarded. </Newspeech>	QUORUM	<Newspeech>DR.
