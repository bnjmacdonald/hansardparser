SPEAKER: 	Hon.  Members,   it  is  most  unpleasant  for me  to  stand here  once  again  and  announce  the  death of another dear  friend and  colleague who passed away on Saturday, 7th  April  after a  long illness. I am  referring to  the  late  hon.  Silas  Mburu Gichua,  Member  for Nakuru North,  a constituency he  represented  from March, 1988  until  the  time  of his  death. The  late  hon.  Gichua had an outstanding political  career  and served with distinction  the  people  of Nakuru as  the mayor of Nakuru Municipality from 1974  to	1978.	He  was  a  staunch supporter of  the  ruling Party,  Kanu and astrong Nyayo  disciple.	He  will  be  sadly  missed  by  many who got to know him hereand  outside  this  august House.  On behalf of us  all,  and on my own behalf,  I convey  our  most  heartfelt condolences  to  the  bereaved family,  constituents  and friends  of the  late  hon.  Gichua. Hon.  Members,   in  our usual  tradition,  let us  rise  and observe a few  moments  of silence  in honour of our departed colleague. </newspeech>(Hon.

MAKHANU  asked  the Minister of State,  Office of the President what were  the militating reasons  leading to the  scrapping  of civil  servants'  allowances in respect -accommodation on  posting,  medical disturbance and contracts  for  lady officers. <newspeech> THE  MINISTER  OF STATE,  OFFICE OF THE  PRESIDENT	(Mr.  Kyalo):	Mr.Speaker,	Sir,  I  beg  to reply.As  a result  of abuses  in respect of ot-patient medical allowances, special accommodation allowances and disturbance allowances,  through fraudulent claims,  the Government was forced to withdraw these allowances due to the fact that  the  funds  voted by Parliament were being misused. 	Appointment of female officers on contract terms  was  withdrawn  in order to  accord them parity oftreatment with male  officers  . </newspeech> <newspeech> MR. MAKHANU:   Mr. Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the reply by the Minister,can he assure this House whether or not the withdrawal Of these allowances is not in contravention of the terms and conditions of services of civil servants?   Is he aware that the issue is dimoralising the civil servants? </newspeech> 	<newspeech> MR. KYALO:   Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we appreciate-the point raised by the hon. Member, the issue in questiOn is that the funds voted by Parliament were being abused and</newspeech><newspeech> MR. A. I. MOHAMED:   On a point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   The Minister is telling us that the funds allocated for those purposes were misused, and that is the reason that led to the withdrawal of the allowances.   If the officer who were entrusted with the funds were misusing  them, then that is a criminal offence. Is it in Order for those entrusted with the administration Of the funds to subject the rest Of the Civil Service to problems? </newspeech><newspeech> MR. SPEAKER:   Hod. Mohamed, that is a supplementary questinn and not a point of order. </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  KYALO:  Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you have stated, that is a supplementary question and not a Point of Order.   However,  I would like to reiterate that the Government is reviewing all aspects of these allowances and, definitely, a solution will be found. </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  A.I. MOHAMED:   Mr. Speaker, Sir,  can the Minister now answer my supplementary question? </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  SPEAKER:   Can you repeat your supplementary question, hon. Mohamed? </newspeech>	<newspeech> MR.  A.I. MOHAMED:   Mr. Speeker, Sir, the Minister has told us that the  funds allocated for Civil servants'  alIowances were bing misused.   Is it in Order for those entrusted with the administration of the funds to subject the rest of the Civil Service to suffering? </newspeech><newspeech> MR. KYALO:   Mr. Speaker, Sir,  the truth Of the matter is that the funds Voted by Parliament got exhausted during the first month of the financial year, that is,  July.   That meant that there were no more funds to pay the allowances. </newspeech><newspeech> MR. MANG'OLI:   On a point Of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   We need your guidance here because we asked this Question with proper intetions.   Is the hon. Minister in Order to tell this House that the funds allocated by Parliament got exhausted?  Is he also in order to say that the funds were misused, without tabling any documents here to prove his claims? </newspeech><newspeech> MR. SPEAKER:   Order,Mang'oli.   You may not agree with what the	hon. Minister is saying, but you must learn to tolerate some of the answers given to you. MR. KILIKU:   On a point of order,  Mr. Speaker, Sir.   I think the hon. Minister is contradicting himself.   In the first place, he said that the funds allocated by Parliament got exhausted.   Can he assure this House that the Government will compensate civil servants when the funds become available and that the Compensation will be effective from the date the allowances were withdrawn? </newspeech><newspeech> MR. SPEAKER:   Hon. Kiliku, you have beed here  long enough to know that what you are raising is not a point of order, but a point of argument. </newspeech>	<newspeech> MR. MWAMZANDI:   On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   When a Minister contradicts himself, that is a very serious offence in this House.   The Hon. Minister has contracted himself in that, in the first place, he said that the funds used to be exhausted in the early months of the financial year. He has also said that the funds were being misused.   Since the allowances were withdrawn several years ago, is the minister in Order to contradict himself by not having done his research properly?  We want him to tell this House whether the allowances were withdrawn due to misuse or due to exhaustion.   If the allowances were withdrawn due to exhaustion, then why does the Office Of the President not ask the House to allocate more money? </newspeech><newspeech> MR. KYALO:   Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no contradiction in what has been stated.  The fact of the matter is that as a result Of the abuses, the funds got exhausted in the first month of the financial year, that is, July. </newspeech> <newspeech> MR.Arap:   Mr. Speaker, Sir,  Can the Minister tell the House how the funds were being misused? </newspeech><newspeech> MR. KYALO:   Mr. Speaker, Sir,  in so far as some  of these allowances were Concerned, with particular reference to the out-patient medical allowances, what used to happen is that although officers were allowed to claim KShs.4,000/-, some officers would claim the amount at one go while the allowance was suppsed to be spread throughout the financial year.   Practically everyone Would presentchits to show that he has been treated as an ott-patient so,  as a result, almost every Officer claimed the allbwande and, hence, the amount allocated got exhausted. </newspeech>	<newspeech> MR. MAKHANU:   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in the Minister's reply and my subsequent supplementary question, the Minister has not really told this House why, in the first instance, these allowances were withdrawn; he has not given us specific reasons and he has also not told us which officers were involved in the alleged racket.   Was it the permanent secretaries or the junior Officers? Sir, I remember that I did ask whether the Minister was aware that the withdrawal  of  the allowances was in contravention  of the terms and Conditions of service for civil servants, in which case a civil servant should be able to take the Government to court.   As far as I know, the Civil servants' terms arid conditions of service are still in force and they have not been  revised and, consequently, the withdrawal Of the Said allowances has affected the  in the Civil service  ,leading to things like Corruption for civil servants to survive.  Can the Minister Confirm or deny that? </newspeech><newspeech> MR. KYALO:   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there was no contradiction.   The fact Of the matter is that the funds were being misused in every aSpeCt.   For example, I have said that in so far as the out-patient medical allowances were concerned</newspeech><newspeech> MR.  MANG'OLI:   On a point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   The House   is almost convinced that this Question has not been dealt with fully by the Office of the President.   IS the Minister in Order to deny that there has been a Contravention Of the terms and conditions of service for civil servants when the hon. Questioner has given him the facts?   Indeed, the Minister is avoiding that question,  and it is my view that since that is the situation,  the Question should be talked back to the Ministry so that more research can be done. I am saying that because "the withdrawal of the said allowances is in contravention of the terms and  conditions of the civil service and therefore,  Civil servants Can take the Government to court. </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  SPEAKER:  What  is you point of order, Mr. Mang'oli? </newspeech><newspeech> MR. MING'OLI:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, my point of order is whether the Minister would Agree with me that  his reply to this Question is most unsatisfactory and this clearly shows that he has not dealt with it properly.:  In view of this, therefore,  the Question should be taken back to the Ministry so that this House 	 can be given a proper answer later.   The Minister has just been going round and round the  Question without giving us the proper answer. </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  SPEAKER:  I  suggest you give the Minister more time to explain what the position is. </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  KYALO:  Thank you very much,  Mr.  Speaker.  In so far as the out-patient medical treatment is concerned,  the  Government is going to include this aspect in the National Hospital  Insurance Fund Amendment  Act. With regard to disturbance allowance and other allowances,  this issue is being reviewed and at the moment, discussions are  going on and no doubt the best method is going to be found to compensate civil  servants who have lost as a result of the withdrawal of these allowances. </newspeech><newspeech> MR. SALAT:  Mr.  SPeaker,  Sir,  if I heard the Minister well,  he said that the medical vote that  is normally given is to the civil servants for their out-patient treatment is exhausted before the  end of the year. Would he tell us What  is wrong with that .If I was entitled to Shs.4,000/- for My out-patient treatment annually,  is there anything wrong in withdrawing that allowance?. </newspeech>	<newspeech> MR. KYALO:  Yes,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there is everything wrong about it if you withdraw the allowance when you are not sick because, then you would be robbing people who are  genuinely  sick of their entitlement. </newspeech>	<newspeech> MR. WASIKE-NDOMBI:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  arising from the Minister's reply, I would like to draw his attention to what the Question is talking about.   The Question is talking about the scrapping of the civil servants allowances in respect  of accommodation  on posting,  medical,  disturbance and constracts allowances for lady  officers.   However,  the Minister has only referred to misuse of out-patient medical vote. We would therefore like the Minister to tell, this House what led to the withdrawal od accommodation allowance on position, and disturbance allowances, Secondly, if there was misuse of funds on the ouy-patient vote as	   he  says,  could he tell us what  disciplinary action  was taken against those officers that misused these funds.   We in this House would be the last people. to  tolerate anybody in the civil service to practise fraudulent accounting to 	 rob the  Government. 	So,  if there 	was 	same misuse of money through fraudulent accounting,  then we would like to know what disciplinary measures were taken against  the culprits. so that  the majority of the civil servants do not  suffer just because of these few greedy people? </newspeech><newspeech> MR. KYALO: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  action was being taken from  time to time against  officers who abused their privileges.   However,  as time went on these abuses   became mare and more  and has the Questioner has  rightly put it, there is a limit to the  extent to which you can punish a majority of these people,if the regulation under which you are working is faulty.   As I have said,   action is being taken to ensure that a proper arrangement is worked out to compensate officers who have lost as a result of the  withdrawal of these allowances.   We do not want these people to continue suffering just because the regulation is faulty. </newspeech><newspeech> MB. MAKHANU: Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  in one of his replies,  the Minister did say. that  special accommodation and disturbance allowances would be reviewed whenthe  financial position improves,  could he give us an indication When the financialposition  is likely to improve.	I am asking this because it  has been thenormal way of answering Questions in this House to just say,  "When the financialposition improves or when funds become available".</newspeech><newspeech> MR. KIALO:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the financial position will improve whenwe  are given adequate provision during the period of negotiations for funds.However,  at this particular moment,  we cannot say whether we shall be givenadequate funds or not,  but we are pressing very hard to ensure that we are givenadequate funds for this purpose. </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  SPEAKER:  Next Question. Mr. Ibrahim! </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  MANG'OLIY: On a point  of order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  In view of the factthat  the reply to this Question has been most unsatisfactory, would I be in orderthrough the  Chair,  to  ask the Minister to take back the Question to the Ministry  	so that   he  can bring relevant information to this House later.  We would like to know from the Minister when this scheme is likely to start .again. We are  asking this on behalf of the People who elected us to come to this House and  we would like the Minister to gve us the correct answer to this question. Therefore, Sir, we would like the Chair to ask the Minister to take back this Question to the Ministry so that he can bring a reply to this House later to tell us when this scheme would be revised.   This touches on the lives of our people and therefore,  it  is	</newspeech><newspeech> MR	.SPEAKER:  Order Mr. Mangoli!	If-you take some trouble to go throughthe , Standing Orders of this House, you would find an answer to what you are now trying to ask. If you are not satisfied with  the reply to this Question,  it is provided in the Standing Orders that you can see the Speaker, who may allow you to raise the matter on a Motion for Adjournment. 	Next Question! </newspeech>Question No.98 MR. MOHAMED	asked the  Minister for Livestock Development since a large number of people in the arid and semi-arid areas depend on camel's as a source of livelihood,,what  steps  he is taking  to improve both their productivity and marketing of its product both locally and  overseas. <newspeech> THE MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT 	(Mr. Mwangale):  Mr.  Speaker, Sir,  I beg to reply. First of all,  I would like to  apologize because my answer is a little bit longer than I thought  and I hope that  the House will be patient. 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we have  about 700,000 camels in this country with a rate of  increase of between 30 and 40 calves born to every 100 camels per year. Camels play a vital role by providing  sustenance for a majority of People in the 1. relatively drier areas of  our Republic. Camels also produce meat, milk and are also used for  transportation.   The potential for  the camel lies on its exceptional qualities to  survive in the  arid and semi-arid areas.  Camels continue to lactate longer with a higher yield during drought periods than other stock.Camels  are also more  tolerant to heat and are less dependent on water than other livestock.  Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  camels  can withstand  extreme de-hydration without  their appetite  being affected. 	Camels  nave  a  better. enVironmental  impact than other animals  as they do not  compete  significantly with them due to their different  feeding habits. Camels  also  utilise plants which are unpalatable  to  other stock may increase  grass  cover by checking  bush destruction. Thus  increased numbers  of canes can be  kept with other  livestock in an area without  significantly reducing the  latter's  feed resources.  This  enables higher  stocking rates. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  due to the  camel's  foreging habits and their large  floppy feet,  higher numbers can 	be carried on fragile arid lands with little  danger  of ecological degradation.	The  camel isalso a potential foreign exchange  earner.	In 1989	,  the Ministry,  forinstance,  authorised  the  exportation  of 3,400 camels.	In view  of the  	camel's actual and potential  importance my Ministry has deployed	152  suitably qualified extension staff in the  arid and semi-arid areasto  enlighten wananchi  on camel husbandry and marketing.	In this respectmy Ministry has established the  following projects   in conjunctionwith various donor agencies.We have  the Turkana Camel Project.	This project  is fundedby NORAD.	We  also  have  the  Farm-Africa Camel  Improvement Projectwhich is  supported  by.	Non-Governmental Organizations  and variousinstitutions.'   This project  is  being implemented in Samburu and Wajir. We  also  have  the  Camel Extension Project  in Samburu which isfunded by the Federal Republic  of Germany and it aims at  improvingcamel husbandry through research and  extension. Mt.  Speaker,  Sir,  my Ministry is  also promoting the marketing of camels by creating awareness among wananchi outside the  traditional camel rearing areas  on the usefulness  of the camel.In.this respect we  introduced  over 1,000.breeding camels  to KajiadoDistrict in 1989, and sold them to farmers at a subsidizedprice.Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is also exploring potential overseas markets particularly in the Middle East. In Order to boost the sale of camels, My ministry is also not restricting their exportation at the moment. We are also in the process of establishing a Kenya. Camel Research and Extension Centre. This centre will beEstablished in wajir in order to assist in the development and uplifting of husbandary breeding qualities of the camel.Thank you. </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  A.I.  MOHAMED:	Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  while  appreciatingThe Minister's answer, we have a lot of problems as far as the  healthof these primels is concerned.We have problems  in areas like  WajirCan the Minister tell us what steps his ministry has taken in order_ to cure  the various diseases that  attack. these  animals? </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  MWANGALE:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we treat the  camel likeany  other livestock whenever it  is  affected by any disease.I am sure that  my District Veterinary Officers are  there  and as I said  before, Wajir District  is  one place where not  only are we  placing ourCamel research centre, but  also we  have  a very strong donorfunded project going on there.I am sure  that  if there  are  anycamel diseases there.they are  being dealt with on thespot. </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  SALAT: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  since we  have  a large  camel population in the  country,  and  since we  have  the Kenya 	Meat  Commission,  I wonder whether,the Minister could ask the K.M.C.  to  buy more  of these  camels  for  slaughter . so  that  camel meat  is  eaten in-this'country and the  surplus exported. </newspeech>                                <newspeech> MR. MWANGALE:	Mt. Speaker,  Sir,  the K.M.C.  is not  equippedto handle  carves as yet..  We know that  there  is potential  forthat  and we are  looking into the matter. </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  A.I.  MOHAMED:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the Minister has said that  his ministry is not restricting the  exportation of these animals  and we would request  him to assist  the  small-scale  traders who  deal with these  animals  so that they can export  them to the Middle  East  and  such other countries. </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  MWANGALE:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is precisely whatI meant when I made my earlier statement.	Any trader who may wishto  export  those  animals  should come forward.	However,  it  is  important  for us  to recogniSe  the  fact  that we do  exnmina,  very strictly, the   amount  of foreign exchange that we  earn from such animalson a kilo-basis  for each of the export licence  approved.  So,  we are not  going to approve  any export without the assurance that all the  foreign exchange will be  ploughed back into  the  country and that we  are  getting the  best  prices  for the  commodities:- </newspeech>Question No.  91 Owners  of :	Associated Sugar Company Ltd.MR.

It  cannot  be  that  there  are  no proprietors  on whose  behalf the 	receivers  are  managing the  firm.	That  answer,  therefore,  is  vague. </newspeech><newspeech> MR.

MANG'OLI:	Mr. question is who the proprietorsof the  company  are,   on whose  behalf  the  receivers  are  managing the  company. </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  GACHUI: 	Mt.  Speaker,   Sir,  the  hon; Member  is aware that  normally receiverships  are  normally  on behalf of the  creditors and  the  current  creditors  are  the Kwale  sugar  cane  farmers,  Kenya Government  and  the  Bank  of Baroda. </newspeech><newspeech> MR.

As  there  are  about	41,000  acres  of  estate,  could  heconsder  sub-dividing the  acreage  to  the  .	creditors  and  theKwale  farmers  benefit  from the  farm,  other than  just  letting it remain unused  for so  long? </newspeech><newspeech> MR.

OKONDO:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, I have  just  said that thecheque was  sent  by registered mail to Mombasa.So,  I cannothand it  over to  him! </newspeech><newspeech> MR. SPEAKER:	Next Question,  Mr. Kiliku</newspeech> Question No.	97.Termination of Services - Air France Employees MR.  KILIKU	asked the Minister for Labour why the management of Air Prance  Ltd.,  Nairobi,  did terminate the  services  of five  senior Kenyan employees late last year. <newspeech> THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR  (Mr.  Okondo): 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, I beg to reply. These employees were_management staff. So,  they were  senior staff members  of Air France  Ltd.  and they were  four,  not five,people. These  four people were  dismissed by Air France  Ltd.  because  the company alleged  that they had  transmitted confidential material to  outsiders  and,  therefore,  breaching confidence  and trust  and could not perform their duties  anymore  as management staff. </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  KILILU: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  senior Kenyan’s services were a. terminated because  on 26th October, 	1989,  they wrote  a letter to the  Regional Manage,complaining about the behaviour of Mr.  Donald who  was using abusive  language  towards  our Government. When  they protested against Mr .  Donald using this letter that I am holding now,  their  services  were  terminated because they were patriotic. Could the Minister tell the  House whether: he is ready to protect those people  who are  patriotic; the  people who are protecting the good image  of the  Government? </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  OKONDO: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I very much appreciate  citizens who  are patriotic  and we  encourage  them because that is what the nation needs;    everyone  of us  should be patriotic,  but if he is not,  then his right to be  a citizen is questionable.I verymuch appreciate  citizens who  are  patriotic.However,  a patrioticcitizen should take  appropriate  action at the right time when the matter arises.	So,  when this matter occured  in 1989, whyis it that these four gentlemen did not report direct to me immediately,  or report  to  other authorities? 	Why did they have  to  go  out and talk to other people,  write outside,  report to  the Press  and  so  on instead of reporting to me  or to  the Department of  Immigration? </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  KILIKU:	On a point  of order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir. I amsaying that when Mr.  Donald used abusive  language  against  the Kenya Government,  these four people reported this matter to  a Regional Manager, Mr.  Botik,   	Air France  Ltd. 	So,  the Minister  should have  taken action against the person who was using abusive  language  against  the Government. But  instead of doing that,  on 1st December,.1989, the four employees were written a letter stating that there were instructions  from the  Headquarters,  Paris,  to terminate  their serviges even without  indicating the  reason why.  Is  the Minister, therefore,in order to mislead the  House? </newspeech><newspeech> MR.OKONDO: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I am not dodging anything. I will be	the  first person to  act on a patriotic  issue  because  I am Very patriotic.	It is within my system and it works with me.	Thefact is that  these  gentlemen have reported this matter to me now.But  they went  all over the places,  to  outsiders,  to the Press,  but theynever reported the matter to me  or to  the  Immigration people. </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  KAMUYU:	Mr.  Speaker, Sir,  four very patriotic Kenyanshave  lost their jobs by unscrupulous means in an international organisation. This matter could  set  a very dangerous precedent to other international organisations. What has  the Minister done, and if nothing, what does he  intend  to  do now that the matter has been reported 	to him?will he summon the management to his office andquestion them,  and then he  comes to report back to this House so that we  are  aware  of what is happening? </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  OKONDO: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  now that  the matter has  been reported to me by the four gentlemen concerned,  one of whom has  . already taken his way out of the whole issue,  I am taking action.  I have  instructed my Labour Officer,  Nyayo House,  to go out and find out  all  the details  and report back to me. 	The issue is in process now;  action is  on right now,  as President Moi's Government is  an action Government. </newspeech><newspeech> MR.KILIKU: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  appreciating the Minister's last remarks that  action is being taken right now,  could he  tell us in whose  favour the  action is being taken? Is  it  in favour of the  four senior Kenyan employees  or is it in favour of Mr.  Donald who  abused the Kenya Government? </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  OKONDO: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when an incident has been reported,  I must go there with an open mind to  look at both sides -of the case. 	If I find the party that  is wrong,  that is  the  side or  the  party that  I prosecute  and follow to  the  last minute. </newspeech><newspeech> MR.

We would like  our four Kenyans  to  be  given a fair treatment. </newspeech> <newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOUFESM AND WILDLIFE  (Mr.Awori):  Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to reply. The claims of Messrs Mulinge Ngila amounting to KSh.11,250/-,Josephat Mulembai:. KSh.8,400/-,. and Wilson Nziu, Ksh.5,600/- wereall approved by the Machakos District Wildlife  Compensation Committee  on 23rd Februry, 1987:   However,  due to unavailabilityof  funds,  these claims have not been settled. </newspeech>End E.  <newspeech> MR. WAMBA : Mr.speaker, Sir, when will funds become available? In 1989, I asked the same Question, and the same Assistant Minister replied that those claims would be settled during the 1989/90 Financial Year. After asking the same Question again, the Assistant Minister has told so that those people cannot be paid due to unavailability of funds. Why Does the Minister not consider the issue of domestic animals which are eaten by wild animals seriously. So that those people can be compensated. Can he tell us when those people will be compensated? </newspeech> <newspeech> MR. AWORI: Mr. Speaker , Sir, the Ministry takes all  claims very seriously. It is correct to say that we do not have enough funds. For instance, at present the amount outstanding for Machakos  District alone is Kshs.21 million, while the amount outstanding for the whole country is Kshs.210 million and yet the amount allocated for wildlife compensation during that Financial  Year was only Kshs.2 million. The whole amount was spent in settling amounts in ordered by the Law Courts in the following manner: Messrs Said Mwaniki Wamlai  Kshs.360,000/- Bruce  Musonga Madete, Kshs.50,000/-, Agricultural Finance Corporation on account of  debts owed  to wildlife compensation claimants Kshs. 1,051,000/</newspeech><newspeech> MR. WAMBUA: on a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I did not ask for the analysis of wildlife compensation claims of other people. My Question is based on particular people. Why have they not been paid?I did not ask how much money machakos District needs for wildlife compensation claims. My Question was: when will those people be paid, and what criteria do they use to decide who is to be paid first? </newspeech> 17.	et 	 <newspeech> MR. WORI: The criteria used is the availability of funds. As I had said earlier, the amount of money allocated for settling wildlife compensation  claims in the whole Republic was Kshs. 2 million during the 1989/90 Financial  year. In Machakos District we have Kshs. 21 million outstanding, part of which belongs to those three claimants. </newspeech><newspeech> MR. WAMBUA :Those  people  forwarded  their  claims  forms back   in 	1984   which  is  seven  years  ago,   and  vet  they  have  not been paid. could  the  Assistant  Minister  now  tell  us  when  those people  will  be  Paid? </newspeech><newspeech> MR.   AWORI: I  appreciate  the  enthusiasm  of  the  hon.  Member, but  what  can  we  do?   We  have  only Kshs.2  million  for  wildlife compensation  for the  whole  country. 	We  cannot  convert  Kshs.2  million into  Kshs.210  million. </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  MALEBE: The  Assistant  Minister  has  just  stated  that the  Kshs.2  million  which  was  budgeted  for  wildlife  compensation  claim for  this  Financial  Year,  was used  to  pay wildlife  compensation claims  which  were  ordered  by  the  law  courts. Does  the  Assistant Minister  want  to  tell  the  House  that  every  claimant  should go  to  court  so  that his claim  can  be  settled? </newspeech> <newspeech> MR.   AWORI:I  never  said  that  every  claimant  who  wants to  be  paid  must  go  to  court. There  are  some  more  cases of this nature pending  in  courts  which  have  not  been  settled. </newspeech><newspeech> MR. MALEBE:On  a  point  of  order, Mr. Speaker,	Isthe  Assistant  Minister  in  order  to  deny  what  he  has  just  statedhere?	He  said  that  the	Kshs.2	million  allocated  to  his Ministryfor  wildlife  compensation,   during this Financial  Year,   was  laid  to claimants after the law  courts had ordered  the  Ministry  to  do  so.If  that  was  the  case,   does  the  Assistant  Minister  want  to  imply that every  claimant  should  take  his  case  to  court,  because  he  is  only   Considering the claims which have gone through the law courts. Otherwise, out of the claimants who were paid, could he give us a list of those claimants he paid after a court order was givenAnd those claimants who were paid without going through the court?MR. AWORI: The total amount of Kshs. 2 million was paid to claimants who had gone to court. As I had said earlier, there more claims to be patd, There were over Kshs. 10 million which the court had ordered to be paid, but we have not been able to settle those claims because we were only allocated Kshs. 2 million. </newspeech><newspeech> MR.P.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I agree with the Assistant Minister when he says that his Ministry has no funds to settle compensation claims. But since the Ministry knows the amount due for wildlife compensation, why does the Ministry not make a provision in its budget during the next Financial Year. So that all outstanding claims are paid? I am sure that this House will be ready tonapprove those funds. </newspeech><newspeech> MR. AWORI: Mr. Speaker, sir, the total amount that is outstanding is more than the total allocation of the whole Ministry. Whether we make a provision or not, it does not matter because budgets are prepared in accordance with the availability of funds at the Treasury, there is very little we can do to correct the situation. </newspeech><newspeech> Mr. arap CHEPKOK: on  a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think the Assisant Minister is misleading the House. What criteria does the Ministry use to decide who is to be paid first? Sometimes you find a person who forwarded his claim a year ago is paid, while a person who forwarded his claim ten years ago is left out. </newspeech><newspeech> MR.

Administration  Police  to  demolish  the  Makuti thatched  houses  that  were constructed  by Mr.   Changawa,who illegally  moved  into  the  land  belonging	to  the  Tana  Salt  Company Limited.	The  background information  is  that  Mr.   Changawa  moved  into the  land  belonging  to the  Tana  Salt  Company  Limited,   sometimes  in December,	1989  deliberately to  try	and  attract  some  compensationfrom  the  Company. Prior  to  that,   Mr.   Chansawa  Was  living,  very peacefully  on  Government  land  adjacent  to  Tana  Salt  Company  Limited. </newspeech>(END…F) DDN.	<newspeech> THE  ASSISTANT MINISTER,  OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT	(Mr.  Keen)	(ctd.):I  would like to advise Mr. Changawa to go back to where he was living before. ;•7 because a demarcation exercise  is about to commence soon and he will considered 	along  with the  other  squatters  living  in the area. </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  BIDU:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  according to the written reply by theAssistant  Minister, he has  talked of two huts  while the original Question talks oftwo houses;  which  is  which  here  now?  Could he clarify that point to the House? </newspeech><newspeech> MR.   KEEN:	Mr.  Speaker, Sir,  these  were  just two huts and not houses. </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  NDZAI:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  being a poor man,  perhaps,  this mancould not afford  to  build permanent houses.	In his  reply the  Assistant Ministerhas  said  that these  houses  were  demolished because  of a chief's  order. Since we.know that when  a chief asks somebody  to vacate  some  piece  of land he has  to writea  letter  to  that  person, could the  Assistant Minister confirm whether this  chiefwrote  Mr.  Changawa any  letter?	Could he  also  inform  the  House the  number of daysthat Mr.  Changawa was  given to  vacate that piece of land? </newspeech><newspeech> MR.

The  chief's  quit noticeletter was:  Chief/FUL/AGR  14/166  of 10th January,	1990  and the  other reminderwas:  Chief/FUN A/AGR  14/119  of 29th March,	1990.	He was  actually given severalweeks  to vacate  the  land,  but simply  because he  wanted to attract some compensationfrom  the  company  he  defied both  the chief's  and the  district officer's  orders.	Asa result, therefore  a  bit  of coercion had  to  be  used    to effect  the 	/contents  of these  two  letters. </newspeech><newspeech> MR . KAMUYU:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  heard the  Assistant Minister sayingthat  these were not houses  but huts.	Could  I  know  what he means by  that?

WAGURA: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  hon.  Kamuyu will appreciate the fact that municipalities and all local authorities in the country have powers  to increase rents due  to  the rising cost of living.

Once  this road is  completed,  it will not be affected by floods because it is now being raised to a higher level  than the existing one. </newspeech><newspeech> MR. ARTE:	On a point  of order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir. 	While appreciating the  fact that  repair works are going on,  I would like to say that right now, over 20 vehicles. carrying goods to Garissa are stuck in the mud. What arrangements is the Minister making to rescue those people? </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  SPEAKER:	Mr.  Arte,  that  is not a point of order but a supplementary question. </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  MIBEI:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as I have said; I have given instructions to the  Contractor and the resident engineer to open up the flooded portion of the road. </newspeech><newspeech> MR. NUNO:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we know that  the Garissa-NairobiRoad is an important road which links Nairobi with North-Eastern Province. Couldthe Minister consider establishing a permanent road maintenance unit at Bengal? </newspeech>  <newspeech> MR.  MIBEI:	We  shall consider that. </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  SALAT:	On a point. of order, Mr.Speaker, Sir.	I appreciate theanswer given by the Minister although he talked of a "flooded area". The area which we are talking about   does not flood but has black sticky daysoil and vehicles cannot pass through it.   While the resident engineer's   work 	 to bitumenize the road from Kilanga to Garissa  is appreciated,  could he be instructed to move to the section of the road where there is a Problem and pour some murram since all the    machinery is there?   This is because if this is not done,  the people who are  stranded there might starve in the next two days. </newspeech>                             END…..I  <newspeech> MR: MIBEI:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we have  already done  that, although 	the  area is not  flooded, asthe hon.  Member says.  But it is affected by the  floods  and that is why vehicles are get  stuck  there. Sacking of workers by NCPB </newspeech><newspeech> Mr.  MAKHANU:Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to ask tha Minister for  Supplies  and Marketing the following Question by Private Notice. 	why were  the  services of Messrs. Titus Siayi Kisach, Jackson Tuwei,  George  Busera,  Ezekiel Ombaba,  Bernard Ayieko and Fredrick Mbaisi,  all former  employees  of the National Cereals and Produce  Board,  Eldoret Depot,  terminated in April, 1989? </newspeech>	<newspeech> THE MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr.  Mudavadi): Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to reply. The reasons for the  termination of services  for the persons  in question are  as  follows. 	Mr.Titus Kisach Was  working as  an Assistant  Depot Manager,  Eldoret,  when the National Cereals 	 and Produce  Board 	(NCPB) 	management discovered in April., 1989,that he  had. prepared and authorised four members of staff,  namely George Busera, Ezekiel Ombaba,  Fredrick Mbaisi  and Bernard Ayieko,  to draw imprest amounting to  Shs.1 million purportedly for payment of casual employees  at  primary collection centres which were not specified. While  the imprest warrants  signed by the  officer   named above, as  part  of cash,  the warrants themselves did not represent genuine imprests  transactions  as no  funds had been issued out  against them. The  motive  for  preparing these  dummy imprest warrants was to replace  the  previous unretired imprests issued to various members of staff and  some  casual employees. Audit  investigations  confirmed that Mr.  Kisach had initiated the cover up and making out of the false  documents. In  so  doing the  officer had abused the  confidence 	 the Board in him as  an  employee.	The  officer was,  therefore,  addresseda disciplinary show cause  letter and subsequently suspended from duty on	22nd June,	1989,to  allow the  Board    to  determine  hiscase.	He  was  consequently dismissed from the  service  of the  Board	with effect  from 22nd June, 	1989  and advised accordingly on 25th October,1989. Mr.  Jackson Tuwei was  working as  a Depot Cashier,  Eldoret, when in April, 	1989 an audit investigation revealed, gross mismanagement of  the  depot  cash account:  The  cash account was in an awful state; reflecting serious  shortages  and Payment  of over Shs.1 million to  staff, including casuals,as  imprests.Mr.  Tuweihad turned the  public  funds  into a source  of Free loans to staffin form of imprests.	The  circumstances Under which the Imprestswere  given out were  unjustified and reflected a corroborative	networkbetween Mr.  Tuwei,  the  depot manager and his assistant.	Mr.  Tuweiwas  a central figure  in the  syndicate when the  dummy imprest transactions  I referred to  earlier were made. 	He  had thus abused the  confidence  and trust  the  Board had in him as an employee. When the  Board management interviewed this officer on 21st Apri1,1989, he  failed to  give  a satisfactory explanation of the  charges levelled  against,  namely mismanaging public  funds  and failing to report  both the  shortages  in the  cash account  and the huge imprests given  out to  staff.  This  officer was  also given a show cause letter on	2nd May,	1989.	His  case  was  placed before  the BoarL!l_ichdecided that  he  be  dismissed,  and was  dismissed from	-employmenton 22nd November,	1989. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  other  four  officers,  Messrs Busera, Ombaba,  Ayieko  and Mbaisi,  had similar  offences. 	They were  working as  stores  clerks  at  the  Boards  Depot,  Eldoret,  when in April, 1989, the  same  audit  investigation showed that  they had  signed for the dummy imprests  as  follows:	Mr..Busera	-  Shs.280,0001;  Mr.  Ombaba-290,000/-; Mr.Ayieko -Shs-170,000/- and Mr. Mbaisi	-  Shs.260,000/-The  imprest vouchers  for these  amounts  indicated that  the  money was intended to  be  paid  to  casual employees  at  some unnamed primary collection centres. It  was  further  established that no funds were. issued  against  the  imprest Warrants in Question and the motive of signing the documents was to cover up retired imprests held by the  depot  cashier,  Mr.Tuwei   By engaging in this fraudulent transaction,  these officers  abused the  trust  placed on them by the Board.	Accordingly,  each one of them.was  addressed a disciplinaryshow cause  letter  on 26th April,	1989.	They were  subsequentlysuspended  on 22nd June,	1989.	Their cases  were  deliberated  on on3rd October,	1989  and they were  dismissed.Finally,  I  would  like  to  point  out  that  all these  cases were determined	following the relevant  disciplinary procedurepand that  should any of the  dismissed officers  feel dissatisfied	withthe  Board's  decision he  at  liberty to  seek redress in  a court  of law.	Thank you,  Sir. </newspeech><newspeech> MR. MAKHANU:   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, while thanking the Minister for that lengthy and elaborate reply,  I have contradictory information,  which is in writing. Around 29th March, 1989 a message was  sent  from the  NCPB head  office  to  the  Eldoret Depot Manager,  a Mr.  Mwangurui  informing him that a Mr.  Jinah from going to check on the  cash position at the  Board's Eldoret Depot. 	Subsequent to  that  information the  senior officers at the  Eldoret Depot,    who  were  the  superiors  of the  six officers named here,  met to  decide what  to  do because  they issued themselves with imprests  amounting to  Shs.1 million..   They then  decided to have Mr.  Kisach and the other concerned  offiders  sign for dummy imprests,  as  the Minister has  said,  in order to make the auditor from the head office believe these  junior  officers  were  the  ones  holding the  imprests. These officers  signed for the dummy imprests in order to save the senior officers,  who  included the  depot manager,  who  actually held the imprests.	I have documents here  which show that  the  imprestswere  held by the  depot manager,  area manager and. so  on and not by any of these  junior  officers. I  also  have  letters  from the Managing Director,  Maj.  Koitaba and Mr.  Kitur,  which indicate  that the imprests over which these  officers  were  dismissed were  dummy. Now,  why should these  officers  have  been victimised when they  did not  hold no  funds  at  all. 	In Viewof these facts,  could the Minister  order  the  reinstatement  of the  six officers? The  depot 	 manager,  the  area manager the  depot auditor and other  senior officers  can then be  followed up because  they are  the  ones who are holding imprests  amounting to  Shs.I million</newspeech> END…..I   <newspeech> MR.  MUDAVADI:	Mr.  Speaker,  sir,  I  would  like  to assure  the  hon.Member  that  investigations  into  that particular case  have not been finalise,  and if  the  Depot  Manager or  the  auditor  involved  thinks  he has got away scot-free, maybe  he  should get  rid  of those  dreams.  The  Ministry  is going to follow up the matter  to  the  end,  and  if  the Depot Manager  is  found  to be a party  to  this,  he will  also  have  to  face  the music. In  the  case  of reinstating workers,  if they signed  dummy  imprests,  which were  fraudulent documents,  whether they touched anymoney  or  not,  it  is  clear  that  there was  some malicious intentions and  that there  were  accomplices  to a felony or an  intended felony. </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  MAKHANU: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to rehiterate that it can be proved  from  these  documents,  which  I  am going  to lay on the-Table of the House, that  these  imprests,  one  of which  I  am holding here,  were actually dummy documents,  and  the  Board  knows  this fact very well. These  officers  never handled any  cash,  and  it  is  my  contention and  request that  the Minister orders,  on  the available  information,  that  these  officers  be  reinstated  forthwith without any conditions  and  that  investigations  into  the matter go  on.	In  fact,  these peopleshould  be  able  to  assist  the  State  in  investigating  this matter.	I  am  going  tolay  these  documents  on  th  eTable  of  the  House,  and  only  request  the Minister to reinstate  these  officers  forthwith  because  the  relevant  information  is  available. (Mr.  Makhanu  laid  some  documents  on  the Table  of  the House) </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  MUDAVADI: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  do  not  think  I  would  add  any more to  this  issue  because  these  were  dummy  imprest  documents,  and,  for whatever reason  the  officers  in  question  signed  dummy  imprest  documents</newspeech><newspeech> MR.  CHEPKOK:	On  a point  of order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.	The  Ministeris  misleading  the  House,  and we  cannot  allow him  to  do  so.	As  a Minister,  youcannot  release  somebody  who  has  stolen Shs.l  million  by merely  removing him  from service  and  let  him go  away  freely  without  taking  him  to  a  court  of  law. Why should  this  happen? </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  MUDAVADI: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  appreciate  the  hon.Member's comments  and,  indeed,  share  his  sentiments,  but  I  said  that  investigations  into the  matter  have not  been  finalised. 	Once  the  full  facts  involved  are  established  and  proper  evidence  is  obtained,  everything else  that  is  necessary will be done. You  can  only  take  somebody  to  court when you can establish your case</newspeech>	<newspeech> MR.  MALEBE: On  a  point of order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir. Is  the  Minister for Supplies  and Marketing in order  in  informing us here</newspeech><newspeech> MR.  SPEAKER: 	Order,  Mr.  Malebe! 	This  has  got  to  be  a point of order,  and  not  a supplementary question. </newspeech><newspeech> MR. MALEBE: It  is  actually  a point 	of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. All  I  want  to  know  is  whether  the  Minister  is  in order  to  tell  us that there  is a practice  in  the  National  Cereals  and Produce Board of anybody,  including clerks  and  store-keepers,  to  get  imprests  in  the  region.of Shs.500,000/=. Is this  in  order? </newspeech><newspeech> MR.  SPEAKER:	Let  us  move on  to  the  next Order. </newspeech><header> POINT OF  ORDER </header> <newspeech> THE  ASSISTANT  MINISTER FOR ENERGY	(Mr.  M'Mukindia):	On  a  point  oforder,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.	I  would  like  to  thank  His  Excellency  the  Presidentvery much for appointing a probe committee  to  look  into the coffee  industry. For a long  time  now,  there have  been serious complaints  from all  coffee-growing areas  in the  country,  especially  the  co-operative sector,  and  farmers  have  been calling  for  some  kind  of  committee  to  look  into  matters  affecting the  whole coffee  industry.	We  must  thank  His  Excellency  the  President  for  coming  to  therescue  of these  farmers.	We  are  aware  that millions  of Kenya shillings  havebeen  given  to  individuals  at  the  expense  of small-scale co-operative  farmers. We  are also aware of serious misuse of funds belonging to very small-scale. farmers and,  although  these  farmers  have  cried out  in  the past to people  in authority  to assist  them,  their  cries  have  not  been heard.	Once  more,  only His  Excellency  thePresident has  come  to  the  rescue of our people.	We  cannot  forget  the  fact  thatrecently,  he  did  exactly  the  same  thing in so far as  the tea industry is concerned nor can we  forget  the problems  facing the  sugar  industry,  the Kenya Meat Commission,  Uplands  Bacon  Factory  and  the  cotton  industry  which collapsed a  few  years  ago. 	There  are  also  problems  facing the Continental  Bank and the Rural Urban Credit  Finance  Ltd.,  where  people  actually  stole money  and got away scot-free. 	I ttthink  time  has  come  for  us  to  realise  that when all  these  things are  taken together, they  amount  to  an economic  sabotage  and  cause disaffection  between wananchi  and their Government  and  the  President. 	We  must,  therefore,  come-out  strongly and see  whether  any of.our  laws  protects  driminals.or managers  who end up carrying out  criminal  activities. 	The  Question  that  the  Minister  for Supplies  and Marketing has  just  answered  was  put  in  the  same  vein. I  must  say  that  the  laws  governing parastatal  bodies,  especially  that section  which  seems  to  say  that  managers  are  not  personally  held  accountable  for whatever happens,  irrespective of whatever they do,  need to be  looked at again. The  Attorney-General  should  look  into  these  laws  and  direct  that,  under all circumstances,  we  ought  to  be  personally  accountable for misappropriating public funds  and  be  followed  so  that  our  livestock,  shops  and  farms  may  be  sold  to -recover misappropriated  public  funds. 	I  urge  this  probe  committee  to  follow  up whoever  is  found  to have misappropriated  public  money  so  that  his  land,  house or  car may  be  sold  to recover  this  money. As  I  speak  here  now,  people  in my  own constituency  in Meru are trying  to  uproot.coffee  trees,  and yet  they have no other source of livelihood. As  at  this  moment,  some  dairy  farmers  have  not  been 'paid  for  three months,  and this  money  has  just  disappeared. I  think  we  must  look  at  this  thing as  an economic  sabotage,  which amounts  to  a  political  sabotage,  and  regard  it  is  being treasonable,  as  it  undermines  the  stability  of our Government and the  trust  that people  have in  it  and  in His  Excellency  the  President.	This  also  undermines  theconfidence  that people  have  in us,  as  leaders.	So,  we  must come out  stronglyand  protect  our people  without fear.	Those  who are guilty  should be  followed upto  their houses  so  that they may pay back  this money. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,' I  do not wish  to go further,  except to thank His Excellency  the President once more  and remind managers,  especially Meru coffee managers,  that  in  the old Meru  tradition,  if you stole  from poor people,  you were  put  into  a  beehive  and  rolled down  into a river  to drown.or wrapped  in dry banana leaves  and  set  ablaze. 	This  is  what  used  to happen  to people who stole from the weaker  people,  and  there  should  be  no difference  today. 	Although  I  am not advocating  such  extreme  measures,  certainly strong measures should be  taken against  such wrong-doers. Thank you. </newspeech>End  J  	 <header> BILL </header> <header> Second Reading  </header> <header> The National Archives (Amendment) Bill </header> (The Minister for Labour on 29.3.90) (Resumption of Debate interrupted on 5.4.90) <newspeech> THE MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT 	(Mr. Mwangale):   Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I arise to support this Bill, which seeks to establish the Kenya National Archirves and Documentation Service.   The Bill also seeks to provide for the preservation of public records and other connected matters. Mr. Speaker, Sir,  the key differende between this amendment Bill and and the principal Act is that every permanent secretary or head of Government. departmert or chief executive of any state corporation. Or local authority is required to supply the director with all copies of ducuments which are necessary for them to be stored as part of our heritage.   We must consider the establishment Of the Kenya National ArChives as part df the linkage between our past, present . and the future.   When you look at the history of this country, a lot of people forget that if it were not for the fect that archives were kept for researchers, historians, academicians end librarians to be able to go back and look at what happened before,  we would not be in a position to find out what happened during the earlier years in the colonial period. Mr.  Speaker, Sir,  the colonial government went to an extent of ensuring that all important documents Connected with the type Of maltreatment and mismanagement Of our Country were either destroyed Or taken away.   Even some of the documents that relate to the Kenyan freedom struggle were taken away at the time of Independence. Some of those doCuments were Of historical value because they represented the. contributidns Of the various Kenyans in the development of Our Country.   What we wereIeft with were documents which would not particularly tell us the type of conributions that we made in the past to fight for our independence.   It is, therefore, important that we support the establishment Of the National Archives and Documentation Centre because today we are here, and we do not know what may happen tomorrow.  For example,  Mr.  Speaker;  Sir,  supposing the documents relating to the concempt Of the district focus for rural-devlopment were not kept,  the future generation would never know the basis On which we decided tO establish the strategy. SO,  I believe that this Bill has come at the right time to update the original ACt which we have had for a long time.	It will also enable us not to call theman in charge of Our archives the Chief archivist.	Of course,  the word "archivist".is jaw-breaking,  and it is Only proper that the man i  cheige Of the archives be Called a director like what they have in other countries. The Other point I wauld like to mention is that it is important for us to give sufficient funds to this department. 	As it is,  when you look at the funds alloceted to this department in the 1989/90 Financial Year,  we Only voted KE642,291 for the reCurrent expenditure. 	This money is not enough to run a documentation service department,  which is very vital.	This money was allocated becausein this country we have tended to ignore Certain departments which are Of much value to us but which do not present themselves that easily. Far example,  when you take our art centres or national theatre and look at the galleries, we have not been able ta do what other countries have done.   "In Other Countries, national theatres,  galleries and museums are considered as part and parcel Of the heritage Of  those countries. In our country we have not been able to appreciate this kind of thing,  and I think it is about time that we funded the national heritage Organisations such as archives,  art galleries and Museums  sufficiently in order to preserve our Past for posterity. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when you look at the development expenditure allocated for the Kenya National Archives and Documentation Centre, you will find that it is K£41,000 only,  a sum which is not enough. 	Kenya is a rich Country,  a very powerful one in Africa and the world today. In Order for us to be able to be proud of what we hav achieved,  we need to give sufficient attention id the areas where the   is a lot more cultural apprediation than we have done in the past. That is why I am appealing to the Treasury to be kind and be more inclined to support these natianal institutions which do not normally attract that much attention    during  our  discussions on our budget.	If today you go to a donor country and askfor money  to develop  national  archives or art aalleris,  that Money will not be forthcoming.  Donor countries  are ready 	to give us money  for  the development of livestock  industry,  road  construction and  teleCommunication equipment but not for anything that preserves our heritage. 	That  is why  it  is  important for us  to ensure that  the money we allocate for  the Kenya National Archives  and Documentation Service is enough.   The money We have alloated during this year is not enough. Therefore,  we must lOOk  forward to really  budgeting far future project and 1ook at where we are going. • Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when you go to the National Archives, which are housed In  the Old Kenya COmmerdiaI Headquarters Buildings, you find that they are very crowded. 	That Will require  us  to  budget for  this  service in order to have  its Own building.   Let us choose a site which also carries the same national heritage that we are trying to preserve I  notice in  the programme  that  the department has  not been sufficiently funded to acquire the type Of equipment that will enable modernisation. Today records  are not kept  in files;  records all over the world are stored On various catridges  in the form Of new technology like computers,  microfilms  and  So  on. I  am  told  that the department  is  now  trying  to acquire Only One Computer this year. I  believe that each of the three provincial documentation Centre should have computers  to ensure that all records are put On Catridges or On computes. At the same time,  information should be stored and  saved as quickly as possible for use. END ……k Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  supporting this Bi11,  I believe that as a country, we have to ensure that  sufficient  finds are voted for rendering some of the 	 services that do not normally attract too much attention in the budget.With those few remarks,  I support this Bi11, hoping that in future we shall be able to vote additional funds to render   this service. </newspeech><newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION -AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Nassir):Ahsante sana Bw. Spika, kwa kunipatia nafasi hii nizungumze juu ya MSwada huu wa Public Archives. 	Katika nchi hii yetu,  tunahifhadhi mambo mengi muhimu, lakini ni  lazima tuugeuze mtindo wa kuhifadhi mambo yetu kulingana na vile Mwenendo na hall ya nchi yetu ilivyo.   Wakati wa Serikali ya kikoloni, kuna mambo kadhaa ambayo yalihifadhiwa, lakini mambo hayo   hayakuwa muhimu sana kwetu.. yale yaliyokuwa muhimu kwa Mwafrika,  hayakuhif adhiwa   Kwa mfano, kuna mambo muhimu sana yaliyofanyika wakati wa kupigania Uhuru wetu, na wakati ule,  watu wetu wengi walikufa,  wakati wengine walifungwa jela na kupigwa viboko na wakoloni. Ingawa hivyo,  ha.lcuna vitabu vinavyoweza kuwaonyesha watoto wetu taabu kuhwa iliyowapata watu wetu.   Nayati Mzee Jomo Kenyatta alikuwa mmoja wa wale ambao walijitolea maisha yao iii kuupigania Uhuru wa nchi hii na kila wakati, alikuwa akiwaambia wageni wasiuchezee Uhuru wetu. Aliwaambia vile Uhuru wetu ulivyopatikana ill wajue ulipatikana kwa njia ya taabu kubwa. Kwa wakati huu,  nchi hii imeendelea sana chini ya uongozi wa NtukufU 				Rais  Daniel aran Moi lakini mambo haya yote hayajaandikwa kwa vitabu, na kama wageni Wanaokuja katika nchi hii wangeyasoma mambo hayo, hawangesema mambo maovu Kuhusu nchi hii.  Lakini kwa vile hatuyaandiki mambo yote yetu ya maendeleo ili  kuwaonyesha watu katika ulimwengu ni mambo gani yatunayofanya, wataendelea kusema mambo yasiyo ya kweli.   Mivi karibuni,  nchi hii imeanza kinmeanisha magari na kadhalika.   Vile vile,  tumenjenga Shule, mshospitali na kadhalika. Tungetaka mambo hayo vote yaandikwe na rekodi hizo zote  zihifadhiwe vizuri ili watoto wetu wapate kujua ni kazi gani tuliyofanya. Kwa wakati huut ule moyo wa Marambee wa kuchanga pesa za kuendesha miradi ya maendeleo katika nchi hii,  ni muhimu sana. Kwa hivyo, watoto wetu ni lazima wajue kwamba tulikuwa na mtindo huu wa kupendana. Ni-lazima vitabu viandikwe vya kuonyesha vile  Serikali yetu inavyoendeshwa na vile tulivyopata taabu wakati wa.ukoloni. Bw.  Spika,  mara kwa mara,  kunatokea fujo za aina max mbali mbali katika nchi hii na kama hatungekuwa na-kiongozi mchupavu,  sisi wngine tnngekufa moyo. Lakinikwa sababu ya uchupavu wake Mtukuft Rais arap Moil  tumewezakuendelea. 	Kwa hivyo,  ni lazima mambo haya yote yaandikwe na kuhifadhiwa kwa manuu ya vijukuu vyetuo   Ukiangalia katika upande wa vyakula, nchl hii yetuimebarikiwa sana kwa vyakula vya aina mbali mbali..  Ni laZima wageni wanaokuja katika nchi hii,  waogyeshwe vysinfla vyetu.vya aina mbali mbali na watiwe moyo wa kuvitumia.   KWa hivyoi  ni  lazima vyakula vyetu viwe vikiwekwa katika Menu katika mahoteli yetu.   Ukienda katika nchi ya Uchina, kwa mfano, utaona kwamba hawatumii vyakula vya Wazungu,  ball wanatumia vya tmla vyao. KWa hivyo, ukienda kule na kusema,  "I want an English dish",  huwezi kupata. Ajabu ni kwaMba hoteli yetu hayapiki vyakula vya kienyeji. Ni lazima wageni wafundiShwe kuvitumta vyalnlla vyetu; ni laztma vile vile wafundishwe miraa zetu, takiendelea vile tunavyoendelea kwa wakati  huu,  tutanata taabu kubwa sana katika siku sijazo. Bw.  Spika,  ni lazima mambo mazuri tunayofanya yaandikwe katika vitabu  na kuhifadhiwa. Kama nilivyosema Napo mwanzoni,  maMbo.yote ya kunigania Uhunt wetu,  na yale mengine yaliyofagytka baada ya kupata Uhuru,  hayakuandikwa kwa vitabu.   Kwa wakati ule,  tulikuwa na shule chache sana katika nchi-hii. Vile vile tulikuwa na vyuo vikuu. vichache.-  Kwa upande wa matibabu,  tulikuwa na hospitali  chache  sana,  lakini chin ya mpango wa HaraMbee,  tuliweza kujenga 	Shulei, na hospitali  za kutosha..   Pengine moyo huu wa Barambee hPnjulikani sana katika ulimwengu, lakini hapa katika Kenya, tumeendelea  mbele sana chini ya mvango huu.

Members  that  the  Government is very committed to the  retrieval of records  relating to Kenya.	Detailed  surveys were  successfully done  to  determine  where  the  specific  documents  are. The second  stage  was  to  start the  retrieval exercise,  and up  to now we  have  retrieved  a lot  of records,  many of them related to the  struggle  for our Independence.	A guide  index is being publishedfor the  records retrieved.so far so that the Kenyans  can come  and read them. 	My Ministry has taken this matter very seriously by posting officers to  London between 1980 and 1989 to facilitate the retrieval process: 	I  am satisfied that  a good  job has  been done  in  this  particular  subject. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir, 	my Ministry has also worked out a comprehensive  programme  for constructing a proper new  Archive  Building in the near future. A plot for this purpose hasalready been  set  aside  and the Ministry will build a purpose design Archives Building when funds become  available. I also wish to inform the House that my Ministry has a long  term policy to  establish Provincial Records Centres in every Province in order to  enable  the National Archives to implement the  Public  Archives Act 	(Cap.19) more  effectively. Such record centres  have  already been established in Mombasa,  Nakuru,  and Kakamega.   Discussions are underway on the establishment of another record centre at Kisumu. 	As hon.  Members are  aware,  the record centres outside Nairobi work very closely with the Provincial Administration in the  selection and preservation of available Government records  and,  as  such,  the Ministry will Continue to work very closely with the Provincial Administration.  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  during the  debate  on thePublic Archives	(Amendment)  Bill,  hon.

I  am happy  to  say that my Ministry has  initiated themodernisation programme  for the National Archives. This will nodoubt  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  our Kenya National Archives. Once  again,  I  am pleased to  inform hon. Members  that the Ministry has already taken steps to increase the Department's capability in this direction. 	Today,  our National Archives  is  one of  the  leading institutions  of its  kind in East and Central Africa. I Wish to  inform hon.  Members  that  have more  than  a million records  in the National Archives here. I would also like  to  take this  opmortunity to  appeal to  Kenyans  to go  to  the Public  Archives and  see  those records,  especially school children	primary,  secondary,and  other colleges,  or even scholars because  we  have a room now for every body.	We have  a room for researchers who would like toconduct their research.	we  have  a place  for school children andeverybody else.

The  hon.  Members  are  aware  of that "infamous mouth" thatcame  into  our real  income  and our savings called  "Inflation".Thosewho  are  still working do get  some compensation in form of wages  and  salary increases from time  to time. is a way of reducing the  real value  of a pensioner’s things. The value  of a pensioner. But  "inflation"   Worth 20 years  ago  is,  of course, far from the value  of today._ So,  the  purpose  of the  Bill  is  to provide for the  grant of pension increase  to retired public  officers as a result of a Government  decision contained in paragraph 17 of Sessional Paper No. 	3  of 1985,wherein it was agreed that retirement benefits payable to public  officers will be reviewed consequent upon the acceptance of the  recommendation of Civil Service Salaries Review Committee of 1985  chaired by Mr.  Ramtu. 	The Bill covers second and  third instalments  of pension increase payable in conformity with the provision of paragraph 17 of Sessional Paper No. 3  of  1985. The  first  instalment was  paid  in accordance with the provisions of the Pensions	(Increase)	(Amerament) Act No.	13  of 1986.	It has notbeen possible  to pay the  second  and third instairents of theincreases which were  due  on 1st July,	1986,  and	1st  July,	1987,due  to  circumstances beyond our control. 	However,  financial   provisions have now been made  to cover arrears  of pensions due  from1st  July,	1986.The  increases payable  have been worked out by the Government actuary on the  basis  of the percentages granted to  serving public officers under the Ramtu Salary Review so  that the  lowest paid pensioner gets the highest percentage increase while the highest  paid pensioner gets the smallest percentage increase, taking into account the  date the pension was granted.   No increase shall  be payable under this Bill on any pension which became payable on or after 1st July, 1987. Since the  increases being granted are intended to compensate pensioners for the loss of their purchase powers due to inflation, it is intended to review subsection 1(3)' of the Pensions (Increase) Act 	(Cap.190) so that all pensiohers are granted increases payable. </newspeech>                                                                      END N.  PG NO 54 NOT READABLE  0.2  10.4.90PG  NO :  55 first para NOT READABLESir, When the Pampu	Committee	Report   was   acconted   by the	Government	it   because 	necessary   that   the   payment of   the   pensionsBenefits be	spread   over	a   period   of 	three	years in   order   to	enable the	Government	to accumulate	money   from   all	its   sources   of	income so	that   the   fund   of   the   pension could	be increased.

There  will  be  a  pensionarrears  of  K£6.5.   million.	That  is  a  big  sum of  money  to  raise,and  therefore,   the 	approval of  the  Bill  will  mean  an  increase  of / expenditure. 	Thereafter,   the  additional  annual  expenditure  from  the Exchequer  for  that  purpose  will  be  approximately  K£1.9  million  for the  current  Financial  Year. Sir,   just  as  the  Mover  of  the  Bill  said,   due  to  the  various market  factors  surrounding  the  existence  of our  nation,   there  will  Be an increase in per capita expenditure. In other words, there will be what we right call a short fall, if the pension payable to the pensioner contains unpaid. It is therefore, necessary that from time to time to see how best the retired pensioners can make for that short fall experienced as a result of rise in cost of living, inflation, and so on, so that they can live comfortably after retiring. Therefore, this is a very important Bill.Sir, we should all thank the Government because it has shown that it does not only look after the working force, but also looks after the needs of the pensioners. The Government is grateful for their past performance and it will continue to review the pensioners benefits in order to enable then to live comfortably. The Bill is very short and it eliminates the already existing second schedule in order to bring a new schedule reads:-1.	“pensions commencing on or before 1st july, 1996:-(a)	not exceeding £226” will be entitled to “£3 or 11.51 per cent of the pension whichever is the highAs outlined in parts (b) (c) and (d), that principle  applies     Mutatis rudendis.In paragraph two of the schedule, there are pensions commencing on or before the 1st july 1997. The some is a little higher there. The pensions commensing on or before 1st July, 1997 which are not exceeding will have an increase of £8 or 10.22 per cent of the pension whichever is the higher.                                                                                                                          (END……O)   	Looking at part	(a),	(b), 	(c)  and (d)  of the pension's Bill’s  schedule one can                easily work out the  amount the  pensioner is going to receive. So.  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  sir,  this  is a Bill  that  aims at making  legislative  the  recommendations of the  Ramtu Commission Report that were accepted. Although this  will  mean an  increase  in expenditure  from  the  Exchequer, this  expenditure  is  fully  justified  for  it will  pay our pensioners. I  have nothing to  add on  to  that  but  to  commend  this  Bill  to  the  House  and  hope  that  the  House    will  see  it fit  to  approve and pass  it.With  these  few remarks,  I  beg  to  second.(Question proposed)<newspeech>Mr.P.J: MASINDE:	Mr.  Temporary Deputy'Speaker,  Sir,  I  thankyou for givingme  this  opportunity  to  contribute  to this  very  important Bill.	I  would  like  to  takethis  opportunity  to  congratulate  His  Excellency the  Vice-President and Minister  for Finance  for  bringing this  Bill  to  the  House. After  retirement and  due  to  inflation, the  amount of money  that  retired officers  receive  as pensions turns  out  to  be negligible.  This  welcome  Bill  is  going to  correct that and  also  help  the pensioners  to  live  a better  life. I  would  like  to request  the Ministry to ensure that the percentage  increase is  on the higher  side so as to help  the pensioners  to  enjoy and appreciate the pension  increase. It  is  obvious  that the  employer,  be  he  the  Government or  aprivate  company,  knows  when  an employee  is  about to  retire.	Unfortunately,  manyworkers have  retired only to  find that there are no arrangements for'the  immediate earning of their  pensions.  In some cases,  although such arrangements could have been made,  you will  find   that retirement  benefits are not released  immediately to catch  up  with  the retired worker.	As  a  result such  a  retired worker  is  forcedto keep  on plying  between his home and Nairobi  to try to get his pension. I  would  like to request	those  concerned to  ensure  that  the retired worker begins  to enjoy his pension  immediately he  retires. 	This  is  because  if such a  thing does  not happen, then  these  workers  run  into  problems  because  they still have children for whom  they  have  to  pay  school  fees and whom they have to feed. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  the other problem is that even for those  who  have  retired and are receiving their pensions,  they do not receive them regularly.	Since  there seems to be a communication breakdown somewhere,I   would	like  to request the  Ministry to check and see that such retired workers receive theirpensions  regularly. 	There  are  cases of such people who  leave their homes to go to collect their pensions from the district commissioner's office only to be told that  there  is no money there since it has not arrived.	Such people have to usetheir money  to go to the  district commissioner's office and sometimes they  areeven stranded there  because  they do not have any money to take them back to their homes. Since  these people have nothing to fall back to they are forced to go back to  the  district  commissioner's  office  after  two or three  days  where again they are told that  there  is no  money  there. So  I  would like  to suggest that this  thing be looked  into  so  that the  pensioners.can get their money. regularly. The  Office of the  Vice-President and Ministry of Finance could even  computerise  the workers pension  schedules  so  that this  money can react them as  fast as possible  in their 	 respective  areas,  be  they  in  Mombasa or in the  North-Eastern Province. The  most difficult  part of these  pensions  is  when widows  want  to claim their husbands  pensions.	Something somewhere has gone wrong about thisissue.	I  would  like  to  appeal  to the  Office  of the  Vice-President and Ministry ofFinance  and  the  Attorney-General's  office  to  look  into this  issue  seriously, especially  where  the  public  trustees have  to  take over such funds.	On  many occasionswhen  a husband  dies,  the widow  has  to  take  care  of  the  children.	The  first  problemthat  faces  these  widows  is that	they  do not know where  to start claiming their husband's pensions.	So  I  would  like  to  suggest  that the  widows  are  educated  and  informed  .about  this  issue.	The  husbands  could also    be  advised to  inform  their  wivesabout  the  procedures  to  be  followed  if they  die before they start collecting their pensions.	One  problem could be that the husbands  may   not be  willing  to give outsuch  information if they have more than one wife. So  the  Office  of the Vice,President and ministry of Finance could thrOugh  its  field officers  and'through the  services  of the chiefs,	ensure  that widows  are given sample  information on how to   go about collecte'ing  their husbands  pensions. 	This  way  their  sufferings and that  of  their children will  be  reduced.                                                                 END P…… Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,,I am glad that  this Bill has comeup now because,as I am speaking now,	I  have quite a number of cases brought to me by widows seeking to know what is happening to  their husbands'  money.	Whenthe   district commissioner follows this matter,  he is told "We want to know the amount of money required for school fees,  clothes" and so on.	They forget  thatthese widows have a duty to feed their children.	They only get  the  money forschool fees and uniforms and   such money is sent by cheque direct to the schools or  to  the uniform makers. The  children may be  in school but the widows find it very difficult  to feed them. the Ministry concerned  should look into this matter and tabulate the amount of pension payable to a deceased family and assist the widows to get it in good time so that they can be able, not only to Clothe the children and Pay their school fees,  but also feed them.   This matter lies mostly with the Public  Trustee. 	I have-cases which I have taken up with the district commissioner and he has written letters to these offices but replies have not been forthcoming. 4sU Since  the district commissioners are very busy with other matters,  they sometimes.do not follow-such cases up.Because of this,  the widows frequent the offices of the district commissioner-from time  to time where they are  told "He have written to the Public Trustee but   wehave not received any reply."   The poor women just sit back because they do not knowwhere  to go next.I would appeal that although we are discussing the increment of the pension,we  should also streamline ways as to how it should be received without tears.With those few remarks,  I wish to support the Bill. </newspeech> <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Dr.  B.A. Godana):	Thank you,  Sir,for giving me this opportunity to make a very brief contribution to, this Bill. 	I  think this is a very welcome Bill whose ultimate object is to try to push on Pensioners of a certain category against inflationary effects. It shows that  this Government is genuinely concerned about those members of our society who have already got out of active working life and who need to be placed on some effective  system of   social  security benefits. 	The Bill is  straightforward and we do not need to dwell on its provisions as such but I think it is necessary to make one or two comments on  the disbursement of pensions which the immediate speaker dwelt on. Without repeating what the  immediate speaker said, I think I need to emphasize the fact that the system by which we disburse pensions to retired public servants   needs to be overhauled. It is time we designed a way of decentralising the management and disbursement of pensions to provincial headquarters. I am saying this because a time comes when some public 	servant   who 		may have been at the bottom   cadre for many-years and who may have not eventravelled to their provincial headquarters before, when they retire,  they find  problems getting their Pension because they have to travel to Nairobi to attend to their  cases personally. The amount  involved may not be enormous but they are forced to  cater for transportation costs,  accommodation and so on.   Very often,  such people are forced to take loans to enable them get their pension.   When they finally get the pension,  Most of it goes to pay the loans which were  secured to cater for their transportation and accommodation expenses. Under  the principal Pensions Act Cap.	190,  Section	17 (1),	it is provided that where a pensioner dies,  that   is,  a retired public servant who isalready earning pension,  his widow or a dependant as the case may be, areentitled to  the same Pension for a further period of five years.	This  is a verynice provision.	In practice	-  in those areas where the rate of education isgenerally low – once a pensioner dies,  the dependants immediately  lose thebenefit of getting that pension.	This is because very often they are ignorant Of the fact  that they are remaired to present themselves to the relevant office with the appropriate documents which always include the death certificate. Situations are  common when a pensioner retires in the rural area,  say, Turkana or other nomadic areas,  and dies  there  far from any hospital   or registration centre.   When family members go to a Government office tryine to secure some of the money,  which is their right,  they are told that they must bring the death certificate. I  think this calls for us to step   up and-try to correct this anomaly. Perhaps,  the Attorney-General himself can look into   ways of correcting that anomaly in the  short-term before the registration system becomes effective and spread to all parts of the country. Another related appect which I went to comment on is with regard to the payment  of   social security benefits to the dependants of deceased public servants who have retired. I believe  there is a general group insurance scheme covering all civil servants including the hon. Members of this Hlouse. This scheme  is charged with securing certain financial benefits   towards the dependants of civil servants who die in the course of their employment. ;T The law in this country,  as in all common law countries,  has a doctrine called"privity of contract" which says that where X and Y conclude a contract,  it is only X and Y who can sue under that contract.   We have a situation here where the insurance  contract is made,  hopefully,  to help the dependants of a deceased public servant. As it is,  the person who is a party to the contract with the insurance company,  is the Government  in all cases.	There is one policy;  one party is theGovernment and the other Party is the insurance company.	To the best of myknowledge,  the  insurance company,  in all cases,  seems to be a parastatal body. It seems  that whenever a person dies, because of too many common problems, the beneficiaries rarely benefit. I am talking about this because I have tried to follow up certain specific cases,  including a case of a late hon. Member of this House who died in 1982.  Problems often come up because  the families of the deceased persons donot know about  the  existence of such Provisions against the,bread-winners.	Theburden of informing the  insurance   of the death of the individual rests withthe Government which is a party to such a contract.	Often,  due  to the bureacracyin Government departments,  the death of an individual is not nofitied to the insurance company within the stupilated time. For  example,  only a few months ago,  I had to go to the headquaters of the Kenya National Assurance Company regarding the would be benefits of an administration policeman who had been shot while on duty in Garissa some years back.   The lawyer who also is the claims manager,  told me "Mr.  Godana, you are a  C lawyer like myself and you  know very well that I represent the insurance company   andthe  Government did not notify us on time with regard to the death of this youngman.   There is nothing I can do."                                               END…..Q R.1……10.4.90This is a situation in which we would wish the family had recourseto  the  law. 	However,  since family members  are not parties  to  the contract,  they cannot  sue  the  company.-   I think the Attorney-General should initiate  some corrective  legislation in this  area. 	Similarly,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  even where. the  Government notifies  the  insurance  company of the  death - in the case  of the Members  of   Parliament  who have died I think the  Clerk of the  National Assembly's  office  has  always notified the  insurance company of the  death - and it  says  the  claim is not legitimate, -there  is nothing the relalives  of the  deceased can do. 	I have  in mind the  case  of the  late  hon.  Umuro  where for some reasons it was indicatedthat he had been killed by shifta bandits,  and the insurance company refused to  pay his  company on the  grounds that he  died   .. under warlike  circumstances. As  a lawyer,  I feel if this  company had been taken to  court  it would have  found it  difficult  to refuse to  pay. However,  the  family had no recourse  to  the  law the law because  it was  not  a party to  the  contract;  again it was  the Government that  was  a party to the  contract. I know it is difficult 	for the  Government  to resort to  court  procedures  to  enforce  such individual claims  every time  they arise - perhaps  they would take up the  entire  time  of Attorney-General's Chambers.	That is why Iwe  should initiate  corrective  legislation in order to rectify the  situation. With those  few remarks,  I. beg to  support. </newspeech>	<header> QUORUM  </header> <newspeech>DR.WAMEYO:	On  a point  of order,  Mr.  Temporary DeputySpeaker,  Sir.

Mrs.Ndetei,   you  have   the  Floor. </newspeech><newspeech>MRS  NDETEI:	Thank  you,  Mr.   Temporary  Deputy  Speaker  forgivtng  an  opportunity  to  contribute  to  this  very  important  Bills which  talks  about   pensions  for  retired  Kenyans. 	This   is  because today  pension  is  a  very  important  contributing  factor to the  well-being of  retired  Kenyans. 	The  Vice  President  and Minister  for 	Finance has  done   a  good  thing  by  proposing  amendment  to  the    schedule  that grants    increases  to  those   pensioners  who  left  employment  before 1985. In the memorandum of objects and reasons, it is stated that the intended  review  is  in  connection  with  the  Ramtu Committee  Report  of 1985  and,   therefore,   the  Bill  covers  the   second  and  third instalments   of  increases  payable  on	1st  July,	1987.	while  this  isquite	acceptable,   I  would  like  to  Point  out  that the amount  ofpension payable	today,   even  to  those   left  service  after  the  period  in Question,   is  not  enough  to  pay  for the  increased  cost  of  living.Some 	pensioners  who used to earn Shs.7,000/- per month 	when  they 	 were  in  employment   are	not  being  paid   a  pension  of  about  Shs.1,500/-  a  .  month. 	These. are  people  who  had  got  used  to  a  certain  standard of   living;   who  have   children  in  school;   who   did  not  benefit  the  last time  the  law  on  pensions  was  revised  and  who,  it  seems,  are  not going  to  benefit  from the  review  we  are  talking about  now. I, therefore  propose 	 that  the  Vice  President  and  Minister  for  Finance  should seriously  look at  Section 3(1)  of the Principal Act with a view to  repealing  it   so  that  all  our  retirees  can  benefit  from  this  review. This  wi ll  encourage   our  retirees  to  set  up  businesses  instead of Iam  going  back  to  compete  for  employment  with university,  college and  school  leavers. we have   people  who  retire   at  the   age   of  about	45 years and who still have children to bring up.	Due  to   the small amount  of  pension they receive,  they take up posts which could  be  given to fresh graduates  in  order to  supplement their meagre  pension income. I hope  the Vice  President  and Minister for Finance  will repeal this  section so  that all those who have retired  can earn reasonable  pensions.  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  the  same  Act has  a section which talks  of Asian widows  and Asian Families Act. 	But, considering the  period during which we  have  been Independent,  I find these references  a little  out  of place. .  I suggest that the Europeans	Act; and those of any other Act may be catering for Europea,ls and so  on,  should be  incorporated in one Act so that all Kenyans are treated in the  same  way. All Government  officers,be  they Africans,  Europeans  or Asians,  work for the  same  Government and should,  therefore,  be  covered by the  same pension terms. We  also  we have  the Widows  and Orphans Pensions Act. 	But Now I do understand that  women in Kenya are  going to work for the 	 Government  on permanent  and pensionable  terms  because the contract terms  are  being phased out.	So,  I  suggest  that  we  should now havea widowers  and  orphans  pensions  act.	This is because  we  have  familieswhere,  due  to  lack of employment,  a wife  works  and supports the family because  the  husband is unemployed. In such case,  this Bill should provide  for  pension for the widower should his wife  die, because  at  the moment  this is not provided for.  This is a matter which 	should be  considered seriously and the  necessary amendment effected.                                             END…….R Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the Government  for having moved  the  payment of  pensions  to divisional  offices,  unlike in the past when  people  had  to  travel  long distances  to district commissioners'  offices. This  move has  made  it  easier for  old  people who  left  service  in the 	1950's  and 1960's  to go  to  district  officers'  offices,  which are,  in most cases,  closer to  them  than  district  commissioners'  offices,  to  collect  their pensions. Sometimes,  this money  is  delayed,  and someone has  to make about two or  three  trips to  the  district  officer's  office  to  collect  his  pension.	In  the  process,  peoplespend  more  money  than  the  amount  they  eventually  get  when  the  cheque  comes.	Thisis  not  beneficial.	I  know  that  the  Government  is  trying  its  best,  but  it  shouldmake  more  effort  to  ensure  that  this  money  comes  in  time,  so  that  the  district   ' officer goes  to  the  district  commissioner's  office  to  collect  it early  enough  and make  it  available  to  these  old  people  in  time. In  this  case,  pensioners  will  not be  forced  to  spend  a  lot  of money  going to  the  district officer's  office  looking for  their money. On  the  question  of  the  Widows'  and Children's  Pension Scheme,  I would  like  to  say  that many  Kenyan widows  have  been facing a lot of problems because the  procesS  involved  is  very long and they have to prove many things before  they  are accepted  as  bona fide widows  of the deceased public servants. They  have to  travel  to  the Public  Trustee's  office  in Nairobi  or to  provincial district  offices,  which  causes  them a lot of inconveniences  as some of them have  never gone  to any  office  during  the  life of their husbands. When  their husbands  die  suddenly  a  lot of responsibility  is placed on these widows,  as  they have  to  travel  visiting one  office  after another. There  have  been general complaints  from  various  people  that  there  is corruption in the Public Trustee's office.	Someone  comes  along,  he  is  qualified  to get his  pension or</newspeech><newspeech>THE  ATTORNEY-GENERAL	(Mr.  Mull):	On  a  point of order,  Mr.  TemporaryDeputy  Speaker,  Sir.

If this  is  so,  she  must either substantiate  this or withdraw theclaim  unequivocally. </newspeech> <newspeech>MRS.

It  is  a serious  matter to  impute such motives as corruptionin  such  an office  in  the  Attorney-General•'s Chambers as the Public Trustee. 	So, the  Gracious  Lady must either withdraw her claim or substantiate it because, through you,  Sir,  I  cannot accept  it. </newspeech><newspeech>MRS.

People  talk,  and we  are their watchdog. When  we  mention  these  things,  we do so without any  ill motives. We  are  not  criticising  the Government;  we  are only saying that there is something somewhere  that needs  to  be  looked  into.	The  Attorney-General</newspeech><newspeech>THE  ATTORNEY-GENERAL	(Mr.  Muli):	On  a  point of order,  Mr.  TemporaryDeputy Speaker, Sir. </newspeech><newspeech>MRS.  NDETEI:	Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I  am replying to apoint  of order,  and  I  should  not  be  interrupted. </newspeech><newspeech>THE  ATTORNEY-GENERAL	(Mr.  Muli):	On  a  point  of order,  Mr.  TemporaryDeputy Speaker,  Sir.	The  Gracious  Lady  has  compounded her  "offence".	She  claimsthat  it  is  not just  the  Public  Trustee  alone  who  is  corrupt,  but also theAttorney-General  himself and  his  office.	I  must  now  have  two  types  ofsubstantiation:	firstly,  that  the  Public  Trustee  is  corrupt and,  secondly,  thatthe  Attorney-General  himself or  his office   is   corrupt.	This  claim must  besubstantiated  or  withdrawn. </newspeech><newspeech>THE  TEMPORARY  DEPUTY  SPEAKER 	(Mr.  Wabuge): 	I  think  the  Attorney-General  might  be  right. 	What  I  would  suggest  to  the  Gracious  Lady  is  that  when you make  a  specific  point  to  the  effect  that  a certain office  is  corrupt,  it means that you have  some  material  to  substantiate  this  claim,but  if you say  that you have  just  heard  it  from  some  people,  for  whom you are  the  watchdog,   it  means  that this  is  just general  talk which you cannot be  in a position  to substantiate. 	So,  if you  do  not  any concrete substantiation to make,  I will ask you to withdraw your claim.. </newspeech><newspeech>MRS.  NDETEI:	Thank you very much,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,for your  guidance.	I  said  earlier that  I  was going to withdraw my claim,  butthe  Attorney-General  did  not wait long enough for me  to do so.	I  was  going  towithdraw my  claim without conditions,  but'I had something burning to say first. All  that  I  am  saying  is  that  these widows we are  talking about are old women. What documents  do want me  to produce here?-   They come to me and say,  "I was told to give  Shs.5,000/=  whereas  I have never seen Shs.1,000/. together." </newspeech><newspeech>THE  ATTORNEY-GENERAL	(Mr.  Muli):	On  a  point  of order,  Mr.  TemporaryDeputy  Speaker,  Sir.	The  Gracious  Lady  is  completely  out of order.	She  cannotcontinue  to  talk  about widows  and  orphans  before  she has withdrawn her very' serious  and  grave  accusations  against  my  officers. </newspeech><newspeech>MRS.  NDETEI: Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  let the  Attorney-General  hear  me  now withdrawing my  claim. 	I  withdraw  it. What  I  am saying  is  that  the  widows who go to claim the widow's  and children's  pension  need great  assistance  and  understanding  from the officers  in the  Public  Trustee's  office  and  district  commissioners'  offices  in order to be able  to  continue  to  execute  their  family  responsibilities  that  their  husbands were  charged with when they were alive. Cases  have  been  known  where  the  husband dies  and  the  wife  is  not  in  a  position  to get  access  to  this  pension quickly enough,  and  her  children  are  forced  to  drop  out of  school  and  a  lot  of their  time is  wasted  before  the  money  finally  comes  to enable  them to go back  to school, and  this  is  a waste of resources. This  is  why  I  request  the  office  concerned  to take  more  care  of  the  people  who go  to seek this  pension. The  point  I  am  just  about  to  make  will  also come  up  in the  Pensions (Increase)(Amendment)  Bill  later.	We  are  now  talking about widows,  the wives  ofdead  people,  who  need' a lot of help.	I  know  of one case where a widow was  askedto  produce  her  marraige  certificate,  but  there  was  now way  she could so so because she  had  been married  only  customarily  for more  than 15 years. Her chief certified  that  she  was  the  real  wife  of the  deceased.	Her district  commissioner also madea  similar certification,  but  the  lady was  still required to produce a marriage certificate whereas  her  husband  was  alreardy_ in the grave. 	This  is  why  I  say that  widows  will  need  to  be  assisted  to get  this money  so  that  they might .-	continue  to  discarge  the  responsibilities  bestowed on  them by virtue of the  death of  their husbands. 	Otherwise,   I  think  this  is  a very  good  amendment. With  these  few remarks,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir, 	I support. Thank you. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  MIRUKA-OWUOR: 	Thank you  very  much,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker, Sir,  for giving me  this  opportunity  to make a few observations on this  Pensions 	-(Increase)(Amendment)  Bill. This  Bill  is  welcome'because.it  is  a demonstration of  the Government's  intention  to  show  its  mindfulness  of other  people's welfare. The  Bill  is  going  to  be  of  benefit  to  pensioners  who  have  retired  from  service. The  are  people  who  have  rendered valuable  and commendable  service-to  this  country, and  it  is  appropriate  that  the Government  thinks  about  their welfare. Often,  the Government  has  considered  the  welfare of other civil  servants  and other wananchi, such  as  farmers.	So,  this  Bill  is  very appropriate,  and  we  support  it.There  are  only  one  or  two  observations  that  I  want  to make.	One  ofthem  regards  the  arrangement  for  payment  of pensions  to retired people.	Firstof all,  some  pensions  are  put  into  hardship  when they retire  because  they do not get  their money  quickly enough,  and  for many months,  they travel from their rural homes  looking  for  their  retirement benefits. End  S  I  would  appeal  to the Minister to consider that When a man is about to retire all  his  benefits should be comuted so that he is paid before he leaves the.OfficeArrangemeats  for payment Of the monthly  pension should be effective as soon as -a retiree gets out of his  office,  so that he can be getting his dues without .delay. There have  been cases of pension payments  failing. 	In  the course of the year, you may  not  be surprised  to hear a pensioner Complaining that his payment has not arrived. This  kind  of situation should  be avoided. If possible,  pensioners should be paid  at  the village  level. The Government has  district Officers everywhere throughout 	the Republic  and  there  is no  reason why  a pensioner should come to Nairobi looking for money. 	There   should be arrangements  whereby  One  is  paid either 44:	at  the village level or  at-the district headquarters Where  the Government hasaccounting officers.Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  the object of this  Bill  is  to settlea pensioner  into a new life,  and efforts  should  be made to remove problems whichpensioners  face as  soon as  they  leave Government service.	While on  this, I wouldalso  like to make another appeal to the Government.	Pensioners  are our Peoplewho,  as  I have already sad,  have rendred valuable service to the country. Therefore,  they  should be given some honour and respect in society. FOr example,  On - National days,  pensioners  should be given some special honour by  being given some , reserved  seats. 	When awards  are being made  to  commend people who have rendered good service to the Country,  pensioners should be considered. With those few remarks,  Mr.  Tempbrary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I support the Bill. </newspeech><newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME  AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL HERITAGE 	(Mr. Lalampaa): 	Ahsante sada,  Bw.

MAKAU:Thank you very much,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir.	ThisThis  Pensions.(Increase)	(Amendment)  Bill has  been brought into this House at the •1. right time,  and  I  Would like to take this opportunity to congratulate theVice-Piesident and Minister  for Finance for his good action.END…….T.    This is a very important thing because a lot of Kenyan who have  devoted their time in  serving this country are now going to benefit  from.the Pensions 	(Increase) (Amendment). Bill  once it  becomes law. While  we  appreciate What has been done, we  Would like  to urge  the  Government  to make  sure that  When the review has been done,  the  implementation is done as quickly as possible  so that  our people can benefit  from it. Here,  Sir,  we are  talking  about  the review of  the Ramtu Review Commission  of 1985  due to the current  structural  adjustment programme which has  resulted in the  whole  question of cost-sharing.Today, the  ordinary Kenyan worker finds it very difficult  to  support his family and therefore,  I would  like  to  urge the Government  and  those  concerned to  set  up  another  salary review commission because the  ordinary Kenyan worker cannot afford  a decent living. This is because  the  salary he  receives is very small compared with the current  high cost  living  due  to  inflation. So,  while  we  are  reviewing  the former  Ramtu Review  Commission in respect  of pensions,  I would like  to urge our 	 Government  to consider  setting up  another commission for review of salaries. There  is  also  another  area which is causing  a lot  of concern to us and 	 this is with regard to retirement and N.S.S.F. benefits of  those  Kenyan Workers who have retired from the civil  service.	Everyday in  this Rouse,  Questions are  askedregarding retirement benefits which have not been paid for years.	We  wouldlike  to  urge those  concerned to make sure- that  the gayments/of these retirement benefits  or N.S.S.F monies are  made without under delay.  Similarly,  there are  a lot  of payments due  to  accident victims which have remained unpaid for years. 	I  would like  to urge the  Attorney-General  to  look into  this  matter. At  the  moment  there  are  so many people  who  are complaining due to the non-payment of compensation  claims after  accidents. We have  also  heard many Questions being asked in  this House by Members of Parliament  due  to  the non-payment  of these claims. There  are  cases Where  accident ccmpensation claims are paid through  lawyers and there  has arisen complains where  lawyers have  failed to  remit this  money to  their clients. 	Therefore,  I am asking the  Attorney-Generalt  make sure that the  lawyers concerned remit  this money to the accident  victims once  it  is paid to  them  We  should not hear of cases Where the clients' money has remained in the accounts of these lawyers. It has on a number of occasions been confirmed that an insurance company,  for example,  has paid a compensation claim, but that money continues to be held by the lawyer. 	So,  I am urging the Attorney-General to make sure that this money is paid to  the indivialial  clients. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  another aspect of great concern to the penioners is lack of money. 	Sometimes when pensioners go for their money, they  are  told there  is no money and this problem  ought  to be sorted out administratively.  A pensioner is a person who has worked for a good part of his life and therefore,  When he Should enjoy his benefits,  he should not be delayed unnecessarily. Another area of great concern to us   is the delay in the Payment of death gratuity.   You will find that once a worker dies,  a death certificate has to be produced. 	However,  a lot of people  do not know that When they are pursuing payment for death gruity,  the death certificate is necessary.   So,  I am urging the administration to  educate  the public  that the  death certificate is absolutely necessary. I am saying this because a lot of people find difficulties in having death gratuity paid due to lack of death certificate. Mt.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  as I said right from the beginning this Pensions 	(Increase) 	(Amendment)  Bill is very important since it  is going to assist those who have already retired and therefore,  with those few remarks, I support  the amendment. </newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES 	(Mr.  Mak'Anyengo) Ahsante sana Bw.

These two  aspects who have  only been possible to discuss  becauseof the peace  and   stability that prevails in our country today;   Thispeace  prevails because  the people  of this .	. country have chosento live  in peace under  one party;   So,  the people who are	: advocatingmulti-party system for this country should know that after the introduction of a _ multi-party system in this  countrywe  will cease  to debate  important  issues which are  of great  benefit to  our people;	Instead,  we will be now fighting each other;  eachparty will be  fighting the  other.   So,  I want to congradulate  His Excellency the President  for having guided this country in peace and stability so that  we  are  able to discuss matters that are  important to the welfare  of our people.                              END.V.. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  the  Bill .is very well intentioned.: It gives  various  categories  of pensioners  certain benefits  or certain amounts  of money. As hon.Mak’Anyengo was saying,  if you look at the Schedule,  you will  see that a pensioner whose  pension does not  exceed k£226  per annum only receives K£8</newspeech>	<newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MlNISTER,OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE	(Mr.  kariuki)-	On a point  of_order,  Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir.	The  hon.  Member on the  Floor ismaking very valuable  and  important  contribution.	He  is  also  saying some  very useful  things.	But there  is too much noise  in theHouse  that we  cannot  hear exactly what  he  is  saying. </newspeech> <newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER  (Mr.  Wabuge):	Order!	Order!I think hon.  Members  should have  quiet consultations.	Let us hearthe  hon.  Member on the  Floor in silence. </newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION 	(Mr.  Omido): Thank you, Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker. I was  saying that  if you look at  the  Schedule  of the Bill, you would  see  that a pensioner whose pension does not exceed k£226 	- when this Bill is passed - he  is going to receive K£8 or 11.51 	per cent.  Now,if you read down the Bill,  you will see  somebody Whose pension does not exceed K£1, 003 will receive K£26 plus 	9.91 per cent.	This,  in my review, requires  to  be reviewed.So,  the  order goes  down.	For instance,  you-will see that_the highest .pai pensioner gets K£103  plus	6.15  per cent.	Now,  it may look onPaper that  a  person receiving 11.51 per cent is getting the highest percentage.	But  the  question is:	11.51 per cent  of what?	So,I  am appealing to  the Minister to  see that the  person who is already disadvantaged and who  is  earning less should be given more in terms  of  "real cash" and not in terms of  "percentage".  .This percentage  is misleading because it gives the impression that  the  person with 11.51 per cent is getting very reasonable  consideration    pension are  still earning more money.  So,  this requires a lot of	-examination and I hope that the Vice-President and minister for Finance will look into this problem so that it does not appear to. be  that we  are  actually serving the more  deserving cases thanminding about the people who may actually be worse  off than the Bill portrays.  it has  already been stated that the Pensions  (Increase)(Amendment)  Bill should be  overhauled. Let me inform those hon. Members who have. contributed and advocated for the overhaul  of the  Bill and I want also to  endorse  the remarks made  by my colleague  on the  opposite  side,  hon.  Masinde that widowers and the  people who  go  for pensions are  getting a lot  of problems.They happen to come  to us and we  know it.ourselves  since most of uscome  from rural constitutuencies.   Many people  approach us.after	travelling hundreds  of miles  away to  go  for KSh.100/-.	They  spend up  to KSh.80/- or kSh.100/-  to  get another KSh.100/-!   I think weneed to  look into this problem and  see whether we  can decentralise  the  system,  if not  at the  divisional  Level at the  district  level,  or if not  at the locationL1evel at  the  divisionl level.	Thi's would be better because  at the moment people  spend a lot of time  and money going to  collect what  is very  small  and does not even meet theexpenses which they incur while  going to  collect the  benefits.   the Pensions (Increase)(Amendment)  Bill requires to be lookedinto with regards  to  the widowers because  as hon.  Mrs.  Ndetei  saidlbeltree  of the  working conditions many husbands  are not working,but  their wives happen to  be  working.	So,  when the  wives die  thewidowers  do not benefit from their pensions.	So,  it  is  importantthat  this Bill is  looked into very urgently so that we can cater for a large number of people who may otherwise not be covered now. 	With those  few remarks,  I beg to support.   END W. </newspeech>   <newspeech>Mr. KuRey: Thank you  very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving us a chance to support this Bill. It is a very important Bill because it is giving some in_centives to the people who are currently working for the Government. This Bill will encourage them to work harder, because they know that eventually, they will be well rewarded for the many years that they have worked for the Government.This is a very timely and important Bill and I therefore hope that after it has been implemented, the civil servants will work harder, because they know that they are waiting for some reward in future. After the implementation of this Bill, the civil servants will work for the Government more sincerely.Sir, this Bill should not only concern the Government employees, but also the employees in the private sector. There are some personal emoluments which are paid to workers as gratuity by private organizations, Government parastatals, international organisations and other private companies. Sir, the private sector should also consider increasing the retirement benefits of their employees so that they can also get some motivation. The employees of the private sector should also be well taken care of today and in the future. If we increase the retirement of benefits of the people in the public and private sector, the society will know that we are mindful of other peoples welfare. The Government is the biggest employer in our country, and it has now set the way to the rest of the employers in the country. They should also try and increase the retirement benefits of their employees, just as the Government has done. I am glad to say that some of the organizations have been paying some gratuity or retirement benefits, maybe at a higher rate than the Government, But I still feel that they should try to increase their rates in order to encourage their employees.I would like to commend the Government because it has not only considered those who are currently working, but also considered those who are currently working but also the retired people. That move will make every body feel that they are part of this country, and they have a part to play even after retirement.                                       (END……X) Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  sir,  this  Bill  is a result of the RamtuCommission  Report.	We  should  not  wait until we have a commission before we canreview  things  such  as  pensions.	Such  reviews  should a contant thing. We shouldensure  that  as  we  review salaries we, at the same  time, review pensions because salaries  and  pensions go hand  in hand and affect the  same people. This  will  ensure that salaries  and pensions march with the cost of living which is ever going. 	We hope  that once  such  a review  is  carried out for civil  servants,  the private sector will  follow  suit and review theirs.This  is because workers working in the private Sector are  part and parcel  of the  work-force of this  country and are  thus entitled to  such  benefits. It  is  a credit to the  Government that this  review came through the Ramtu  Commission  instead of the  trade  unions.	This  shows  that  the  Government  ismore  considerate  about the welfare of its workers than the private sector.	Theincrease  of pensions  as  shown  in the  pension's  schedule  is  quite reasonable  because taking  into  consideration the pensions that they have been receiving and the rate of  inflation,  I  realise  that everything was  taken  into  consideration when making that schedule.	I  hope  that this  will encourage  the  civil servants  towards working more  loyaly  to the  Government.	I  also hope  that  it will prevent them from leavingthe  Civil  Service  to enter  into  private  businesses.	This  increase will  show thattheir welfare and that of their family has  been taken care of. 	 It  is  true an other  hon.Members  have  stated,that sometimes  the	processing of pension  claims  tends  to  take  a  long time.It  should  be  appreciatedthat most  workers  do not  prepare  themselves  well  for  their  retirement  period.	Thisis  because  even after  they retire  they  still expect  to keep  on getting their  salaries Most  workess  still  have  responsibilities  when  they  are retiring. 	They  could have children  who  are  still  in  school,  house  rent  to  pay  and hospital  bills  to meet. As  a result  a  retired  worker cannot afford  to  wait  for  a long  time  for his  pension 	because  of these  commitments.	It  is  therefore  important  that  the  money	is paid  tothe  worker  immediately  he  retires.	The  processing  period  of pension  claims  must	 therefore  be  shortened.	I  am not sure  whether it  is due to the  paper  work	or negligence on the part of the officers that causes these delays;  but all in all those concerned should  ensure  that  pensions  reach  the  retired workers  immediately they retire.                                                                END Y…….   Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  it is upon the Ministry concerned to look into  this matter and make  sure  that  the amount is paid almost immediately an officer retires. This  is because  if you have were  living in a Government house,  you will be required to vacate it and look for a private house where you must pay rent.   Not all people have houses in the rural areas. Some  of us who live  in the City do not have houses in the rural areas;  our homes are in the  City. Such people are  expected to Pay house rents after retiring. There is a tendency for people to assume that once a person retires, he must go and reside in his countryside home and,  therefore,  there is no house rent to be paid. That  is not correct because  those of us who  do not have homes elsewhere, apart from the  City and other urban areas,  will still be expected to continue paying house rents.   Therefore it is important that one receives pensions soon after retirement.	To be precise,  a retired person should start receiving his pensionfrom the  immediate month following his retirement.	Such a move will enablea retired person to meet his obligation   such as, 	paying house rent,  telephone and electricity bills and so on. I would appeal to the Minitry to make sure that the processing of pensions  is not delayed 	as has been the case. 	If this  is done,  the pensioners will be able to support themselves and be in a position to live properly without having to be subjected to certain problems simply because their earnings  will be received through other means. One of the reasons why there  are such delays is because the records are not kept properly. 	For  example,  the last address may not be   recorded on time. 	It  is,  therefore,  necessary for the Ministry to keep on up-dating records of individuals from time to time.   Unless such up-dating of records is done, it would be very difficult when paying out  the pension,  to know where to send the  cheque. Even when the processing of such monies has been completed, it  becomes very difficult  to make payment to those individuals who live far away from where the money is being computed.  It  is,  therefore,  necessary for all parent Ministries to make sure that  their Personnel officers update the records of civil servants especially those who have  attained the age of 55 years.- They should not wait until such 	 persons attain the age of 	55 years or when retires before they start updating their records. It becomes very 	inconvenient for a person to travel from up-country to Nairobi from time to time to look for his Pension. It  costs a lot of money and such people are forced to spend the little money they had saved when they they were working for transport   and accommodation expenses simply to follow up their pension   just because the records were not up—dated. For example,  when Questions are brought to this House with regard to .non-payment of pension,  we are  told that the records are not available. END…..Z  a.4 We know cases where retirees have been asked to provide informationto be  used in up-dating their records  and thus enabling calculationof  their pensions.	In order to  avoid this  kind  of situation,  it is necessary  for the  Treasury to  ask all the Ministries  to  ensurethat records  of people  who  are  approaching retirement  are up-to-date.This  will  make  it  possible  to  know when officers  are retiring,  how much would be  due  to  them,  how Much their monthly payments  wouldbe  and where  those  payments  would be  sent  once  they have retired.If records were kept	up-to-date,  we  would have  avoided wasting a lot  of time  and subjecting retirees  to inconveniences  of having to repeatedly visit  their former  offices in search of their pensions.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  as  other hon.  Members have  said,  sometimes  confusion arises as to	who  between adeceased's wife  and children should be paid his benefits.	Therefore,	it is necessary for us to ask our consitituennts to write willsso  that  it is known who  should be paid a deceased's  dues  like  deathgratuity,  NSSF money and so  on.	Our  people  have  an incorrectfeeling a that when one makes out a Will he dies soon.	it  is  wrongto  think this  way,  and we need to  convince  our people  that writingof  a will has nothing to  do  with  one's  death;  a Will   is moreimPortant  for  those  people  who have  several wives. </newspeech><header> ADJOURNMENT </header> <newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER  (Mr.  Wabuge):	Hon  Members,  itis  time  for  interruption of the  business of the House.

Receipt books for each chief's office Harambee were printed and distributed to the public for funds Collection.   Howevr, only KShs. 5,400/-and KShs.5,000/- were collected for each location respectively;  This money , which is in the chifs' custody, is not enough to put up the Offices. The two Offices now require about KSha.300,000/-.   Nthawa Chief's,OffiCe requires a sum Of KShs.200,000/- and Evurore chief’s office requires KShs.100,000/-.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MATE:   Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for that reply, these days we appreciate the importance Of the chief in matters relating to development and CO-OrdinatiOn Of all Government activities.   We also know that the chief in any location is the Chiarman Of all the development projects. Can the Assistant Ministeer  tell the HOUSe how soon his office can avail some money to construct the two offices because without them we  cannot do much? </newspeech>	<newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA:   Mr. Speakr, Sr, as far as Evurore  Location is concerned, my office allocated KShs.30,000/- to supplement the local effort and the money has been used to purchase 1,800 stones, 21 tones of ballast, and 21 tones of hard-Core, all of which are lying at the chief's Office site.   At the same time, the chief Of Nthawa Location has managed to raise 14 tonnes Of stones which are on the site. Mr. Speaker, Sir, my office budgets for chiefs' offices in the Republic depending On the needs and the requests made.   Provindes are allocated funds for construction Of chiefs' offices according to the provinces priorities supported by local effort.   Nthawa and Evurore locations will be considered along with other locations in the province as well as in the rest of the Republic. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.

ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker,  Sir, my office could do what the hon. Member is asking, but as things stand now, it is not possible because the number of chiefs in the country who require offices is very large.   However, we  shall  endeavour to provide chiefs offices where they do not exist, but I am sure  the hon. Member will agree with me that it is very difficult to satisfy this, requirement  in every area.  We have asked the Provincial Administration in areas where chiefs offices do not exist, to try and construct them through the Harambee spirit and I am sure the hon. Members can help us in this regard. I think ten. Mate should come in and assist in this endeavour and I promise that  whatever money he will be able'to raise, we shall try and subsidize his efforts.. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.

Could he  assure this House that this money is still safe in the custody of the chief, particularly when we know that it was raised two years ago and given to  him to keep. 	Is this money  really safe?   I am asking this  question because we have some doubt regarding the safety of the money. </newspeech> 	<newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I would like to assure the hon. Member and the House that these funds are  safe. </newspeech><newspeech>MR. MATE:  Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  arising from an earlier reply from the Assistant	Minister that we should make some effort to raise funds for the construction ofChiefs officers through Harambee,  is he aware that our district development committee has recommended the construction of thses offices and we have already started raising funds for this purpose?   I think they should now come in for our assistance because we have already shown our efforts in collecting some of the money required for the construction of the offices. Could he give an indication in this House as to when they are likely to give us funds for the construction of these two chiefs offices? </newspeech><newspeech>MR. ONTANCHA:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as I said before Evurore Chief's Camp has received Shs.30,000 before  and I am sure the Hon. Member will appreciate this.

This is Why we are asking chiefs in different areas to contribute their effort to 	 raise the necessary f.rds for the construction of these offices and  in this particular case,  I would like to call upon the hon.

MOMANTI asked the Minister for Education since the Kenya National Examinations Council has already paid the  senior officers their resultant benefits following  the approval of their scheme of service last year,  why the junior cadre of officers, that  is,  clerical  officers, machine operators,  secre taxies and messengers,  have not been paid their benefits. THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, I beg to  reply. The Kenya  National Praminations Council was re-categorised from category  'F'  to  'D'  on 	10th November, 	1989 and accordingly given the go-ahead to work out  salaries of non-unionisable  staff for consideration by the  Office of the President.   The  salaries for non-unionisable staff were approved by the Permanent  Secretary to the  Cabinet and Head of the Civil Service on 10th March, 1989 and implemented in May 1989.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the Kenya National Examinatiaas Council is now in the process of reviewing the  salaries for unionisable  staff.   The  salary revision for this cadre of staff will be implemented as soon as the council receives approval from state corporations advisory Committee. </newspeech><newspeech>MR. MOMONYI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am surprised by the Assistant Minister’s reply because these workers are all permanent and pensionable. Why should the Kenya National Examinations Counciol categorise some staff and leave others? Could the Assistant Ministers tell us why they pay some cadre of staff their benefits and leave others unpaid? </newspeech><newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, before November 1989, the Kenya National Examinations Council was placed under category ‘F’ as a parastatal and there is now way the Council could have paid higher salaries  to its workers. The approval and upgrading after November, 1989 enabled the Council to pay better salaries to the  non-unionisable  staff. 	However,  they  have made recommendations to the State  Corporations Advisory 	Committee so that  the salaries of  the other members of  staff can be improved. </newspeech><newspeech>MR. MOMANYI:  Mr.Speaker,  Sir,  paying some staff their resultant benefits and leaving others really kills the morale of workers particularly when  these people are doing the  same type of work. 	Several  salaries review commissions have been set up in this country to review salaries, for example,  the  Gachathi Salaries Review Commission,  Ndegwa Salaries Review-Commission and the Ramtu Salaries Review CommissiancL  However,  when'these reports were finalized no classification was done with regard to the workers of  the Kenya National Rraminations Council, and  I am now surprised that they have started categorizing the  staff. Could the  Assistant Minister advise the Council to pay these workers because their moral of work has really gone down? </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  KARAURI:  Mr.  Speaker,  I have already said that the salaries of these employees are going to be improved and we are just waiting for the Approval from the  State Corporations Advisory Committee after having  submitted our recommendations to the Council. </newspeech>                                                                                                       Question No.36 <header> Payment  of compensation to Mr. Katiku. <subheader>           MR.

However,  the  claim has not been paid  owing to non-availability  of funds. </newspeech><newspeech>MR..  WAMBUA: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the Ministry has been giving the  same reply since 	1980:  When are those  funds  going to be  available? This has now become a song. Can the Assistant Minister this House that  adequate  funds will be made  available during the next  Financial Year? </newspeech> <newspeech>MR.  AWORI:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I cannot assure this House that we  can ever get  adequate  allocations to  complete payment  of outstanding claims.

BIDU:  On a point  or order,  Mr.  Speaker,,Sir. When a Member is not  in the  House  to  ask his  Question that  Question is dropped; what  happens when Ministers  fail to turn up to  answer Questions  in the  House? We  forwarded these  Questions to the relevant Ministries  a long time  ago.   We need  a ruling from the  Chair regarding this  matter.   That  are  we  going to do? </newspeech> <newspeech>MR.  KUBO:  On a point  of order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.	My pointof  order relates to the point  of order which was raised by hon. Dr. Wameyo regarding Question No.119 .	If an Assistant Minister is  in 	the  House when a Question is asked and he decides to walk out of the Chamber then that  shows  some disrespect for this House:   So, we stillexpect  the  Chair to make  a ruling as to whether it is in order for an Assistant Minister to walk out of the Chamber without answering a Question and  in total disregard to the House. This is a serious' matter; </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  KIRWA:  On a point  of order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.   This is very interesting; Towards the  end  of the last Session,  so many Bills were  Tabled  in this House  and we had to discuss them hurriedly.   We know that  some of these  Questions will be transferred to the next Sitting or to  another subsequent  Sitting. This means that we  are going to have  a lot  of work to do during this particular Session;   We want  to  inform the' Ministers,  through the  Chair,  that this  HotSe should  be  taken very seriously:   This  is because  if Questions are brought here  and nobody is here  to  answer them,  then shows a very bad picture  to  the  public. Every Ministry has  got  one Minister and more  than one Assistant Ministers.   Surely all of them cannot be committed this  particular morning.	We  urge  the  Chair  to  giveus  guidance  on this matter; </newspeech><newspeech>DR.  MISOI:	On a point  of order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.	We  hon.Members  are  very disappointed with the		performance  of theMinisters	who-are  supposed to answer these  Questions: When openingthis  Session,  His  Excellency the President	said that  we  must  takethe Business  of this  House  very seriously.	Is  this  the  way theMinisters and Assistant Ministers  are  taking the Business 	of this House? 	We  need your guidance,  Mr.Speaker,  Sir. 	What  is  going to be done  about people who fail to perform their duties? </newspeech> <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH	(Mr.  Ogur):	On a pointof  order,  Mt:  Speaker,  Sir.	It  is true  that  when Question No.119was  asked,  Dr. Wekesa was present.	But  he  did not have the answer.So,  Dr.  Wekesa has  rushed to his office for an answer and  Ithink the  House  should  be patient. </newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER,  OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr.  Onyancha): 	On a point  of order,  Mr.Speaker,  Sir. 	Those who want to  be  treated  fairly should also deal fairly with the  others.   In other words  it is a question of give-and-take:   I was here very early in the  morning and ready to answer Question No.l. But hon. Wakole was not present. So,  when hon.Members are  criticizing us they should also look at  themselves. </newspeech><newspeech>THE   MINISTER OF STATE,  OFFICE OF 	THE PRESIDENT 	(Mr. Kyalo): Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I think we  should be  considerate over this  issue. It may be  possible  the  circumstances  beyond one's  control may have contributed to this problem. Since  the Ministers  concerned are very responsible people,  we  should  just be patient and try to  find  out what  may have  happened. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  MIRUKA-OWUOR: 	On a point  of order,  Mr. Speaker,  Sir. My point of order relates to the procedures of this House., 	I fear that we  are  likely to  get  into  a state  of confusion. 	This is  	 because  several points  of  order have  been raised  and  I think the  Chair should give us  guidance  on these  points  of order before we  move  on to the next  Order. </newspeech><newspeech>AN HON.  MEMBER:  What  is your problem? </newspeech>END.C..  <newspeech>MR. _BOY:	On a point  of order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.	Questionsare  supplied to  the Ministries long before they appear here,  andOrder Papers  are  also  supplied to  the Ministries Headquarters	-Ministers  offices a week early.This  particular Order Paper was with the Ministry concerned since yesterday or the day before. That is what normally happens. All  the Ministries knew that such and  such a Minjstry had a Question to be  answered here today. For example,  hon.  Dr.  Wekesa could have  just stood up and said "I have  no  answer,  or the  answer will be  given in the  afternoon". But  instead,  he  just walked out. 	And the  other one  is  on strike! Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,you can just  see  that  the  tendency by the Assistant Ministers  is  very bad. Even sometimes when they do not have  proper answers,  they  just buy time for you to call for the next Question and the Question at issue  "dies". So,  I would  like a ruling from the  Chair as  to what could be  done  to  safeguard pa Back-benchers because  it  seems  as if the  Front  Bench have  something against the  Back-benchers</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: 	On a point  of  order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir. We  take Ministers  to  be very responsible people,  and  that is why they were  appointed to  those high posts.  But if Ministers spend most  of their time  in night clubs dancing and come here very late, this is very embarrassing to the  nation. So,  Ministers  should know that they are responsible  people  and  they should not behave like  that.	So,  they  should refrain from that. </newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDuCATION	(Mr.  Karauri):	On apoint  of order,  Mr.  Speaker,Sir.	Hon.

I want hon.  MeMbers to  take this  House  seriously-regardless  of whether you are  a Back-bencheror Front-bencher,  not  only during the  Question Time but  also  duringthe Debates.	It is even most unfortunate  that  the Question of IQuorum has been raised -several  times  in the  House  simply because I think some  of the hon.  Members  do not take  seriously-the Business of the  Rouse. 	So,  I hope  from now on,  you,J. are  going to  take-theBusiness  of the  House  seriously. </newspeech>	(Applause)<newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION  (Mr.  Karauri):-   On a point  of order,.Mr.  Speaker,  Sir. 	Are we  to take  it that whathon.  Mwamzandi has said is true that Ministers spend their nightsin night  clubs?	I demand that he withdraws  that remark or substantiated by telling us which Ministers  spend their nights in the night clubs. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  SPEAKER:	Order!	Order!	That  is hbn.

Mwamzandi  did not  just say he  "thought"  or  "believed",  but he  simply made  an allegationto  the  effect  that  some Ministers end up in the night clubs.	We would like  to  know where hon.  Mwamzandi was when he himself was not in the night club . </newspeech><newspeech>MR.  SPEAKER:	Order!	Order!	Hon.

KUBO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. My pointof order is with regards to this Motion because .during the weekendthere was a meeting somewhere in Machakos and there, was a reply tothis Motion in public while we know that the Minister concerned was.supposed to come and give a reply to this House. So, my point oforder is whether it is in order for a Minister - a very experiencedMinister. to go to explain to the public about the policy of cost-sharing and talking about the non-payment of fees by members of the	public in a public meeting rather than coming to explain that there inthe House because once a debate is going on here in the House itshould be confined to the House</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT Minister for Health (Mr. Ogur): On a. point of . order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I was present accompanying my Minister to Kathiani Hospital, Machakos, during the World Health. Organisation Week. A question was brought to us by the area Member of Parliament hon. Kitele, and my Minister took the opportunity to explain to the public, the Nyayo people The question was answered very well and to their satisfaction. Anybody who was there heard it and there was no problem at all. The newspapers  especially the Daily Nation reported it very correctly. That question had nothing to. do with the debate in this Parliament </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. hon.Kibaki is  an old Member of this House. I think wehave been together since 1963. He knows the Standing Orders of theHouse very well. It has always been our stand here that no debate will arise outside the house from any proceedings in this House until that debate isexhausted. The Motion was not yet exhausted here. So, if a Memberasked a question in a public meeting and the matter was a subjectof Parliamentary debate, the Minister was bound to promise the audience a reply later. I think the Minister has violated our Standing Orders. So, we need a ruling from the Chair. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.SPEAKER: I think this is a very technical area which I am sure the hon. Assistant Minister for Health, Mr. Ogur, is not quite capable of replying to. I think we shall wait for hon. Kibaki to tell us exactly what transpired in the meeting. Our Standing Orders are very clear on that issue, and I am sure he is also very conversant with them.. So, we shall wait for him to explain the position.So, we are now ready to debate this Motion, Is there any. hon. Member wishing to contribute? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I remember last time hon. Mwamzandi had moved the Motion and I had seconded it. So, what remained was for the Motion to be read to the Members or the question to be proposed so that Members could debate on it. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: As far as the Chair is concerned, the question was proposed. So, it is now for the hon. Members to debate the Motion</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAFZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It looks as if hon. Members are not willing to speak on this Motion because the reply has already been given. Can the Chair clarify? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Can you repeat your point of order, Mr.. Mwamzandi</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZARDI: What I said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that it looks as if the reply to this Motion has already been given. So, it looks as if the Motion has already been taken over by events.MR. SPEAKER: You know, Mr. Mwamzandi, we normally do not respond to newspapers but to points raised here by hon Members. But if hon. Members are not ready to debate the Motion, I hope the Government Responder is ready to respond</Newspeech>.<Newspeech>MR.Kiliku: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. If  there is no hon. Member wishing to contribute, it is now time for the Government Responder to reply to the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Kiliku, that is precisely what I said. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. If a Motion is brought to this House, and only the hon Mover and the	Seconder have contributed,and there are no other hon Members willing to contribute to  it, then it appears that the Motion is unpopular, and therefore, the best thing is to put. the question</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order! That is your point of viewhon. Karauri</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI: On a point of order, Mr.Speaker sirI do not think the Motion is unpopular I think what has happened is that thehon. Minister for Health has given a much better position  thanwhat this Motion is asking for. In the. statement that he gave at Kathiani he said that people who do not have moneyshould be given free medical treatment This Motionwas asking the government to raise money from the employed people,so that the unemployed people can be treated, using that money Now that the Minister has given  much better position, I think thereis nothing to discuss. This Motion has been overtaken byevents. That is my point of  view. </Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker., Sir.The Motion has got very good proposals, but just as hon. Mrs .Ndeteihas said, the hon. Minister has somehow amended and improved theterms of Motion outside this House. That is the dilemma that wehave here. We would have preferred the Minister to be here in orderto restate the position, so that we can discuss. We are short as of now What can we do now? </Newspeech><Newspeech>HON.MEMBERS: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.SPEAKER: Order I am sure there x are some hon.

WASIKE-NDOMBI: On a point of order, Mr.Speaker, Sir In view of what is going on, can I call upon "the Mover to reply?	</Newspeech><i>(applause)<i><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order! If the Government is not prepared to respond, I will only request the hon. Members in the Front-Bench to dessist  from discussing the matters of this House:outside Parliament. </Newspeech>(Question that the Mover be now called upon to reply put and agreed to)<Newspeech>MR. KUBO: On a point of order,Mr. Speaker, Sir.the Government has. responded to this Motion, outsidethis House and therefore, even if it means restating what has alreadybeen said outside this House, it must be repeated here, for it to bevalid to the House. Therefore, would I be in order to request theAssistant Minister to restate what was said yesterday about thisMotion, as a Government policy. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Hon.Members, I think the position is clear.The hon. Assistant Minister is here, but he is not prepared torestate what the Minister said  yesterday  and therefore, we should x wait for the responder. Can we therefore, now ask the Mover toreply. Can you go ahead Mr. Mwamzandi. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.According to my Parliamentary experience, it is very unusual fora Minister to give a reply to a Motion outside this House, and keep the house in darkness  I have tried to look at the standing orders to know which standing only we could apply but the only standing order that we can apply here is standing order no.1 which employees . the speaker to make a ruling on issues of this native.  I am glad that you have ruledthat we are waiting for the Minister to respond. I x have said thatthe House is in darkness because hon. Members have been made number and they do not know what to do next. According to the replythat he gave, in Machakos yesterday, it is apparent that theMinister entirely accepted the terms of this Motion. Sir, </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Onyanch On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir Is it in order, for the hon. Member to bring here a debate which had taken place outside this HOUSE? Why should be bring that debate into this House?The hon. Member is implying that the hon minister has alreadyresponded to this; Motion outside this House. Actually, he isdiscussing issues that happened outside this House,  Is he in orderto do that? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr.MWAMZANDI: I do not know which Standing Order The hon. Members is referring to . the hon members should read all our Standing Orders so that they can know what we are talking about. I said that the hon. Mr. Minister replied to the Motion, outside this HOUSE, but he did not oppose the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: , On a point of order, Mr. Speaker Sir We cannot go by  what the Minister said yesterday. since The Assistant Minister for Health is here, why can he not state the Government position on this Motion? What is wrong with that?THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.I have already said that the statement made by the Minister in Machakos yesterday did not interfere with the debate in this House. In view of that, if the intentions of a debate have been overtaken by events, it is  for this House to decide. I am prepared to listen to the debate, and even to respond when my time comes. </Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order! I tend to agree with what hon. Mwamzandihas said. appears as if most house hon.member appear not to understand the procedures of this  We have passed that stage, and we are waiting for the Mover to respond, and immediately after that will put the Question. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karuari): ON a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Sir, I would like to seek your guidance here. The minister talked about the policies of his Ministry hon.Members , responding to the Motion	Sir, if I am invited as a guest of honour, in my capacity as anAssistant Minister for Education, and I talk on a wide range ofeducation policies, for example about recruitment of untrained teachers ,and so on I not be in order to do so irrespective of whether there is a Question or a Motion in Parliament do I understand that if there is a Motion in the House, the Ministers  shall keep quite about their Ministries policies, in fear of being told that they were talking about matters Which are  already before the House? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Hon. Karauri has used the word if meaning that he is assuming.We x do not assume things in this House. He should talk x of a specific issue and therefore he was out of order to assume things in this house </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order.! I have  already clearly stated the position. If there is any matter that is being debated in this House, it must not be debated again outside this House. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo);  On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.This issue seems to be dragging considerably ,and I think the solution is not clearly stipulated in our Standing Orders. May I suggest that the best thing is for the Mover to  ask the leave of the House to stop debate on this issue and withdraw the Motion which has been overtaken by events. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr.Ogur): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I would like to inform the House that there was no debate in the meeting that my Minister held with the Press that touched on this Motion. In that Press meeting he merely replied to questions that were asked of him by the Press. He did not in any way interfere with the current debate on this Motion. That is the position, as it stands now My Minister never decided  reply-to the Motion outside this House as it is being said in this House now. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order! For now I am waiting for the Mover to reply. I have also: said that I am also waiting for the Minister himself to restate the position because I do not think that you, Mr. Ogur are position to reply adequately to the issue </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL HERITAGE (Mr. Lalampaa): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Mine is just a matter of procedure because the position is now very confusing. The Motion was proposed, seconded but no other speaker debated on it. We are now calling upon the Mover to reply without the Government responding. I think there is a technical problem here. How do we tackle this issue because we were supposed to get the Government's response before asking upon the Mover to reply? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order I There is no confusion here! The Government responder was given enough time, to respond to the Motion; but since he is prepared to do so there is nothing else you can expect the Chair to do and what now remainsis to put the Question because as far as I am concerned the Mover has alreadyreplied to the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. There is a lotof confusion in this matter. According to Standing Order No, 151, (1) or (2) thereis supposed to be a General Purpose Committee which if supposed to deal with such matters. So I would like to propose that we commit the debate of this Motion to that Committee which will advise the Minister on the best way of solving this problem. I will await your ruling on that before the Question is put. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Onyancha): On apoint of  order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. According to the ruling of the Chair,, the Mover of the Motion has been called upon to reply to his Motion; could he do that so that we can go on to the  step? Why does he not want to respond to his Motion? </Newspeech><Newspeech>AN. HON. MEMBER: He has already done that! </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Since the Assistant  Minister for Health is here, why can he not through collective responsibility respond to the Motion? This is because he has told us that he was in that meeting which means that he knows what the Minister was up to Why can he not be given time to respond to the Motion?	</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: I have gone through the Standing Order quoted by hon Mwamzandi, but I find that it is not relevant to what is before the House.. So if the Mover is not ready I will have to put the Question".(Question put and negatived)Terminal Benefits for Kenya Rayon Mills Employees</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the following Motion:-THAT, in view of the promise made last year by the Minister for Labour concerning the payment of terminal benefits of the ex-employees of the former Kenya Rayon Mills and while noting that all assets of that company have been liquidated, this House urges the Government to direct the receivers of the said company to pay in full all the terminal benefits due to. the ex-employees without any further delay.When this company was placed tinder receivership I led a delegationwhich included four former employees of this company to the Minister's office.During that meeting the Minister promised that these ex-employees would be paidtheir benefits. I also remember tabling a Question in this House ,in whose replythe Minister accepted and promised that when the assets of this company wereliquidated, the workers claims would be met. Right now this company has been bought by Bahari Mills, accompany that was formerly based in Thika. When I approached these new owners they told me that- they .had paid the receivers shs.48 million while the workers total claims amount to only shs.5 million.That is why I am asking my good friend the Minister for Labour to assist the workers by directing the receivers to pay them without any further delay. It think the former Kenya Rayon Mills was owned by the madhvani Group of Companies which also owned Ramisi Sugar Company. These people declared their employees redundant not because they were banckrupt but just because they wanted to transfer their business to Uganda. My problem here is whether the Minister is going to assist the workers to get" their terminal benefits further to the promise he had made sometimes back in. this House. Since the receivers have been paid all that money, I hope that they will be paid their benefits. The workers have been waiting for this money for a long time. Mr.Speaker, Sir the Minister should amend the law so. that the workers are paid first before a company is put under receivership and its assets liquidated The law as it stands now hon.Wasike-Ndombi can bear me witness  says that when a company has been placed under receivership, the money so realised from the sale of assets, would first be used to pay the creditors and not the workers. That clause is a bit colonial and I urge the Minister to bring an amendment with respect to that law so that workers are paid first. "Workers are an asset to the company- and they should be. considered first in line with the Nyayo philosophy of being mindful of other peoples welfare.These workers should be paid because their children are now not going to school due to lack of school fees. They have no other source of income are, therefore, loitering in the streets of Mombasa waiting for the Minister to" fulfil his promise. Some of these workers may have died but their next of  are there and will receive the necessary benefits on their behalf.Last week the Minister said that he loved  Kenyans and workers very much. If the Minister orders the receivers to pay the workers, I think the employers-will respect the workers in future. I read in the local newspapers today that 2,000 workers of Kenya Cashewnuts, Kilifi, have been declared re¬dundant and the company closed. The Minister has a lot to do for the workers and I hope, when he conies to reply, he will not talk of less than Kshs. 5 million in the form of workers claims which he himself promised in this louse some time back,  should as a tell us when these workers will, be paid  and also assure us that the next of kin of the workers who might have died will receive such benefits without delay. is should also assist these workers to get N.S.S.F. benefits, because they were contributors to this Fund and the employer did not complete their forms before they left the company.Before a company is allowed to declare workers redundant, the Minister should appoint a committee to investigate whether what the company is allegingis true or not. For example, when a company wants to transfer its business from one country to another, instead of applying to the Ministry to say that they are going to close the business and pay workers their benefits, they use that technicality of saying that they are bankrupt and run away. As I am talking now, the Madhavani Group of Companies have gone to Jinja. If they were bankrupt, they would not have gone to establish business in Jinja.The problem we have now lies with the labour officers. These officers should be patriotic to this country. This is because if they were patriotic, we could not have so many Questions concerning the Ministry of Labour in this louse. We bring Questions here because workers are not paid their dues. from today, the Minister should make sure that  their first priority is the welfare of the workers. he should also take disciplinary action against labour officers who do not take the workers disputes seriously.Sir, I do not know why an employer does not; turn up when he is summoned by a labour officer to discuss industrial disputes. The Minister should direct the employers to respond to the summons of a labour officer and listen to what the officer says so that the problems facing the workers can  be solved, rather than the workers resorting to come to Nairobi or to ask their Members of Parliament to bring Questions, to this House. If the labour officers were patriotic enough, I think the Minister could not be having many problems that are facing the workers now.	I do not have much to say except to reiterate the fact that thequestion before this louse is with respect to the payment at in full of the claims of the former employees of Kenya Rayon Mills on the strength of the Minister's promise that they were going to paid kshs. 5 million in total.With those few points, I beg to call upon hon. Bidu  who is my neighbour back home  to second this Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Asante sana, Bw. Spika, kwa at Icunipa nafasi hii.

The Motion urges the payment of terminal benefits of the ex-employees of former Kenya Rayon Mills. we have been informed that the company has receivedover Shs.48 million while the workers benefits amount to only Shs.5 million. One of the reasons for which we are urging the Government, through the Minister for Labour, to ask this company to pay workers their benefits has to do with NSSf contributions, which are made by both the worker and the employer. If this companyfor example, did not remit workers NSSF contributions to this Fund,the Minister for Labour has to ask the company to forward thosecontributions to the fund so that are able to withdraw their NSSFbenefits on attainment of the age of 50 or 55 years. Another reason for which we are asking that these  workers benefits be paid is contained in his Excellency the President's Address when he opened' our current session. If you, Mr. Speaker,may allow me to quote, on page 8.of his" Address, the President said:-"I have said on many occasions human are, and must remain, the focus of  all our development. Indeed, no development can be worth undertaking "if it does not improve the quality of life of wananchi. This is the reason why my Government is committed to the promotion of harmonious  working relationship between workers and employers".Mr. Speaker, Sir, there cannot be harmonious relationships betweenworkers and employers if the latter resort to dirty tactics, such as. claimingthat they are broke and they cannot continue to do business, only to sell their businesses and run away to establish new businesses elsewhere. We have had an example of. such behavior in this country in that Miwani and Ramisi Sugar Companies closed down only the other day, and now we have the Kenya Rayon Mills closing down. You will notice that after these companies have closed down, their former owners  emerge under different names to form very lucrative companies. . Therefore, besides asking the Minister for Labour to do what we want him to do, we will also ask the Attorney-General to scrutinize the former employers of these companies that have been liquidated so that if they try to form new companies he may follow them up Such companies cheat workers and run away to form new companies after having got their benefits.We also request the Minister for Labour to ensure, with the assistance of the Attorney-General, that the Companies Liquidation Act is among those that are to be brought here for amendment so that we may amend that particular section that allows workers to get no more than a sum equivalent to four months salary. We also want him to bring this amendment here so that we may resolve that when a company is liquidated, the workers are the first to be paid. Creditors should not be paid anything unless the workers, who produce profits for creditors, are paid first. We say this because this is not only colonial, but also outdated and we would like it to be amended so as to suit the lives of Kenyans today.We have had a number of companies go under liquidation, and you will notice that most of them were being run by Asians, who are very expert in cheating the Government under the pretext that they are broke. We also want to ask the Minister for Labour to recall that, in the law relating to redundancy, there is a provisions in the Trade Disputes Act that any intention to lay off. staff should be thoroughly warranted. So, the Minister should be very careful in approving redundancy. Before he does so, he should ensure that the workers involved are given a promise that when their company is liquidated, they will be  the first to be paid. I say this because in many past cases, companies, especially those run by Asians, have given false statements. Sometimes, these companies maintain two payrolls in their offices: a true payroll and a deceptive one which they give to labour inspectors to hide the fact that they underpay their workers. I know that we are not asking for the impossible, because the Minister himself promised hon. Kiliku when the latter went to his office in 1986 that he would do something in this line. Therefore, since the Minister is a man of his word, we would like him to keep his word and ask this particular company to pay its workers their terminal benefits which have not been paid, including their provident fund contributions, gratuity, N.S.S.F. dues and redundancy benefits for those who were declared redudant. This latter category of benefits is provided for in the Act, and those concerned should be paid half-salaries for all the months they worked for the company. Out of Shs.48 million, Shs.5 million is peanuts, and the Minister should not ask us, as he has been doing just now, as to what law this provision comes. We are requesting him to order the company concerned to pay its workers Shs.5 million out of the Shs.48 which has been collected by the official receiver.With these few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me a chance to support this particular Motion. What the Mover is asking for" is a very simple thing. He says that once a business has been started and workers employed, all we need to do is to take care of the welfare of these workers. We know that for any business to run, there must be some investors who can invest either in cash or in kind. The law tells us that when any company is liquidated, the person who is going to benefit is the investor whereas the workers who gave their time and lives to the company are not going to be paid anything.We understand that the official receiver for this particular company has received more than Shs.48 million after selling the company's assets, and all that the workers need out of this money is only Shs.5 million. We know that the law ties our hands in this particular aspect, but are we merely going to follow 	the law as these workers continue to suffer? This is the key tactic that some employers have been using to con their workers out of their sweat. All we need is a Government directive telling the official receiver, "This is the much you got from the sale of the assets that you sold. Therefore, surrender a part of this money to the workers." This is the only way in which we can safeguard our workers. We know that some organisations go into fictitious liquidation when, in essence, they are not in any financial trouble. An example of this is Miwani Sugar Company, which was said to be under receivership sometime back. We know that the employers of this same company have set up some business premises elsewhere and that they are running this new business without any financial problems. . </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: In Uganda? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: Yes, in Jinja, Uganda, if that is what you want to know. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this new company is running without any financial problems, and yet it had been said that the former Miwani Sugar Company had been in some financial problems. This is a very big problem that we need to look at in the House. When we are here</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Chesire): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The hon. Member speaking says that the managers of the former Miwani sugar Company are now operating a new company in Jinja, Uganda. Could he tell the House whether these managers took any money out of the country to set up a new business in Uganda?MR. KIRWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I go into this issue, let me say that when we are here, we are here for the welfare of this nation. Whether we speak from the Back or the Front Bench, we are here for the welfare of this nation, and we do not make allegations in respect of which we do not have enough evidence.(Applause)To answer the Assistant Minister, however, this company in particular said it was going to pay its creditors, and not all of them were in Kenya; some were abroad. How sure is the Assistant Ministers that the creditors who were paid in London did not take their money through some channel to Uganda to start this new business? I hope the Assistant Minister is now satisfied. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we know that workers are very innocent, and, since many of them are not in managerial positions, most decisions, be they good or bad, are arrived at by the proprietors of these organisations and companies. All that the workers are required to do is to work and, once they have done the job, go home.	Why are we allowing a law that is making very innocent people to suffer and yet. the people who know why the company has failed benefit a great deal? If any-thing, .the Motion is trying to assist the Government to contain some of the foreign exchange that we. have been losing through these? fictitious creditors some companies are allegedly paying. The Minister should look at this Motion in the! light of,  the welfare of this country. It is very clear in the President's speech that when he talked about the workmens Compensation Act, he meant that we are going to take care of the welfare of our people Mr. Speaker, Sir, an Act should come in as far as liquidation is concerned such that the welfare of workers is taken care of. Some of these laws were enacted during the colonial days when the colonialists wanted to reap the1 most our of our people. Now that we are in full control be our country, why do we not enact laws that are going to assist our people We are not asking for too much. We are ask-ing that we pay to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and we pay workers what belongs to them.With those few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the; Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I arise to support this - very simple and straightforward Motion, which calls upon the Government to direct they money available from the former Kenya Rayon Mills official receivers to pay the Kenyan workers of that company whose families are in problems. As we are talk¬ing here! now, some of the! workers, children may not be going to school due to lack of school fees, which is a very sad affair. It is especially sad when you consider the fact that some of the former workers of the company had worked there for over twenty years before the company was liquidated. The future of those workers was invested in that company.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Mover of this Motion is merely calling upon the Government to direct that the money available but Of the liquidation of this company be used to pay the formers workers of the company After all, their claims total to only KShs.5 million, which is a very minor sum. I believe that the Minister for Labour agrees that the families of the former workers of the company are suffering a lot. I wish the Minister saw how those! families are suffering. He would just stand up here and say "We should not continue debating this matter; let the Motion be passed so that the workers are! paid their dues".Mr. Speaker, Sir, the previous speakers have spoken loud and clear on  the anomalies of the present laws governing labour.  Those laws are inconsistent with normal-African traditions. Here, the law says that when a company is liquid¬ated, the first and foremost persons to be paid are the Government and the creditors According "to the law, the people who helped such a company make money - the workers should be given priority We are asking that the Minister, after he has directed that the workers in question are! paid their dues, brings a Bill here for enactment provide that in the event of a company being liquidated, the welfare of the workers should precede all other interests Since this Motion is very simple and straightforward and has very good intentions, I am sure that the Minister will bear with the Mover and move very fast to ensure that these workers are paid their dues. As we speak here now, some of the! workers! children are not in school and do not have clothes. Since money is available to the; liquidator or the receiver, we are only asking that the Minister directs that the workers dues are released. After all, the KShs.5 million due is a very small sum of money in present Kenya. Given that Asians would want to employ a large number of people and pay them less, I am assuming that the ex-employees are between 300 and 400, and most of the money may be going to the big boys the managers  who made the company collapse.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are calling upon the Minister to be considerate. If he feels that this is not a genuine move, he should change and be with us and  agree to pass the Motion as it is so that these workers may benefit from their sweat. As I have said, there are quite a number of labour laws that need to be repealed in this House because they are not for the good welfare of bur people who work in factories and companies. Those laws should be brought here, as it was said by His Excellency the President, so that we can change then and make them , relevant to present Kenya. In this particular Motion, I am sure that the Mover and the Minister are speaking the same language. Unless otherwise, we believe that the Minister will move! fast to insure that the rights of these workers are taken care ofMr. Speaker, Sir, I hopes that the Minister knows very well that the owners of the liquidated company are the Madhuvani Group, who are crooks of the first order. That is the group of companies that change's like a chameleon. When they know that they have made enough money in a country, like Kenya, they liquidate their company and move to another country Later on, after making a lot of money in that country, they come back to Kenya through their brothers and grandchildren You find that these are the same? people? you will get in Zimbabwe, Zambia and Uganda. We want to get rid of these characters. After all, if the company failed in Kenya in the first place, why should they want to come back and. set up the same thing? These are crooks whose tricks must be uncovered. Their methods of manipulation should be uncovered. Why should their companies be the ones that are liquidated day after day? Why should their companies be the ones that declare workers redundant every day? It is because" the big boys who own the companies are not making millions. Those are the people who should be taken care of properly by amending the relevant sections of our labour laws. We should know why these companies are always being liquidated and the motive behind these manipulations. Is it true! that those companies are not producing enough due to economic forces? We want the Minister to be vigilant, especially when it comes to dealing with our brothers who, because of the prevailing peace and stability continue making huge sums of money and take advantage of our labour laws.Mr. Speaker, Sir, you will recall that when Africans took over the business in Biashara Street, Asian businessmen said that there was no business and they pretended to close down their shops, declaring our brothers redundant. But, later, they came back to Biashara. Street. What we are saying is that they are taking advantage of the law in opening businesses and closing down. You find that an Asian businessman closes down his shop along Moi Avenue and opens a small kiosk at Piangani, only to see him resurfacing again on Moi Avenue. If they are not making profits in town, thereby being forced to close down, how come that we see them resurfacing in the same town? It is not surprising to see an Asian closing down his business, going to India, coming back to open a small kiosk- in Parklands and then see him operating in town. That is why we are saying that the whole operation is unfair to workers generally Therefore, if a company is liquid¬ated today  and we have many of them being liquidated  the interests of the workers should be taken care of The Minister should direct that the workers be paid their terminal benefits before any other creditors are, considered. After all, those are the people behind the existence of the companyWhy should these workers continue to suffer? Some of than have been workingas casuals over .the years only to find the factory closing down one morning You find that somebody has worked as a casual for many years and has not obtainedany skill to enable Him to be employed somewhere else. Some of these peoplekeep on going to the factory, hoping that one day they might find it open.However, the true position is that the company has been sold to other peopleand these workers cannot be paid their money although the money is available.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Motion is very clearlyasking the Government to direct the receivers of the said company to pay infull all the terminal benefits due to the  ex-employees of the company,. We  would also like to urge the Minister to make sure that if in future any company is liquidated, the employees of the companies are paid their dues before anything else is done If there is any cash in the bank, effortsshould be made to get that cash and pay the workers before the company is sold.At the moment, the law provides that the receivers shall fist pay the Governmentduty and other expenses before they can pay the ex-employees of the company .If these workers continue to be considered last, then there is no reason whyour people should continue to work for these private companies If our peopledo not work for these companies, there is no way in which they can make money.However, since they have been working for them, they should be paid their dueswhen it is necessary In this particularly company, Shs.48 million a was  realized after selling the assets of the company and this was possible because of the effort of the workers.If it were not for the hard work done by these employees, this company would nothave obtained the assets. We are therefore saying, that the law should provide.that these employees should be a paid their terminal benefits so that they canfeel comfortable. At the moment, these people have no employment but they arehoping that this Motion will be approved so that this money can be paid them tomorrow and I hope that this will be the case.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as soon as this Motion is  passed these people will move to the office of the Ministry of Labour in Mombasato ask for their dues. This does not involve a lot of money. In fact, someof them are claiming only Shs.200/  or  Shs.500/- and the maximum claim is onlyShs.l,000/- Perhaps if the Minister adds up all the claims, he would, think this involves a lot of money, but if he considers individual claims, he would find out that the involve very little amount of money as I have indicated above So, I would like to urge the Minister to consider these people With those few remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Br.wameyo : Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is. a very importantMotion but unfortunately, there are only a few hon. Members in the House at themoment and I know that some of them will come and vote against the Motion. we have been told a number of very important things by the previous speakers and I am not going to repeat what they have said. However, I would like to highlight one or two point So This particular company was formed by the Madhuvani Group of companies and it went into liquidation and taken over by some people in Mombasa who are now making a lot of profit to the extent that they have held to pay to the receivers Shs.48 million. Therefore, it was liquidated under very mysteriops circumstances.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,  Sugar Company was owned bythe Madh vani Group of Companies. It was liquidated and handed over, to  theofficial receivers for unknown; reasons I am personally disturbed to notethat it is the same Madh vani Group of Companies who started the molassesfactory in Kisumuo I am also, disappointed to note that the same people wentto Switzerland and formed another subsidiary company there that lent money to the molasses company in Kisuimu. I believe that at the moment, Government is paying very heavily for the loan. However, the Madh vani Group of Companies have continued  to make money in this country. The same people went to Panama and formed another company which bought shares in the Kisumu Molasses Plant. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. Mango'oli: These are comment</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO: This plant has never come off the ground  but the Govern¬ment has continued to repay very heavily the loan that was advanced to this plant Last week, I asked a Question in this Souse about a voter in Mumias Constituency who worked with the Kenya Rayon Mills in Mombasa. This- voter has been askingwhen he will be paid his N.s.S.F. benefits I was pleased by the hon Ministerwhen he replied to the Question and said that this voter was paid so much moneyin January this year and that no more money has been received from the employer.However, the Minister ought really have known well that the company was liquidatedThese are people whom the Motion is talking about. I know that the Minister for Labour has been asking other Ministers to come to. the House today to vote againstthis Motion. It is fair enough to note that these people have been paid four-months' salaries, but what about their N.S.S.F benefits which the company didnot contribute to the N.S.S.F Although this was not done, the Minister didnot raise even a finger to ask why the company was not contributing to the N.S.S.FThe truth of the matter is that this company did not collapse and they just wantto swindle our people of their money I am saying this because the company isstill there and is being run by some other people I do also know that someof the employees were re-employed by the present directors of the company whichis making fantastic profits. This company has continued to make clothes forthe entire country. Nobody is walking naked in this country! Everybody is wearing clothes and there is no way in which the company is making a loss or is likely to make any loss in the future.Therefore, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is a very important Motion and if the Minister wants to do something about it, he would probably amend it, but if he rejects it" in toto, that would be forgetting the problems of the people of this country who voted us into this House. There were very many people from Mumias Constituency who were working in this company. These people are now suffering since they are not employed and it is surprising to note that they cannot even be paid their N.S.S.F. benefits until an a hon. Member brings a Question in this House. This is a very straightforward Motion and it has been brought because most people have been using this law to swindle workers in this country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for a long time in the past and even now, the sugar companies in this country are having their balance sheets is brought to this House in. which they say that they are still making losses.However, I do not see how any sugar company which continues to mill sugar-cane and sells the sugar can continue making losses. I raised this pointhere once when,I was an Assistant Minister and later as an ordinary Member ofParliament, and  I know that up to this moment, Mumias Sugar Factory is makingfantastic profits. During this year alone, Mumias Sugar Factory paid Government a dividend of over Shs.30 million and in the previous year, they had paid Shs.42 millionIf Mumias Sugar Factory can do that and pays to the Exchequer a total ofShs.370 million, how can other companies that are milling sugar be unable topay a single cent to the Exchequer? We are being swindled  	 Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are being swindled but when some us  mention these things they get a firing. But it is very important to say these things. We can see from the newspapers today the Kenya Airways-has declared., other people  redundant and yet a Presidential Committee has been, appointed to look into the problem ofunemployment in this country. But. you. can see that people are being dis-employed. It is very important that we look into the affairs of the sugar industry in this country. Although I do not come from South Nyanza, I feel that the way Sony sugar Company is going on is not fair to us. The way the Muhoroni Sugar Company is going on under the management of the Menta Group of Companies is not fair. . Also Chemelil is not doing well. I come from  a sugar growing axe a and I produce sugar-cane. I know you can make a lot of money by growing sugar-cane; it just grows for two years; you do not have to weed it. People just come and cut it and crush it and produce sugar. There is a very large sugar market in Kenya and  Eastern Africa as a whole. So, you cannot make any loss and you cannot declare anybody redundant." But you will find that Ramisi Sugar Company abandoned the sugar, cane to wither, and dry and the farmers looked as if they were in a country which had no Government. They are grazing their cattle in the sugar-cane. But the sugar-cane crushing machines are there ¬at Ramisi and they could be rehabilitated and run properly. Therefore the Madhvani Group of Companies has swindled us and taken us" for a ride. I would plead with the Ministry concerned to understand the problems of the former employees of this company and come to their aid. The Minister is the only person who can save these people and to reject this  Motion totally would be thoroughly unfairto our people.Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND. BROADCASTING (Mr. Nassir): Bw. Spika, jambo linal owahusu wafanyakazi hapa Kenyani jambo kubwa sana. Kwa hivyo yafaa Bunge hili limwelewe mhe. Kilik sawa sawa. Hii ni kwa sababu katika nchi nyingi watu . huzikasirikia Serikali zao huku wakl.dhani kwamba Serikali. zao hawazi wajali wafanyakazi. Kwa hivyo ni lazima kila nimoja wetu aj aribu kuyashughulikia mambo ya watu wetu kikamilifu. Yafaa Mbunge ajaribu kwenda kwa ofisi za Wizara zinazohusika ili akaweza kufaha mishwa vile mambo yalivyo. Hii ni kwa . sababu Serikali ni yetu na hakuna rntu ambaye anaitwa "Serikali" katika nchi ya Kenya. Sisi sote ni sehemu ya Serikali yetu. Kwa hivyo ni lazima sisi.sote tujaribu kuyashughulikia matatizo ya wafanyakazi katika nchi hii. Ninafahamu kwamba nia ya mhe. Kiliku ni kuwasaidia watu wake. Hii ni kwa sababu hii kampuni ya Kenya Rayon Mills ilikuwa katika sehemu yake." Kwa hivyo ni wajibu wa kila Mbunge kuwasaidia wale waliomchagua. Lakini utaona kwamba  kabla ya hawa watu kujitangaza kwamba wamefilisika, ni lazima Serikali iwachunguze kikamilifu kuhakikisha kwamba watu wetu hawadhulumiwi kwa njia yo yote. Hii ni kwa sababu wafanya biashara wengine hawana Imani na nchi hii. Wao wa.na.taka. kuwanyonya Wakenya halafu baadaye watangaze kwamba wao wamefilisika. Wao wanatakc: kuwatumia Wakenya kama nguo mbovu. Wao wana nia ya kuwatumia watu wa Kenya kujipatia mali mengi halafu kuwaacha bila cho chote. Ninaishukuru	sana .	Wizara ya leba kwa kufanya kazi kwabidii. Hawa wafanyakazi walilipwa . mshahara wa miezi minne kila nrtu. Mimi natumaini kwamba Waziri mwenyewe atatoa ufafanuzi kamili." Yule aliyenunua hiyo kampuni aliwarudisha kazini.watu hao. Kwa hivyo kupitia kwa Hoja hii ni lazima tuonyeshe kwamba nia ya Serikali ni kuwasaidia wananchi. 	Mr ."Speaker left the ChairThe Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr.Wabuge) took the.ChairBw.naibu Spika, wa Muda, mat a j iri wengine katika nchi hii wana ujeuri mwingi sana. Hii ni kwa sababu vyama vyetu .vya wafanyaka¬zi haviitishi migomo isiyokuwa na maana. Hii pia ni . kxa sababu kuna haii ya uelewano kati ya vyama vya wafanyakazi na waajiri. Vile vile tuna MahaJcama ya Viwanda am Day o kazi yake ni kuhatri ki sna iiwamba wafanyakazi wametendewa haki.' Lakini utaona kwamba kuna mataji wengine amoao wanazichukua shida za wafanyakazi kama mchezo tu. Kuna 'Kampuni moja icuie Mombasa inayojuiikana jcama S.G.S. ambayo iliwaiikuza jcazi watu watatu.Mimikama Mwenyekiti. wa Kanu, Mombasa, niiimwanaxiCLa barua Meneja wa icampuni hayo nikimuomba awarudishe kazini watu nao. Lakini yeye aLliniambia "Go to He, Mr Kanu Chairman; I have people toaeaJL with in tne Ministry of Labour." Niiimwandikia barua kama Mbunge, Mwenyeiati wa Kanu, Mombasa na Waziri Msaidizi katika Serikali ya Kenya. Lakini yeye alisema kwamba hajali kanr,ve kwa kuwa kuna watu	.. hapa Nairobi wanaofaa icuwasiliana naye. Alisemakwamba yeye hawezi kuijibu barua yangu.  Nataka wale wato warudishwe jgazini" halafu nitamwona yule Mene ja anayeclai iswamba yeye ni mtu wa maana sana. I want to see him personally. Yeye ni nani? Haifai kumwaciiisha kazi mfanyakazi kwa sababu ya kuicataa kufanya overtime.' Mimi nimechoka. Overtime is not compulsory.Huyo mtu aliwafukuza wafanyakazi kwa sababu walikataa kufanya kazi siicu za Jumapili.' Isitoshe, walipomwendea wakiwa naile barua niliyowaandikia wampelekee, ye_ye aliwaambia hivi: "I have people to discuss the. matter with in .Nairobi." Simjali huyo Mwenyekiti wenu wa Kanu; mnaweza kurudi na barua yenu". Hata hivyo,nimemwandikia Waziri wa Leba painoja na Disii wa Mombasa, Bw. Francis Keitany nikiwaomba wachukue hatua zifaazo. Ingefaa yule Meneja afahamu kwamba Mwenyekiti wa Kanu si rntu.mdogo. Yafaa Waziri wa Leba azidisiie juhudi zake katika kuwatetea wafanyakazi katika Kenya.Mhe. Kiliku alianza kuwatetea watu wa Kenya Rayon Mills zamaniWalilipwa na hawakufukuzwa kazini. Kwa ' hivyo ningependa kumwambia. mhe. Kiliku, "Well done my son"." Yafaa. vile vile ifahamike wazi wazi kwamba nia ya Serikali ya Kenya ni kuwatetea wafanyakazi-."Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ni lazima tuwe kama Serikali yetu ya Kenya a	mbayo nia yake ni kuwatetea wafanyakazi. . Kama kuna haki yao yoyote ni lazima itoke.. Kwa Mvyo, kabla Wi?ara hajajibu hapa, ningependekeza kwamba kabla ya mtukuiunda kampuni yoyote na kuwa ajiri Wanakenya  kuwe na mikataba fulani. Hii ni kwa sababu mtuWanakenya kufanya kazi katika kampuni yake halafu baada ye akifilisika akose kuwalipa Wanakenya haki. yao. Kii ni kwa sababu mtu akiajiriwa kazi na kampuni yoyote,hasa kampuni ya .kutoka nje, kuna mapatano ambayo huandikwa. Ikiwa kampuni itafilisika, rnwenye kampuni anakubaJLiwa kufunga ofisi yake lakini awaiipe wafanyakazi hpki yao.	 Kwa hivyo, "ni haki Mbunge kama mhe. Kiliku na sisi sote kama Wabunge hapa, pamoja na Mawazirijnia yotu rrL moja tu: kuwatetea wafanyakazi wote kwa sababu wao ni. ngao ya Kenya. Wao ndio wengi. Kwa hivyo, kuna wajibu Waziri akijibu kuwe na mambo ambayo yamefa nyika ya haki na usawa. Wafanyakazi hulipwa mshahara wao na kama kuna madai mengine, ningeomba kusiwe na Ho ja ambayo inaonyesha kara Serikali haisaidii ama haifanyi jambo loloterieai. ningependekezakuwe na mjadala wa kuiambia Serikali kama kuna mambo ambayo hayakuf anyika, nowomba, kwavhisam seffll,. Lakini hakikisholangu Tnimi mwenyewe ni kuwa Wizara ya Wafanyakazi ilifanya kaziwakati ulekampuni ilif ili sika nakuona kwamba wafanyakazi wamerudishwa kazini. Lakini ni. lazima tujbitafute vifungu ambavyo matajiri wetu wa Kenya uwezo wa kuweka mambo ambayo wanataka kama kufunga maduka, kuwafukuza watu kazini na kuwaonea maskihi pasipo kujali.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, nikisema mambo kama hay a, nafikiri tumefikia wakati ambapo ingefaa tuipati Wizara ya Wafanyakazi askari. Hii ni kwa sababu tajiri wa Kenya an awe z a kuitwa na ofisi ya wafanyakazi  na kutumiwa barua lakini hawezi kuenda.He does not care! Namwambia Waziri wangyThuo ni ukweli mtupu. Waziri ni rafiki yangu. Haya ni mambo ambayo nimeyaona huko Mombasa na mpaka leo yanaendelea. Tumewalinda matajiri "wa Kenya pamoja na mali zao. Eata tumewapatia ndugu zetu kama wafanyakazi lakini wakiitwa na ofisa wa wafanyakazi wanamdharau, hawaendi.  Pia waki andikiwa barua na mwenyekiti wa Kanu wanasema, "I do not care; I have people to deal with in Nairobi". Nataka Wizara ifiktrie marobo haya na ichukue hatua. Nami wiki ijayo, Mungu akipenda, baada ya sikukuu ya Pasaka, n^oae kwamba watu warnsrudi ahwa kazini kwa sababu hatupendi kuona watu wakidhulumiwa nam-rifl. hii. Mimi sina maneno mengine ya kusema isipokuwa nataka tuitilie nguvu Wizara ya Wafanyakazi na kuona kwamba mata j iri jwasiwadhuluniu wafanyakazi..Kwa hayo machache, naomba kuunga mkono. </Newspeeh><Newspeeh>MR.

We have a Government machinery which should protect the workers. During	 the time when that Committee will be  working, I would like to appeal to the Ministry of  Labour and all the Government agencies, to ensure that redundancy is completely controlled if not stopped. Sir, in^Kenya unemployment is the greatest problem.

MAHIHU: Just before I was interrupted, I was sayingthat the best, asset that Kenya has,are workers. Workers in all  our industries do a very commendable job. Without the workers our economy, Kenya would not be what it is today.Sir, workers in Kenya have been working very hard,and by so doing they have helped us to  attract more investors. We need investors who can come and create more jobs We needto create a climate of understanding 30 that  the investorswho want to come and invest in Kenya and respect our workers. The workers should also be well paid for their work. Sir, every leader should be concerned with the development of our country especially now that we experiencing this very great problem of unemployment  We should all try to create the climate of understanding between the employers and employees.Sir, every effort must be made by the Ministry of Labour and other Government agencies, to ensure that the workers  are protected. The workers have been doing, a commendable job, and especially in the industries that earn us job foreign exchange. Most of the investors who come to invest here, do so because they know that we have got very good workers who attend to theirneeds. Therefore, we have to create more jobs, and some good relationship between the employer and the employees that is why I am supporting the good spirits of this Motion. The welfare of the workers and their families should be well taken care off, not only when they are working, but also when they are not working. If there is that understanding, the employees will Work harder and become more productive as a result and the industries will make more profits and expand. We have to expand all our industries. The committee that has been appointed to look into the problem of unemployment should be given all thesupport. Everybody who can contribute to succeessshould do so.Sir, there is no part of is our country that does not have a department of labour. The labore offices are doing a commendable job. As leaders we should also appreciate the fact that the officers in the Ministry of Labour are having a very difficult time in creating more jobs. If you go to our labour offices, you see very long queues of people looking for employment People want more jobs, and still others are being dismissed. The Ministry should continue to harmonise the relationship between the employees and employers so that in future we can  attract more investors, and therefore, create more employment Sir, every person who loses a job does not suffer alone!  his family also Sir, It when the Minister will be replying to this motion we will expect him to the former employees of the Kenya Rayon Mills will be paid. I am sure that the Minister is considering the welfare of those people as much as we are doing We should create a  good working atmosphere, that will help us to create more job opportunities. I am sure that the Minister cares for the welfare of these people as much as we do. We should try as much as possible to use every opportunity available to us to create more jobs.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker sir, it is not my wish to make a long speech but all I wanted to stress was the importance of creating more Job opportuni¬ties, inviting investors into this country to create employment opportunities for our people and establishing more industries so that more people can get employed.I support the Motion. </Newspeeh><Newspeeh>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Mr. Salat I am going to give you only four minutes to air your views. </Newspeeh><Newspeeh>MR. SALAT: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me. this opportunity to support this Motion. This is a very important Motion for which I must commend the Mover. " This is because it shows that he is adhering very much to the Nyayo Philosophy of being mindful of other peoples welfare. This is a very obvious Motion with the best of intentions because it talks about the plight of the workers of this country. When we talk about workers in this country we are virtually talking about the economy of this country which means that we are talking about the prosperity of this nation.This is a very straightforward Motion in that it is simply asking the Minister to direct the receivers of  this company who have already collected enough money to pay the workers their terminal benefits I am sure that the Minister will not hesistate to take the necessary action because workers form the backbone of the economy of this countryRedundancy as has already been said by the other hon. Members is a cronic disease in this country. It issurprising to see that sifter the. President has set up a commission to look into the question of unemployment in this country some companies are still declaring their workers redundant. Such a thing is a blow to our efforts. The Minister being a very able man who is very conversant with the labour laws in this country should be able to control the rate of redundancy in this country. The laws governing the Companies Act need to be reviewed This is because we know of companies that are liquidated while the directors of such companies continue to own a" chain of other businesses elsewhere which also continue to make profits.  It is illogical to liquidated a company while its "sister companies  continue to flourish. It is sad that such people continue to get away with such thing while innocent workers continue to suffer. Acts like the Workmen's CompensationAct should also be reviewed. This is because you will find presently that when aworker loses his limb in an accident in a factory he is compensated only about shs.5,000.00. This is not fair because we know that good incentives make workers produce more thus sustaining the economy of the nation through good foreign exchange earnings.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the Motion is very obvious I  do not think I have to dwell much on it. It is asking the Minister in the spirit of being mindful of the welfare of. others to direct the receivers of this company now that they have collected enough, money to pay the workers their terminal benefits. With those few remarks, I beg to support.<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, SirI stand to respond to this Motion by saying that due to the way it has been phrasedit is not acceptable to the Government. We cannot accept it because of the way ithas been put because that  it  an effort to mislead the House. The languageused in the Motion is misleading.  It states that:THAT, in view of the promise made last year by the Minister for Labour</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for the Minister to allow the Motion to reach this stage before coming in to say that the Government cannot accept  as it is? Is he in order to do that when  have already contributed to it? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Yes, the Minister is very much in order to do that. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir the Motion states as follows and i quote</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (ctd):THAT, in view of the promise made last year by the Minister for Labour concerning the payment of terminal benefits of the ex-employees of the former Kenya Rayon Mills and while noting that all assets of that company have been liquidated; this House urges the Government to direct the receivers of the said company to pay in full all the terminal benefits due to the ex-employees without any further delay.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Motion is misleading because I did not make such a promise to the House last year  1989. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKCK: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,Sir The Minister is misleading the House because since last year he has been telling the House that he is going to take action. We have noticed that in this House</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Order What is your point of order, Mr. Chepkok? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: My point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,is whether in order for the Minister" to say what is contrary, to what he hadpremised the House, last year This, is because we know that he promised the Househere last year that was going to be but up to now he has not done so.		Is he in order to refute that he had not promised the House that he would settle this issue how that a Motion has been brought to this House? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Order, hon. Chepkok:I think we should allow the Minister to say whatever he has to say before we canjudge whether he is misleading the House or not. This is because he has justbegun responding to the Motion and we cannot tell" whether he is misleading the Houseor not. Let him first respond and if there is a point that needs clarification thenwe can always ask him to do that. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sirin my reply that was given to the House by hon. Midika on 29th July, 1989, I said;"The employees of the former Kenya Rayons Mills have already been paid their wages. They were paid a total of shs.147,399.00 on October, 1983. The hon. Member knows that company went on receivership." This is not a promise to pay; but a declaration that payment had already been made.So there was no promise. Sir, when the company went into liquidation, there was not enough money to pay the secured creditors. The law requires that the secured creditors be paid first. This is a Government that obeys the laws of the land. The President  charged us with the responsibility to ensure that the laws of Kenya are observed and that we should run this country in accordance with those laws.Where a law needs to be changed, then that is a different- matter, normally, an amendment z is brought into this Souse and it is the duty of the Government to consider whether the law should be changed or not. At present, that is the law. In fairness to everybody, we can only proceed in accordance with the Act in these circumstances.As you know, Sir, Sis Excellency the President is worker number oneand his whole purpose in labour mattes is to ensure that the ordinary worker is safeguarded completely and these are his orders. I follow, these orders to the hilt and make sure that every worker's right is upheld to very limiti .That is what I have done.In this case, the workers have been paid in accordance with the law. Because terminal benefits are not secured, they can only be paid if there is a surplus. In this case, there was no surplus. The secured creditors got only about 40 per cent of their securities. In other words, where a creditor was owed, say, Xshs. 100/= and he was secured under the Act, he only got Xshs. 40/= So there was not enough money to. pay even the secured creditors. now then can you look at unsecured liabilities? It was impossible and could not be done in the circumstances. Therefore, this situation does not arise. That is why I said that the Motion, in its present form, is misleading because, first, I did not make a promise as suggested in the Motion and secondly, the workers cannot be paid their terminal benefits because they are not secured creditors. Terminal benefits are not secured credits. It is this House which passed the Act  which says that when a company goes into receivership, terminal benefitwill not" be treated as  secured liabilities. It goes to say that in lieu of terminal benefits, the workers will be paid four months' wages If we observe the law, then that is what it is. I symphathize with the sentiment that the workers have not been paid their a terminal benefits. I would like tor say that in a way, they have been paid because we have observed the law.The question of redundancy was also mentioned by the mover of this Motion.Whenever a company applies to declare workers redundant, I never accept it as matter of course. I always- make sure that the company is looked into verycarefully by the relevant labour officer. It is only when I am satisfied that thecompany has no other course, that I authorize redundancy to be effected.In my tenure as Minister for Labour, I have authorized less than halfthe redundancies that were asked for. All those that did not meet the criteriawere rejected. Let no one say that we just approve redundancies as a matter ofcourse. We do not do that but scrutinize them very carefully. I would like toassure the hon. Members of this house that that is the very purpose of having redundancies referred to the Minister for Labour.A lot has also been s± said about the need to amend the law. That is not the intention of this Motion. It is not asking for the law to be amended. We cannot at the moment go into that because it is not in the terms of the Motion. If the law has to be  amended, then that is a different question. It is our wish, as the President says, to amend all the laws that contain colonial relics and we are doing so one by one. For example, we are now amending the Factories Act to remove all the colonial relics and to bring it up to-date to meet modern technology. We are in the process of  doing that but have not yet come to the stage of amending this particular one. If there is need for it to be amended, then we will do so.It also been said repeatedly that employers disobey summons of labour officers. This may be true but I do not know of a single case where an employer has disobeyed the instructions of a labour officer and got away with it.There is not one case. In the course of his duties, a labour officer is a magistrate</Newspeech><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: ON A POINT OF ORDER, MR. TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER, SIR. THE WORKERS IN QUESTION ARE CREDITORS TO THIS COMPANY AND IF THEY WILL NOT BE PAID, WHERE WILL THEY GO IN THIS GOVERNMENT?</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Sir. Okondo): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker sir in industrial disputes a labour acts as a magistrate. so if his  summons an employer to appear before his have the employer should comply .If such an employer does not comply with the summons, the labour has powers to ask the police to enforce the summons by arresting the employer concerned- and taking him to the labour officer. Everybody should know that any labour officer presiding over an industrial dispute is a full-fledged magistrate.So, non-compliance with the orders of a labour officer in  sucha matter, can result in the offender being arrested, charged, convictedand fined or jailed. If anyone did not know this, I am now givinga clear warning that any employer who disobeys a labour officer's orders will be doing so at his own risk of being arrested,chargedwith contempt of court, convicted and improsoned or fined for the offence, because that is  what the law of this country provides It is my duty to enforce "that law because it is a responsibility that the President has give me to perform. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. Arap CHEPKOk: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary  deputy Speaker, Sir, in this case a receiver has taken over the company and placed the whole issue in a court. How can a labour officer come in? </Newspeech><Newspeech>The Temporary deputy speaker(Mr.Wabuge): That is your point of order, Mr.Arap cheipkok? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.arap chepkok: is the Minister not misleading the House by saying that a labour officer is involved in this matter when it has been taken to court and orders made? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE Temporary DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr.wabuge): Order, Mr. arap Chepkok I think the Minister was responding to allegations made in tills House that  certain employers disobey the orders of the labour officers. He is saying that he has never heard  of such a case in this country, and that if it happens, then the  employersconcerned can be arrested and charged he is referring to matters wherea 2 labour officer is involved and not a magistrate. I think it isnow clear to you, hon. arap Chepkok  the Minister is saying that in industrial disputes a labour officer acts as magistrate and nobody be he the employer or the employee, can disobey his orders.<Newspeech>The Minister For (Mr. Okondo): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is the position, and I would like to knowof any case where a labour officer has ordered an employer to appear,...and the employer refused to do so and he was not charged with the offence. As I have the responsibility to enforce  the law ofthis land, let me know now of. any employer who has disobeyed a«labour officer's instructions to appear before him, and I will ensure that the provisions of the relevant Act are observed entirelyThe issues raised in this Motion should have been discussed with me before the Motion was brought to this House. I cannot, therefore, recommend to this House. I thus must say this Motion is not acceptable in its terminology. I, therefore, beg to reject it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. Kiliku: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Minister says he is rejecting the Motion, which is his position and not that of the whole House. Unfortunately, since hon. Okondo became the Minister for Labour democracy in industrial disputes hastended to disappear; in fact, we are getting problems from theemployers because of the minister I think the Minister, who happens to be an employer, is behind all the injustice,the workers .are experiencing. It is, therefore,high time the Minister addressed himself- to problems of workers; on the Minister knew that the policy of this country isto mind about other peoples welfare. I am saying this because.the Minister  says that he did not give any promise at all. But. he knows that I led a  delegation of our people from the ex-employees of of the former Kenya Rayon Mills to him. and that while we were having a cup of tea at the lounge, just outside this House, the Minister told those people categorically that they would be paid. Since then, those workers have been anxiously looking forward to being paid.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): On a point of order,Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I do not quite understand whatthe hon. Member is saying I promised. I have read the HANSARD,which is the record of what was said in this House. If he is sayingthat the hansard  is a wrong record, then he should make himself clear, otherwise he is misleading the House. I have the HANSARD which shows a then Assistant Minister in my Ministry saying that the terminal benefits of these people were unsecured. In those circumstances, is the hon. Member in order to continue saying that a promise to pay was given in his House when that is not true? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.isTHE TMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mir. Wabuge): Order, Mr. Malebe I think it is a question of how one understands, or puts  the reply. The Minister maintains, which is of course on record," that in reply to a supplementary question, his assistant Minister said that if there would a balance of the liquidation proceeds after other creditors were paid off, then the workers would be considered. Now the Minister is saying that, in view of the fact that there was no balance, then the question of paying the workers terminal benefits does, not arise, while the hon.Member that there,was promise to pay the terminal benefits. Now the question is whether there was any balance. In view of the fact that there was no balance, then, perhaps the question of a promise does not arise, Mr.Kiliku, this is howI look at it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEbE: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Mr. Kiliku states that the Minister promised, adelegation of those employee over a cup of tea that they would be paid their terminal benefits. Can the Minister deny or acceptthat he gave that promise over a cup of tea and not in this House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr.wabuge): If the Minister gave a promise over a cup of tea, then may be that was done outsidethis House and, therefore, it is very difficult for us to know it.It is up to the Minister to tell us whether he gave that promise or not</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER fOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): Mr. Temporary first of allDeputy Speaker, Sir matters which were, discussed outside this House did not amount to a promise given in this House. Secondly I did not hon. Kiliku,over a cup of tea, a cup of cake or  cup of anything else, anything at all. If I ever spoke to hon.kiliku about this matter, which I do not remember doing and I do not know who discussed this issue with him, I could only have told him about the legal position.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (CTD. ) :I cannot make a promise that I cannot fulfil. After all, when I speak on behalf of the Government, which I must do as a Minister, I can only  say what the Government can do, and I should be able to substantiate it. What I am being asked to do is not something that can be done under the law. Therefore, whathon. Kiliku is trying to attribute to me is purely a pigmentation of hisimagination, and it is not true at all.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I sympathize with the Minister because if hon. Kiliku brought some four people from a certain organisation and the Minister talked to them over a cup of tea, when the same people hear or read what the Minister is now saying, I doubt that he is going to maintain the same credibility as before. So, it is only in order for the Minister to tell the House the truth about what he told hon. Kiliku because that is the guideline we expect from the Minister.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Mr. Kirwa, I think the Minister has said that he never gave Mr. Kiliku any promise. You may go on, Mr. Kiliku.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister has been reported in one issue of The Weekly Reivew as a man with a loose tongue. If the Minister is now denying what he told the delegation I led to him, then God will help us. Since he denies what he told the delegation that went to him from the Kenya Rayon Mills, I just pray to God to help him. </Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: They are going to read this tomorrow.

Whatever the Press has written about me is irrelevant in these circumstances because many of its quotations are statements of untruth, and we cannot bring them into this House. There are many things circumstances, I am going to look for a way in which this House can establish a select committee to probe this matter with regard to what the Minister said earlier and compare it to what he is now saying. The committee will also know why the workers concerned have not been paid using the Shs.48 million that the company's official receiver got. It will also look into the activities of Mr. Madhvani, who has run to Jinja,. Uganda, and established another business there after having cheated that he had run bankrupt. I think it is now time for me to propose that a select committee of this House be established to investigate this and other similar matters because we cannot go only by what the Minister says. The democracy of workers must be guaranteed by the Minister just as the democracy in the Industrial Court must be seen to work.

KILIKU: Kabla sijawasilisha Hoja yangu ningependakulishukuru Bunge hili kwa kuwa na demokrasia ya kutosha, kwa sababusasa hivi  tumefanya uchaguzi ambao haukuwa na uharibifu wa kura.Huyo ni mfano mzuri na kwa hivyo nalishukuru Bunge hili kwa kuonyesha mfano mzuri.Kwa hayo machache naomba kuwasilisha Hoja ifuatayo 11.4.90 Construction of Divisional Market in Changamwe.KWAMBA, huku tukiipongeza Serikali kwa kuisaidia Manxsipaa ya Mombasa kujenga soko kubwa huko kisauni na iklfahamdka kuwa Changamwe ni mbali mno na soko# hilo kwa hivyo wafanya .biashara wadogo hasa akina mama kutoka Changamwe wanateseka mno kwa kusafirisha bidhaa zao kutoka soko hilo hadi Changamwe, Jumba hili laiomba Serikali ijenge soko katika taraga ya Changamwe.Ingawa tunashukuru Serikali kwa juhudi za  kuwasaidiawanakenra, na hasa watu Mombasa kwa kuwa jehgea soko huko Kisauni,lafcini watu waliojenga soko huko hawakufikiria masilahi yawatu wadogo kutoka Changamwe. Kama mtu anataka kwenda sokoKisauni, ni lazima apitie katika daraja va Nyali, na kama Qnagari au mkokoteni ni lazima Qlipe pesa kabla ya kupita daraja hilo.Basi wenye magari wanawatoza  abiria nauli kali kwa sababu  wanalipa pesa kupita daraja la Nyali. Watu wahaofanyabiashara ndogo ndogo na wanakwenda huko Kisauni kununua bidhaahawawezi kuendelea na biashara zao kwa sababu wanapata gharamakubwa ya kwenda huko.Kwa hivyo ningependa ktunuuliza Waziri aangalie pahalipazuri pa kujenga soko Hata kuna soko la Mumispaa ya Mombasahuko Changamwe arhayo hitumiki kikamilifu,  Uinawezakurekebishwa na kufanywa soko kubwa ili bidhaa ziwe zinaletwa hapo,  watu wazinunue kutoka hapo. jAkifanya hivyo lac atakuwa amewasaidia watu sana. Kuna utaratibu wa Serikali wa kuwasaidiawatu wa jua kali, kwa hivyo ni lazima weayie  masilahi ya wenye vioski yatiliwe maanani kwa sababu  hata wao ni watu wa jua kali.Tunahitajika kuwasaidia hata wale wanaouza nyanya, samaki na mboga katika vioskL  Watu kama hawa pia ni lazima wasaidiwe kwa sababu hawana kazi jiyingine ila hii.Aina hizi za biashara ndizo wanazozitegemea kuwasomesha watoto wao. Kwa hivjro,ni jaabo la kuvunja moyo sana wakati tunaposikia kuwa manispaaau Tume Nairobi ina mipango ya kuviboraoa vioskL. Ninapinga vikali ule mpango wa Tume ya 	 Nairobi ya kuviboraoa vioskt700. Hii ni kwa sababu wanabiashara kama hawa ndxowanaochu'cua vyakula kule Kisauni, Mombasa na kuviuza vyakula hivyo kwenye vioskcvyao huko. Kwa hivyo, biashara hii hafwezi kamwe kuendelea kama watu hawa hawatakuwana soko karibu nao. Viongozi wote wanahitajika kutia hima ili watu wote wenyebiashara ndogo ndogo waweze kuendelea. Hii ni kwa sababu watu wetu wengi ndio	wanaoziendeleza biashara kama hizi.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, nia kubwa ya Serikali ya nchi hii ni kuhakikishevkuwa uchurai wa nchi hii umewekwa katika mikono ya wananchi; lakini jambo hili hali- wezi kufaulu kama hatuwainui. watu wetu wenye biashara ndogo ndogo. Hii ni kwasababu ni Wakenya wachache rano wanaoendesha biashara kubwa kubwa. Kwa hivyo, nivizuri kuwainua ili wakiendelea waweze kuwa na biashara kubwa.Ningependa kuwashukuru wafanybiashara wanaoleta bidhaa huko Kisauni kutoka Nairobi  wanawasaidia sana wakazi wa Mombasa. Utaona kuwa kwa sababu Mji wa Mombasa unategemea bidhaa hizi zitokazo Nairobi wakati magari ya kuleta bidhaa hizi yanapoharibi-i  huwa ni vigumu hata kupata nyanya au viazi huko. Hawa waianyibiashara hupeleka Ibidhaa zao moja kwa moja hadi huko soko la Kisauni. Hii ndiyo sababu ninaomba kuwena soko ayiagtne kule Changamwe ili wafanyabiashara wa huko waweze kunufaika pia. 	Tutakapofanya hivyo tutakuwa tunawasaidia watu wengi kuwa na kazi kwani kamatujuavyo kuna uhaba mkubwa wa kazi siku hizi.Siku hizi kuna watu wengi ambao hawaDendi kwaaaikwa kazi bali wanaDende	lea a wenyewe kwa kuanzisha biashara ndogo ndogo za kuyastiri maisha yao.Lakini watu kama hawa jfranapeenete. kuomba mkopo 4wa benki^huombwa dhamana. Ikiwa hawana akaunti katika benki hiyo au dhamana ya aina yoyote basi ina maana hawawezi kupata mkopo wowote. Kwa hivyo, ningependa kuiomba Serikali itafute njia za kuwasaidia watu kama hawa ili waweze kupata mikopo ya kuweza kuanzisha biashara ndogo ndogo. Biashara hizo zikishika kasi bila shaka wataweza kulipa mikopo hiyo pole pole.Ninasema hivyo kwa sababu mtu hawezi kupata mkopo .katika benki kama hana akaunti huko au dhamana ya aina fulani. Hakuna mtu hata mmoja ambayehana pesa katika benki aatew anaweza kupata mkopo huko na, kama yuko, basi ningependa Waziri anieleze jina lake. Kwa hivyo, ni wajibu wetu kuona kuwa tumewasaidia watu kama hawa ili wawe na maisha mazuri.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, miji haina budi kuwa Wabunge wenzangu wengine walisema hapa kuwa ni lazima miji yetu iwe misafi kwa sababu ya watalii wanaoitembelea nchi yetu. Lakini(hawafwatalii] hawaji hapa nchini kuona majumba makubwa makubwa kwa sabahu wanayo majumba kama hayo huko kwao. Wao hupenda kuja	hapa kuona vile tunavyofanya kazi. Utaona kuwa kuna Wazungu ambaohttja hukoMombasa kwenye vioskuili waweze kula chakula cha kienyeji. Hii ndiyo sababu ninahimiza uendelezaji wa vioskL. Tukifanya hivyo hawa Wazungii watakuwa wakija hapa ili waweze kula chakula chetu kwani hata.wao wangependa ile tunayoita kwa Kingereza change of diet.	Mtu hawezi kumfukuza mtoto wake nyumbani kwake eti kwa sababu anasura mbaya</Newspeech>ADJOURNMENT<Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Order, Mr. Kiliku, you  will continue next time.

BIDU asked the Minister of State, Office of the President whether in view of the fact that	wananchi residing along Mombasa-Kinango-Lunga-Lungaroute axe facing serious transport problems,! he	could provide three nyayo buses in order to facilitatethe movement of goods and. services in Kinango Constituency.<Newspeech>THE assistant MINISTER, office of THE President (Mr. Keen): Mr.Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. I appreciate the hon. Members concern in bringing this Question to the House. I am grateful to note that he has shown tremendous-interest, in the Nyayo buses which axe at the moment rendering very good service to wananchi. -However, I regret to inform him that owing to lack of enough Nyayo buses, it isnot possible for the time being to consider extending the nyayo service in mpmbasa to this Mombasa to this area</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Bibu: Mr speaker  Sir, arising from the reply by the Assistant Minister V who is my good friend, would he be kind enough to consider my requestbecause I know there are very many nyayo buses in Mombasa Town where alreadythere are enough means of transportation. For this reason, could he considerat least set aside two nrayo buses for Kinango where wananchi are really sufferingfor lack of proper means of transport.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. KEEN: Mr.Speaker, Sir, I would like to advise the hon. Member toencourage wananchi in Kinango to start matatu and. bus transport business inthe areao This would help a lot in solving the present transport problem inKinango and perhaps the hon.Member himself would benefit from this business by acquiring a bus for himself because we shall. support him However, for the time being, we do not have adequate nyayo buses for distribution throughout theRepublic. So, as much as I sympathize with the hon. Member's sentiments, Iwould like to inform.him. that we have a very limited number of these buses. In fact here the majority of these Nyayo buses axe within Nairobi area and the demand for then is so much that we cannot divert them elsewhere.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. Nizai: Mr.Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell the Souse how many Nyayo buses are there in Mombasa Town.MR. KEEH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I may not be in a position to the tell the House the exact number of Nyayo buses in Mombasa Town, but all I know is that they are few compared to the demand there</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NDZAI: On a point of order, Mr.Speaker, Sir. I specifically asked the Assistant Minister whether he could tell the House how many Nyayo buses there are in Mombasa Town By telling us that they are few, does not help us to know the number. Could he therefore tell us how many	busesthere are in Mombasa Town? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEEN: Mr.Speaker, Sir , the Question, before the House is not about the number of Nyayo buses in Mombasa. </Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. When a Question likethis regarding Nyayo buses is asked in the House, we expect the AssistantMinister to at least be able to give us the figure of the buses in the areain question When he comes here to say that he is not in a position to tell usthe number, then that shows he has not done his homework properly Isthe Assistant Minister really in order to tell the House that he cannot given the figure of the buses as requested by the hon. Member? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEEN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure that the House will agree with me that throughout my Parliamentary life, I have never failed to answer a Question in this House. If I was asked to say how many nyayo buses axe in Nairobi, I would probably be able to say how many they are. Similarly, if I were asked how many matatus there are in Nairobi, I would probably be able to  give the answer, but this is a different question altogether. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NDZAI: On a point of order, Mr.Speaker, Sir.. The Assistant Minister does not seem to know the number of Nyayo buses we have in the RepublicHe said that he knows the number of these buses in Nairobi but not in Mombasa However, the truth of the matter is .that there are quite a number of Nyayo buses in Mombasa Town and the hon. Member is requesting the Assistant Ministerto at least set aside two of these buses for Kinango. Let the. Assistant Ministertell this House the number of nyayo buses in Mombasa.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

CHEPKOK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in his original reply, the AssistantMinister said that he appreciates the concern that has been shown by the hon.Questioner in this issue of Nyayo buses.

Chepkok Tabled a medical certificate . here a week ago indicating that he isof a sound mind, I think it may be necessary for the hon. Member to up-date that certificate from time to time.  I think he should renew his credentials with Br. Mustafa from time to time.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.CEEPKOK: Mr. Speaker, Six, can the Assistant Minister withdraw those remarks?

Member, I  withdraw those remarks. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister did not answer the supplementary question! put to him. Why. is he unable to send one Nyayo Bus to Kinango? I would like him to  answer that question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEEN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already said that the question of the. number of Nyayo Buses in Mombasa Town is a different question. So, I need sufficient notification to be able to give a proper answer to this House regarding the correct number of Nyayo Buses in Mombasa, Nairobi, Nakuru and so on.</Newspeech>MR. KUBO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. TheQuestion itself mentions Mombasa. So, if the Assistant Minister was serious he should have seen that the hon. Member was asking about the Nyayo Buses that are already based in Mombasa. Can the Assistant Minister consider taking some of these buses to Kinango.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEEN: Mr.Speaker, Sir, I have said that even if there were 100 "buses in Mombasa, I am not prepared to consider sending two Nyayo Buses to Kinango because I consider this to be unnecessary. The hon. Member may be well advised to encourage local people to start bus operations in the area</Newspeech>.<Newspeech>MR. MUTUA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.Is the Assistant Minister aware that these Nyayo Buses are public property?	Since these buses are public property, is the Assistant Minister aware that they should be shared out equally to all parts of the country?</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. KEEN: Mr.Speaker, Sir, I am very much aware that Nyayo Buses are public property and when one becomes available in l995 or 1998 I will be too glad to send one to Nithi.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

WAMEYO asked the Minister for Health since eighty five percent of the prostitutes tested, for AIDS in Nairobi have been found to be carriers of the AIDS Virus, what the Ministry has done to create awareness amongst the vulnerable groups</Newspeech>.<Newspeech>MR. KAMUYU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. TheQuestion by hon. Dr. Wameyo must be re-examined. This is becauseI think the Question is derogatory and misleading and also extremely insulting to Nairobi people. I say this because AIDS is not confined to Nairobi only. I think the hon. Member must lay documents on the Table to prove that 35 per cent of the prostitutes in Nairobi are AIDS carriers. This is a misleading Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. My pointof order is in support of the point of order raised by hon. Kamuyu.Would the hon. Questioner, even before this Question is answered,Table documents here to prove that 85 per cent of the prostitutes inNairobi are AIDS carriers?..</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order! Hon. Members, I do not see anythingwrong with this Question. What is important here is . for theMinistry of Health to react to it. The figure may not be 85 per centbut I know that this disease is present in Nairobi.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Couldhon. Kamuyu and hon. Mwenje declare their interest in this matter?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: On a point of order, Mr.Speaker, Sir.'Our interest which we would like to declare is one; that we have beenelected to represent the residents of Nairobi. I must defend mypeople from any derogatory remarks made about them Could the honDr. Wameyo Table documents in this House to prove that 85 per cent ofNairobi prostitutes are carriers of the AIDS Virus?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: I have already, made theposition of theChair clear It is the responsibility of the Ministry to react, to theQuestion. There is nothing with that; AIDS is here in Kenya</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASIKE-NDOMBI: On a point of order, Mr.Speaker, Sir.Are hon. Mwenje and hon.Kamuyu in order to begin to debate a Questioneven before it has been answered?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: They merely stood on points of order andthey are entitled to  raise objections if they so wish, but theymust convince the Chair that it is necessary to do so. But unfortun¬ately they have not done so.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr.Speaker, Sir. I think the word "prostitute" is unparliamentary. What criteria do we use to categorise people as prostitutes and so on? I think the word "prostitute" is uncouth as well as un Parliamentary.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR Health (Mr. Kibaki): Mr.Speaker, Sir,as you can see, this Question has a lot of interest.First, in order to clear the points raised by everybody else,the actual groups or communities investigated upon were very small.So, we are really talking about 200 people or so I do not know whetherto use the word which is being challenged but in common language,they axe "prostitutes"  that is in the ordinary man's language.Therefore, any statistics, particularly percentages based on thiskind of statistics are, of course, misleading because percentagesare very misleading. You Mr. Speaker, since you went to school,know as much as I do that an increase from one to two is 100per cent, and an increase from 100 to 105 is only 5 per centStatistics are called "damnable lies". So, they should never beused by people who are serious minded. They should talk of actualstatistics or actual figures.In any case,Mr.Speaker, Sir, one little quick survey by anypeople of a particular region or part of Nairobi is not adequatebasis for declaring that Nairobi as a whole is like that becauseyou are investigating on a prejudice sample, to use the language . used by statisticians. This is because if you chose a particular area where you know there, is already a high concentration of people who, by the nature of their trade, are more likely to have been infected both by AIDS because it is sexually transmitted or by other S.T.D.s (Sexually Transmitted Diseases) that can be an area which "prejudices" what you are going to investigate.So, I am with the hon. Member for Mumias but it shouldbe called "Miami at thought continues to call it "Mumias"  English He is mistaken because it should be called "Mumia" after late was a senior paramount chief in the axea. So, he should drop the letter "s". He is misleading Kenyans (applause)Now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I agree entirely with. the hon. Member for Mumia. But to go by this kind of statistics, we are misleading the world. Bat this is not to say that the particular members of our society who are in this line of trade are not at risk. In fact, they are amongst the high risk groups. Therefore, our National AIDS Committee focuses "on them and, in fact, concentrates even more on counselling and assisting them. They tell them what they can use in order to protect themselves,and also their clients." We are doing this everyday, and the hon. Member is aware of it because we have programmes on the media, programmes through counsellor and so on. Counsellors who visit these communities are well known to all of us and, in fact, the hon. Member is more knowledgeable about it. So, I do not think I. can really answer him in greater detail "what we are doing to create awareness" In fact, there is " already"enormous "awareness" in Kenya and" almost every Kenyan now". thinks about it and discusses it freely even in ordinary places.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WAMETO: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I repeat the Question: "What is the Ministry doing to create awareness. amongst the vulnerable groups?". May I know from the Minister how many secondary schools in Nairobi have been visited by the National AIDS Committee to give lectures to students about the dangers of contracting AIDS?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIBAKI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am perfectly willing to replyto that question, but it should not be confused- with the vulnerable group" that the hon. Member is talking about Our visits to secondary schools and other youth groups is to make them aware of the dangers of contracting AIDS. We do visit all the schools. The hon. Member I wants to know "how many", and I do not have a figure for him. But I am sure that in Nairobi we have visited, at least, one-third of the schools. I cannot name them one by one, but I can give him the list and the dates of the schools that we have visited. However, schools are not in any way linked with the Question he has asked That is a separate question.</Newspeech>: -<Newspeech>MR. KAMUYU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, since hon. Dr.Wameyo has provedto be extremely knowledgeable in this AIDS business in Nairobi, canhe tell this house tell Kenyans and the world at large  how many prostitutes there are in Nairobi, how he came to know about it, andhow he came down to the percentage of 85, otherwise he should with  draw the Question? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: Mr.Speaker Sir in that context and in the context of the reply by the Minister, could the Minister tell us which specific areas of the City were covered for this purpose? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.KIBAKI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of .the important aspects of spreading awareness -and I want hon. Members to take this matter seriously  is that when anyone has been examined or when anyone has been advised on what to do, we do not go round saying we advised "So and So". This is because if we did so, we would then be spoil¬ing the whole campaign and people would begin hiding away from thepeople who are doing this work. Therefore, even in the areas that investigations were carried out - there were about four areas - we should not continue saying that "We did investigations in such and such areas" because  then people will begin to ask "which house" and "who"? This is not in the nature of the ethics of medical " profession. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I quite agree with the hon. Minister, but I do not want to know "who" was examined. But since the City is very large, could he mention the specific areas, say, estates or constituencies where investigations were carried out so that we are made aware of the dangers? </Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: No No! It is not necessary. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.Kibaki: Speaker, Sir, the hon Member may be veryinterested but actually we cannot promise to. give him this inform¬ation. This is because we are going on  checking theeffectiveness of the campaign that we are carrying out.In all• >seriousness, the House must take the work of those field people from the Ministry seriously. So, if they begin announcing where they will be and what they are doing, next time they go to another area, they will not be well received and the campaign will fail  we do not want it to fail. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRIMA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member for Mumiasshould either substantiate or withdraw this Question unless hegives us the percentages for Mombasa, Mumias and so on? Where did he get 85 per cent for Nairobi from? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIRuKA-0WU0R: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Question worried me last week and I directed a query to the Minister and also to the" Questioner as to whether they would tell us if there is a register for people who are called "prostitutes" I would like to know if the Ministry maintains a register not only for Nairobi but also  throughout Kenya because the. Minister seems to agree with the Questioner that  85 per cent of prostitutes in Nairobi are infected with the AIDS virus. He also seems to agree that there are </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Ask your question, Mr. Miruka-Owuor. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MTRUKA-OWUOR: How did you determine that? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIBAKI: The hon. Member for Nyando is putting words into my mouth. In fact, I started of by rejecting the	proposition about 85 per cent. I started answering the Question by explaining that there was a small community of about 200 people which had been studied but from different parts.Sir, one of the things that the Ministry of Health has to do is to deal with the sexually transmitted diseases.It is also true that the people. who are in this particular line of trade are exposed to those disease.  When they visit our health clinics, we treat them as patients. It is of no purpose to keep  register showing who is who, because, it is individuals who contract disease. There is no disease which is said to be contracted by a certain community. Diseases are contracted by individuals and therefore, you can only have a record of a patientwho were treated, but you cannot have other records.	On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: While appreciating the answer given by theA Minister that the statistics maybe misleading because the percentage is high, the hon. Questioner had good intentions in raising that Question. We all live in Nairobi and so we have an interest in that Question. Nairobi being the capital of Kenya, it could be a transit centre through which that disease could be spread tothe outlaying areas or the Republic. I Therefore, I do not understand why the hon. Members from Nairobi, are trying to reject a Question which is of interest to every  other hon. Member. Were they in order to do that?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: On a point, fa of order, Mr. Speaker, si Sir. MR. SPEAKER: I hope that it is genuine point of order and not a point of  argument. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: It is not a point of argument it is point oforder.Now that the Minister has confirmed that that diseaseis there</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: That is a supplementary question. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: Let me put my point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. if the minister has accepted that the disease is there in nairobi why does he use for treating those patients who are already suffering from the disuse?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Let us now move on to Mr. MwamzandisQuestion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.I did not understand why my hon. colleagues, particularly fromNairobi, felt a little embarrassed about that Question. If we keep the papers that we read, we. would have noted that it wasreported in The Kenya Times  of Wednesday 30th August, 1989,on page 21, that and  I quote :"That the rate of infection in a thousand female prostitutes in the study was 85 per cent, and they also had a high rate of other sexually  diseases"The research was done by the University of Nairobi, the Instituteof Tropical Medicine, Belgium and the University of Manitoba, Canada,and it was reported in that newspaper. There was also a report fromProf. Oliech, the Director of Medical Services appearingthe same newspaper, touching on the same matter revealing that some 800 children below the age of three have been found to be infected with the disease. Since now we have getting fas blood that is HIV positive from a number of secondary school student in Nairobi, it is important that parents and Parliamentarians know that they are also becoming vulnerable to the disease, since .many men have withdrawn from the streets and  left the prostitutes alone.</Newspeech>	MR. SPEAKER: Order! Next Question.Question No.95Ambulances for Vanga and KikoneniMR. MWAMZANDI asked the Minister for Health what urgent steps he is taking to provide ambulances to serve Vanga and Kokoneni Health Centres in Msambweni Division.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Dr. B.A. GODANA): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Vanga Health- Centre has an ambulances GK E807 which is now grounded at Msambweni Hospital. It is awaiting the Board of Service recommendations so that it can be disposed off. The Ministry plans to replace the ambulance during the 1990/91 replacement programme, subject to adequate financial provided </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: That Question is about vanga  and  Kikoneni Health Centres and the Assistant Minister has onlytalked about Vanga health Centre. Does he  have any information about the provision of  ambulance at koneni Health Centre</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: .Sir, due to shortage of vehicles in thedistrict, there are no immediate plans for sending an ambulance toKikoneni Health Centre, in the 1990/91 Financial Year. An ambulancewill be supplied to that health centre as soon as funds areavailable.In view of the shortage of vehicles, the Medical Officerof Health Kwale Hospital has been instructed to carry out frequentvisits to health centres which have not means of transport</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Last year, there was a similar Question which was brought to this House, and the Assistant Minister who replied I think it was hon. Ogur said that the ambulance for Vanga Health Centre was in the garage under repair I pointed it to him that the ambulance was grounded in a  just opposite mateernity hospital but  he did not agree with me. Does'he now agree with me that the ambulance for Vanga Health Centre has never been taken to the garage for any repairs whatsoever? </Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: If I heard the hon. Member correctly, he said that he had asked that same Question in the last Parliament, did he I say that? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: I said exactly that., I said that theAssistant Minister was being misled by his officers in the field, in that there was no ambulance in the garage under repair because grounded opposate "Msambweni Maternity Hospital.Would the Assistant Minister, therefore, agree with me that they was being misled by his officers in the field</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL.HERITAGE (Mr. Nooru) : On a point of order, Mr.Speaker, Sir.I think hon. Mwamzandi is misleading this House. If I heard him clearly, he said that he has asked the same  Question during the last Parliament.  I was in this. House, but I did notsee hon. Mwamzandi in that Parliament therefore, he was not here. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Did I say last Parliament or lastSession. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: You said last Parliament. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: I said last Session, therefore, I sympathisewith my hon.  colleague because did not hearing what I said correctly because he. is fasting during this month of Ramadhan therefore I said last Session. </Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: I think the hon. Member should fair enough and  that I am now answering the Question that he has put to the House today. Just as he had said I am not  the one who had answered that Question last time. He should  to be fair to  allow me perhaps to answer his supplementary question that he had raised. At the moment, I am answering his have agreed that the vehicle is grounded at the moment, and we have got is plansto replace it in the next replacement programme.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question, Mr. Malebe.</Newspeech>Question No. 125<Header> Vehicle for Akachiu Health Centre </Header >MR. MALEBE asked the Minister for Health since there are no Government hospitals in Lgembe Division and realising that there are only two Government .dispensaries in this area, whether he could urgently provide a vehicle to serve Akachiu Health Centre.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Dr. B. A. Godana): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Government provides transport to health centres and not todispensaries subject to availability of funds. Since Akachiu is a dispensary "and not a health centre, it does not qualify to be provided with a .vehicle.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think there, is mistake in the Question in that I meant two Government health centres and not dispensaries. The Assistant Minister should have known that we have two health centres in Igembe, that is, one in Akachui and another one in Kangeta. I remember the Minister promised during thelast Session that he would provide a vehicle to serve Akachui  Dispensaryis now a health centre. When is the Ministry going to provide a vehicle toAkachui Health Centre? This is because in Igembe we have, no Government hospitalapart from the two health centres. Since we are not enjoying any Governmenttransport, could the Assistant Minister as a matter of humantarianism provideone vehicle to Akachui Health Centre? </Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, Akachui Dispensary which the hon.Member wants us to upgrade to a health centre and which we will if his districtdevelopment committee (D.D.C.) recommends so is only eight kilometres from MauTown which has a big mission hospital. Emergency cases in the area are usuallyreferred to this hospital and we are satisfied for the moment that this hospitalwhich is working in collaboration with the Government is doing a good job. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is it in orderfor the Assistant Minister to say that the mission hospital will cater in place of  Government health centre? This is because there are no vehicles in this mission hospital that could be used by the Government health centres. How can this be so? </Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the hon Member shouldunderstand that mission hospitals work in close collaboration with the Government. In fact, the Government gives them some contribution of a token sum and when we plan our health facilities in the country we do so taking into account what is provided by those mission hospitals which as I have said get some contribution from the Government. So it is therefore proper for us to take into account what exists in mission hospitals when we are extend health care services to the people.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the Assistant Minister is intentionally refusing to assist this health centre.or Igembe Constituency. This is because the health centre is more, than eight kilometres from Mau Mission Hospital and casualty cases have to be transported on stretchers to the mission hospital. In fact, this has forced many women to give birth on the roads because of lack of transport. Could the Assistant Minister be serious and "answer this Question positively This is because we have to serve these people who are tax¬payers  Is the Assistant Minister satisfied that these people who need these facilities so much should, remain without transport? </Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B.A.GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure the hon. Member that the people of Igembe Constituency like the people of the other constituencies have the attention of the Ministry because we are concerned about them just as we are about the others. We have not forgotten them and thus it is not proper for him to try and impute that kind of motive. As I have said, the Government policy at present is that it provides transport to health centres and not to dispensaries. If the hon. Member still thinks that there is need for Akachiu Health Centre to get transport, then the ball is in his court. He should approach his D.D.C. to recommend for its upgrading and after which we will give them the vehicle. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SALAT: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I heard the hon. Member correctly, he is referring to Akachiu as a health centre while the Assistant Minister refers to it as a dispensary. Could we be informed whether it is a health centre or a dispensary? </Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a dispensary and, in fact, the hon. Member conceded in his supplementary question that it is so when he said that there was some error in the original Question. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Make sure that it is a point of order and not asupplementary question, Mr. Malebe</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, Akachui-Health Centre was recommended"by the D.D.C. for upgrading. from a dispensary to a health centre and the Ministry has the minutes of those recommendations and resolutions. So even if there was that error in the original Question they should have known that it is now ahealth centre. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

GODANA asked, the Minister for Livestock Development why Mr. Jaldes Galgalo, formerly stationed"at Moyale Livestock Office has not been compensated in accordance with the Workmen's Compensation Act for "injuries sustained in a road accident on 27th February, 1979, involving a vehicle GK 42H, while on duty.<Newspeech>MR.

WAKOLE asked the Minister for Water Development what has caused the shortage of water supply in Garsen and Tarasaa Trading Centres, Ngao Village and Hospital for the past 18 months and when this problem will be solved. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Mweu): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.I would first of all like to correct the impression that the two water supplies at Garsen and Ngao have been out of operation for 18 months as implied by the hon member Mr. Speaker, Sir, Garsen Water Supply, according to our records, broke down in November, 1989 as a result of of heavy floods on the Tana River The high- lift pump used to pump water to Tarasaa, Ngao Market and a secondary school nearby,broke down in July, 1989 and only the low-lift pump has been in operation since. As for Garsen, the area remained flooded until the beginning of February this year, when the floods subsided and my technicians were able to remove the engine for repairs and modification to avoid future problems. The generator and the submersible pumps have now been repaired. My Ministry is now in the process of purchasing a 400 metre electrical cable at a cost of shs.120,000.00 which will be installed as soon as possible to enable the supply to go back to normal operation.In respect of Ngao Water Supply, water has been available through tanker since the high-lift pump broke down. However, the District Tender Board adjudicated the purchase of an engine, generator, submersible pump and an electric pumping set. The cost of these items is shs. 628,000.00. only shs. 350,000.00 was available a reallocation of shs.160,000.00 from Ministerial Development Project was discussed and agreed upon by the District Executive Committee meeting on 28th March, 1990. However, a further shs.120,000.00 is still required to meet all these expenses In the meantime," a generator, a submersible pump and an electric pump will be purchased so that the supply is brought back to operation.Further to this, today,. 11th April, 1990, I have been informed that the generator has been bought.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.WAKOLE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the Assistant Minister aware thatthere was no water in Garsen Trading Centre the whole of last year?  I askeda similar Question during the last Session and the Assistant Minister told methat they had no funds. </Newspeech>		<Newspeech>MR. Mweu: Mr. Speaker,Sir, I am aware. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAKOLE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has told us thata generator has already been bought.. When will it be sent to Garsen? MR. MWEU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I got this information from my District Water Engineer Sola, and, therefore, it is not true that the a generator was bought here today. I got that information from Hola. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.G. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the Question, this borehole serves a hospital which is a very  important facility. . Could the Assistant- Minister assure us that he will avail a stand-by engine so that such situations do not arise again? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. Mweu: Mr.Speaker, Sir, the engine should be at the river and not at the hospital. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAKOLE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the Assistant Minister is joking. 3e should give us a proper answer. Is he aware that recently students in. Ngao.Tarasaa boycotted classes and burned a dining  hall because of water problems</Newspeech>- .<Newspeech>MR. MWEU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sorry if that happened but I am not aware that there was a strike because of water problem</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.G.Godana: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant	. .Minister has not answered my question. I did not imply that the engine was meant for the hospital but for the borehole which supplies water to the hospital. Could he, therefore, avail a stand-by engine to pump water when the existing one breaks down? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWEU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, a. we have modified the pump to safeguard itfrom flooding in future. we have installed an electric submersible pump and, therefore, this problem will not rise again. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

The resealing of this road is earmarked to start next financial year using the toll funds. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMHJA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have not seen the unit the Assistant Minister is talking about that is charged with patching the potholes.

Wambua : On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

NDETEI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister be specific as to when these potholes are going to be patched? This is a very important road, which is used by sand harvesting lorries that move at very high speeds. The potholes have "eaten" both sides of the road which is now so narrow and difficult to drive on. Can the Assistant Minister promise this Bouse that that road is going to be repaired tomorrow or the day after? . </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am very sympathetic with the hon.Members from this area.

KILIKU asked the Minister for Lands and Sousing whether he could direct the Board of Directors of the National Housing Corporation to withdraw their recent decision to increase house rents for its houses in Changamwe Constituency.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LANDS AND HOUSING (Mr. Mbela): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.It is not necessary to direct the Board of Directors of the National Housing Corporation to withdraw their recent decision to increase rents for their houses in Changamwe Constituency because it is Governmentpolicy that parastatals operate profitably.The Corporations effort to operate along these lines is, therefore, acceptable and requires that rents chargeable for these  properties be both realistic and comparable with the market rates. In fact, the recent rent increases are still much lower than the market rates.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.Kiliku: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Minister says thatthese new rates are still lower than the market rates could he tellus how much the market rates are?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. MBELA: Mr.Speaker, sir, as the market rates as perprofessional valuation for the accommodation for which theNational Housing Corporation (NHC) is charging Shs.1200/- is shs.2,000/per month, which means ,the NHC accommodation rate is Shs.800/ below valuationTHE ACCOMMODATION RATE FOR WHICH THE NHC IS CHARGING SHS. 1,600/- IS VALUEDat Shs.2,300/-, which means that Kenyans will pay Shs.700/- below the market rate. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. kiliku: Mr. Speaker, Sir, considering that these house rents have been increased by 50 per cent and that the NHC is supposedto provide housing for low-income earners I do not know is  whether the minister trying to implement the Government policy that everybody should have decent accommodation. Most of the affected people cannot afford to pay the house rent of Shs.l,200/- per month since most of then earn Shs.2,000/-, or less, per month. In any ease. a rent  increase of  50 per cent at once is not realistic. Could the Minister treat the case with some humanitarianism and, perhaps, do something about it? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.Mbela: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member, is suggesting that the NHC should subsidise the  which we are unwilling to do. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>DR. MISOI:  Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we appreciate that, market values of houses goes up, it is surprising that the NHC has to wait for so long that when it increases its rents, it does by 50 per cent what is .the Minister doing to ensure that. the. NHC revises its rents as time dictates? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.kbEIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I expect the tenants to be grateful because the rents were not increased in time. If they were increased progressively they would be a but higher than at present. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the Minister. informthe House the criteria  which the NHC used to increased the rents bearing in mind, that the houses in Changamwe were built in 1970 What has the  Corporation done to the houses to warrant the increases? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MBELA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said earlier  on that a professional valuation was done before the rents were increased. I would also like to add that even if the houses were built in the 1970s, this	did not mean that the NEC should not beable to trade profitably It has a right to have a proper oninvestments and also be able to get funds for repairing the houses. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.Mslebe: On a point of- order, Mr. Speaker Sir. Ijust asked the Minister to give us the criteria the NHC used to -increase the rents. I know we have valuers who do valuations. Butwe want to know the particular features they look for in order tojustify the rent increases - the issue is not just to enable theCorporation to get income</Newspeech>.	<Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Malebe, that is a supplementary question and nota point of order.

KIBAKI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, you will remember that this morning when a point of order was raised regarding the speech I made at Kathiani, Machakos, on the World Health Day, it was stated that I carried the debate on cost-sharing outside the House, which was against the Standing Orders of the House. I would just like to explain how this- matter happened because I am very aware of the Standing Orders of the House which relate to the fact that a debate before the House should continue to be discussed here until it- is concluded.On the material day, it happened that when local leaders spoke, before the two Ministers present, that is, the Minister for Environment and Natural Resources and I, they raised this particular question, saying that at the hospital in that particular place and at another hospital within the district, people had been told to go home to collect money, before they could be treated. It was stated by the hon. member for the area and one or two other people that since the Minister for Health was there, he would clarify the matter when he came to speak. When a large audience of that nature was told such a thing, you could not, as a Minister, fail to reply and explain the Government position because all those people at the meeting would not understand what it was that stopped you from explaining to them the realities of the matter. It was in that context that when I came to speak I made quite clear that nobody should be denied treatment because he did not have money to pay for it.That was not a new position and, even if there was such a matter before the House, this particular policy was included even in my original statement which I lay on the Table of this House. So, I was not really saying anything new; I was merely repeating and clarifying it. I did not in any way initiate anything that would contravene the conventions and traditions of this House.I just wanted to make this point quite clear, Sir.</Newspeech><Header> PERSONAL STATEMENT </Header ><Newspeech>Mr.Kipkorir:On a point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir.

Kipkorir laid the documents on the Table) Okay, I will look at themBill Second Reading The Pensions (Increase) (Amendment) Bill(The' Assistant Minister, Office of the Vice-President and" Ministry of Finance (Mr. Kariuki) on 10.4.90)(Resumption of Debate interrupted on 11.4.90) </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I was saying yesterday before the House adjourned, every civil servant or EVERY pension or gratuity beneficiary  should write a will to avoid confusion, particularly in case he dies leaving behind dependants who should inherit his estate It is important to note that the simple fact that one has written a will does not mean that he is soon going to die. This the writing of wills has been a long standing tradition, we should accept it as a way of solving problems that may face a deceased dependants. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important that the Government should hold seminars to educate retiring civil servants on the procedure's and systems of the payments of pensions. I am saying that because some time's delays in paying civil. servants their retirement benefits arises from their own ignorance on the matter. It is important that seminars to Educate civil servants and other employes in the private sector on how to go about claiming their final benefits so that no much time should be wasted before one can be paid his dues. Retirees should be told which office's should serve th&n because delays in payment of final benefits affects many lives. It is only by holding seminars that retirees can be educated on; how to claim their dues.	Mr. Speaker, Sir, this increase is a clear indication that the Nyayo Governmentis determined to look into the problems of its employees. This is an indicationthat the Nyayo Government is mindful of the welfare of the people of this country.It is for this reason that everybody should come out and support this Government.However, those who continue to blame our Government and its leaders, shouldappreciate the positive steps now being taken by our Government to benefit, notonly those currently working in the civil service, but also those who have retired.This is should serve as an example to those who continue talking ill of thisGovernment Therefore, those who have continuously refused to understand the policies, of our Government, should know, that through this Bill, the Government	is determined to look  into the welfare of its employees. It is a shame onthese people to continue saying that the welfare of the common worker in thiscountry is not looked after. It is clear in our policy that Government iscommitted to serving its people and to continuously review their, conditionsand terns of serviceMr. Speaker, Sir, it is gratifying to note that the Pensions(increase)(Amendment) Bill will also include the female employees so that theycan continue to enjoy the same pension,  which was formerly only enjoyed bymale workers This is encouraging particularly because women form a large numberof the civil service. Sir, there is also a pensions scheme for the hon Membersof this House and this scheme should also be reviewed in the same manner and this kind of prorata increment should also be reflected in the. scheme.I am saying this because Members of Parliament are also servants of the peopleand if this was reviewed, they would feel happier when serving wananchi. AlthoughMembers of Parliament are not categorized as civil servants, I consider itimportant when we are discussing  the Pensions (increase)(amendment)for the civil servant that the pensions scheme for the. hon. Members of this Houseshould also be reviewedMr. Speaker, Sir, I think other people working in the parastal bodiesshould also benefit by having their pensions schemes reviewed. Everybody from the mostjunior to the most senior position both in the civil service and in the parastatals should benefit. Today, the ordinary worker is worried about his future when he is not able to work after retiring. However, we hope that once this Sill is passed, the ordinary worker will stand to benefit. We hope that this will also be extended to the other category of workers including those in the private sector. I am sure the Assistant Minister in the Office of the Vice President and Minister for Finance, who is present here, has taken note of this point.Finally, Mr.Speaker, Sir, it important once this Sill is passed to the delay inminimize the delay in pensions payment to those concerned. I am saying this because the fact that one has  retired does not mean that one has stopped paying hisvarious bills. I know there are many people who axe waiting to hear the outcomeof this Sill and these are the retired workers who have done a lot for thedevelopment of this country. These people are patiently waiting for the passingof this Sill because the amount of tensions that they have been receiving hasnot really been able to meet their expenditure and most of the times, they havenot been able to make their two ends meet. I hope that once this Sill is passed will be implemented immediately and that Government will continuously review the on as and when the need arises.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for bringing this Sill to the House to review the Ramtu Commission with regard to Pensions. This Commission did a good job and I think it is high time that another salaries review commission was set up to look into the possibility of increasing salaries for the ordinary workers in this country. The same review should be done with regard to the N.S.S.F recipients so that they may have some extra money to live on when they have left employment. -With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Massir): Ahsante sana Sw.

I will start by declaring my personal interest in the Bill. This is because I am a young pensioner who still has a long way to go before benefiting from this amendment. I find the Bill very timely and I support it fully except for the reservations I shall make.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir, pensioners are men and. women who have served this Republic with distinction and need help intheir old age. I do not know the exact definition of theword "pensioner" but I would like to believe that it refers to those who have put in long years of service. As a result of the cost of living going up due to inflationary trends in our economy, I think this amendment is very	timely.</Newspeech><Newspeech>The ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE (Mr.Karingi) (ctd)So, those who have made their contribution in the development of thiscountry should be  rewarded by the Govenment. I therefore support this Bill fully.I would like- to say that the formula that is used to calculate the increase is very appropriate because it tends to. favour those who are at the bottom of the scale. However, I would, like to . urge the Vice-President and Minister for Finance to. ensure that pension is payable as quickly as possible." This is because pensioners are suffering and they may not have any other source of income." Therefore they need to be paid promptly.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say, with¬out casting aspersions on the integrity of the officers of the Ministry, there have been undue delays sometimes due to missing files. I would therefore like to appeal to the Ministry '	to ensure that this becomes a thing of the past."My next point is on what I might call discriminative tendency whereby those who retire under the 10 year rule are not being favoured The people who retire under the 10year rule are usually people who have served the Republic with distinction .I want   to take one or two hypothetical cases of young graduates who leave the university and join the Civil Service at the age of 22 years and put in  25 years of service each ana thus each of them  retiring at the age of 47 years. You will find that such pensioners will not benefit from this amendment.</Newspeech>				<Header>QUORUM</Header> <Newspeech>DR.

Before I was interrupted,was giving an hypothetical case of a young university graduate who joins the Civil Service at the age of	22 years and rises	 throughthe ranks very quickly and by the time he is	45 or	47 yearsold is he already a Permanent Secretary of long standing.  You willfind that if he retires he will not benefit from this amendmentbecause he has not attained the age of 55 years.	However, ifanother person joins the Service at the age of 40 years and worksfor 15 years and retires at the age of	55 years he stands to benefitfrom this amendment.	I	think, with due respect, it is unfair onthe part of the	Vice-President and Minister for Finance todisregard the long service rendered by the officer who retired before he was	55 years of age.	I think in future accommodation shouldbe found for such-cases.	This is because many of the civil servantswho retire	at an early age	still	 have young children andthink their needs are even greater than those of the senior citizens who retire at the age of 55 years hence my argument that the young pensioners need special consideration.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I consider the Bill very timely and I support it wholly. 	But I would like to remind the Vice-President and Minister for Finance that next time he should also consider the your pensioners because they do need attention. 	Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KAMUYU:	Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,Sir,  for giving me a chance to contribute to this Pensions 	(Increase) (Amendment) Bill.   our old Kenyans who are retiring have suffered considerably especially when collecting their pensions because of the fact that they have to travel from so far in the rural areas to come here to Nairobi to identify themselves,  to follow up the complicated offices here and there, and finally to convince the officers that they are truly the genuine pensioners. Therefore, proposal is to decentralize as much as possible the pensions offices 	into every districtdivision and possibly even location.	This is because it has becameextremely difficult to travel to come here and yet we have many  responsible officers. For instance, we have many university leavers  who can be sent to the districts so that they can effectively work and help the old people.	Many pensioners at that age of 55 years are notonly old but also sickly.	Many of them know little about Nairobi orNairobi offices and, therefore, it is about time we very seriouslythought about decentralization of the pension centres.	This is very important because personality I have come across some old people from far upcountry who come here although I do not prevent them so that I can show them how to go about these matters.	Some of them come 	 here and stay for a day or two, one week and so on.	Itwas also very good when the pensions' officers in the Ministry madea decision to come back into the City centre.	I believe at one timethey had attempted to go slightly out of the City centre alongLangata Road so that they could be able to meet the people, there.When the pensioners came, they used to find it extremely difficultto find their way there, or to locate that place.	It is better nowthat they are here.	But that is not enough.	We have to thinkseriously about decentralization of these offices because it is very important.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir, when a person has worked for, say,	30 or 40 years, he is really "flogged". He has worked 	  so long and tolerated so many things to be able to reach there, deserving to be able to retire without any complications. 	Pensioners have accumulated so much money that to give them this money in piecemeal is not fair. What is more is that the purchasing power of money is changing every day. That you are able to buy today will cost  three or four times in a year's time.	So, I would like to callupon the Ministry or the Treasury to consider establishing whatI might call "Pensioners' Bank".  This is where all the pensioners' money should be put into an account where it is earning interest.The pensioners should also be regulated by Government officers because, after all, pensioners are still part and parcel of our society. 	So, we have a duty to guide them and give them the basicguidance.	So, we should set up a Pensioners' Bank where we deposit the total earnings of each and every Kenyan who has retired to gointo a bank so that the money can earn interest.	These days moneyis expensive.	Therefore, they can be able to find their totalemoluments put into one big account and earn, say,	14,	15 or 16 percent interest or even more.	This is very important because when an. old person has reached that far in age, he needs a lot of guidance.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also dare say that we 	should think about counseling the pensioners, say, at district or divisional level. 	We should have counselors who will be able to 	talk to guide and advise the pensioners so. that they do not get too 	excited by this "big amount of money" which sometimes makes them get socially lost.When I am talking about pensioners, I am not only talking about Government pensioners but also private pensioners. 	I callupon private-employers to follow suit especially in increasing the  pensioners’ percentages, as the Treasury has directed.	There. aremany private employers in the country and they should also do the same. 	If there is also a possibility of establishing the pensioners' bank, they too should put this money of the pensioners into one central investment bank. This is very important. The Government, as the biggest employer, and the private sector, have one common plan for the pensioners in terms of long term investment. If you leave some of the pensioners here, they will just grab their money and go back upcountry. Some of them will get excited. Either because they have been waiting for this money for a long time, they will simply go and get themselves a second or third wife, 	 or some may go and take this money into a bar and drink themselvesto death and so on.	That is why it is very important to havecounselors or field officers who go round counseling those people in order to show them the way to handle their own investment. This is a lifetime investment. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, because of the increment in population of this country, there are so many graduates leaving university here locally and-overseas. I congratulate the Government for giving the 50 years' optional retirement to officers who have served for a number of years. I believe that more encouragement Should be given to the civil servants and other Kenyans who have Attained the age	50 years and above to persuade them to leave voluntarily. Many of them should be encouraged to leave work voluntarily so that we can create more Employment for the youth and upcoming Kenyans who have no jobs.	At this stage, it may not be necessary to do sothrough an Act of Parliament.	But I think this encouragementshould be given to them so that as many of them as possible give way voluntarily so that we can have new and younger generation coming up to take over from them.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,. Sir, some of the6 pensioners, for example those who have lived in the City Commission houses here in Nairobi for so long working very faithfully in some of these institution should be given first priority to occupy or to buy houses  where they have lived for so long. 	A pensioner many have lived in one house for so many years ant  Immediately he retires, he has to go back upcountry. SO, to re-settle himself upcountry sometimes takes a long time. 	Therefore, options should be available for pensioners to be given first priority to continue occupying the houses and to be given first priority for buying those same houses. 	This is very important because the majority of the retiring Kenyans are not very educated. 	They probably served in the Kenya Railways for a long time, or in the Kenya Police Force, Kenya so on. They did not invest very well.  Those people were not very highly educated and	therefore,they did not invest very well which means that they need a lot ofcounseling,  guidance and assistance.	A house is a veryimportant asset to a person who is retiring.	Therefore,  I would like toemphasize that people who are retiring should be given	priorityin owning	Houses.Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir, majority of the peoplewho retired at high cadres around,	1963, were Kenyans ofEuropean or Asian origins,  and most of them have left IR Kenyaand settled in other countries.	Some went to Europe,  Zimbabwe,Australia and South Africa. I think some investigationshould be carried out in order to prove that the pre-Independent pensioners, who are still getting retirement benefits from. Kenya, are still alive,  dead or they have minx changed their citizenship. If some of them have changed their citizenship, and they have become South African citizens,  I think their pension benefits should be discontinued.	I know that there are very manyKenyans of European or Asian origin who left Kenya before1963 .	Some left in order to start businesses in other countriesand others to settle their families elsewhere. If some of those people have already changed their citizenship, I do not see why we should continue paying them pension,  especiallyconsidering that our eco	my is poor.	That	matter should beinvestigated,  and if it is found that they 	are no longer citizens,  theirif	pension benefits should be discontinued immediately.Sir,  our country has got several urban centres such as Nairobi, Mombasa,  Kisumu and so on. 	The Government should seriously  consider constructing old people’s homes in those urban centres. Sir,  if you visit Europe, America, and most of the western countries  You will find that they have got homes for the elderly people, although I am not saying that we copy what they have done. But we should consider constructing such centres in our urban centres. Many of our aged people are lonely, sick, poor and in many cases, they have nobody to look after them, because their children have already settled in various parts of the country. It has become a trend in the whole world for elderly peoples centres to be constructed by Government or through cost sharing strategy and even by church communities. Our churches should stop taking too much and instead concentrate in constructing old people homes. The Kenyan society is mature enough to consider that aspect. Many of our parents have been left alone in the so-called reserves, others are in the city begging. Sir, some of them are desperadoes; they have given up in life; and I therefore, think it is very important to put up such centres. We can do that either through cost sharing strategy or by getting assistance from the central Government or even local Governments. We can get enough funds for putting up old people’s homes. That is a very important commitment, because we have to look after our old people well; after all they are our parents-</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): On a point of Information, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The hon. Member has referred to old people who are living in the reserves. I would like to inform him that the present Kenya does not have any reserves people live in the rural areas, but not in reserves; We have reserves for any animals.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KAMUYU:	If the Assistant Minister listened to mecarefully,  and if he knows English,  I said	“the so called reserves".The English language allows that version.	I am-sorry to hear thatthe Assistant Minister is not listening to what I am saying carefully. However,  just as I was saying,  it is important to organize our people both from upcountry and urban areas, so that we canconstruct old people’s homes.	I would like to appeal to the Ministryof Culture and Social Services and the Treasury to look into that 	 proposal seriously,  so that they can help us to put up old people’s homes where we can take our old people after that  their children should be given a chance of visiting them occasionally. Those homes will also reduce loneliness because they will be able to talk to one another. Also pastors from different religious organization could visit them there and educate them socially and spiritually. With those few remarks,	I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. TERER:	Thank you, Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir,for giving me this opportunity to support this Pensions Amendment Bill. I think this amendment is very timely. 	For a very long time, pensions have not revised,  and as a result, the pensioners have suffered.	We know that	from time to time the prices ofcommodities have been increased, but the pensioner	have not been giverany increases, they have not even benefited from the various  salary reviewsSir,  I think that pension rates should be revised from time to time, when the Government revises salaries,  it should not forget the pensioners.The pensioners have been and are still the pillars of this country. They are people who spent most of their time serving the Government at various levels. Therefore, we should think of those people first, when dealing with salary reviews.  Sir, as I have already	said, some of the pensionersremained in their jobs for a very long time, such that they were not able to acquire any commercial businesses. Some of them do not even have piece	of land. Very soon we shall have many pensionerswho have nowhere to settle when they retire.	Sir,most of the pensioners have very large families.	The questionof family planning had not been introduced in our country when they started serving this country. 	Some of them have many wives, they are also members of our extended families, and therefore, they have children and grand children to take care of. Therefore, pensioners in the cities or towns have problems. When they retire,	do not	to the rural areas because they do notbelong there.	Soon or later, we-shall have pension who were bornin the-city	or towns, and since they have nowhere to go, they will remain there. They will not go anywhere else.  	Sir, I think The Government should help its employees to acquire their own houses. 	I think the Government should approach financial institutions to find a way of 	 ensuring that young civil servant buy houses in which to live when they retire. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is not good for retirees to keep on chasing for their benefits. 	I think the best solution to this problem would be to update their records from time to time so that when they retire they can start getting their pensions immediately.	I am saying so because fax those retirees who	live in town get financial problems when they-retire.and they do not get theirpensions immediately.	This is because they have no other means of getting money tomeet their expenses.	So there should be continuity of payment from a salary to apension.	I know that the Ministry, concerned is capable of ensuring that such athing happens. There have been some delays of late in retirees getting their monthly pensions.	I have cases in my area of retirees who retired a long time ago butup to now they have not got their pensions.	Such a thing should not be happening because the money is there.	These retirees should be paidregularly so that they do not have to keep on playing between their homes and the district commissioner's office to try to get their money. 	So since some of the pensioners earn very little money, they can as well be paid through their respective district officers. 	This will minimise the cost of their having to travel from their homes to the district commissioner's office which is some cases is very far away. So I would like to request the Treasury to make sure that those pensioners who earn as little as shs.300.00 per month is get their pensions through their respective district officers or even through their chiefs. There is a new class of pensioners that is emerging now that needs special consideration. 	These 	pensioners get problems when they retire because when they .go to the rural areas they seem sort of thrown in the wilderness because 	they miss some of the social amenities that they used to enjoy in urban centres.So I would like to suggest to the Ministry concerned to set up libraries at .Divisional and even locational levels to enable these retirees to go there and readnewspapers.	This is because if their social pattern is interrupted they get distressed.	So the Government should consider setting up libraries at locationallevels to cater for this class of retirees. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think retirees should be given special consideration when it comes to treatment in Government hospitals. 	They should be given free medical treatment or the treatment charges could be subsidized by the Government. 	After all after retirement, these pensioners are still Government supporters and are thus the pillars of our country. I would also like to request the Government to make pensionable emoluments attractive so that the Civil Service can attract the right cadre of personnel to serve the Government. 	If young graduates from our universities and colleges join the Civil Service they will remain there only if they are going to get reasonable emoluments when they retire. I think death gratuity should be for all workers.	This is because wenow. have women civil servants who are pensionable.	So if such women workers die.before they retire, their death gratuity. should benefit their spouses.	Thismeans that the widower or the next of-kin should receive that death. gratuity. I would like to say something now about the National Social SecurityFund	(NSSF).	The money that retirees receive from the NSSF after retirement isnot enough.	I think the employer should be made to contribute a substantialamount so that at the end of the day the beneficiary will be the employee.	Sothe Government should come up with a policy on NSSF contributions and providentfunds so that employees can benefit when they retire.One hon. Member mentioned the idea of setting up homes for the oldretired workers.	I fully support the idea and echo that	there should be homesfor retired workers because it is not all of them who have people to take care ofthem when they age.	So I would-like to suggest that we have such homes all overthe country.	Since these old people are our mothers and fathers, it is upon us	to treat them well during their last few days.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

First of all, I would like to thank the hon. Members who have contributed to this Bill.	They have made very valuable	contribution and have suggested veryimportant points and I would like to thank them. for the concern they have shown about the welfare  of those people who have served this nation ably up to-the time of their retirement. The Bill before the House does not suggest anything new.  According to Sessional Paper No. 3 of 1985, it was agreed that benefits payable to retired officers be reviewed upon the recommendation of the Civil Service Salary Review Commission, better known as the Ramtu Commission. This is exactly what we are doing. The first  installment stage was effected in 1986 and all we are trying  	to do is to cover up the installments that were not paid because of some circumstances beyond our control during that time.  A few hon. Members argued about the inadequacy of the awards. 	I must 	mention here that these increment awards  have been worked out very carefully by actuaries who took into consideration the actual awards in the increment of civil servants' salaries. They also took into account the level of Inflation in the country.  All these factors were taken into consideration. I must also make it very clear that the people who benefit are those who retire after the attainment of the age of 	55 years or those who retire due to ill health.	It does not benefit those who m retire because they are sackedfor wrong doing in the Civil Service.	Such people are not covered at all.There is a clause in the Bill that was worrying certain hon. Members 	 and it seemed not to have been understood during my explanation yesterday. 	I. mentioned about Asian, Widows and Orphans Pension scheme and some hon. Members were wondering why we have a particular clause covering  Asians. 	I would like to explain that we are not turning into another South Africa where we have a special law for Asians. The fact that we have a particular clause for Asians is historical and WE have an explanation for it. Before Independence, there used to be three pension schemes.  The first one covered Europeans; the second one was for Asians while. the third one was for Africans.  After independence, the and Asian Civil servants who were serving this country were entitled to a pension under the same scheme that they were serving under.	We are still carrying on thesethings.	We shall only have one pension scheme  as and when Europeans and Asianscease to be employed in the Civil Service.	I hope that that explanation issufficient with regard to the Asian, Widow and Orphans Pension Scheme.	It isnot that there is any discrimination but it is just a historical fact. The cost to the Exchequer for these increases, is going to be £1.6 million for the pensions that will commence on 1st July, 	1989 but there will be an additional £6.5 million for the arrears between June 1986 and July 1989.  Almost every hon. Member who contributed to this Bill was worried and concerned about the delay that is suffered by pensioners who have to travel 	deny from their homes to the Treasury to collect their Pensions. 	I cannot/but agree that this delay is there.	We must first of all address ourselves  to the  causesof the delay.	We must admit that there is some delay caused by theadministrative problems in the Parent Ministries themselves.	There is alsoa delay caused t by the pensioners  themselves when they do not give adequate information to theta officers who process these documents.  Another delay is caused by the office of the public trustee or the district commissioners when they are not able to identify the beneficiaries of a pensioner. What is the Government doing About this problem?  I am glad to say that the Government being aware of these delays and wanting to make them a thing of the past, has taken the following steps:-The Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance has posted pension officers in every Ministry to speed up the processing of Pension. applications.	We hope that this is going to go a long way in shortening thedelays that have been noted.	Secondly, the Government is in the process ofdecentralizing the administration of the pension schemes  as suggested by many hon. Members who contributed to this Bill. 	I hope that very soon, we shall have Pension officers in the districts so as to save pensioners the trouble of travelling all way from the rural areas to Nairobi to look for their pension.  These are two	fundamental steps that the Government is taking.	Ithas already posted pension officers to the Ministries and is in the process of appointing pension officers to help district commissioners in the processing of pensions applications. I hope that in future there will be complaints from hon. Members about this kind of delay. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, many hon. Members Have also suggested that there should be a constant review of pensions 	 Just as is the case with salaries.	I must mention here that this isexactly what we are doing:	This review has come about because ofthe salary review that was done by the Ramtu Committee in 1985 and I wish to assure hon. Member gin another salaries review there will 	 ,1 also be another pensions review. One hon. Member has said that the purchasing power is deteriorating. 	I must say that the fact that the purchasing power of any savings, or any amount of money that one may be having, is deteriorating is exactly the reasons why we are having a pensions review. If there had not been a change in purchasing power of the money there, probably, would have been no need for a review. So, we are having this r  pensions review because we understanr1vmoney has 	 lost value and its purchasing Power has deteriorated. I would also like to join the hon. Members in calling upon all the private companies, particularly the big ones, to follow the example set their employees. by the Government and start pensions schemes for I know many private companies are already doing  this.	But I would like to also ask those companies which do nothave pension schemes to introduce them, because this is a very 	important way of ensuring that when people grow old and retire d  they do not become destitute.	We do not want to see an increaseof destitute in this country because of our philosophy of African socialism, African brotherhood and family hood. The Government decided to bring then bill have because it wants to see our elderly, or senior citizens being taken care of-  With those few remarks, I beg-</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

I am glad the Assistant Minister has noted it and has outlined some steps that are being taken to rectify the situation.

However, I do appreciate the point that he has raised.  I certain	think that it is a wise suggestion:	The processing ofthe pensions should not wait until the particular employees haveretired.

On 5th September, 1969,the Engineers Registration Act, Cap 530, of the Laws of Kenya was 	enacted, and 	established the Engineers Registration Board toaccord legal professional recognition through registration ofthose competent to practise in the country as engineers.  The following two main criteria for registration were set out in the Act, Which the applications had to satisfy simultaneously:-(a) a recognized degree, diploma or licence of a university, or school of engineering. ;.!  (b) 	Not less than three years' practical experience of such a nature as to satisfy the Board as to the applicant's competence to practise as an engineer. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, on 8th November, 	1978, the Engineers Registration 	(Amendment) Act was made, which gave provision for the registration of graduate engineers, being those qualified academically in engineering, but were not necessarily competent to practise as professional engineers.	The proposed	1990 amendment seeks provision for specific appropriaterecognition of the following:-(a)	High National Diploma holders in engineering.(b)	Consulting engineers.The amendment further seeks provision to establish whether all those registered by the Board are still in practice in the country or whether they have ceased to practise. To this end, a nominal annual licensing scheme by the Board is proposed at no additional costs to the Government. It is proposed to introduce a specific provision in the Act for the registration of holders of High National Diploma in engineering or a recognised equivalent, who have satisfied the Board that they have satisfactorily completed an approved course or practical training to be registered as I quote "registered technician engineers". It is also proposed to introduce control to ensure that the required standards of competence are maintained by registered engineers offering their services as consulting engineers. 	A person wishing to offer higher services as a consulting engineer will be required to satisfy the Board that he has achieved a required level of competence in professional specialization. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is proposed, for example, that electrical consulting engineers be registered as such and their activities be restricted to electrical engineering by law. 	There is no provision in the law at the moment to prevent such people from practising as highway consulting. engineers. The amendment aims at individual consulting engineers, and not  engineering consulting firms already registered as such under the Business Act.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move:</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION	(Mr. Karauri):	Thank you verymuch, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker; Sir, for allowing me to speak on thisEngineers Registration	(Amendment) Bill.	Among the things that the Bill seeks topromote is the standard of competence of engineers.	The Bill also seeks tointroduce controls to ensure that the required standards of competence are maintained by registered engineers. 	This is very important because when you travel in the country, you realise that there are roads that are built, but they do not last more than six months. You will find that a tarmac road is built in an area that needs it very badly, but after a very short time, it goes into shambles and develops potholes as the tarmac peels off. So, it is important that the standard of engineering is constantly checked by this Board so that those engineers who do not with Stand the test of time or are not competent are deregistered. 	Nobody would like to come across a road that is meant to last about 50 years wearing out within a year or even less than a year. The Board is going to be satisfied before it registered anybody that he is honest and has reached a high enough degree of competence. 	Talking about consulting engineers, I would like to mention that consulting engineers are involved in the construction of some of the roads that we are talking about, whose tarmac peels off within six months. These consultants are satisfied that these roads. are built up to the standards required by the Ministry concerned. I think professional honesty should be maintained by engineers so that when the certify that a road is up to standard, it is actually so. Consulting engineers are just like the other engineers employed by the Ministry, and we would like the Government to employ qualified engineers all the time so that we do not have to go to external consultants because about a third of the money used in the construction of roads goes to consulting engineers. If many-more-qualified engineers would be employed by the Government, they would supervise the building of our roads and the construction of anything else that is undertaken by engineers.  Therefore, there would be no need of having external consulting engineers. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, one of the reasons why I support the Bill is that in the past, an engineer who was qualified as an electrician and registered as a consulting engineer would, in some cases, allow himself to be consulted as a roads engineer, while he knew absolutely nothing about roads. If an engineer's qualifications are such that he should handle electricity, heshould be employed only in that line in which he is qualified. It is this loophole that this Bill seeks to cover so that an engineer should only be consulted in the field in which he is qualified, and not in any other business. 	I am talking more on roads than anything else because, although engineering is not only about roads, these are what we see more practically in rural areas than anything else. Murram roads have been built in rural areas by the Government and, although you may not be an engineer yourself I know that you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, are an engineer, but I am not one sometimes you wonder why the engineer who designed a certain road did not even make provision for an outlet for rain water because you will see that there are no gulleys or trenches to carry away rain water. After two months'  of the particular road being murrumed, the road is washed away by the floods and it appears as if it was not necessary to spend money murrumming a particular road.  That is why I am stressing that it is very important for Only competent engineers td be registered. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, people have talked much about road accidents and the tiredness of drivers.  I would like to add another dimension to the subject of road accidents.  When a road has many potholes, every driver, fearing the expense of buying a new tyre or denting his car, will swerve to avoid the potholes and, in the process, clause an accident.  so, if we want to avoid 	road accidents, but roads must be kept to the required standards, and that is the duty of competent engineers. With those very few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the Bill.</Newspeech>(Question proposed) <Newspeech>MR. MAKAU:  Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this Opportunity to make a few comments as far as this amendment Bill is Concerned. This is an extremely very important Bill, and I am saying so because Of the type Of education that we have embarked on.  The registration Of engineers, for many years, has been for Only those who have degrees in engineering.  Because of the 8-4-4 system Of education we have adopted, what we need in this country in abundance are technicians.  It is, therefore , very welcome that this Bill is permitting those with higher national diplomas in engineering to register themselves as engineers.  I am stressing that aspect because these people who are going through the 8-4-4 system Of education will not get id the university.  So, by passing this Bill, we are going to allow a lot of people to practise On their Own because they will have a Chance to register themselves in the field of engineering.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we should also look at Other professions such as architecture and amend the law so that it suits the requirementsOf present Kenya.  That also goes on to Cover the field of quantity surveying. In such professions, you find that most of the work is done by the technicianwho are not necessarily graduates.  The same thing applies to the legal profession.  In fact, in many countries one does not have to have a degree it law in order to become a lawyer.  We have what we call articled clerks, who are eventually allowed to practice as lawyers or advocates.  I am stressing this point because the type 	 of education we have Introduced in this country cannot ensure university entry for everyone.  For instance, Only 16,000 candidates who Sat for examinations last year will get admitted to the public universities.  There are the Other People who will  go to Other colleges to do diploma courses.  There are those who will go to the Jomo Kenyatta College Of Agriculture and Technology, the Kenya Polytechnic and others will go to other institution to read for diplomas and riot degrees. What I feel is that we should look at the type of education system we have and think in terms of those who graduate through this type of education who do not get a chance to go to the university:  They should be recognized by the professional bodies. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we should appeal to the professional bodies, such as the marketing bodies and others, So that they should bring themselves 	in line with the present changing environment.  They should not stick to the Old traditions Of exclussive whereby it is a must, if you are to 	join a certain professional, you have to be a graduate from a university.  It is not going to be possible for a lot Of people to have degree and, therefore, since we are supporting in the new system of education, we should move in line with the changing needs of the society.  Those people who read for diplomas should b  recognized by the professional bodies, and that is why I am saying that this Bill is very important. The exclusiveness whereby Only those who have degree's can be registered in a certain professional defeats the most important thing that the Government advanced in the introduction Of the 8-4-4 system Of education.  Hence, the introduction of this Bill is welcome because it is in line with the type Of education we have adopted. While we need people with degrees, we also need people technically trained in 	 various professions, and those people should be recognized. We need also to look into other areas where people who do not have degrees but are technically trained are discriminated against.  With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Bill.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WABUGE:  Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I will not take' very much time of the Meuse because I have very few Observations to make.  Before I do that, I must say that I do congratulate the Government for this Bill, whose intentions are quite good. The only thing that I would like to say is that the main purpose of bringing this Bill here is to enable young Kenyans coming Out of colleges to be registered as engineers where necessary.  I think the whole idea of registration is, first Of all, to make sure that anybody who is being registered as an engineer has that capability and capacity Of being an engineer.  Secondly, by registering engineers, we will  ensure that professional ethics are maintained.  Those are the main purposes Of registering engineers.  That also ensures that the engineering discipline is also maintained.  Where you have professional ethics in engineering, the two must always be seen in action.  I say that because unless discipline and professional ethics are maintained, there is a likelihood Of the members who will be registered in this body to find themselves being either bribed Or corrupted and, hence, losing the sight Of their professional ethics and discipline.  SO, the purpose Of registering these professionals is to ensure that an engineer applies for a fresh registration every year.  It is only Sat the time of renewing ones 1icence that the registering biddy Can consider whether that particular individual has maintained the professional ethics and discipline.  If a particular individual has not maintained the required professional ethics and discipline, then the registering body Can refuse to renew his license. As One hon. Member has just said, there are a lot of things happening in this country.  We have had roads getting damaged immediately after Construction and we have also had buildings having cracks immediately after construction due to some negligence on the part Of the designers.   Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it has been usual these days for an engineer to give specifications for a particular road where Government spends millions of pounds in the construction of the road. 	However, after a few months, this road starts developing potholes which continue to cause, several accidents. I would like to urge the Minister to make sure that the roads maintenance unit checks the operations of the so called road engineers to find out what they are doing on our roads. If for example a road develops potholes within six months of completion, that particular engineer should be asked to explain why this is the case.  Perhaps there is some corruption involved here and if that is the case, then Government will continue to spend 	 millions and millions of pounds on the construction and maintenance of these roads. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Government must come out to wipe out corruption at all levels and the body that has been charged with this responsibility should not be complacent with the way our roads are being constructed. These days there are very many registered bodies through Acts of this Parliament but they are not actually doing what they are supposed to be doing.</Newspeech><Newspeech>M. WAMEYO: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Is it 	 in order for hon. Malebe to keep on standing when hon. Webuge is contributing to debate on this Bill?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva): He is absolutely out of order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WABUGE: Thank you, Sir. I thought I was the only person on the Floor of this House. 	I was talking about certain bodies that have been registered through Acts of this Parliament, For example, we have the Law Society of Kenya. There are today certain things that are happening in the Law Society of Kenya Which leave a lot to be desired. We have heard of cases where poor People from the rural areas have gone to these lawyers and asked them to represent them in land cases. However, instead of the lawyer helping the poor fellow, he takes his money and keeps it in his own account and the Whole case is just messed up with, and when the client complains, nothing is done. The Law Society of  Kenya is composed of professionals who are supposed to be helping our People in legal matters. 	Today, you will find a layman just being thrown away without any justice being done and nobody seems to care what happens to him. I think that professional ethics must be maintained if we are going to wipe out corruption in this country. We must start with these professionals and ask them to keep their house in order first. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, doctors are also professionals, but quite a number of them do not keep to their professional ethics. Today, if a patient went to a doctor and is not able to pay for his treatment, he cannot be treated.	It is against the profession for a doctor to refuse to treat apatient just because he has no money.	I think our Government should take thismatter very seriously because our sick people today are being exploited from left to right. 	Take for example a veterinary surgeon who refuses to treat a sick animal just because the farmer does not have the money to pay him immediately. What happens in a case like this?  The cow just dies and this now becomes a loss, not only to the farmer, but to the nation as a whole.	This is because thecow was producing milk which was being used by the nation.	Similarly, it is.a loss to the nation because the farmer will no longer pay any tax since he has no milk to deliver.  Therefore, I feel that discipline and professional ethics must be maintained by these professionals. Mt. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, similarly, if an engineer is given a contract to construct a certain road, he should stick to the specifications in 	 the contract.  However, you will find that some of these engineers are crooks. In fact, 	 the so-called businessmen are by nature crooks. 	If you are a straight forward businessman, then you will never succeed and this is a fact.  Therefore, whoever is given a contract to construct a road is a businessman and in order for him to succeed in that business, he must be a crook. Therefore, unless we get people who can stick to their professional ethics, the results are going to leave a lot to be desired. I appeal to the Ministry to make sure that it carries out frequent checks even after this body has been established. They should not feel aver-confident with its work and therefore they have to carry out checks from time to time. 	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, if you take three hyenas and ask them to  decide the fate of a sheep, do you think they will make a reasonable charge against the sheep?  One of the hyenas might be hungry and as a result, he will go for the sheep.	I am trying to say that this body which is going to beestablished by this Act should be checked from time to time.	When the Ministeris appointing the members of the board, he should make sure that the consumers who are not professionals should be represented in the board. I am saying this because we would like to avoid a situation whereby the professionals will be taking care of the professionals interest alone. We would like the consumers to be represented to that they can take care of the other consumers interest. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to remind these professionals that they have a duty to build this nation and therefore, I appeal to them to be patriotic.  They must make sure that Whatever they do in their m profession, is in the interest of this country and not in their personalinterest. At the moment, most professionals will always consider their interest first instead of Placing the interest of the nation first. If a professional wants to swindle his client, he can do so in a very big way and will always. get away with it.  So, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, my appeal to theprofessionals of this country	and more so the young onesis that they should take the interest of this country at heart.	Theyshould be patriotic in whatever they do.	They should not dothings that may injure the country.	A professional should ask himself the following question:	"Is what I am	doing likely to portraythis country as a corrupt country?"	Parliament can enact laws butunless the citizens of this country are ready to serve this country with dedication and in whatever capacity, the laws made by this Parliament will never correct the evils in this country.	We cancondemn .	corruption 101 times but 	unless the citizens	areready to defend the name of the country we will find ourselves beinggiven all sorts of names.	We do not wish that to happen.The intention of this Bill is good.	But I feel that somethinghas got to be done in order to protect the good name of this country. In Clause	20 .		we are being told that if a person isfound guilty of an offence shall be liable to a fine not exceedingKShs.20,000/-.  There is a little bit of improvement on this one. The previous amount was R.Shs.10,000/- but here we are told that the new 	fine will be KShs.20,000/-.  If the layman who has not learnt about ethics PTO who does not much about discipline is being fined KShs.l0,000/- or KShs.20,000/-, what about the person who has undergone the necessary training relating to ethics and discipline? If a person is found to have messed up an important project like a road, or he has been given some bribe to tear apart specifications, he should be severely punished. If a person interferes with the specifications of a major project like proposed Kenya Times Media Trust .	Complex which is coming up soon, he should be heavilypunished.	It will not be proper to fine such a person onlyKShs. 	20,000/-, when he may have been  taken a	bribe of probably more than KShs.1 million.	I thinkthis particular amount of fine is on the lower side.	If we are reallyout to stamp out corruption in this country, I feel very strongly that something has got to be done here. 	This is because a professional takes a bribe while knowing very well that he is going against professional ethics.	He does so knowing very well that he is goingagainst the laws of this country.	Surely, KBhs.20,000/- nothing toa person who has taken a	bribe of about KShs.200,000/- orKShs.1 million.	Here they say that when a person isfound guilty of professional misconduct he will cease to be registered. 	I think they should go further and say that such a person should be disqualified completely. He should never be allowed to practise after he has been found guilty of professional misconduct. I know that the Government is serious about the eradication of corruption and I think the Minister should go back and think over this issue and probably come up with an amendment. I do not want to take too much time on the Bill and I would therefore like to say that the implementation and operation of the Bill must be seen to be done when the Bill becomes law. With these few remarks, I beg to support the Bill.MR. KAGWIMA: 	Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this very important Bill.	I support the Bill which is actually long overdue.   Although I support this Bill I am not sure we have enough details onthis Bill.	This is because we have introduced the	8-4-4 system ofeducation in this country.	We also have the Jua Kali Sector and Ido not know whether this Bill .	will cater adequatelyfor graduates of the 	8-4-4 system of education and the Jua sale artisans. 	I agree with whoever drafted. this Bill that it is necessary. to stop at the level of technician probably because of the need to maintain. quality. I hope that is what whoever drafted the Bill had in mind.  I say this because I believe that this Bill should have covered the Jua Kali artisans and also primary and secondary school leavers of the 8-4-4 system of education.  However, I am nappy that at least there is this good gesture  that the engineers are being. being remembered, wherever they are, by our Government through the introduction of this Bill. Mt. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me touch on the role played by an engineer in the economy of the country; You will with me that engineers,	among other professionals, arevery, very important people, in any country:  Engineers are very important to the economies of developing countries. This is because without Qualified engineers, we stand to be cheated by outsiders; without Qualified engineers 	we will tend to go for very low quality jobs and we also stand to waste a lot of time on experiments.  This is because we will start jobs without knowing whether those jobs will be satisfactorily completed. We have qualified engineers in this country and as a result of this we	have theability to avoid unnecessary expenditures;  This is because	beforeany job starts, the engineer will look into every aspect of the project to make sure that ever; thing in order.  So, with Qualified engineers we can predict with some degree of accuracy the completion and the cost of a project.  So, you can see that engineers are very important people. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we should review the terms and conditions of service for engineers so as to encourage Qualified engineers to remain in the Civil Service.  We should have attractive terms of service for engineers so that we can retain them  in the Civil Service for a long time.  If you look at a cross-section  of the engineers we have in this country, you will find that most of the highly Qualified and articulate engineers are Finding their way to the private sector. This means that the Public Sector will have to spend a lot of money paying consultancy fees because we do not have qualified engineers.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva): 	Order! 	Order!</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KAGWIMA:	Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker.The Government are some other institutions will spend a lot of money looking for consultants. This is as a result of losing those qualified and experienced engineers into small private organizations where they think they can make enough money for. themselves, their families and extended families. So, we should try and support the consulting firms instead of spending so much time and resources.	Some of them are not actually engineering firms.	Some of them do not even belong to this country.We should rather spend money on our own people, train them better, use them better, pay them better, and make them more useful to this country. If we are not careful, initially the Government will spend money taking people to schools, colleges and so on, and after only two yce.ro or three years of practical training, we end up by losing those fellows. These are people we have trained at very, very high expense and the same people are going to be lost into small non Kenyan consulting firms. 	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, what happens when these people join those areas that they think are more lucrative thanthe public service.	After only a short time,  some of those veryhighly qualified engineers find themselves frustrated because someof the firms are run by unqualified persons from outside this country. 	So, those same people will exploit engineers. 	They will misuse them and do all sorts of things so as to contain the engineers pretending that they are paying them well. One will look at the question of salary or money only, but there is the other aspect of how much time one will be required to put into the job in order to get the little money that the consulting firms pay our engineers.	So. It is important to review, as I said earlier, those terms. It is also important to take care of our people. It is important    to retain them for as long as we can so that we are able to utilize the people we have educated. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to make some difference or show the difference between an engineer and a technician This is because quite a number of times some people in the factories or industries have confused the roles of an engineer from that of  a technician. 	At times I have even heard some people in charge of personnel services argue that instead of paying so much money to recruit an engineer, They should	pay little and have a technician dothe same jobs. I would like to correct that impression and say that a technician will not be able to replace an engineer because each one of them plays a different role in an industry.	An engineer will be able to design a project, supervise the same project, give instructions on how to carry out that project and so on. However a technician is supposed to receive instructions from the engineer who will be able to interpret the Policy of the company, and pass the same interpretation to the technician who is supposed to understand and supervise the project that the engineer has designed. 	So, if you replace an engineer with a technician, then you will not be covering all the aspects that are supposed to be covered in implementing a project. 	You will have removed. a man that would design, give instructions for the supervision of that job and so on. 	So, you are only left with one person, the man who would just supervise without necessarily relating the project with the policy of the company. 	So, while I appreciate the role of a technician, it is also important to have the person that supervises,. designs, instructs the technician and so on. Most important of all is that an engineer would be trained to be a person who would rise to the level of management. In fact, Quite a number of times we have an engineer rising to the level of a managing director whereas  you would find it very, very difficult 	 I am not saying it is not possible to push a technician to the level of a managing director, and then expect the same person to co-ordinate all the functions of an institution.	But you can,	with a lot ofease,  have an engineer become a managing director.	So, weshould not overlook the role of an engineer and we 'are also not trying to dismiss the role of a technician. 	In fact, both of them are equally important because they are playing different roles. However, I wanted to define and state clearly that both of them are equally important to the functioning of the industry. So, a technician is there to receive instructions from an engineer and the engineer is there to design, supervise, cost and relate the project to the policy of the company.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT 	(Mr. Muturia): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. While the hon. Member for Tharaka is giving a beautiful contribution on the question of engineers and technicians, we are just having another meeting over there whose chairman is the hon. Member for Mumias, Dr. Wameyo. So, I do not know who should be listened to. Is hon. Dr. Wameyo or the hon. Member on the Floor?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER	(Mr. Tuva):	Keep your tones lowContinue, Mr. Kagwima.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAGWIMA:	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank theAssistant minister far intervening.	I was also getting worriedbecause I thought the House would like to benefit from the contribution of an engineer. So, it is important that we understand and listen to some of these contributions because it is not every day we have this kind of Motion. But it is a Motion that is very, very important to our country especially at a time when we have started going for industrialization with the introduction-of Kenyan cars.  This Bill is very, very important to us. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, want to talk about quality of workmanship in our industries, especially in Jua Kali hope by introduction of Jua Kali Artisans and by allowing our technicians to practice does not mean going for lower quality of workmanship than we have had in the past. Our industries should not only aim at producing things that would be consumed locally, but also for export. Therefore, it is important that we should retain quality of the goods that we produce in this country so that the same goods are able to compete quality-wise and price-wise with other goods	the markets outside this country.	We shouldnot be narrow-minded as we do not want to manufacture things for our own consumption only. We have quite a number of countries that have a long way to go before they manufacture their own car. So, by retaining the quality that the Engineers Registration Board and the Kenya Bureau of Standards support, we shall be able to produce cars of quality similar to those produced by other countries like Japan, France, Britain and so on.  Sir, if we do that, we shall be able to export more goods and earn more foreign currency than we are earning at the moment. If we can support our technicians and forget the quality of goods, we shall be trending on very dangerous grounds. As much as we want  to encourage our technicians and other related craftsmen, we should as much as possible, encourage proper supervision.  For example, the Jua Kali artisans should not be left alone. 	We should have somebody 	who is either employed by the Government or the Engineers Registration Board, who will assist and supervise the  Jua Kali artisans,  so that their workmanship is of high quality. The good; produced by the Jua Kali artisans should be of good quality	but if they are left on their mum own, they will producevery	many goods of very low quality,	Sometimes they may not even observethe engineering ethics, because most of they have not beentrained to observe any ethics.	If nothing is not done intime,  the	quality of goods Ask will deteriorate,  and therefore, itis important to km give the Jua Kali people some supervision. Sir, I would request the Minister to consider offering free or subsidized consultancy services to the Jua Kali technicians. Those people need some guidance. Some of them have never gone to school;  all that they know is that a certain realm or a lump shade is made in a particular way. but they do not know the principles km behind it. Sir,  if the Government could possibly provide some free consultancy services and supervision to the Jua Kali people, it would be very good,  so that they are able to know what they areproducing and the quality of goods that they are producing.If that is done, we should be in very safer hands.	Some of usMay be 	using some of those goods whose safety has not been assured.  When we start losing 	lives,  that is when we shall realize that those things had  problems,	I hope that the	Minister is going to givefree consultancy services to the Jua Kali technicians for the sake of producing quality goods.I would now like to thank the Member of Registration of Engineers Board.  I remember that there is a provision in the Registration of Engineers Board, which says that an Engineer is a person who is fully Registered, after passing a test givenby the Kenya Registration Board.	There is also another provisionwhich says that after a person has served for over seven years as an engineers,	he automatically qualifies to be a fullyregistered engineer.	There are some people who have served asengineers for the last ten years,  but they 	are still registered as graduate engineers. They have not yet become fully registered engineers,  although there is a clause which provides that after any person has served for more than seven years as 	 an engineers, he should automatically be registered as a qualified engineers. I attribute that mistake to the fact that the Engineers Registration Board do not update their records. Sir, I would therefore, request the Engineers 	Registration Board of Kenya to look through their records and they will find out that thereIs a large number of engineers who ought to have qualified for automatic registration as engineers very many years ago, but they are still referred to as registered graduate engineers.   -Unless there is a clause stating that they will be considered fully qualified engineers after serving for seven years, how long can they keep the title? Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Engineers Registration Board should call annual meetings where all engineers can be appraised of new methods and ideas so that they can be conversant with the changes that are taking place in their field. So it is no use for the Board to just keep a register and hope that all is going well. So I would like to suggest that the Board updates its register to be able to know at a glance the number of engineers in the country; but if they do not update their register it might end up containing names of members who are dead which might make it very difficult to know the number of engineers in the country. 	So it is easy with proper records to assign jobs to particular engineers. 	But if the records are not well kept, how can you trace a particular engineer when the need arises? let me now make a few comments about consulting engineers. 	I hope that there has been no pressure, especially from those firms that employ unqualified engineers, to be accepted to practice. This is it because such a thing would be very dangerous to this country because we would be paying. money to consulting engineers who are not qualified enough to do consulting work. As a result you will find out that we will end up with very many uncompleted jobs.  let me give an example to show that we still have bogus consulting engineers in this country. When this work was being given out I was working with a consulting firm that was going to give the job to a consultancy firm. 	During that time I argued against the initiation of that project because I was convinced that it was not going to be completed. But because at times engineer’s ideas are overlooked the management of the firm that I was working for decided to allow the Mzungu to go ahead with the job.	The discussions took about six months.	After spending over shs.5 millionthe project was abandoned and even as I stand here now, it is still not completedand it has no hope of being completed.	This is what I mean by the existence ofunqualified consulting firms:	So the Board should ensure that they register onlyqualified engineers to render services to this country.  Sir, if we register engineers without control, we shall drain the 	 Economy of this country by enriching a few unqualified consulting firms and the public will be left to suffer at the nerds these cunning persons in the name of consulting engineers. After 26 years of Independence, we should support and encourage our indigenous  engineers.	When we support  our own people, we are, in the longterm, building the nation.	This is because some of foreign consulting firmscome here to make money and when they have had enough, they leave the country. For example, when we support indigenous engineers  and consulting firms, they will grow into big employers  who will be contributors to Harambee projects. If we support firms that are out to make money in a Period of two years and leave afterwards for their mother countries, we will be draining our economy into the hands of foreigners. It would be better to  spend that money with our own people who will contribute to Harambee projects. 	At this stage, I will propose to the Minister to bring another more comprehensive amendment Bill with regard to engineers.	In this way, we will beable to look at a wider scope of the aspect of engineering.	We are now onlycovering three categories of people, that is, graduate engineers, technicians 	 and consulting engineers and have left out all the other varieties of our technical people. 	It is, therefore, important that we  have proper guidelines so that those people serving in the technical field can know  where to operate, their limitations and expectations. We are now dealing with a very narrow Bill and I hope that the Minister will bring one or two comprehensive Bills covering all aspects of engineering. On the part of engineers - myself included - I hope that  they will live to the ethics of engineers in order to sustain the quality  and the trust that people have on them.	People take engineers very seriously and expect them todo roads, repair motor vehicles,	have proper structural columns designed,proper buildings put and so on.	They should, therefore, not betray the trust the non-technical have in them.  The moment the designs start failing, even the lay people will start wondering  where such engineers went to school. If this happens, the quality and ethics of engineers stand to be doubted and that would be very bad because we, as engineers,	should  be taken very seriously.It is not good enough when an engineer says that	the designs are Proper whenthey are not.	This will not augur well with the respect  the non-technicalpeople accord the engineers.	I can see one of the engineers is here and heis anxious to hear what I am saying about engineers.  So, it is important that engineers are 	properly taken care of Properly; the engineers should also live to the expectations of the public. I thus hope that the Minister will introduce other amendments to this Bill so that we can adequately cover engineering in this country. With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Thank you, 	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to make a few comments on this Bill. I note that we have different categories of engineers and I think  this is the right time to explain to the non engineers what the 	 word "engineers means Section	2 of the Bill talks of registeredconsulting engineers, registered graduate technician engineers andregistered technician engineers.	I think the Bill should have givenmore details on this definition of engineers.	This is because even a carpenter, a mason, a plumber or a painter could be an engineer. You will find that a carpenter design good seats like the benches we are sitting on in this House and ensures that they are strong enough and have the fine finishers of an engineer. To me it seems as it the draftsmen only considered qualifications and said, for example; said that a higher diploma will be required for a technician and a university degree will be required for a graduate technician. But today we have many institutes of technology in this country  and Jua Kali programs where engineers are being trained. 	I feel that the definition of an engineer should have been made broader because. Then the Engineers Registration Board warts to register somebody it looks for specific qualification. I think a Manson is an engineer because he is able to construct an upright wall of a building and at the same time know the amount of mortar to use between each layer of the building stones. In fact, these technicians are more qualified than the graduate technician  engineers.This is why I am happy with the	introduction of the8-4-4 system of education.	In fact,	during the colonial days,Days, you could have Standard Six level	brick-layers	who could evenbuild a multi-storey building.	You could also get carpenters whocould design and produce-furniture of	various specification So,the definition should have been more explicit in order to help people, who are not engineers to understand who is an engineers.   Sir, the other definition that ought to have been explained further is the title, "consulting engineer". 	Who is a consulting engineer? 	This is because currently you find every Tom, Dick and Harry coming from Europe to "assist" the so-called Third World countries in the name of consulting engineer, without even-</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAGWIMA: 	On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker.-I do not think it is in order for my hon. colleague, Mr. Malebe, who is an engineer like me to claim that a mason is also an engineer, just because he can calculate amounts of cement required. and mortars for his work of putting up a wall.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

As far as I am concerned, I am requesting the definition of atechnician engineer in the drafting of this Bill.	This is because the masoncould be called an artisan, or in some cases, a technician.	So, it is amatter of coming up with the appropriate definition. The other required definition is on the consulting engineers. 	You will find non qualified people coming to the Third World, or the Developing  Countries, and pretending to be consulting engineers. 	First of all, I would like to request the Engineers Registration Board, although we have the Association of Consulting Engineers in this country, to come up with an  examination to determine which engineer can qualify as a consulting engineer. When you are a consulting engineer, you are supposed to be a teacher, a supervisor of all the engineers and the structures that they come up with. 	So, the clarification of these definitions is important. 	Sir, I will now turn to the classification of engineers.	I knowthat engineering is a wide term but, as the Engineers:	Registration Boardstands, the definitions are limited.	There is the architect, the quantitysurveyor, the civil engineer, the surveyor and a few others.	However, Ifind that we are missing registered mining engineers.	We even have fully-fledgedMining Department in the Ministry of Environment and-Natural Resources but, within that Department, there is no mining engineer who is registered and yet we have a mining engineer who is in charge of a full Government Department. I would urge the Engineering Registration Board, or the Ministers concerned, to try and include those mining engineers registered as their other colleagues. 	As far as I am concerned, I know that the mining engineers have not been. able to have their own scheme of service. 	They are already catered for in the engineering chapter, but they have failed to convince the Government on how they can train the mining engineers from the basic levels up to the Chief Mining Engineer.  This is where I think the Government should Come in because the purpose Of the Act is to get people committed. 	Once such people are not registered, they work in the manner they like and they can do anything and there is nothing the Engineers Registration Board can do to them. The Government should, therefore, Come up with something  to cater for the mining engineers in terms Of a scheme of service. Currently, there are very few mining engineers in the country, and even when vacancies occur it becomes very difficult to fill them. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there should also be enacted a Geologists Act in order to have them registered. 	These engineers are very active, but then you find that there are very many Other professions which are engineer-related and which are not Catered for. I should not fail to mention even water technician SO, I do call upon the Government to introduce legislation to cover the legislation of geologists. Such legislation is very much overdue, and I think the time has come for the Minister for Environment and Natural Resources to come out and introduce it in this House. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the role of an engineer is manifold. geological engineering, you find that engineer are mainly geo-technical or specialists in foundations.	For anything below the ground, ad engineer has toSeek the expertise Of a geotechnical engineer.	Civil engineering is restrictedto  work above surface and a bit Of the earth surface.	As you go deeper, thenyou have to seek the advice Of a geologists because geologists and geotechnical engineers are the ones who are able to determine the foundation bearings Of the ground so that skyscrapers can be put up. 	Without them, the tall buildings cannot be constructed. Furthermore, Sir, with geotechnical engineering, it is possible to control the effects Of earth quake. 	That is why you Saw a team Of geologists being Sent to Mombasa the Other day when there was some earth quake. Geologists also recordthe type Of cracks in house So that ail engineers can sit down arid formulate a design. 	After that they ensure that buildings are put up in such a way that when  there is a slight shake the effects are not enormous. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the role Of the consulting engineer is mainly to supervise engineering Contacts, including construction Of buildings and roads.	This is where we need registered engineers to supervise contractors.You find that unless we have qualified	engineers, We shall always	get very shoddywork being done.  For Instance, these days many roads are poorly constructed and  hence, potholes develop very soon.  If the foundation is riot established properly by drilling, even if you put a veneer of tarmac on the road, a little rain will  Cause potholes on the red.</Newspeech><Header>ADJOURNMENT</Header><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuve):  Order, hon.

MWAMZANDI asked the Minister for Health in order to provide adequate medical services to the wananchi in Msambweni, what measures he is taking to  post an extra Clinical Officer to Msambweni District Hospital to serve patients during the night shift.  <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH	(Mr. Ogur):	Mr. DeputySpeaker, Sir, I beg to	reply.I am happy to inform the hon. Member that Clinical Officers will graduate from the Medical Training Centre in June, 	1990, and  Msambweni District Hospital will be given priority in July, 	1990, when these officers will be posted to various hospitals and health centres in the country. 	In the meantime, Mswambweni Hospital has nine clinical officers who cover the Hospital adequately. Their specialization is as follows:-(a)	4	-	General duties(b)	2	-  Paediatrics(c)	1	-  Anaesthetics(d)	1	-	Orthopaedics(e)	1	-	Ophthalmic	These officers have a duty rooster for Clinical Officer"on call".	They are always called up by nurses to the hospital whenthere is an emergency.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the problem hereis not lack of	clinical officers.  But you will find thatduring the night shift the	clinical officer "on call"	 normallystays	at his house anti has to be called up every timethere is an emergency.	Sometimes the officer has to be fetched fromhis house seven times.	why can the Ministry not station one officerInside the Hospital the whole night so that he can be readily available whenever there is an emergency? 	It is not good to call him up from his house every time there is an emergency because this may tire and even annoy him.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR:	Mr. Deputy Speaker,	Sir, when a doctor or a clinical officer in this case is "on call" it does not matter where-he is so long as he is within the reach of the nurse calling him.  He should be within the reach of the nurse calling so that he can attend to emergency cases that may arise during the night. 	There is always one clinical officer "on call" at Msambweni Hospital.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZINDI: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I agree with what. the hon. Assistant Minister is telling the house, but we want him to 	put one clinical officer "on call" and rake sure that he stays inside the Hospital throughout the night. It is not convenient to call him up from his house seven times a night.	It is not proper to disturb him from-sleep every time thereis an emergency case.	I think the clinical officer "on call" muststay inside the Hospital throughout the night just like the nurses do;</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR:	Mr. Speaker, Sit, it appears that the hon. Memberdoes not understand what the term	"on  call" means.	Thisofficer is in the	Hospital "on call".	He does not have	to stand next to the	patient's bed!.	This term means that theofficer is available "on call"; the nurse would know where the officeris.	He does not stay far away from the Hospital.	Being in the	hospital does not	mean sitting inside the	ward and next to thepatient's bed.	He stays in a place	known by the nurses, withinthe	hospital;  Whenever there is an emergency they just press a.bell to alert him or just rush there to call him;	Vie do not have manyemergency cases	every night; we may have three cases, two cases,one case or nil  case every night:.  That is why we	always haveone clinical officer "on call" every night;</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I know what theterm "on call" means.	However, what I am saying is that the officer"on call"' should not stay at his house at night; he should stay in the hospital. He should spend the whole night in the hospital. 	Why can the Ministry not organize to have one clinical officer "on call" in the Hospital and also  make sure that he stays there throughout the night?	It is cumbersome to go for him in his/-¦house at night	whenever there is an emergency case.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, these officers arevery few.  You will find that only 100 clinical officers will graduate from the Medical Training Centre in June, this year. Only a few graduate every year and we try to post them to every district hospital	in the country.	Since Msambweni DistrictHospital already has nine clinical officers we will have to consider.the possibility of posting an extra	clinical officer tothat Hospital in	June,	1990.</Newspeech>  Question No.	132<Header>Rural Electrification Programme for Garissa</Header> MR.  AWE, on behalf of Mr. Salat, asked the Minister for Energy what plans he had to extend rural electrification programme to cover Garissa District. <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY 	(Mr. M'MUkindia): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. Plans have been underway to extend the Rural Electrification Programme to cover-Garissa District. For example:-	1. In 1989, an additional generator was installed at Garissa at a cost of KSh.50 million. 2. The Kilifi-Bura National Grid Line which is under design is planned to extend to Garissa District. 3. Further rural electrification work in the District will be planned in accordance with the D.D.C priorities as and when funds become available.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ARTE: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, whereas I appreciate the hon. Assistant Minister's answer, Kilifi is wether in Garissa. District, nor is Bura. The Rural Electrification Programme is a very 	 important aspect of development.	Garissa District was ninedivisional head-quarters, But there is not a single division with rural electrification. Can the Assistant Minister consider putting one or two divisions under rural electrification because during last year's D.D.C. meeting all the divisions were recommended for rural electrification? Can he consider that request?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. M'MUKINDIA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Kilifi-Bura National Grid Line will be extended to Garissa Town.	However, I knowthat	and Bura are not in Garissa-District, but the line	will be extended to Garissa Town.	Until yesterday, our Ministry	-did not have priorities given by the Garissa District D.D.C.But we got them. yesterday after we actually sent a telex to The District		Commissioner. We had not received that previiously, but from the list that we have, the towns that will be covered by this National Grid Line will be Mbalambala, Kotile, Masabubu, Bura, Namigi and Karokora.	Now, the divisional headquarter that will	be a priorityin Garissa in this case will be Mbalambala Divisional Headquarters. But we only got these priorities yesterday.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant Minister's reply the towns he has just mentioned are along River Tana.	How about areas like Modogashe, Liboi, FnFi, and soon?	Does the Assistant Minister have any plans for those areasthat are a little inside the district?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. M'MUKINDIA: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the first thing the Ministry has to do is to ensure that we have enough electricity within Garissa Town itself, and then from there, we shall plan according to the D.D.C.'s priorities. 	So, if the D.D.C.i in Garissa says "No, it is not Mbalambala but Modogashe, or Liboi", so be it.	We shall go along with that.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.ARTE:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Ministersays that the Kilifi-Bura National Grid Line will reach Garissa Town. When? Is it this year or next year?  We have been waiting for this line for the last ten years or so and people are still talking about it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. M'MUKINDIA: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the design work for the Kilifi-aura National Grid Line is going on, and we have not yet secured a financier for the actual work. 	We do have the finance for the design work, but as far as the actual implementation of the policy is concerned, it is subject of negotiation in July. So, maybe after July this year, I will be in a better position to tell the hon. Member when the actual work can start.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Next Question, Mr. Malebe.</Newspeech> Question No.	126<Header>Cattle Insemination in Igembe</Header> MR.

What effects has the insemination done to multiply the hybrid cattle in Igembe Division?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MWANGALE: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the purpose of having The Artificial Insemination	(A.I.) Service is precisely because we want to improve the genetic qualities, whether. It is for milk or beef, The purpose	is to enhance the capacities of the genetic qualities ofthese animals.	That is why we have the A.I. Service.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have five locations in Igembe Division, as follows:- Kiegoi, Njia, Kangeta, Maua and Akachiu. We have a total of three A.I. Services. One is stationed at Maua which covers Igembe Division.	We have two others, at	Meruand Chogoria.	We are all aware that the Maua A.I.Service used to service Igembe Division, but it is not servingall the areas.	Some locations are not fully serviced, say, Maua,Akachiu and so on.	Also Athiru-Gaiti is not fully served by theA.I. Service, and I am proposing from next financial year to start or to extend the A.I. Service to those locations that are not fully covered at the moment.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MALEBE:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, what are we supposedto do with cattle in Akachiu and other areas where we have disused dips?  Does it mean that the Ministry has not given funds to cover those areas because, I think, there are more cattle in those areas than in other locations?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWANGALE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the problem related with the A.I. Service in the country are well-known. 	What we have attempted to do in the last eight months with the support of donor countries, is to rehabilitate the entire scheme. As I said, only a few days ago, we have received over 200 vehicles specifically for the A.I. Service in the country, and we are hoping that in the deployment of these vehicles some of them will be used in Igembe Division.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

P.K. MOMANYI: I gave two reasons as to why the Kenya  Bus Services withdrew their 	services from the Mombasa Lunga Lunga route.

BIDU:	Can the Assistant Minister tell us the	operational cam costs that made the company make	losses.	As faras, I know those buses were to carrying people to and from Mombasa, and they were collecting a lot money.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR.  P.K. MOMANYI: 	Sir,  the operational costs rose up due to very many factors, but the main factor was that the buses  belonging to the Kenya Bus Services K (K.B.S.), were facing a lotvery high competition from the matatus and the country buses.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  BIDU: 	Sir,  there are no matatus or any other public vehicles at all serving that route.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. P.K. MOMANYI: 	I would like to inform the hon.

The local people should tryand arrange to have	some buses for that route.	As I had said earlier on,the K.B.S. is a profit making company, and naturally, it will not service a route that does not generate profits.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: 	The K.B.S. have formed a habit of withdrawing their services on every route where they receive competition, yet they continue to enjoy a monopoly on transportation services in certain areas.

If the. Hon. Member is aware of any breaches of that agreement which have not been reported to me, he should let me know and I look into them immediately.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: 	ors. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the reply from my hon. friend, I would like to inform the Minister that this company has been employing people as trainees.	In	1987;it employee 34 people as trainees; in	1988 it employed	24 traineesand in 1989 it employed 25 trainees. 	So far 83 people have employed bythis company as trainees. Although	the collective agreement theMinister has referred to is in order, the company is employing 	some people as trainees; even the	driver of the manager is a trainee	and yet the company is not a driving a school. These people are being  employed as trainees so that the company does not pay them housing, travelling and leave allowances. So, could the Minister investigate this issue and direct the company to employ these people on permanent terms as per the collective agreement of 1987?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would carry out investigations pretty quickly provided the hon. Member would encourage. 	 at least one of the agreed employees to make a formal complaint. I cannot start investigations	in the company if	no employee hascomplained to me because they might they say that the Government isinterfering with their terms of employment, which are very clearlyset out in a collective agreement signed between thecompany and the worker's trade union.	However, if a Manageable	employee whois not a member of the trade union complains, then,	of course, wewill investigate the complaint.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SALAT:	On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.The hon. Member, who is an elected representative of wananchi, must have got the facts	of this Question from the employees of thiscompany.	He is telling the Minister that there is discrepancy inemployment of people by this company.	Is it in order then for thehon. Minister to ask that the employees themselves come forward and complain when they have already voiced their grievances through their Member of Parliament?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think it is perfectly in order because if employees in a company are happy, there is no need of investigating anything. 	If these employees are unhappy, they can go and complain to our labour office in Mombasa. if I start investigations when nobody has complained, the employees may ask me, "Mr. Minister, what are you investigating when we have not complained of anything?", as it happened recently in the case of a certain teacher.	So, we do not just walk in and start investigations unless	someone has complained to us.	However, since thehon. Member has said that he is not happy with what is happening in that company, I would be 	grateful to him if he could encourage one of the employees who are unhappy to put in a formal complaint and then I will move in very quickly and launch investigations.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIKIKU: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have a letter of complaint and a list of all the people who have been employed as trainees.  If you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, allow me, I will Quote a portion from a letter of appointment. as a trainee, which states:-"We are pleased to inform you that you have been selected for training. 	At the end of the training period you may be permanently employed. This will depend on your on-the-job as well as institutional performance".    So, Mr. Deputy Sneaker, Sir, you can now see that this company is employing people as trainees and then laying them off 	after the Period of training instead of being  placed on Permanent. terms of employment. 	The company is 	 doing this so that it does e not pay the workers their allowances and terminal benefits. 	with your permission, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to give the Minister a list of the people who are complaining so that they can take action.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

KYONDA, on behalf of Mr. Wambua, asked the Minister for Public Works what urgent measures he is taking to construct bumps on both sides of the Kitui-Machakos Road, near the bridge across Thwake River, in order to minimize accidents along this section of the road. <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS 	(Mr. Malyani): 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. The Ministry usually erects speed control bumps at road sections where accidents involving pedestrians are frequent. 	However, in the case of Thwake Bridge approaches, plans are in hand to erect appropriate rumble strips, plus reflective road signs, that would warn any speeding drivers that they are approaching an accident-prone area.</Newspeech> 	 <Newspeech>MR.

MAIYNAI: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is only after the Ministry becomes aware that a certain area is becoming dangerous that we start instructing our engineers to make the necessary plans. This is exactly what we are doing, and plans are being prepared so that rumble strips may be constructed in the said area.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant  Minister for that answer, I would like to know either he could tell the House when these plans are due to be completed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I have said, it is after the necessary design has been completed that we will know how many days the work involved will take to complete.	However, we know that this is not going to takea long time.	In any case, we cannot do this work anyhow because when bumps orrumble strips are carelessly erected, they can cause more danger than otherwise. For instance, if they are placed in the wrong place, speeding vehicles may overturn.	So,  this work has to be done by experts according to the relevant plans.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think we agree with theAssistant Minister that something will be done and that this is not a big job. 	-Since the making of plans is already in the process, I think it is only fair for the Assistant Minister-to tell us about when he expects this work to be completed. In this regard, I would like to remind the Assistant Minister that we are talking about Thwake where we recently had a very terrible accident.	That part of thebridge that was torn away by the fateful bus has not yet been repaired.	Couldthe Assistant Minister tell us when this part of the bridge will be repaired?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

MAKHANU:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this road was a priority ofBungoma District Development Committee sometime back, and it was even put in theforward budget.

I just want toknow the date when it was issued.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

The priority road now is D 275, Namwele-Kapsokwony, whichis also known as Kikusi-Kaptama.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think we need your guidancehere.	If a project was a priority,  it was accepted by the Ministry and put inthe forward budget and it appears. in the Printed Estimates, is the Minister prepared to tell us that it will have to be pulled out of the Printed Estimates and replaced by another project?  Priorities keep on changing, so that when you through with one, you go on to the next one.	No project can remain a priorityfor five consecutive years.	Therefore, I still insist that this road is a prioritythat has been accepted by the Ministry, put in the forward budget and an allocation of £150,000 made for it. We want to know when the directive to withdraw these funds was issued, so that we may ask other questions.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIBEI: 	Mr. deputy Speaker, Sir, if you give me until next week,  I will give the hon. Member the date he wants.

When did this particular road cease to be a priority?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MIBEI:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,  I do not know how the hon."Member heard me answer, but the prioritization of roads or any other projects is done by district development committees.	In this particular case, prioritieswere altered on	6th February,	1989.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am a member of BungomaDistrict Development Committee and I am very conversant with the rules and functions of district development committees, having been a chairman of one of them. Kimaeti-Malakisi Road was a priority in 1988,  it was forwarded to the Ministry, it was accepted and put in the forward budget, but in a subsequent meeting in 1989, we had to come up with other priorities because the earlier priorities had already been accepted. So, it is not right for the Minister to say that the second road took over the priority of the first road because the latter had already been accepted. Could he be kind enough to tell the House when the directive to withdraw the funds meant for Kimaeti-Malakisi Road was given?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

The problem appears not to-;	be with the Ministry.

Records held in Keiyo/Marakwet District Education Office indicate that between November, 1989, and April, 1990, my Ministry supplied a total of 1,346 cartons of U.H.T. school milk to primary schools established in the educational zone in question.  I wish to clarify that there is no educational division, zone or school called Endo in Keiyo/Marakwet District.  Kapyego is not an educational zone but one of the primary schools established in the Kaptalamwa Educational Zone.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR:  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am surprised by that reply by the Assistant Minister because I come from that area and I have seen parents  coming to me to complain about the non-supply of school milk in the area.

Is itin 	order for the Assistant Minister to mislead the House by saying that milk has been supplied to schools when, in fact, the hon. Member from the area knows the situation better.

There was a period when milk was not.supplied due to floods, but that was only three months, between the months of-The distribution of school milk during the first term of 1990 was delayed because the district education office lorries were fully engaged in the distribution and delivery of school foodstuffs to 91 primary schools under the school. feeding programme in the district.	That was the only period when the supply of milk to school wasinterrupted, otherwise, milk was supplied for the whole period.	I have the detailshere of how many cartons of milk each school received. For example, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Turin Primary School received 38 cartons of U.H.T. milk on 9th November, 	1989, and on 	29th of March, 	1990, 	28 cartons were delivered to the same school, totaling to 66 cartons. 	There is a list here showing how many cartons were received by various schools during the months of November, 1989, and March, 1990. For the benefit of the hon. Member, I will lay the list on the Table.</Newspeech>(Hon Omido laid the list on the Table)  <Newspeech>MR. KAMUYU: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the facts as presented by the Assistant Minister are either misleading or they were just badly recorded. It is clear that the hon. Questioner knows whether milk was delivered or not; he is not going by the papers the hon. Assistant Minister is quoting. Now that the Assistant Minister has been informed that the fact of the matter is that milk has not been reaching these particular centres, what is he going to do about it?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMIDO: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have already formed the House that there was an interruption of a short period when milk was not supplied to schools, and it is possible that the hon. Questioner received complaints during that period when it was not possible to supply milk to schools due to floods. 	However, milk was supplied to schools.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to tell, the AssistantMinister that the information he was given was wrong.	During the month of March,this year, it was not possible for a lorry to go to Embobut and, therefore, school milk could not be supplied. When I held a Harambee in that area last October, milk had been supplied only once after three years and the issues was even carried in the local dailies. How come that the Assistant Minister has come to the House with the wrong information? Can he be asked to go back and get the correct informationto present to the House?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. OMIDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the information I received, is the information I have given to the House but if the hon. Member has more information that could help my Ministry to carry out further investigations into this matter, I shall be Pleased to received that information.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>DR.MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have been told by the hon. Questioner that these primary schools have not been getting their supply of school milk. What other fact does the Assistant Minister need?  It is now the responsibility of the Assistant Minister to find out Where the problem is and to make sure that the milk reaches these schools.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMILO: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, I have given the correct answer to the House regarding this question.  We have been told by hon. Chepkok that these schools have not been getting milk for the last two years and if the hon. Member can give me the details of this information, he would be assisting my Ministry to carry out further investigations.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENTE: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, by which method does the Assistant Minister want the hon. Member to give him this information?  He has just told him that right now, the area is flooded and therefore, he has been given the information he requires. Which other method does the Assistant Minister want this information to be given to him when the hon. Member has already given him this information here in the House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMIDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am looking for detailed information. For example, the hon. Member should be able to tell me that these schools did not receive milk from such-and-such a period to such-and-such a period. This is the kind of information that would help my Ministry.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to give the Assistant Minister the right information. No milk has been supplied to these schools from the beginning of March this year and up to this time, now milk has been supplied to any school in Embobut.  There is no way that milk can be taken to these schools because the entire area is flooded. How can he get a misleading answer from his officers in the field and. then comes to read it here?  He should go back and get the correct information from his officers because  what he is now telling the House is not true.  The roads in this area are completely impassable!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. 	OMIDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, according to the information that I have, a total of 1,346 cartons of milk were delivered to the schools in question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Omido, do you not really think you require extra time to look into the Whole Question?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAMUTU: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in this connexion, can it be recorded that the Assistant Minister ought really to be given time to look into this particular issue?  I am saying this because the answer he has given to the House is fairly misleading.  I think the House requires some guidance from the Chair regarding this matter.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMIDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the issue of floods is quite relevant here, but the hon. Member from the area said that these schools have not received milk for a period of two years.	However; according to the information I have, all these schools have been receiving milk. 	It would assist my Ministry if the hon. Member could indicate to me for Which periods milk was not delivered to these schools. 	This would help me to know that the information I have is not correct and consequently, I would endeavour to investigate the matter and bring a more suitable answer to the House later.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Questioner is complaining . 	 that schools in  Elgeyo/Marakwet have not been supplied with milk, but in one of his replies, the Assistant Minister is talking about cartons having been supplied to the Schools.  The Question is about the supply of milk and not cartons. Would the Assistant Minister go back and bring the proper answer to the House. We would like to know the number of packets of milk which have been supplied to these schools and not cartons.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMIDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sure the hon. Member knows quite clearly that I said that these schools have been supplied with 1,347 cartons of UHT milk. With regard to the other question, my Ministry is quite  willing to look into the matter again.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Now, to be able to close this matter, I think a little bit more verification by the Ministry on this issue, would be quite appropriate.  They should be able to ascertain whether the actual UHT milk in the cartons that the Assistant Minister is referring to reached the schools in question.</Newspeech><Header>POINT OF ORDER</Header> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Nassir): Jambo la nidhamu, 	Bw.

Alisema kwamba vyama vingi vya siasa havifai kabisa katika nchi ya Tanzania. Jambo hili linalingana na mwongozo wetu wa siasa katika Kenya.

Alisema hata ingawa kuna Makabila mengi katika nchi yake, vote wanashirikiana kama watu wa jamii moja. Alisema kwamba nchi yake itaendelea kuwa na chama kimoja kusije kukamwagwa damu. Yeye alijua kwamba watu wakioatiwa nafasi ya kuunda vyama vingi vya kisiasa, karibu kila mtu atakuwa na chama chake cha bandia.

Deputy Speaker, Sir, at the end of last month, the Minister for Public Works assured this House that the Outer Pi	re Road will widened and that the work.	would havestarted by 1st April,	1990.  The section  I am talking about hasbecome a black snot.	Every other day there is  an accidentalong that stretch of the road.

KILIKU: 	On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. We are allowed by our Standing Orders to raise points of order at any time in the House. It is not always necessary to consult the Chair before rising on a point of order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER.	You must be referring to StandingOrder	Nos.73 and 74.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU:	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I	rise on apoint of order in Connection with a report that appears in today'sissue of The Standard.	It is reported here that the Kenya	Airwaysintends to	cut the number of its staff by half; thatis	2,000 people because the	whole establishment of	-KenyaAir Ways is. 4,000 people.	I do not know what is going to happen tothose people.	I therefore expect the Minister for Transport andCommunications to make a Ministerial Statement to clarify this matter. We have all along thought that the Kenya Yi Airways was set to expand. I think that is why we approved a guarantee of loan to Kenya Airways to enable the national carrier to buy two Sir Buses and Fokker 50s.  Kenya Airways should not take this step because the Government policy at present is to create more employment opportunities for our people. Kenya Airways is acting contrary to Government policy by laying, off about 50 per cent of its workers. if the airline has been plagued by corruption it is the managers who have been corrupt and not the people who are going to be affected by this decision. The Minister should clarify this point because many people are going to lose their jobs.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Anybody from the Ministry of Transportand  Communications? (The  Assistant Minister for Transport  and Communications 	(Dr.  P.K. Momanyi)  stood  up) Dr.  Momanyi,  I am  just  hoping that you are noting the sentiments  expressed by hon.  Kiliku;  I am asking you reply now.  I think the  Deputy Leader  of Government 3usiness  has  something to  say.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY  (Mr. 	Biwott): 	On  a point  of order, Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir. The  House  will recall that  a few days ago, 	when I was Answering a Question by hon.  Jalang'o,  regarding the profit margins given to  petrol retailers, I did promise to come to the House after I have  seen the retailers  and the  distributors  in the  oil industry and  give  the  House the  decision regarding those margins.	I have  hadan  occasion to meet  the retailers  and  the  distributorsand  I have  explained  to  them that	profit  margins  among themselves isa matter for themselves.	This  is  because  the  Government  gives  so muchmargin and  it  is  up  to  the  oil  industry to distribute  the  margins among the various  claimants. It  is not the  responsibility  of the public  to  differentiate  between the  two 	retailers  and  distributors in the  oil  industry.	This  is  because  the  distributor and  the retailerat  the  petrol pump  station are  one  and  the  same  thing.	They  havealready met but apparently the  oil companies are reluctant  to  give the  retailers  any	wider profit margins.	I had  a meetingwith the  retailers  this  morning and  I appealed to  them to  bear withthe  situation until  the  next	review and  I hope that  in the  nextreview	a solution   is  going to  be  found regarding thatprofit margin given to the  retailers;	So,  I hope  that the  House  willbe  satisfied with my explanation.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR: 	On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I stand to clarify the statement I made yesterday in this House where I requested hon.

MALEBE: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to continue where I left yesterday. 	Before the interruption of business  yesterday I was about to explain the role played by the consulting engineers. 	Although this is a very important profession, in the past these consulting engineers have been working without being supervised by any authority.   Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,	it is good that the Engineers Registration Act isbeing amended to include a provision to register consulting engineers. 	In the past, every Tom, Dick and Harry used to come to this country for purposes of engaging themselves in consultancy work without us knowing whether  such a person is a qualified engineer capable of running consultancy work. In some cases, clients have been taken for a ride, by such consulting engineers. If this Act is amended, the consulting engineer will also be monitored by the Engineers Registration Board and it will eliminate  the registration of bogus engineers.	The role of a consulting engineer is very vital in ax anyproject as he is supposed to be. the chief adviser of the client.	He should bean educated person with vast-experience and who can be treated by the client as his right-hand person. By bringing in the provision of registered consulting engineer, it will 	eliminate those who would like to cheat the client. (Mr. Deputy Speaker left the Chair) (The Temporary Deputy Sneaker, (Mr.	Kagwima) took the Chair) Although we are seeking the registration of consulting engineers, we have  many other types of consultants who will infringe  engineering related projects. I wonder how the Engineers Registration Board would be able to look into ways  of encompassing all consulting engineers and related disciplines. For example, 	an engineering geologist would wish to be included in the registration of consulting engineers  because he would be more qualified on the geological aspect as opposed to the actual engineering. 	Since the engineering geologist deals with tunnels, foundations and so on, it would be necessary for the Engineers Registration Board to make it a pre-requisite for  civil engineers wishing to be registered to be examined in geological subjects. In this way, they would be able to understand, say, the strength of the rocks and be able to interpret any foundations studies. They  would also be able to recommend the bearing capacity of any foundation to withstand  skyscrapers.  Sir, I find that in this country, we have very people of that nature. When we coin that  position and call it "geo-technical engineers", you find foreigners coming and taking up projects because they want to take advantage 	  	of the country's lack of registered geo-technical engineers. geo-technical engineering is normally built from a geological base which is also a line of engineering. I would like to urge the Engineers Registration Board to recommend to the local universities  to start courses on geo-technical engineering. 	In this way, we shall discourage pirate engineers from other countries coming here to take advantage of our lack of such Personnel. As I said earlier on, a consulting engineer is a very important person who should  not be overlooked at all.  There is a Problem when one relies so much on a consultant that he does not know well. Some consultants tell the client that his consultancy sc firm is the one which gives the right services. This  is because. I have seen some buildings here in Nairobi  which have been overdesigned by engineers.	Such a building would have cost less butin the final analysis, it would cost	three times the initial estimates.	This isall due to overdesigning. For example, now, there might be 	a lot of engineers travelling to Mombasa because of the earthquakes that have been reported to offer consultancy services to 	those wishing to construct buildings. Since such engineers do not have the knowledge of earthquake effects, they will come up with a jargon of a design and the people would not even be able to Construct the buildings. The Engineers Registration Board should look into a way of getting somebody to act as a go between the consulting engineer and the client. This is because the client can be given a report but he may not know how to interpret it.  Therefore, there should be a third party somewhere to  vet the consulting engineer's report and recommend to the client whether the project is economical or not. This is because such a project might call for huge amounts of money while in essence only half of the required amount would be needed. Thereis a tendency by consulting engineers of coming up with details of huge amounts of expenditure so that their fees can also go up. Sir,  for example,  we have a problem with architects in this country.. They can,  say,  come up and design a building-while ensuring that it becomes a multi-million project so that  their fees is also increased tremendously. This is the problem we  have with architects. Since they want their fees to go up,  they will come up with unbelievable drawings. 	For example,  at the Kenya Ports Authority,  I know of an architect who overdesigned a lot-of-buildings   and the Authority was unable to even start-the Project. It seemed that the architect in question wanted to take almost half of the available funds. So, the project was never even started and that public money was not utilised..    Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,  this is why a consulting  engineer  should be  a man  of integrity. This act  should also stipulate  specific  examinations the  taken by those  who want to be  registered as  consulting engineers. If this  is  done,  an executive  officer  in the  Engineers Registration Board offices will be  able  to  accept or reject  applications  for registration   without having to pass  it  over to the relevant  committee  for  a decision. I know that today one is required to have  more  than 12 years  experience in order to be registered as a consulting engineers within three years after their graduation. In most cases, the performance of such engineers is questionable. We should try to protect clients by registering only people with strong qualifications, long  standing experience  and high reputation as  consulting engineers. We  should not register people from. Europe  as constulting engineers because  we  do  not  know whether  they have  had any experience  in consultancy. I think the  Board should address  itself to  this issue  so  that it can always pick the right  engineers for registration as  consultants. I want to also say that I do not know what  this Bill means  by a graduate  technician engineer. 	This  is  because  to me a graduate  technician  can be  somebody who has obtained a higher diploma in an engineering field. This  is because for Such a Person to  attain a hiher diploma he must  first  of all have  gone through the  technician grade. 	I therefore,  I do  not  know whether by graduate  technician engineer the bill means  that  a person will become  an engineer immediately after he  obtains his higher diploma,  or whether he  will work for sometime  under a highly qualified engineer before  he  is registered as  a graduate  technician engineer..   The way the  Bill is in this respect is  oven ended because 	it  does  not make difference  between a graduate  technician engineer  and technician engineer  clear. 	One  could be  a graduate  of a polytechnics, or  college,  while  the  other one graduates from a university with a degree. 	The ambigufty between these  two  categories  of engineers should be  classified before  the  Bill is  passed. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when it comes to the use of the  abbreviation "Eng"  for  engineer,  I find very many, People, including some  artisans  in some  Indian engineering firms,  using   this abbreviation, and I think we  should restrict its use to only those who  are qualified to use it. Unless we do this, one will not be sure  that  the  person in Kirinyaga Road or Industrial Area. who uses this term and with whom	we has  entrusted with his Work. is	really a Qualified engineer.	Restriction  of the  use  of  the  this  term is	necessary because  that  is the  only way of knowing whether  somebody is  a qualified engineer  or he  is  just doing engineering as a businessman. The  only case  where  this  term Cannot be misused is when  one  writes  a report,  otherwise  in all other cases-it is not easy to know is using it right or wrongly.	This  a problem for which we  need an explanation from the Minister.I would  like  to  conclude  by saying that  every project  shouldhave  an engineering input. we  have  seen our engineers  produce the  Nyayo  Pioneer  cars. I am sure  the moulding,  design and fabrication stages  were  undertaken by technicians and this  shows  that  they can also  be  good  engineers. We  should,  therefore, make it	mandatory in projects where  engineers are required that only registered engineers  are  engaged.	The Minister  should also  ensure  that there, is maximuminput in such projects from local registered engineers. Even ifforeign engineers who  are registered here  are  engaged,  they should incorporate  local engineers  so  that  the  information they obtain remains  in  this  country. In some  cases foreign engineers  have done  engineering work in some  projects,  but when they left, it became  very difficult to get  local engineers  to maintain those projects.	This is why I am insisting that	the Government  should ensure  that every	contract  and  consultancy report has  indigenous engineering input.	In this  way,  even when the  foreign engineers leave  the  country,  we  will have  local engineers to  turn to. 	These days  donors have  become  crafty in that  they tend to prepare  project specifications  that  fit their  own engineer specifications; they even bring engineers  from their countries 	there to  do  consultancy.  So,  this  is  where  our Government should keep  a sharp  eye  so as  not  to allow donors  to bring  in  projects  and  then  take them away  any  time  thereafter. 	This is  why  the Government,  through  the  Ministry concerned,  should make  it mandatory for all  projects  to  have  local  inputs. I  propose  that  a minimum  of 30  per  cent of every  project  be  local  inputs  in  terms  of engineering. consultancy  so  that we may  generate  employment  for  our own  engineers  and  encourage  our registered engineers  to  work  better. This  will  also  encourage  our upcoming graduates  and technician  engineers  from  the  university ;to participate  in the development of this  country. When  projects  of an  engineering nature  come  up,  I  think  they  are  much overlooked because  when bilateral  agreements  are made,  in  most cases,  they are made  by  secretaries  or  legal  officers  within  the Ministry  concerned whereas  an engineer  is  never  called  upon  to  make  some  input  in  the  agreements.	This  is why you  find  that  sometimes  we  are  held  up  by  bilateral  agreements.	The  donor will  come  and  say,  "This  is  the  way you signed  the agreement,  and you cannot withdraw your signature." 	This  is why we should have our registered engineers involved  in  all  aspects  of drafting such agreements so that if there are any loopholes 	 a donor  will  want  to  create  a loophole  as  a shield when he comes  to negotiate  a contract  later on they may be  seen immediately and rectified, instead  of  waiting  until  there  is  a crisis  between the donor and the receiver. 	I  congratulate  the Minister on having brought up this amendment at this  time,  but  I  would  also  like  to ask the Minister not  to be  short-sighted.  We  would  like  such amendments  as  this  to come  in full  because  it  is not useful to make  an amendment  today  only to make  another one  in the statute law tomorrow. I think  the Minister should be able to look through  the whole Act concerned and come  out with one  full  amendment that serves  the whole purpose. Finally,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I  urge the Minister for Environment and  Natural  Resources  to speed up  the amendment of the Mining Act. He  should  bring  the Geologists Registration Bill here for discussion So as to streamline  that profession,  too,  which is closely related to the engineering  profession. I  think  a  promise  to  this  effect was  given  last year,  and the samepromise  has  only  kept being repeated. It  is  time  that  amendments,  particularlyto the  Mining  Act were  brought  here. Bits  of  amendments  have  been  brought  upin  terms  of Statutory Law 	(Amendment)  Bills  to  deal  with a person who  is caught with gemstones  in  his  pockets,  but the main core of  the Mining Act still remains colonial. So,   the  amendment dealing with a person who  is caught with gemstones in  his  pockets  is  not  even  relevant  because  this  fellow will  help  himself after earning  a  few  shillings,  possibly  lawfully. However,  the  main  core  of  the  Act should be  brought  here  for amendment  because  even  today you will  find  that the Minister  has  very  little  powers  in  the  Mining  Act  whereas  the  Commissioner of  Mines  is  overwhelmed with  all  the  powers. I  am  sure  that  this  situation was okay  in  the  colonial  times.	In  the  present Kenya,  however,  the Minister  is  the  overall  boss,  and  he cannot  be  overruled  by  his  officers. These  are  some  of the  anomalies  in  the Mining Act,  and  the  Attorney-General  should inform the Minister  for Environment  and  Natural  Resources  of  the  situation so that  this Act may  be  brought  here  quickly  for amendment. I keep  on repeating persistently that geologists,  too,  are still waiting  for  a Geologists  Registration Act,  which,  I  am  sure,  is  lying in the office  of the  Attorney-General  or  in  the Ministry  of Environment and Natural Resources.	We  would  like  this  Act  to  be  brought here  for discussion and enactment.There  is  also  the  Water  Act,  which  is  very  archaic  and requires  tobe amended as  it  is  still  colonial. You  will  find  in  this  Act  that  there  is noprovision  for  communication with the  public. Someone  from  a certain  area maywant  to  become  a water undertaker,  and a notice may even be put up in a newspaper  for  the  public  to know  this. 	However,  the notice will pass unknown especially  in  the  remote  areas of this country where people do not get newspapers, and  the  applicant will  be given almost a whole division as a water undertaker. Of course,  there  is no remedy here  because one somebody has been registered as a water  undertaker of a certain area,  even the Government cannot just walk into  that  area  and  develop  water. In  such  cases  as  this,  where  not even  the Government can  walk  in  and  supply water  to  its  people,  what justification  is there  for having private water undertakers? 	In  my  own  constituency of Igembe, for  example,  almost  the  whole  area  is  under  a private  water undertaker,  and even  when  the  Government wants  to come  and  dig  boreholes  there  for  the  public, this  becomes  impossible  without a  letter from the private  undertaker. This  is the  so-called  letter  of no  objection. Even  if we  talk  and  argue  about  this situation,  we  are  not  listened  to. Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I would now  like to request the Minister  for Water  Development  to  think  seriously of  this  issue  and  see  whether the  water  undertaker should  have  the  power  to  restrict  individuals  in developing  their water resources  or even to bar a well-wisher from making a borehole  in  the  undertakes  area. I  think  the  idea of having a water  undertaker is  really  selfish,  particularly  because  the Government  is  not involved because 	private  water  undertakers  just  fence  in an area so  that somebody else may not go in.. In  Igembe  Constituency,  for example,  we  have good non-governmental organisations  which are willing  to  come  and assist  us  to get water supplied to our homes,  but  the  water  undertaking regulation prohibits them  from supplying even  a drop  of water to  our families.  The water  undertaker himself is not even capable of providing the people with water, and  this  is  where  I  would<Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER(Mr.  Kagwima): Order,  hon.  Malebe. Could you please  stick  to  the  Bill  before-the  House? I  am getting  a little bit lost.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MALEBE:	Mr.  Temporary  deputy Speaker,  Sir,   I  think what I am sayingis relevant to  the  Bill  before  the House because we are talking about the amendment to  the Engineers Registration Act. I  was only talking on the  amendment of the Water Act as  related  to  the amendment of the Engineers  Registration Act. So,   I think  I  am within the context of the debate. I was  only  detailing some  things for Ministers  to  hear and  note  because  there are many problems  in some Ministries that the laymen do not understand. 	That  is why we want to amend various Acts  for the  benefit of the  laymen. In law we say  that  ignorance  is not an excuse  to commit an-offence,  but we  must take  into account the fact that most of our people are illiterate;  they cannot-read or write. If you advertise the amendment of this Act  in  the  newspapers,   it will  be  good for  the engineers  and  the  university graduates because  they  will  be  able  to  read  the notice. But if you  advertise  to  become a private  water undertaker,  very few people  in the rural  areas will know the meaning of  the  term  "water  undertaker". This  is  the example we have in Igembe Constituency. Such  a thing happened and the people are now suffering  there  due  to-lack of water supply. A  private  water  undertaker was appointed and now the people cannot develop themselves  water-wise  as  they  wish;   they must get a letter  of no  objection from this  private  water  undertaker. This  is  a specific problem  in my constituency, and  that  is  why  I  am stressing  it. Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  yesterday I  did touch  a bit on potholes on our roads. It would  be pointless  to register engineers without them coming up  with  a masterpiece on what we have to do with our roads.	If you  have to  tarmac a road, you must have. a specific design as to how you are going to do it.	I  understand  that  in most cases  it is the contractor who messes;  the design could be okay but  it  is  messed  by  the  contractor. 	If a contractor  is  told to put five centimetres  of tarmac,  he puts one centimetre despite the fact that he is under the supervision of the clerk  of works,  who  is supposed to be an engineer himself. That mess comes as  a result of non-supervision of contractors by engineers. A contractor will decide to put  a veneer of tarmac instead of using the required standards. If the  tarmac is not of high quality,  then when the rain comes it is just dislodged as concrete and  then potholes start appearing.	So, everything depends  on our engineers.	If our  engineers are  lax,  potholes will never end on our roads,. however good you do it.Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  the other thing I would like to mentionis  that the maintenance engineers of the Ministry, of Public Works have been pouringmurrain on potholes. What happened to  this road? There were tenders  sent out for constructing a dual carriageway between Thika and Makutano. Since  I  use  the  same road to go to my constituency,  I have a lot of problems. It  takes  me a long time to get to my constituency when I use that road.. . Sir,  engineers  are very  important-people who should be registered and monitored  to ensure  that they give us  they give us honest designs. Engineers must be men  of integrity who are  able to supervise contractors. Because we  have  a lot  of temptations  for contractors,  I would recommend that the Engineers Registration Board be  looking  at the  integrity  and honesty of engineers,  on top of their academic" qualifications,  before  they are  registered so that we get patriotic and committed engineers  registered. An  engineer  should render a honest service without favouring a contractor  so that roads  are designed and constructed properly. That way,  we will  be able  to eliminate  the problem of potholes on our roads. 	Finally,  Sir,  let me also  say  that the  services of geologists should be  used  before  the construction of roads start. 	Geologists,  particularly geotechnical geologists  or what  the  engineers  terms  as geotechnical  engineers,  should be  consulted before construction work of roads begin so that they can give engineers material for  foundation. It  is only  a geologists who can specify materials for tarmacking and  recommend where  those materials can be obtained from. At  the same  time,  geologists should be  able  to locate weak sites along a road stretch where you are likely  to have  depressions. In  particular,  a geologists  should detect areas with claysoil  because  those  are  the  areas  that are  likely to cause problems. Such  areasshould  be  taken  care  of properly  in order that potholes  and cracks  do not appear along  the  road,  hence  disturbing  traffic. That  is  the work of a geologist,  and his  services  should be  called upon whenever  it  is necessary.	Professionals should work  as  a team  so  that they come out with a well done job.	They  should  be  able to give  our people  a good service.	When we have properly constructed roads and properly put up  buildings such that no cracks can occur, that is a credit to our engineers  and other  related disciplines. In such a case,  we  do not have  to  spend a lot of money  maintaining the projects. With  those  few remarks,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to support  the Bill.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEWA: 	Thank you,  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  for giving me  an opportunity to make a contribution to the Engineers Registration (Amendment) Bill,  the last amendment having been done  in 1970. Sir,   I  do appreciate  the fact  that in this Bill we hope to give an opportunity  to  the consulting engineer,  the graduate technician engineer and the technician engineer to be registered by the relevant board. My main worry,  however, is,  as  I  have  said in another forum as a pharmacist,  the question of opening the floodgate  to everybody who-might think he. is what he is not. We stand the risk of having,  as  they  say,  too many  ships and very few Indians. The   Minister for Public Works will have to tell us who is going to be registered as a graduate technician/engineer. 	I am asking this because there could be an element of overlapping in this case where people might be tempted to  take  short-cuts and the board might not be able to know who fits in what category. I assume that this has been categorized to take care of the current/ system  of education where not. all the engineers will come from the University. We g hope  that  eventually somebody can graduate as an engineer at a technical college or a polytechnic. Those who do not make it to the university after Form IV should be able to  join youth: polytechnics where they would undertake an  artisan course and eventually be able to join the university as technician/engineers. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  this might perhaps not be the right time  to  say that  we need to  have a complete feasibility study to increase the number of youth-polytechnics that are going to offer training opportunities to artisans. The other day I read in one  of the newspapers that about 50 polytechnics have been set aside for the training of artisans.   Looking at this list, I found that it was not very representative. I found that most: of these polytechnics have been upgraded in areas where there are very few youth polytechnics which were at  one time village polytechnics. Such institutions should be fairly distributed throughout  the country if we want entually to ensure that-we have enough/technician/engineers.   This point should be looked into by the Ministry Technical Training and Applied Technology so that every division has an institution to cater for artisans Who  eventually might end up as grad registered technician/ engineers. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  after going through the amendment Bill Which I have in my hands at the moment and comparing it with the existing Act, I find a very big anomaly in Section 11,  Subsection i (a).  This Section has not been amended and still remains the same.   This is what the Section is saying: "The Board will register a member of an institution of engineers, the membership of which is recognized for the time being by the board as furnishing sufficient guarantee of academic knowledge and practical experience in engineering".  Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  my interpretation  of this Section is that we are,  in fact,  going to register foreign engineer wholesale.  It pains me at this level of our development to hear that  simply because somebody is registered by an institute of engineers in Pakistani,  India,  Britain or Canada, he can just work into Kenya and get a registration certificate. I think this is wrong and  therefore,  that section should be looked at and amended accordingly. Our engineers do not just/walk   walk into other countries and get registration certificates like that.   This does not happen in pharmacy and certainly I do not think it ought to happen in engineering. Foreign Engineers should be treated according to  the  legislation that We have here.   They have got to have the necessary academic qualifications and they ought to have practised in Kenya for a minimum number of years as required by the law.   Therefore, I would like to call upon the Minister to  seriously look at  this section which give an opportunity to foreign engineers to be registered Wholesale here in Kenya. Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I am saying  so because if today  you are  a registered electrical engineer in 	1gland,  even the weather alone is enough to  tell you that  a steel bar/does not behave the  same in Kenya. When you pass that  element  of registration,  it means you have an ability to practice.  Where can you practise in an atmosphere you have had no practical experience.   This is the crux of the matter.   One  would go even further and talk about  the registration  of constultant  engineers. 	This again does not  gives any protection to our indigenous engineers and at  the moment,  they are experiencing unnecessary competition.   Most engineers come to this country straightaway as consultant  engineers and  since they do not necessarily have to be registered by the board of  engineers,  they come here and work for donor agencies.	Here I	have an Example that  I am very familiar with. As  we  are talking here, there is a big project  that  is going on at Kilifi  for the construction of the Kilifi Bridge. I am using this just as an example and I am saying  that there is  something with the engineering working there.	These engineers are not  Kenyans and I am saying  that  this  Act gives us an opportunity to  register these people the first day they arrive here.   These people come from countries  that  continue to assist us and if they are going to be automatically registered here,  it means that our local engineers will be phased out and these people will  even continue practising here even after the project is completed. Since  these consultant engineers have been working here for so long,  they will  continue to lobby for jobs as a consulting engineers at the expense of our local engineer. I note here  that this  Act does not give us specific period for which a registerd engineer may work in Kenya.	If an engineer has been working for a donor agency,  that alone should not be taken by the board as a reason for registering him. This is because an engineer working for a donor agency would be working under an entirely different condition from the one under which he would be working If he was practising on his own  and doing	specific job.Mr. Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  this is because the conditions under 	which this  engineer will  be working are completely different  from if he  was working in a country. where  he would  be  exposed	to  a  specific  job  as  a mechanical engineer for that  matter and he  would  compete unfairly with our  own engineers. I hope  that  once  this Bill is passed  our people will also have an opportunity to  compete  for these  jobs  and work as  consulting engineers.	This  is  because  right now most  of the  so-called consulting engineers  are  foreigners  and  they tend to	collude  with foreign contractors or in Kenya to  assist. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  you will find that  at the  end  of the  day,  as  I  said  earlier  on,  we  would like  to  give  every cadre  of  engineers  an opportunity to be registered;   This  is  what  this means.  We want  to  encourage  our youngsters particularly within the 8-4-4  system to  get  involved  in the  field  of engineering: We  should encourage  them to  get  involved  in the  technical aspects of the development  of the  development  of our	country. We are at  a kind of a technical threshold  or industrial revolution and we want  to make  sure  that  our  own Nyayo Pioneer Car is  going to bemanufactured by  our  own Kenyan engineers. This  is why we  do  not  wantthe	Armchair  engineers registered. We  want  those who  grease  their hands  to  get registered. But  the  Board  should be a board which will  stand no nonsense  as  far as registration of engineers  is  concerned:   That Board will have  to  listen to the engineers  of Kenya who I am quite sure can assist the Board as  watch-dogs regarding who might want  to  take  short-cuts to  get registered; Mr. Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  the Bill,  like the previous Act,  talks  of penalising those who pretend to be  engineers or  those  who use  false  titles  of engineers.  This  clause has  been there  and  it will continue to be there. But I have  yet  to  see  as many people  as  you would  imagine I do not support  engineers	but  if you talk of  other professionals there  are  so  many quacks and  particularly in the medical field,  doctors pharmacists  for that matter. We  have  passed a Bill inthis  House to  allow for the  registration of clinical  officers and I hope  that  in future  we  will  be  able to register pharmacy technicians  so  that  those loopholes are  closed.I think we  ought  to	get  more  tough with these people whopretend to be	professionals  and particularly people  who have worked with consulting engineers  in the past.	You will  find  that somebody works  for  a consulting engineers and  after a few years he  gets to  know what goes  on in that  office: He  may disagree with the engineers  and  since he  has been exposed to  that  profession,  he  continues to practise it. Even though the  penalty which is here  is stiff and quite  discouraging,  I am Sure that  there  are  quite  a few quacks who continue  to call themselves  engineers;	When it	comes to	herbal medicine  they call themselves  "Doctors";   We  keep  on encouraging them and  at  the  end  of the day they do more harm than good.. I do not want  to  take  too much time  on this  issue but  I just  want  to  say that 	most  of these professional Acts  are  old and they need  to repealed  in accordance with the  current  system of education;   For instance,  we have yet to be told  by the Ministry  of Education,  what  will happen, to doctors  and pharmacists who,  after doing their  "A"  Levels,  have  been doing a four year or five year	degree  course.	Nothing has come  out  in a  straightforward manner as  to how many years  Will be  for university and how many post Form Four years will be for practicals. After that there will be  the  element  of registration.  So,	Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, until those Acts  are  amended,  we  might  have  these  Form Four graduates  going on, for further  education and not being able to be slotted into any register.This would  be  futile  because  as  I  said  earlier,  we want  togive  an  opportunity  to  our	upcoming young generations  to take  science subjects more seriously;   This is because the developmentof our country right now relies very heavily  on people  with a scientific background.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR RECLAMATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF ARID, SEMI-ARID AND WASTELANDS(Mr. Mokku): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to  join my colleagues in contributing to  this Bill. 	I think the Minister has  brought  this Bill at  the  right  time:   At  present we  need the  services  of engineers in this  country.	The  engineers we  have  in this country  are  very  competent  people.   So,  as legislators  we must  congratulate them for the  good  job they are  doing in the  country;While commending these  officers,  I would  like  to make  an appeal  to. the  road engineers to be serious when designing our roads. You will  find  that 	the  Ministry  of Public  works may  set  aside millions  of shillings  for the  construction of a particular road. We  have  engineers  who  oversee  this  construction work but you willfind that  in less than two years that roads  is  full of potholes. This leaves  you wondering,  as  a layman,  whether there was any engineer  on  site to oversee  the  construction of that road. So,  we  need patriotic  engineers  in this  country;  engineers who will take care  of public  funds. This  is  because  the  Government  uses public  funds to build  these roads; We. need  engineers who do their work with dignity and have the  interests of this country at  heart. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  the  same experts design  our buildings schools  and  so  on.	After the  completion of a building  an  engineer  is  normally asked to  go and  find out whether the	building has  been carried  out  in accordance with the  blue print.	But  you will  find that  the  engineer goes  there  and  approves everything and recommends the  contractor to be paid. However,  after one  or two years the  house will begin to  crack.	The  engineer is  a Government  officer who  is paid  from public  funds  and therefore all engineers  should be patriotic.	This  is  because  the wananchi do rely  on them for  good  service.Mr. Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  while  contributing to this Bill,  I would  like  to make  just  one suggestion. My suggestion is that  every Ministry  should have  its  own engineers.  The Ministry  of Education,  for  instance,  should  have  its  own engineers to oversee  the construction of schools  and  so  on. If a building starts to crack after one  or two years  the  engineer who  inspected  the  project  should  be  held responsible. We may use  a foreign engineer to  supervise  a project but  you will find that  if anything goes wrong with the  project,  there  is no way we can get hold  of that  foreigner and pin him down.  But  if an engineer is assigned some duty by his Ministry and then there  is  some  shortcoming in the  course  of his duty, appropriate  action or any departmental disciplinary action can be  taken against him For example,  in the  districts nowadays,  we have people  from the Ministry of Public Works who go on inspecting those Projects and  sometime it is not easy for the heads of the departments from the Ministry of Livestock Development to take any appropriate action against an officer from  the Ministry of Public Works. As  such,  I am making a proposal that we  should have,  at least,  an engineer from every department taking care  of the projects of that particular department. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  we  have engineers and consulting engineers who  are  exploiting the  common man  very much today.	For instance,  if a consulting engineer is  hired to  go	andinspect  a Project  or to make  a plan for a  certain project,  I think,the  fee  charged is  so  high that if we had Government-controlledengineers, so  that the  rates  for these  charges  are  controlled,  thenthe  fees charged to  the  common man which are  being exploited bysuch consultants	could not be  as high as  they are  today. As such,  when the Minister will be  replying to  this Bill,  we would like  him to  see  to  it that the  fee  for the  consulting engineers is  controlled. They should not  just  charge  that they want,  but what has  been agreed  on by the  board. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,  we  have  another type  of engineers	the  cluster manager engineers	who  are  dealing withirrigation schemes. I  am sorry to  say that  in most of the  areaswhere  we  have  such engineers,  they must  plan-properly for the canals. You might  be  told that  such and such a canal had been inspected,  planned  and  so  on by a very qualified engineer,  Cluster manager engineers,  and during the  floods or any time when we  have a heavy rain,  that  canal-bursts and the  floods have  a lot of side  effects  on the community that lives in such an area.  I think, even with the  type  of education that we have	the	8-4-4  system we  encourage  practical  subjects very much. In this  regard,  I would  appeal to  the Ministry concerned to introduce youth polytechnics  in every division so  that at a very early stage  engineering can be  practised,  especially at  secondary level before  somebody  goes  to university. We  also  have the post of executive  officer in the  board  of engineers. I  think this  should be a person of high integrity. He should work for the  welfare  of  this  country and not in favour of  an individual or group of persons. This  is  like  what  I said earlier on.	If the Ministry does  not  control  the  consultants  fees,  then the common man will be  exploited to the highest level. As  such,the  executive  officer of this board should be  somebody of a very high calibre,  integrity and who  has  the welfare  of this  country at  heart. He  should  also be  somebody who  has  the  common in mindand not money. With those  few remarks,  I thank the Minister for having moved the  Bill.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS(Dr.  Momanyi): 	Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  thank you very much for allowing me  to  contribute  to The  Engineers  Registration (Amendment)  Bill. Well,  I think,  I will be  a bit  superfluous,  but I would like  to  say that Engineering is applied  science, and an engineer is somebody who  converts pure  science  into  a practical entity for use by mwananchi  and the  other public.  Engineering,  like  any other profession,  has rules  and ethics,  and this  is where  there  are very many mistakes made. This  is  also where many of us including myself blunder. A man or a young man who has qualified from university with a degree in engineering verges between an engineer and a pure  scientist. Let us not yet  a qualified engineer,  but he  is  a qualified engineering graduate. Let us not make  a mistake  of seeing anybody in the university doing engineering and then we  say that  he  is  an engineer. He might  be  a pupil engineer,  a graduate  engineer,  or we  might call him cadet. There  are  stages,  and  I think these  are  the stages which are meant by this Bill.	One who is registered as  an engineer is not necessarily a consulting engineer. He  is  just  a registered  engineer in that he has  done  practice  for  the number of years  required by the  board, but  he  cannot  stand and  advise  other engineers  on matters  that have gone  out  of hand,  or matters  in engineering that need deep  study. These  are  some  of the  things  that We  have  to  consider before  we talk of engineers,  consulting engineers,  consulting engineering firms  and  so  on. Well, For an engineer to "serve the  public,  especially here, he will be  required to  design things.	Designing carries  a lot of meanings because  even dresses  are  designed;  roads are designed, houses  are  also designed  and  so  on. 	Now,   "design" means  conceiving the  idea,  putting it  on paper and then into practice. Now, the person doing that is what we  call a designer. Now,  when we  come  to  engineering design,  we  have  to take all parameters  as required by law. For instance, if it is a road, there  are  parameters. There  is  the  alignment,  the  soil  conditions, the  water conditions  and  so  on. Those are  the  parameters required.  There  are  rules .which every country has on the designs even of a chair.	 There  are  standard rules that must be adhered to.	Then there is the cost element.	You cannot have  an engineer telling you, "I want to build you a house and it will cost KSh.10 million". 	You may have that kind of money. You could have KSh. 100,00/- and you have to adhere to that. There is cost-elements in that. The  engineer should not .hide  the client .what he is doing.	In fact, some  engineers  and architects hide from the client what they are designing for him.	"Oh,  heaven,  what do you know you are getting'"Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  we need to clarify some of these  things  so that when we  come to register the chaps,  we know What we are doing. That is why I am going into some of these minor details. The engineer must come to what we call the tender stage.  He must  compile proper drawings that do not leave out anything. They do not need any variation. They can be  given to  a contractor, and without  supervision, he can go ahead with the work. They even specify the materials to be used. Those  are  the working drawings. ButWhat  I have  seen in the  field are  sketches,  and you are given a headache  to  think of what to do with them.	That is not  engineering work. There must be  bills  of quantity to  show you,  as the  owner of whatever is being done by your engineer,  how much you are  going to spend and what material you are going to use,  whether you are going to  use  this  or that. This is very important and it is what is missed out very much in practice in this country. 	Also, the  client must be  advised because  he  is  the  man who spends  money,   An engineer must be  a person of  integrity. Like  a doctor will not kill his patient,  an engineer should not exploit  his  client.	But,  here,  almost the  opposite  happens.  Why must the word "integrity" lack in many of them?Mr.   Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,   the  other  thing that the  engineers  do  is  to  implement  the  projects. That  is what  the  clients  are  interested  in,   because  that  is  the  final job,  which  will  be  used  by the  client. 	That  is  why many  of my  hon.   colleagues  have  said  that 	 engineers  must  be  supervised. I  think  they  also  have  their  own  integrity. Sir,   I  would  now  like  to  talk  about  the  category of the  qualified persons  who  can be  registered  as  engineers. 	After completing  ‘A’  levels,  there  are  some  people  who  join  our  national polytechnics  and  train  as	technicians.	Such people are  taught  the  elements  of  engineering,  and after sometime,   they are able to catch, up pass  an examination which is  just below  the  degree  level.	Such  people start working under  qualified engineers,   and  after  a  year  or  two  they  can work  on  their  own  as  engineers, At that stage they can be  registered  as engineers  They can also  work  and  supervise  work  on	their own.	If  a  person undergoes  m  such  a  training  and experience, gains there is no reason why he  cannot be  registered  as  a  registered  engineer,  although he  is  not able to carry out research That  makes  a  great  difference. He  is  a  technical  man,  but  he  cannot  do  research  on  complicated matters. 	You  might  know 	how  to  construct foundation,   but if  you  are  told lay a foundation for, you might not know  what  kind  of  foundation to  put  there  because  you  have  not reached  that  stage.	That  needs  a  lot  of  geo-technics  and  soil  mechanics.	Although  you  are a  registered  engineers  you  cannot construct  that  foundation in a swamp  because  it is  complicated.  Sir,    there  might  be  another  person  who  goes  through  ‘A’ level  and  joins  the  university and attains  a  bachelor  of   Science Engineering,  then  a  Masters  Degree  in  Engineering and  later a  Doctorate  in  Engineers.	All  that  is  academic  performance.	He has  to  come  and work  for  two  years  in  the  field,  work for	 two or three years in the  office,  and put  into  practice  what he had  learned  in  school.	After  that  he  becomes  a  registeredgraduate  engineers. I  have  not  said  that  he  is  a  consultant engineer. Such a Person  becomes  a  registered engineers, That means  that  he  can  work  on  his  own,  carry out  complicated projects. If  he  has  got  some  equipment he  can  do  some  research on certain projects, He can  also  work  on  his  own.Sir,   a  consulting  engineer  is  person who  has worked  for  more  than  ten  years,  and handled many projects.He  is  like  any consultant  in  any  other  profession. It  is  good  that the ministry of public works has brought this bill here so that we can be able know the kind of engineers that we have in the country. Are they registered engineers or consultant engineers.   The colonial government used not register people with higher diploma as engineers. After somebody attain a higher diploma technician at the polytechnic, and works for a number of years in the field, he gains more experience than a person who attain engineering degree at the university. Sir, after people with higher diploma gain experience, they should be registered as engineers. Sir,   it  is  not  easy  for  one  to  be a registered as an engineer. One  must  work  for  two  years  under  a  qualified engineer,  present  a project; and 	be  examined by  the  Engineers  Registration  Board on  legal and  social  matters one can be registered. With those few remarks, I beg to support the Bill</Newspeech> .  <Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT MINISTER  FOR  FOREIGN AFFAIRS  AND  INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION 	(Mr. Munyi): 	Thank  you  Mr. Temporary  Deputy  Speaker, Sir,  for  giving me-an opportunity to  say  something on  this important  Bill Sir,  I  think Kenya  is  leading  all  the  other  African countries  as  far  as  the  education is  concerned. The	8-4-4 system  of  education  which  is  used  in  our  country was  started by countries  like  Japan,   United  States  of  America,   Sweden  and  some  other countries. Sir,   I  would  like  to  inform  the  hon.  Minister  for Public  Works  that  today  We pareis  talking  about  construction of  an English  channel, which will connection, France  tandrBritain.	The Japanese did  that  long time  ago.	The  Japanese  constructed  a  channel between  Nagasaki  where  the  first  atomic  bomb  was  dropped and to   Hiroshima channel	covers a distance of  almost	50  kilometres.	That  channel  was  constructed  very many years  ago. The Nyali  Bridge  in  Mombasa  was  also  constructed by Japanese engineers They also	constructing	another  bridge at  Kilifi. 	That  shows  they  have  a  very high technology. Sir,   according  to  the  statistics,  today,   Japan  is producing more  engineers  than  the  Admit  United  States  of  America 	(U.S.A.)The  U.S.A. is bigger  than  Japan  in  size,  but  every year,  they produce  more  engineers  than  the  U.S.A.	That  is  why  the  Japanese have  got  tankers,   super  tankers,  computers  and all  the  modern equipment. The  number  of  cars  m which  are  manufactured  in  Japanare  more  those which  are manufactured by the U.S.A.  today.  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  within the Preferential Trade 	Area	(PTA)  we are well-known because of our dynamic leadership.	In  fact,  we areknown as  mini-super power.   This  is because of our products.	So  I  would like tochallenge our young engineers to form some sort of co-operative unions or jua kali groups  to come out with more  inventions,  be they agricultural machines or otherwise, to  be  supplied to  PTA countries. In East,  Central  and South Africa we have very many minerals that can be  exploited by our engineers.	I  think we  have more  geologists  in this  countrythat any  other-country  in this  region.	I  would  like  to request our geologists,because my  friend who has  just left was emphasising that point so much,  to go to other  countries  to help  exploit  the  resources  that have not yet been exploited. I  would  like  to  inform  the  House  of what happened  sometime  back  in 1947  in Shinyanga,  Tanzania where  a white man  called Mr.  Williamson went to a certain 	 Village where-he saw a woman wearing a necklace which was made of pure diamonds.  After that he  went  back to  England and brought  a glass-necklace  which  he  subsituted with the  diamond necklace  that  this  woman was  wearing. 	In  England,  that necklace  was  valued at  shs.40 million and  today,  because  it  is  still  preserved in  London,  it  is  about  half a  billion  shillings. This  is  because  the value  of diamonds  keeps on going up  and  its  texture does  not  change  even  if you mix with mud. So  I  would  like  to  challenge  our young geologists  to exploit our minerals for us. As  you might be  aware,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir, 	there are  very many gemstones  in Tharaka. What we need  is our own Kenyan geologist to go  there  research and exploit these minerals.	This  is  because foreigners cannotagree  to  do  this  for us.	No, they will  not  do  that. , They want to a keep on supplying us with oil and so on.Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir, before Nigeria attained Independence,it did not have books on geology in its bookshops.   Nobody knew that one dayNigeria could produce  oil.	This also applies to Libya. I remember this country was one of the poorest countries in Africa in 1961-1963 but things changed when they started producing oil in 1965. Before  that,  there were geologists from Italy and so on but they could not drill that oil. The  leader of that country   is now going all over the world on subversive missions because of the oil his country is producing.We want   to challenge our African engineers who are registered and even those who will be registered, to continue doing more  inventions on agricultural machinery which we  can supply to Preferential Trade Areas. I remember recently hon. MWangale, the minister for Livestock Development, went to Kabete and found   stocks   of machinery which were rotting and could not be used due to lack of spare parts.   Who cannot make those spare parts if not our engineers?The  can invent farmiliar spare parts for cars and other machinery like tractors. For example,  there   are some machinery which has been lying idle in our sugar Industries for many years due  to lack of spare parts.	They should do research and come up with adequate spare parts rather than relying on foreigners.For  example, some machinery in Uplands Bacon Factory where hon. MWangalealso visited recently cannot be used due to lack of spare parts. Why can we not manufacture  our own spares parts as Kenyans like they do in Germany,  Sweden and so on?India is making its own machinery and we can also do it. We  should not rely on foreigners.   As we have been told by our great President,  we  should not rely on foreigners but  on ourselves.	When we do so, we  shall be making use of our resources which have not been exploited.  Sir, there was a time when I flew   from Paris to Angola and we stayed in Lunda’s biggest hotel overlooking the sea. We were  told by the Angolans that an ordinary carpenter   or mason earns more than an engineer from Europe because they do not even have youth polytechnics. For  example,  if they have a chair for repair,  they go to Europe to look-for carpenters. When I asked them what was happening,  they told me that they were waiting to get an aeroplane to airlift   all the broken furniture to be taken for repair in Europe. They could not  even do  ordinary carpentry and masonry work and they had to go Europe to recruit  expartriate masons.	Yet  we  know that is not necessary in technical work.	Whether the  technician is an Italian or Kenyan, you can send him to Angola,  or anywhere  else, and he  will repair  anything. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, sir, in fact, there are many countries that cannot train their own artisans, but I am mentioning the  ones  I know. Owing to the  civil war  which is  going in Angola the  type  of furniture  which is  costing only Shs.5,000/- here will cost more than Shs.100,000/- in that country; despite this high Price  it  will. go  like hot  cakes.	The  same  thing applies to Zaire  and in many other countries that order us.I agree  with the  hon. Member who  said that we  should have  a youth polytechnic in every location,  and not in every division.	This  is  important because  we  need masons,  plumbers  and so  on in construction work.	Our  people  in rural areas need the services  of these  people.	This  is  because,  for  example,  the hotels that 	are  built in those areas become almost inhabitable after two  weeks. Firstly its sewerage  system will first block because of  too much paper being used and then later breakdown. 	This  is why it is  important  for us to train plumbers in the rural areas who can provide plumbing, services to hotels and other water systems. Even here in Parliament when our sewerage  system breaks down we get trained people from the ministry of public works to repair it. 	I have  also realised that the  services  of plumbers  are very much needed in company offices and Ministry offices. 	Today  I visited a toilet  in Treasury Building which was in a mess and needed the the  services  of a  Plumber. These	artisans  are  also  needed in provincial headquarters  like Embu. We  should not find it difficult to  produce  these  artisans:  in a year  or two you can have a well qualified Plumber,  who can go whenever his services  are required.  When you  are  in  New York or Washington,  you see  plumbers  walking about,  and  they can  check your  equipment  and  repair  it  for you. These  are  graduates. I  will tell  the  Committee  for  Unemployment  which was  appointed  by His Excellency  the President  that we  have  many  jobs  that  can  be done  our  people  to make  life better  for  our  people  in  rual  areas.   Everybody wants  to go  to  rural  areas because  there  is  good  air  there  and  buildings  are  also  going  up  there. 	When  we encourage  our  people  to  go  to  rural  areas,  we  should  give  them  facilities,  which we  ourselves  can make. As  for piping,  we  can  use what resources  we  have  to make  pipes. We have  bamboo  trees,   In  such  countries  as  Indonesia,  when  her  people  had not got pipes,  they  were  given  some  technology  to  use  bamboo  wood  as  pipes.Even people in  Thailand  were  using  the  same  technology. A  bamboo  pipe  can  be  traditionally preserved  in  water  for a month and  be  serviceable  for 	100 years without  being eaten  by  white  ants. We  can make  use  of all  these  resources that we have,  even in  our  secondary  schools. The  other  time  when  officials  of  the  United  National  Children's  Fund came  to  Embu,  they  asked  me  why  the  number  of girls  in  secondary  schools  had not been going up,  I  told  them  that we  must first  improve  boarding facilities  for girls, such  as  water  supplies.	I  said  that when you  supply  such facilities, they  would  encourage more girls  to  join  boarding schools.	You  heard yesterday that  in  North-Eastern Province,  there  is one  technical  training  institute  in Garissa.	I  think  the  trainees  there  from  North-Eastern Province are very few and  the  majority  of  them come  from  outside  the  province.	As  our President  has been  saying,  we  should  encourage  our people  by giving them the necessary facilities  because  if we  do not do  so,  they will come  to town. 	However,  if  they see  that  there  is  water,  electricity,  and so on,  people will go to rural  areas. This  is  why  I  want  to  criticise my  friend and tell him that there is no  question  of rural  areas  once  we  supply  them with the necessary facilities. We  want  to make  rural  areas  better by giving them good schools,  machinery and  other  similar  facilities.	In  this  case,  people  will  go  there rather, than cometo  towns.	The  other day  a  friend of mine came  to me and told me,  "In one cityin  Latin  America,  say,  Mexico,  Buenos Aires or Argentina,  there are more than 15 million  people,  but  there  are  no people  in their rural areas. Why?" I  told  him that our policy  is  good because we have made our rural areas better as we were directed  by  our President. I  told  him  that  if people  in Latin America did the same,  many  people  would go  to rural  areas. Mr.  Temporary  deputy Speaker,  Sir,  you can see that in developing countries,  the  population  is  increasing very rapidly.	Why  is  this  so?	It  isbecause  everybody wants  to go  to a big town because they know that they will getwater  and  electricity  there.	In Kenya,  however,  when you go  to Kericho,  forexample,  you will  find electricity,  tea,  coffee,  and so on.	When you go  toMr.  Elgon,  you will  find many people going there because they are encouraged to go  there.  Therefore,  I  would like  to request the Minister for Public Works to advise our engineers  to change their mentality and be patriotic.	That way,  they will knowthat when you  invent something today your name remains  in history.	For instance,what  education did the man who invented locomotives have? 	He  just saw water boiling and  thought of something,  and today we are talking about him. If an ordinary man could do  that,  why can our people not do the same today? Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I want to congratulate the Ministry of Livestock Development for what it has done in terms of inventing drugs for animal diseases.	I  should not  also  forget to thank and congratulate-the Kenya MedicalResearch  Institute for  inventing KeMron.	Due  to commitment to what we are doing,the other day we  beat the other nations of the world who had put their heads together to  look for a drug like KeMron. And  if we have done  that  in this field,  why can our engineers  not do the  same? They  should use  their knowledge  to  invent more things. Turning to  another point,  Sir,  I want to tell  the Minister for Public Works-that  today  in Kenya everybody  is  talking about the  rural access roads because they  are  better  than any other. Whenever we  meet  in district development committee meetings,  everybody  stresses  the need to have  more rural  access roads  because  they are  properly murammed and even when  it rains you do not get stuck.  How are  the other  tarmacked roads?	They  are  very  bad.	In fact,  somebody  was  just  complaining here  today  about  tarmacked roads  being  impassable.	We must  follow  the example set  by  the  Ministry  of Public  Works  to  increase  rural  access  roads.	Those  are the  roads  that  will  save  us  because  road construction has  become  very  expensive. 	Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,   I was  reading a story  in  the newspapers  the other day  and  I  saw  that  the  cost of constructing underground  train system  is almost Unaffordable.	According to  statistics  availed by  the World Bank,the  cost of constructing one square kilometre of sub-way is KShs.l billion. When you  talk  about  construction of sub-ways  in a city like  Nairobi,  which  is  in a developing country,  where do you get all the money  to finance the project? We  should deal with  the  facilities  available  to us and  improve our roads  in the best way we  know.	Tar, which  is  used by  the Ministry of Public Works  for road construction, does  not cost much.	Even  though,  to  tarmack  one  kilometre  of road costs  a lot 	but we  should  concentrate  on that  instead of relying of the  big companies  that want  us  to  undertake  costly projects.	In fact,  we  can even use  co-operative societies to amass money for such projects as roads, with the guidance of our registered engineers  and technicians.  I am saying this because if we did that, the cost would come down. Today, it cost a lot  of money to  just tarmac one kilometre, but if we can use the local tar,  the cost would be much less. They  have used this kind of tar to tarmac the parking are here in Parliament and I have seen them using it in other Ministries.   They have also used it by the Ministry of Water Development in Embu and this did not cost them much. What we Should do  is to call these engineers to  a conference and ask them to give us their views so that we can make use  of these views to improve the position. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir, 	while suppoting this Bill,  I would like the Minister for Environment and natural resources to come with a similar Bill to take care of the recent problem of earthquake. Recently, a report  has been made regarding the earthquake that took place at Mombasa. This report had been compiled by our geologists and this was a very good report. 	So,  it  is important to carry out study of the formation the earth before putting up  storey building,  for example,  in a place like Nakuru.   This kind of "Study must be carried out and its report thoroughly scrutnized so that it becomes secure to put up a to storey building    This ought to be done inplaces where there are occasional earth movements.Therefore,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, with the registration ofour geologists,  we are now going to have proper geo-survey reports and I amsure that  if  our geologists are  going to continue to work together,  they aregoing to come out with a very good solution on what can be done regarding theproblem of earth tremor. I am  sure our geologists can also  go to t othercountries and expatriate engineers for a number of years and there is  absolutely nothing wrong in that. In fact,  foreign engineers are Paid much highersalaries together with other benefits when they come to Kenya and I do not thinkthere is m anything wrong in our geologists or engineers working elsewhere asexpatriates  So,  we  can send them in other countries  so that they can showtheir counterparts there what can be done regarding some of these problems. " However,  foreign countries do not come out openly to say what they need. They just  speak half-way so that Kenya may not provide them with expatriate engineers, geologists,  agriculturists, surveyors and so on. I am sure if we continue like  this,  we shall create a good name for our beautiful country of Kenya. 	Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  is a very good Bill, but I would like  the Minister to make sure that when the board is appointed, every province is  represented in the board so that ideas can be coming from the provinces into the board. If he does this,  he will be getting ideas from Embu,  Mandera,  Wajir,  Kisii,  Homa Bya, Kakamega and so on.   If this is done, I am sure that  the board will operate very well.</Newspeech><Header>ADJOURMENT</Header><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER(Mr. Kaglitma) Hon.

But  out  of 20 cattle  dips,  why arethe  three  not  operating?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  CHESIRE : 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, There are three cattle  dips which are not  in operation at  the moment  in the Division. The  one in Akachiu Location Thaucu dip has cracked. It cracked soon after construction. It has  already been repaired,  cleaned, and refilled. All  that  is remaining is  for the  acaricide  to be Put in. 	But  due  to  heavy rains the road to this particular dip is not accessible  at the moment. The  other dip which is not operational at the moment is Athiru-Gaiti dip which has flooded and it is  being emptied now by wananchi  themselves. 	We  hope  it will be  operational when the wananchi have  finished the  cleaning. The  other dip  is  in Njia Location the Mura dip which lacks water.	Water pipes have been purchased  and arrangements are  underway to  connect  the  dip with piped water.	This will  be done when it  is dry since  the  area is  also  inaccessble  at the moment  due  to  the present very heavy rains.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MALEBE: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, when the  Assistant Minister says  that the mura dip cannot operate because there. is no water, who is  going to  supply the water?   Who  are  they waiting for to supply the water because  they might wait indefinitely before the  dip can start  operating?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

MALEBE: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when the Assistant Minister talks  of heavy rains  in the area and that they are not able  to reach some  cattle dips,  will this be  a recurrent problem,  Or is  it just  an excuse  which the Ministry is trying to bring in? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

Is the Assistant Minister in order to brush off my question?   When I asked how may cattle  dips  are  functioning at the moment,  I meant the 	 Assistant Minister  to  tell us why those that are not functioning are not  functioning.   But  then the  excuse  of the  heavy rains  is not acceptable  at  all  for a cattle  dip not  to  be  functioning.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  CHESIRE: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,   I did  mention that some  of these  cattle  dips  are flooded due  to the current heavy rains. Also,  the  roads  to  the  cattle  dips  are  impassable  and,  therefore, it makes  it difficult for the  people  to  take  materials to  repair them there. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  may  I  also  add here  that  the  actual  responsibility for maintenance  and repair:   of dips in every area is The the  local people.	Therefore,  may  I request the  hon.  Member to  ask his people  to  ensure  that these  dins are in good working condition all the  time.

KIMEMIA  asked the  Minister  for  Labour since  Mr.  Joab  Bita  Sule,  former employee  of  Rift Valley Products  Limited,  P.O.  Box 1023,  Nakuru,  was injured while  on	duty  on 23rd March,	1989,  whythe management  terminated his  services  and how muchcompensation  is  due  to the  complainant  in  terms  ofthe  Workmen's  Compensation Act	(Cap.	236).<Newspeech>THE  MINISTER FOR  LABOUR	(Mr.  Okondo):	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,   I  beg  to  reply.Mr.  Sule's  services  with  the  Rift  Valley  Produce  Limited,  Nakuru,  were  terminated after  he  was  involved  in accident which resulted  in the  loss  of his  four fingers  on  25th March, 1989. While  with  this  company,  Mr.  Sule was  employed asa casual  employee  and had worked for this  company for very many years.	After  thisaccident the  company could not  utilise his services and as a result he was paid a sum   of shs.27,360.00 on 1st January, 1990 as  Workmen's  Compensation through  the Labour  office,  Nakuru.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

OKONDO:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Mr.  Sule, after  losing four fingers, wassent  to  a doctor  for percentage  loss assessment according to the Act. As  a resultof that  assessment he  was awarded 50 per cent disability for his hand which according to the  Workmen's  Compensation Act formula amounts to shs.27,360.00.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR.  A.K.  KIMEMIA: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, could the Minister  instruct the  management of this  company  to reinstate Mr.  Sule  because he cannot be employed elsewhere?	In  fact,  as  we are talking now Mr.  Sule  is jobless.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

No.	13-739-212 would be  paid their  benefits.<Newspeech>THE  MINISTER FOR  LABOUR (Mr.  Okondo): Mr.  speaker,  Sir,  let me  firstof all  say  that  this  Question  has  something  bitter  and  sweet  in  it. Having said that  I  beg  to  reply.Mr.  Bechitupu Tembe  has already been paid for the years 1957  to 1989,excluding  1974.	He was paid shs.64,615.25 by cheque on 26th March, 1990.	He  hadapplied for  his  benefits  in January, 1990.	As  for  the  year 1974  for which we  donot have  any records,  we  are  still  looking  into how we can complete  the  schedule and as  soon as  this  is done we will arrange for his payment. Mr.  Jefwa who  was  an  assistant chief has not been  paid which is very unfortunate. 	He  applied  for  payment-of his  benefits  in 1983,  but 	since  that time we have not been able  to get all the  information that relates to his working period. It  is  only now that we have  been able  to get that information. So we  are now arranging to pay  him  as  soon as  possible. But  I  would  like  to  say  at this  juncture  that  the  delay  in this  case is  totally unacceptable  to me  and as  with  similar such cases which have  come  to 	my attention,  I  have  set up a committee  to  look  into this matter of delays  in the National  Social Security  Fund (NSSF) so  that matters  can be  speeded up.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  BIDU: 	Mr. speaker,  Sir,  although  the  Minister  did not  provide  me with a written reply  to my Question  I would still  like to thank him for that good 	reply. However, Is it  in order for win to tell the  House that they could not get some of the  forms  of these  people when I know very well that the forms were forwarded  to his  office?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  OKONDO:	Mr.  speaker,  Sir,  I  totally agree with the hon.  Member thatany retiree  should be  treated the way Mr.  Jefwa was  treated. This  is  a  veryunfortunate  case  in which the NSSF failed to act promptly. Because  of this andsimilar  cases,   I  have now set up a special committee to look into these kind of cases and report  back  to me. This  committee  started work  today. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  KAMUYU: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, since. the  Minister sounds  apologetic about his  Ministry's  carelessness  in  proper-records  keeping,  could he  confirm  to the  House  that  should  this  committee  find  that Mr.  Jefwa should have  been paid by 1983  he  is  going  to  adjust  the  payment pro  rata to  the  current  purchasing power  of the  Shilling? This  is  because as  we  are  aware the  purchasing power  of the  Kenya Shilling keeps  of going down and  down which means that the  value of a  hundred shilling today  is not the  same as  that of 1983.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  OKONDO: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  money  is  defined as a measure of value and thus  shs.20.00  is  shs.20 and  it does not vary no matter the years.  Although that  is  so  the  Act  does  not provide  for  inflation accounting. There  is  nogovernment  in the  world that provides  for inflation accounting. So we  cannotdo  that because  it  is  beyond the requirements  of the law.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MAKHANU: 	MR.  Speaker,  Sir,   I  am glad to have heard  from the Minister that he  has set up a special committee to deal with delays  in his Ministry. 	Could he  tell us  whether this  is an ad hoc committee or a permanent committee which will  deal with NSSF delays  in his Ministry?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  OKONDO: MR.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  an  ad hoc committee to correct `; the managerial system  in the area where the  delays occur,  but as soon as a solutionhas  been  found and proper administrative methods have been set it will bedissolved.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  SPEAKER: Next Question.</Newspeech><i>Question No. 	117</i>Kenya   Export Fate  in Future 	EEC Market MR.  KILIKU asked the  Minister  for Planning and National Development   what  the  implications in the Kenya's export sector will be when Western Europe  introduces a single market system by the year 1992. <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT(Dr. Onyonka):	Mr.Speaker,  Sir, I  beg to reply.(noise) I request the Chair to protect me from the noise made by the Front-Bench on the other side because this is an important Question that has been asked by the hon. Member. (applause) Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in general terms,  the impact of the Post 1992 EEC single domestic market on Kenya's export sector may be briefly summarized as follows:-It is most likely that there will be less bureaucracy in getting our exports into  the other EEC member countries from one EEC member country,  since there will be  less administrative barriers through standardization and harmonization of import regulations for the single market. -However,  the above benefits might be outweighed by more stiff competition. from other countries offering similar or identical goods, as bilaterial trade preferences and concessions will most likely be lost. Higher quality   standards coupled by advantages obtained through economies   of scale might adversely affect  some of the export firms which will fail to meet such standards and offer goods at competitive prices. Additionally,  Sir,  another drawback which Could affect us from a single EEC domestic market is related to the possible introduction of protective trade barriers for the  importation of those horticultural commodities which are already produced in large quantities by some of the EEC member states.  Further more, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there  will also be the likelihood of local divestment by some EEC countries which might prefer to go and setupsimilar businesses in the enlarged EEC domestic market.  A parallel issue of concern is the likelihood of a reduction(noise)Sir, the noise problem now lies with the Members of the Front Bench behind me.(laughter)A Parallel issue of concern is the likelihood of a reduction in the level of investment capital from those EEC member countries which have traditionally provided industrial development resources through their respective business communities.   Such entrepreneurs might choose to go elsewhere within the EEC domestic market.Finally, the above Picture clearly demonstrates that there is  genuine course for concern by the Government and other ACP member countries.  Incidentally, this is one of the issues we have been in Fiji in the last 10 days.  As a result of such likely adverse effects on our economies, ACP member countries have prepared resolutions which, inter alia call for guarantees in support of the traditional exports as well as the promotion of further exports from emerging and traditional sectors.Thank you.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU:   Mr. Speaker, Sir,   I would like to know from the Minister when these resolutions calling upon the EEC member countries to guarantee thetraditional exports  from the developing countries to that part of the world will be presented.  I would also like to know whether the EEC countries are prepared for such resolutions.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. ONYQUKA:   Mr. Speaker, Sir, the  resolutions have already been discussed in more than one meeting.  We are being given verbal assurances that the outcome would not be adverse.  Frankly, we are taking all that with a grain of hope. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>DR.  MISOI:   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, we appreciate  the answer given by the	Minister but I would like to say that we know that the EEC says that themarket is open to all our products.	The  Minister  should tell us how Kenyanindustries would fit into this market and what his Ministry, is doing to ensure   that we  can export even if the  market  is competitive both in price and standards in order  to meet the interests of the consumers in those countries. This is  the only way we can be assured of the market. </Newspeech><Newspeech>DR.  ONYONKA: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that is a genuine supplementary question. The  truth of the matter is that the private sector in this country is already fully aware of all  these facts. 	In fact,  the Government,  working through organisations such as KEIL,  has ma made it quite plain that in the new situation,  it means that for us to be able to compete effectively, Me have to be much more efficient in our production,  marketing arrangements and in other aspects with respect to quality and  standards. This message has been conveyed to the private sector many times and it  is now up to them,  given the present incentives and other forms of encouragement by the Government,  to do their best to be able to sustain our present position and to improve upon it.</Newspeech>(applause) <Newspeech>MR.  JALANG'O: 	Mr.  Speaker, Sir,.  Kenya was a signatory to the recently signed Lome Agreement between ACP countries and others. In view of the concern the Minister has enumerated,  can he assure this Rouse that that Agreement still holds water  in view of these  concerns which are going to be created by the single European market system by the year 1992?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR.  ONYONK1:	Sir,  in the negotiations for Lome IV Agreement in whichwas involved,  everything was done  to  try and improve on the existing arrangements under Lome III Agreement;   It is a-fact,  for instance,  that we expect more in terms of capital funds and improvement in the other implementation mechanisms. 	As  the hon.  Member probably knows,  I am the current Chairman   of the 	ICPAEC  Committee that is charged with the responsibility of monitoring the implementation of some of those provisions. (applause)  The  truth of the  matter is that looking at  the provisions of Lome IV Agreement as a whole,  there  is an obvious  improvement. What  is  of concern  to allof us at  the  moment   is  the  actual  implementation of the provisions of the  treaty. For instance, under the previous treaty,  it was quite clear that Kenya was free to export as much as was agreed on with respect to french beans. Despite  that fact,  when it came to the actual implementation of the  treaty we ran in to serious problems   and we had to put our foot down and ensure that in the new Agreement,  the ambiguities which existed under the previous one, were cleared, and that has been done. It came as a big surprise  to us that despite the fact that  the provisions were  on paper,  their interpretation created a lot of difficulties. Our concern is not  so much that  these are  contained within the provisions of the Lome EV Agreement but  their interpretation and actual implementation. I hope that working through what was originally Committee 	193,  we shall be able  to monitor and see  that where  there is a deviation from what was agreed on, action will is taken to rectify the  situation. Thank you, Sir. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  KILIKU:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, the Minister has alreadysaid that  the African,  Carribean and Pacific (ACP)  countries have passed resolutions  to guarantee markets for the good that are traditionally exported to  the  European Economic Community (EEC)  countries:   Now, if these resolutions are not approved by the EEC  countries, what is he doing to find markets for this country's exports?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR.  ONYANKA: 	:Mr. Speaker,  an Sir,  if I  got the hon. Member right, the main point in passing those resolutions was to convey the 	message:   We have  done  that  and the response from the  otherSide has been positive: we  have been told to take  that as assured. The  proof of the  pudding is in the  eating there of and we  are,  therefore,waiting for the  actual implementation in order to see what happens:</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.	KILIKU :	Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  in his reply,  the   Minister states,  "The  level of investments from the  EEC  countries in thiscountry will be reduced". Could the Minister tell us what the Government	is  doing to encourage  investments from countries  outside the  EEC  to  offset  the  effects of a single  European market by 1992?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR.  ORYONEA: Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  the  hon.: Member can see that  in my reply I painted a possible  scenario.   Here,  of course, there  is  scope  for divergent views:   However,  in our own honest	_interpretation,  that is  one  of the  possibilities. But  as far as weare  concerned,  investors from this region, as well those from other parts  of the  world, are  definitely treated alike when it comes to our present investment incentives: It is  our hope  that the present set  of incentives  are  good enough to attract  some  investors from areas  outside  the  EEC block.   But there  is  so many imponderables that really one  can hardly give  a definitive answer concerning this problem. 	The  situation is  so fluid that  I think all I  can is that it is for to re-evaluate  the  situation and to be on guard so that we  can remedial measures to fit stabilise the  situation. </Newspeech> <i>Question No.	48</i>Equipment for Youth Polytechnics  in Machakos MR.

LEAKEY:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I think the  hon. Membermisinterpreted by the hon. Member. I said that we  have  a certainamount  of equipment.   We  do not have  sufficient equipment at  the moment  for every polytechnic  in the  country,  we are  still having shortage of funds for certain types  of equipment:   Therefore,  we  are  trying to work hand in hand with the district development committees so that they set the  priorities for us. Some  of the  Harambee institutions have  better  equipment than others while  others are in a better position to  acquire  equipment for themselves;   That is what  I meant in my reply to the hon.

NDETEI: On a point  of order,  Mr. Speaker,  Sir:   The Assistant Minister has  just  said that the  principal of Machakos Technical School has been transferred as part  of the  expansion exercise which is in-progress:   Does he mean that  the expansion could not be  carried  out without transferring the  principal  and that he was transferred to midmanage  another institution? Can the AssistantMinister tell why the  principal was transferred?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  LEKKEY-	Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  I did not say that transfer  of the  principal was part  of the  expansion programme:	I  said that the hon. Member will have  noticed that we  have  changed the principal and we  hope 	that that will have  some  positive  effects  on that institution:   This  is because  the  fact that there  are in idle classrooms,  equipment and desks in that institution indicates that the running of the  institution has not been entirely satisfactory; it is my Ministry's intention to change that situation.</Newspeech> <i>Question No. 108</i>     Repair of Baomo BridgeMR.

MAIYANI: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  I have  indicated in my reply,  the  cause  of the  delay has much to  do with the weather. However,  I have  supplementary information on this Question.   The crossing at Baomo,  which links  Garsen and Hola Divisions,  was washed away by the	1989  floods	The Ministry has not  been able  to repairthe wash out  due  to  lack of a bulldozer  and serviciable  shovel inTana River District; The  Ministry  has  also  approached  the Director,  National  Youth Service,   to  assist with  equipment which  is  idle at Tana Basic Project.  A  sum of Shs.500,000/=  has  been  issued  to  Tana  River District for this  project,  but the  project  progress  is  affected  by  lack  of equipment.

The  Community  has also  agreed  to  consider financing a section of the road between Isiolo and Marsabit,  following the  updating of the said design.

P.G.

Apologise  first.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT  MINISTER,  OFFICE  OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT  AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE 	(Mr.  Keah): 	I  was  going  to  do  that,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and hon.  Members need  not  shout. I  beg  to  reply, but  before  I  do so,  I would like to apologise to hon. Members  for coming in a couple of seconds after the hon.  Member had asked his Question.Customs  officials  are  empowered  under the Customs and Excise Act tostop,  board  and  search any vehicle or person within Kenya,  and may examine goodscarried  by  such  person or vehicle for  the purpose of enforcement of the provisionsof  the  Act. Customs  officers do not,  therefore,  require the presence of the police  to  operate  road  blocks  for .this  purpose,  but,  should  there  be additional protection  required,  they  can  then  seek the  assistance  of the  police. Secondly,  customs  officers  from Shimoni  Customs Station and other sections  of  the  department periodically operate  road blocks at Milalani/Kikoneni junction,  Mwisho wa Shamba and Ganja  la Simba,  in Kinondoni  Location,  in order to  intercept  smugglers  using  unauthorised  panya route entry points along the adjacent coastline  for  illegal  importation of goods  into Kenya from neighbouring countries.	The  above  places  are  junctions  of roads  leading from coastal  villagesand  the  main Mombasa-Lunga Lunga Road.	These  road  blocks  have resulted  inseizure  by customs  officers of goods  being  illegally  imported  into Kenya or	exported  from Kenya,  and  the  arrest and prosecution of the culprits.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MWAMZANDI: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  arising from  the Assistant Minister's reply,   I  am  sure  that the  idea of these road blocks  is  to intercept illegal goods. So,  information must be  given that a vehicle  is coming with certain smuggled goods. Could  the  Assistant Minister tell  this House why these road blocks should be permanent  from  Saturday  to Friday,-from January to December,  in that area?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR.  KEAH: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if we  have reasons to believe that these  illegal  panya routes  are  likely  to carry  the kind of traffic we are trying to  stop,  my office  has every right to man and lay traps,  such as road blocks, from January  to December.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MAKHANU:	Thank you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.	Arising from theAssistant Minister's reply, I appreciate that customs officers can set up roadblocks  and prosecute culprits.	However,  would he agree with me  that theGovernment is  doing double work here?	Instead  of customs officials arrestingthe  culprits  and handing them over to the police for possible prosecution, why  would  the  Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance not allow the  Kenya Police  to work alongside customs officials at that road block?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  KEAH:   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  could the hon.  Member repeat his question?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  MAKHANU:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  here  is  a  situation  where customsofficials  man  a  road  block  alone.	We  are  arguing  that  it  would  be  better forthese  officials  to work  alongside  the  police,  instead  of the officials  doing the  job  alone  and  looking  for  the  police  later  to prosecute  the culprits. Could  these  officials  and  the  police  not  work jointly  to easen the work?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  KEAH: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  they very often work jointly where  it is necessary,  but Customs  officers have,  on  their own right,  the power to work on their  own without  the police.	However,  as  I  have  stated,  the two teams very oftenwork hand-in-hand.	The Customs  officials  also. work together with other interesteddepartments within  the  Government.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR.  MISOI:	Mr.  Speaker, Sir,  I  believe that smuggling  is not confinedto  this  locality  alone.	Can  the Assistant Minister tell the House how many otherroad  blocks  in Kenya are manned by  Customs  officials?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  KEAH: 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that question should be put in a substantial manner  so  that we  can get  the  hon.  Member  the relevant statistics.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  KAMUYU: 	Mr.  Speaker, Sir,  I  heard the Assistant Minister referring to some routes as panya routes..  By  implication,  the term panya routes means that there  are  a lot of  illegal practices going on. Can  the  Assistant Minister change his  attitude  now,  so  that according with the  requirements of this Question,  both Customs officials  and the police work together in order to completely block these panya routes?</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON.  MEMBER: Say yes! Say yes!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  KEAH: No,   I  cannot say yes. I  do not understand  the rationalebehind that question because  if this House passed the Customs and Excise Act empowering or giving authority  to Customs officers to operate as they do at the moment. Why  can  they not change their mind and amend the Act? The Customs officers work  in accordance with the Customs and Excise Act and,  therefore,  I do not see what doubts hon.  Members have. I  did clearly  say  that where  it  is  considered absolutely necessary  that extra protection is required, the Customs officers do  ask  the  police  to work with them.</Newspeech>4 <Newspeech>MR.  KAMUYU: 	On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 	The Assistant Minister  is clearly misleading this House because if those are panya routes,  then they require police surveillance all the  time.

MWAMZANDI:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the purpose of asking this Questionis  that  Customs Officials who operate road blocks do not operate them for the benefit of the Government but,  rather,  for their corrupt interests.	That  is why they do not want to work with  the  police.	If the Assistant Minister is sure that the Customs  officials are working  for the  interest of the Government,  can he tell this House  how many  cases have. been referred to the police by Customs officials and how many  tusks  have  been sent  to Customs warehouses?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT  MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL  DEVELOPMENT 	(Mr.  Ogle): On  a point of order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.

MWAMZANDI:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I said that since Customs officialsdo not operate  road blocks in good faith but,  rather,  for corrupt purposes,  that is  why  they do not want to work with the police.

Under the  circumstances, unless the  hon.

That  is  in  the  interest of the country.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  KILIKU:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  could  the Assistant Minister deny orconfirm  that  these officers are not corrupt?

The plaintiff claims damages under fatal accidents Act Cap.32 of the Laws of Kenya, arising from a road accident  along Nairobi-Naivasha Road on 13th November, 1977. 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  suit was filed on 7th October, 1980 and witnesses were heard up to  June, 1986 after which: it was adjourned and advocates were to  take fresh dates in September, 1986, which they did not. On _1st February, 1988,  the matter re-surfaced but it was stood over by consent of the  advocates as the police filed which contained the sketch plan and the police abstract was missing. Again when it came up on 25th April, 1988,  it was  stood over generally by consent. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is now for the  advocates to take fresh dates and move to  the  court.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KINYANJUT: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  I thank the Assistant Minister for that  reply,  I would like to take this matter very seriously.   I am saying this because here  is a lady who has been misled by her lawyers since 1980 and as the  Assistant Minister has said, this case has not been heard up to now.  Would the Assistant Minister assure this House this lady is going to be  protected.  As I am talking in his House now, there are marry cases of this nature which have been Pending for years and I think the people   concerned should be protected. In these cases, the lawyerd on both sides come to a certain agreement and decide not to tell the client what is happening. Would the Assistant Minister tell this House whether the lawyers of this client have been paid any money by the defendant?</Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, records on the court file do not indicate that  any money has been paid through any of the advocates. In fact,  evidence of such payments,  is only indicated in the client's file with the lawyers and not  in the court file.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KINYANJUI:  Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  it is normal for lawyers to demand money from the client, but I have never heard of a case where a lawyer, acting on behalf of a client,  advances his client with money. 	I would like the Assistant Minister-to tell this House why these particular lawyers decide to advance this client a sum of Shs.5,500/-.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR.

KAMUYU: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  ten years is a long time for a poor defendant for this to wait.

GODANA: Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  I referred to the police file missing, something which caused the advocate to stand over the case over a year ago. I said it is now up to the lawyers to seek for fresh dates and move to the court. 	It is not  for  the Attorney-General to know whether or not  the police file is now available.   That is another Ministry's responsibility.  It is not the responsibility of the Attorney-General to look for these documents. This  is a civil case and it  is therefore up to the lawyers to take their initiative and look for the  documents,  and if there are any complaint's to make,  there are appropriate procedures within the High Court Registry to follow.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

If things continue like that I am sure that  nothing  will/Come out of the case. How is  the Attorney-General, as  the dm custodian of the  law of this country defend a poor client like in this case?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. GODANA:  Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I think the hon.

This is most unusual and I am sure the z hon. Members who are lawyers in this House will agree with me.

My point  of order is in connection with a story Which appears in today’s  issue  of the Daily Nation:   On page three,  there.-is  a story with the heading "Bunyala Kanu Row Continues Unabated."	The newspaper goes  on to  say that the Kanu flag at the Kanu office was lowered by the  Chief and that I had instructed the Chief to do so.   This  statement  is not  entirely true.   This is because first  of all I have no authority to give  instructions to the chiefs.   That is the work of the  district administration. I cannot instruct a chief in any way:  Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  there was no Kanu flag at  the Kanu officer' The position is that  this gentleman flies a party flag at his private  home. So, the Chief gave  instructions that the party flag can only fly at the part offices and not at a person’s private home:   When the gentleman refused to obey, then the Chief removed the party flag from the private home  of the  gentleman and teak it to the party offices. The chief was doing the right thing Subsequently, the	gentleman hoisted another Kanu flag at his private home  and the  Chief once again ..  .   went to the gentleman’s home  and uprooted the  flag post  and took it to 	Kanu office.   The  Chief was doing .the correct thing and I did not instruct him to do  so. He was doing it because the locational committee had complained to him about this irregularity.1   So, the Chief was doing the  correct thing and the Kanu Chairman of the Sub-Location was  irregular in what he was doing.   I thought I should make  this point very clear so that the matter does not continue being cloudy the way it  is now. Thank you,  Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

Members  of Parliament and staff:   As  I am talking some part of Parliament Buildings are peeling off and some pieces of debris falling from the buildings are dangerous to human beings coning into the buildings: In fact,  one  gate has been closed because  of thatand  action should be  taken,  and taken very fast.   This is because  a leader  of a our calibre can easily lose his life:Mr.   Speaker,  Sir, as  I am talking :new,  there are  some old wall clocks  here which I think were  operating during the Legco days:   However,  they are not  operating now and this gives a bad impression and	a bad picture  of this  august House to visitors who come here;   There  are	wall  clocks in the Dining gall and in the Lounge which do not  function:   Even the Tow Clock does not function properly:   Probably as  I am speaking here  only the Chamber clock isshowing the  approximate time	But the  other wall clocks  are not functioning and  something should be done about themMr. Speaker,  Sir,  also hon. Members are having it   roughhere  because they are  conducting   their constituencies business through a call box in this House. The telephones here are not working:   In fact,  no single Member of Parliament has  access to the  direct  telephone  code,  even within Kenya;  even those ones which are within the  intercom do not  function. You can ring up the Exchange  for  several hours without receiving any reply.  Mr.   Speaker,  Sir,  you will also find that most  of our constituents  out  in the rural areas cannot get access to us. It  is difficult to get the National Assembly number:   Therefore,  something must be done  about  this matter because we  feel that we are not being treated very fairly.   Some  of us have  got better facilities  outside this Parliament. But we  expect to have  a higher  standard  of maintenance  of facilities in the National Assembly even the general maintenance  of the  buildings:   The general maintenance  of buildings,  toilets  and so on   is not to the required standard:   So,  I am raising this  matter because  this  august  House  has its  own select  committees:   The Public Accounts  Committee  is  one  of those Committees We  have  been very keen on seeing that there  is proper utilisation of  funds  in various Ministries:   But you will find that when it comes to  ourselves here,  we  are treated to these  sub-standard' services:   I do not know whether this is due to misuse  of funds  or lack  of adequate  funds.   But we must be  given an explanation I have not mentioned something like  catering facilities food services The  food  served here  is pathetic:   Some  of us prefer going to  eat  outside  instead  of eating here. So,  something must be done about this one   When I mention these things  I am not Touching on the ability of probably the  junior officers who  are working in the  National  Assembly.   But they have to work within a certain system I am only complaining about the standard of services  in the  National  Assembly:   I am saying that the  stadards  of all these  services must be raised because we  cannot be  treated to these sub-standard services because we did not come here to live  on sub-standard  services</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

You  might  km  read  articles  in  the  newspapers  where  the clergymen are condemningpoliticians  and  civil  servants.

If  there  is  a  corrupt  highranking officer,  it  is  better  to  come  out  say,	“so-and-so is  corrupt”, rather than  to  condemn people  generally.

Members  are  talking loudly and therefore,  we  cannot  hear  well.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  MINISTER  FOR  LANDS  AND  HOUSING(Mr.  Mbela):	Thankyou,  Mr.   Speaker,   Sir.Sir,   it  is not therefore  the  wish  of  the  Government  to  acquireprivate  property arbitrary or  unnecessarily. It is only  in  the  case of urgent need  and  in  the public  interest  that  the  Government  would invoke the  provisions  of  the  Act pertaining to the compulsory acquisition  of  land  or  any other  property. Whenever  such  a  thing has  to  be  done,  it  is  for  the  interest  of  national  development and  security  as  the  case  may  be. The  Government  is  committed  to enhancing  the  quality of  life  of  every.  citizen  in  this  country. As you already know,  the people of  this country look upon the  Government  to  provide  those  services  which  will  assist  in improving  their  ways  of  life. 	In   order  to  fulfill  the  public expectations  for  better  health,   schools,  roads and other  social ammenities  for  better  standards  of living, land has	to  be made  available,   through  acquisition as_provided  in  the  law.Sir,   in providing  the  required  services,  the  Government tries  as  much  as  possible  to  strike a  balance  between  the  publicdevelopment  needs  and  the  private  property  rights,  so  as to  ensurethat  a  fair  play  is  done,  by paying  adequate  compensation  for  theacquired  land  or  property. Sir,   Parliament  through  the enactment  of  Land  Acquisition  Act,   Cap.	295,   of	1968,   granted the  Minister  powers  of  compulsory acquisition  of  land for  the development  of  public  projects  for  national  development. Under Section 	6,  the Act provides that notice be given before such acquisition.is  effected.  Under Section 8 and also Section 13, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  the Act  protides  that  full and prompt compensation is to  be  raid to the  parties  interested in the  land acquired. It is  the  Government policy to  amend  and upgrade  all  our laws  from time  to  time to conform with the  changing social .and economic  situations  in the  country. The main objects  and reasons for the proposed amendments are  to  improve  on  the  admiristration of the  Act  for the  benefit  of wananchi;  Specifically,  the  objects and reasons  are  as  follows:-1.	To  ensure  prompt payment of compensatign and  settlementof disputes  on compensation for land compulsorily acquired. The amendment  intends  to  establish a Compensation Tribunal comprisimg of  an Advocate,  as  the  Chairman,  and two  Registered Valuers  as members.	The  Tribunal will have powers to hear and deterhinedisputes  on award of compensation. A party which is  dissatisfiedwith the  decision of the Triburnal  will have  the  right  of  appeal  to the  High Court  of Kenya. 2. The  amerament  intends  to  set  a time  limit of 	24 months  and 60 days within which the process of acquisition must be  completed, otherwise  it will be  considered  "abandoned". 3. 	The  amendment  intends to make  provision under which the owner of  the  plant  or machinery on land compulsorily acquired Will be  allowed to remove  the  plant  or machinery unless  such equipment is  required .for the purpose  of which it is to  be  compulsorily acquired. Lastly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the proposed amendment intends to remove the fixed"  percentage  interest payable under Section 	16  on delayed awards  of compensation. The  rates will now be  prescribed by the Minister from time  to  time,deoending on the prevailing economic factors  and circumstances. 	This  is necessary because of  the inflationary trends  that we have  become accumstomed to.  In 1968,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  prevailing rate  of interest was 6 per cent compared to the current bank rate of 15 pet cent. 	The  main purpose  of the  amendment Bill  is to  speedup the adminisLration of the  existing Act and to make  it more  efficient, and beneficial  to  the  land  owners..  I would like to take  this opportunity to assure  hon. Members that the proposed amendment Bill  will not contradict  in any way the  Constitutional provisions as regards the  right  of  ownership  of property,  and that  these provisions will  continue  to  be  observed. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  enactment  of the  proposed Bill will involve  additional  expenditure of public funds which should be provided for in the  annual   estimates. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those  few remarks,  I beg to move.</Newspeech><Newspeech>	THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Kr.  Muli): Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to  second the  Bill  before  the  House. As we know, under the Constitution,  the property of a person should  not be  taken-away without adequate  compensation for that piece  of land  or property.	Now,  it becomes necessary in the admimistration of land that  a particular piece  of land belonging to  anIndividual may become necessary for useby the public  generally.  In such a case,  you will  find  that it  is not  in the  interest  of that  one individual to  continue holding that piece  of laria to thedetriment,  or rather,  to  the  prejudice  of  other persons generally in which case  the  Government may come  to  a concluSion that a piece of land  owned by an individual  should now be  acquired to benefitthe  public  generally.	Now, that will not be construed to be contrary to  the  provisions  of the  Constitution.The  Constitution is very explit  on this matter.	It  says that  any Property that  is taken by the  Government must be compensated  for. We have no  provision or even intention that the Government  should take  things  and nationalise them   and deny the owners  of  their legal  rights without- commensation. So,  having come  tothat  conclusion,  there  is  in existence  a very old Act of Parliament  called the  Land Compensation Act,  and in this Act,  the Commissioner of Lands  assesses the piece  of land.	First  of all,he  advertises, on behalf of the Government, the piece of land intended to  be  taken from an individual for the  benefit of marly; and having gazetted it,  he  proceeds  to  hold  an inquiry in order to  give  compensation to  the  indiVidilal   so  deprived of that piece of land. 	Now,  it  is  at that  stage where  the  compensation is to be given where  a lot  of problems and dissatisfaction have  taken place because  the  assessment  time  and the  payment  of the compensation take very long  time;  say,  even years,  after the  lend  has been occupied  public  land  before  the  land is  gazetted. Also, when the  compensation is  giten,  there  is  also another  "lag"  or lack of time whereby the  person  so  compensated is required to  go to  the High Court  of Kenya to challenge the compensation that has  been given by the CommiSsioner of Lands. That,  again,  takes  a lot  of  time  because  the  High Court procedures  are  rigid in their 	own way.	By  the  time  you actually  "hear"  the appeal_against the 	award  of compensation,  it may take  a lot  of time, say, even years, and  the  person so  deprived may have nothing to benefit from his land which has  been thus  acquired by the  Government for the public utility.We  have  come up with this amendment, Mr. Speaker   Sir	totry to  find  out a shorter method whereby a person from whom land was  taken is compensated auickly or speedly and adequately. 	The  principle  of  "speedy  settlement  and payment of commensation" 	is  the   principle  behind this  amendment. So,  what will  happen,  if 	this  amendment  is passed,  is  that as soon as the Commissioner has awarded compensation,  if that compensation is not found by the land  owner to be  sufficient or equitable,  the land owner will  now have a right,  not directly to the High Court of Kenya,  but to a Tribunal that is being set under the  new Bill. 1_7  It is  a  tribunal  that will be presided over by an appointed  lawyer  of good standing with two valuersLassessors  and a presiding chairman. We  expect at that stage  a lot of disputes over compensation as awarded by the commissioners to be eliminated.	This  is  because the valuers  know more about such issues than a judge of the  High Court.	If such an  issue  is sent to the High Court,  the judge of the High Court may  say:  "I  better send this matter to some assessors who will bring me a report". This  is  because  he  is  not a technical man on valuation. So  we  think that the tribunal  presided over by that  lawyer of good standing with the valuers will easily come up to  a point where that award of settlement can be adjusted. If they agree  with the  aggrieved person and they  find out that the award   was too  long, they farm will  have  a right  to  direct  the commission to  pay  that higher compensation  as  it would deem adequate or  eauitable  for  the  purpose  of that particular compensation. So,  we  are  asking the  House  to endorse  that  principle of creation of a tribunal which we think will'be speedier as  it will settle these disputes  quicker: settlement will  be  reached and the owner of the  land  will  be  compensated speedlyand adequately. That  is  the  principle  of speedy  settlement and adequate compensation.	So  that tribunal  is  called  for  under the new amendment. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  those  who will  be  aggrieved   in the rare event of agreement not  being reached amicably  at  the  tribunal  stage   will  have  the right  on points  of  law only to go  to  the  High Court and Court of Appeal.	But  at  that stage  matters  of points  of facts on valuation will have been determined at the tribunal  stage. So,   it  is  an Act where we have  brought a reform which will benefit  our  people  and will  facilitate matters  affecting our  citizens  versus  the Government. We  do not  feel  that  it  is  fair to continue  with  delayed.settlements when  the  owner  of the  land has  been  deprived of  it andtis  now in the occupation of the  public  as  a public  land. That  we  cannot  accept  because  it  is  tantamount  to what  we might call acquisition. We have  no, provisions  for acquisition.  Everybody's property is protected bythe Constitutionand iftaken.it must be with adequate and speedy  compensation. That is  the principle we are advocating.  The  other point that was not provided for,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  under the existing Act which was mentioned by the Minister and one which I would like to emphasise on because  it has  been giving a lot of problems and inequities at certain quarters  It mill  become necessary.as  it hasbeen thepast that a piece of land intended  to  be  taken or  acquired by the commission 	(to acquire  in  English means  to take  or  hold  as  one's  own)  which improvements and other developments like  houses,  dams and  commercial  buildings  he will  have to compensate for these 	utilities.	This  is  because  in the past the  commissioner was not empowered to consider such utilities.	The  law was  thus  silent on  this  issue. So  it  becomes necessary  to  think  whether  the  law was  equitable  or, just  in taking a piece of land  knowing very well  that there have  been  developments  on  it and fail  to  compensate the owner  for them. That  is  inequitable and unjust. So  we  are  seeking the  approval of the  House  to  seal that  loophole so that the owner of such a land can  be compensated. In  this  case  the  commissioner  will  wdarbe  required to  serve a  notice  to the  owner  telling him  to remove  his  property  from  the  land that  they require  or required by the  public.  The owner  in such a case may willingly agree to  remove his movable property at his own expense,  but what about where  it is impossible  to remove  the  developments,  machinery  and  such  like  things  which  are inherent or a feature  of that land? In such  a  case  then the  commissioner  will  be bound to  consider  those  plants,  machinery and developments. He will either  allow the owinr to remove them or compensate him for those that cannot be removed. Since  land  is  very valuable, we have to be quite careful even in planning, not to  allow particularly  in  towns  all  space  to go  to individuals.  We must  look ahead in future to know where we are going and What we need to avoid a lot of disputes where the owner of the  property is deprived of his property so legally through the Acquisiton Act and the Constitution. Such  cases  are more painful when such landowners have no   other pieces of land. So we  plan to  look ahead in  future when setting up schools.,  playgrounds and hospitals.	But when there are no  alternatives,  then acquisition of land will  take place,  but  I would like to  inform  the  House  that the Government does not  just acquire land for the sake  of  it  or acquire to sub-divide  to friends. No, the  Goverment  does  not do that. The  Government  is  our  father  and  mother which means  that  it  cannot do that. It will  only take  a piece  of land from an  individual  for  the purpose  of  the public use and on such cases  it will give compensation. 	With  these  few remarks,  I  beg to second.</Newspeech>(Question  proposed) <Newspeech>MR.

Mbela who  is a dynamic Minister. ES has brought this Bill at  the right time and I would like  to thank the Attorney-General for enlightening the House on its contents.  I would like to say that  this Bill should have been trough to this hon.  House two decades ago.	We  were worried because ane did not know hisposition once his land had been taken away nor assured of any protection-.This Bill has come at the right time and I would like to tell the Minister that  since we have been waitir," for   a long time, 	as soon as it is passed, its contents should be   worked upon and implemented immediately, as the Attorney-General has just said. The other day I went to the Ministry of Lands and Housing and found that there are so many title deeds which are awaiting collection by the owners. 	I would like to appeal to the hon. Members of this House to appeal to wananchi and tell them to collect their title deeds whichgwaiting collection at the Ministry.   The sooner those title deeds are claimed,  the better. 	This is because the Minister has been appealing to the owners 	he even mentioned   the names of the districts concerned to collect the title deeds but they are still lying at  the Ministry. Hon.  Madbubuti mentioned Lan District and I do not know whether it  is one of the districts whose title deeds are lying at the Ministry. 	We are happy because  the Minister promised the nation that he was going to work out a programme with regard to the issuance of title deeds.</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION (Mr. Mury) :  So,  it is up to  hon; Member to  tell wananchi  to come  forward and collect  their title  deeds: 	It  is good that  the Attorney-General has explained that  land is very important While  here we  talk of acres  of  land,  in countries like  Japan,. Britain and so  on, they talk of inches  of land;   This  shows that land is very important: Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  I therefore,  thank the Minister for having introduced this Bill here. I would like to appeal to him to  ensure  that  as  soon as the  Bill is  passed by this House,  it is implemented: With those  few remarks,  I beg to support;</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  WABUGE: 	Thank you very much,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, for giving me  this  opportunity to  also make  a few remarks  on this Bill. Acquisition of Tana  is  a constitutional matter:   I know that the provision for  land acquisition was included in our Constitution every country in the world ha such a provision in its  constitution so  that whenever there  is need to acquire land for public utility, the Government does  not find it  diffidult to do so. That is why it was found fitting at  Independence  to 	  	make  such a provision in our Constitution. I would like  to  say that acquisition of land is in the interests  of the  public.   This is because  such land is  acquired for development  of A-facility like  a hospital or industry that benefits the whole  country and  not  an individual. I would,  however,  like  to refer to Clause  3'6A:(2); which states:-"Where  the Commissioner notifies the  person interested that the  plant  and machinery may be  severed and removedjthe  person interested shall sever and remove  them at 	own expense …" Now the  question here  arises in connection with "at his own exmense". I  ask the Attorney-General to focus his mind in Kangundo  and he will  See what may happen to an old man there who has spent all his time putting up  something on his  piece of land,  for example machinery or a plant, only for the  Government to  come round and say it wants to acquire that  land and ask that poor man in Kangundo  to remove the  machinery or plant  on it  at his  own expense. Surely,  I feel that  this is too much in the  sense  that evendf the man has been compensated; the amount  of compensation will be  used up in the removal of the machinery or plant and this will leave  the  poor man with nothing with which to ac wire  another piece  of land to  live  in. It is not fair for somebody, who is being disturbed in the  public interest, to be  told to amor remove whatever is in his land at his own expense 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I think it is m only fair for  the Minister to  considerm .paying:Something to  somebody who has voluntarily moved out  of land for removal of plant  or machinery from that piece  of land.   The way the  clause is now leaves  a lot to be  desired, it requires somebody to spend the little amount of compensation he will be  paid in removing machinery from his  land. I urge  the Attorney-General and the Minister to introduce  an amendment too this clause at 	Committee  Stage  to enable  such a person to move  out  of his  land without incurring extra expenditure: The  same  clause  further  says:-	and the  plant  and machinery shall not be included in the  computation of the compensation payable under this Act": Mr. Speaker,  you can now see what my worry is. While  plant and machinery will not be  included in computation of compensation payable  under the Act; the Act will require  the  owner  of the  land to remove  the  same  at his  own expense: I find this unfair;  I feel that fair compensation should be paid and disturbance should also be  taken into  account.   This is because  somebody of my age will have stayed on a piece  of land for over 60 years and it is  wrong to tell me to move out of my land  and that whatever development	 may have done is not going to be  considered for compensation; Mr. Speaker,  Sir, I remember the time when we were discussing our Constitution:   We had white settlers whom we wanted to move  out  so that wananchl could  occupay the land. The whites demanded compensations for the 	development they had effected on the land and we agreed to compensate them for	 it. How come now that we are talking of acquiring land from a fellow African without paying compensation for machinery or plant that may la be on that piede  of land. I feel that it is unfair for an African Government that paid whites for development of land to now tell an African. That he will not be compensated for whatever development he has done on which is being acquired by the Government	. The Attorney-General and the Minister should ensure that the owner of any land that has to be acquired in the public interest is compensated for the land; develoument  on the land and disturbance  so that he will move out of his land comfortably, acquire another piece of land and settle down again without any inconvenience.  In  moving  on,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  notice  that  clause 	4  of  the  Bill says:-"Section 	9  of  the  principal  Act  is  amended---(a)	in  subsectiori	(1)	, by  deleting  the  words"not earlier  than  twenty-one  days"  and  inserting "not  earlier  than  thirty  days  and  not  later  than twelve  months". We  are  dealing  with a human being here,  who has  been  living on  a certain piece of  land  for a certain amount of  time.   If Wabuge,  who  is  over 60 years  old,  has been  living on  that  land  and  when  it  comes  to  acquisition of  the  land,  I  am told that  I  have  to  shift  within  a  period  not  later than 30  days,   I  think  we  should be  very  considerate.	This  is  a Government  of the  people,  by  the  people  and  forthe  people.	The  people  who  are  being asked  to  vacate  this  land  have  been  therefor  all  their  lives,  and  now  they  are being  told  to  move  out  within 30  days. This  period  used  to  be  not  later  than 21  days. 	I  feel  that  we  should give  our people  a  reasonable  amount  of  time  to  move  so  that  a  person  and  his  family  may. make  plans  as  to  where  they  are  going next.	It  is  very  difficult  in  Kenya  todayfor  someone  to  move  into  a  new  place  easily  and  settle  there.	So,  I  feel  thatthe  Government  should give  a reasonable  period  in this  regard,  and  that when  a person moves  into  a new  place,  he  should get some assistance.	Perhaps,  theGovernment  could  say,  "Look.	We  are  moving you,  and  we have  allocated you  thatplace.	Please,  use  the money  we  gave you  to  buy  this  piece  of land  so  that youmay  live  here."	If you  merely  tell  mwananchi,  "Here  is Shs.l  million. Have  itand go  to  look  for  new  land",  where  will  he  look  for  it?	In  the  case  of myfriend  over  there,  who  is  a Maasai,  he may  have  four or five wives and many children  in  his  manyatta.	How will  he  move  out with all  his wives and childrenwithin	30  days?	I  think  we  are  not  being fair  or considerate  here,  and  I  urgethe  Minister  to  be considerate enough  to ensure  that when somebody has been asked  to  move  out  of  a certain  piece  of land  and has  been paid compensation,  he is  given an  ample opportunity to-do so. He  should not merely be  left alone;  the Government  should  assist  him  by  showing him a new piece of land to buy with  the  money  that the  Government  has  paid  him.	I  think  this  will  be good  to  wananchi,and  I  request  the  Ministen to  be  very  serious  on  the  issue because we should not mess  up  people's lives  by  throwing  people out of their land just like  that. 	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,   looking  at  clause 5   I  am moving very  fast because I  know  that  other hon.  Members  would  also  like  to speak 	I  notice  that  it says:-"Section 	16  of  the  principal  Act  is  amended  in. subsections 	(1)  and 	(2)  by  deleting the  expression "the  rate  of  six per  cent  per annum"  and  inseting the expression  "such  rate  s  may  be  prescribed" Who  will  prescribe  this  rate? 	It  may,  perhaps,  be  the  Minister,  the  Permanent Secretary  or  the  Commissioner,  and  he  will  do  it at his own will,  which will very much depend  on  the  mood  in which he  will  have  come  up  from his  house to  the  office at  that  time  deciding. The  clause  goes  on  to  say:-" 	which  shall  not  be  less  than  six  per  cent per  annum." Six  per  cent  now,  with  the  present  inflation,  currency  and  "clove" 	(?)  economy, is  chicken  feed.

WABUGE: 	I  am  addressing  the  Chair,  and  I  wish you  look  at me when  I  am  talking. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  rate  to  be  prescribed,  which shall  not be  less than six  per cent  per annum,  needs  rethinking about,  because at present  inflation is  very high and  the  value  of our money is almost nothing. I  agree  that  six  per cent  is  nothing,  and  my  argument  is  that this  rate should be prescribed as per the  current rates  of  interest. What  is  the  rate  of interest at the  present moment? If you  go  to  the  Agricultural Finance Corporation,  you will  find that  it  is 14  per cent.	In  banks,  this  rate  is 18  per cent,  and  at  the  N.I.C.(?),  it is 19 per  cent. The  Bill  talks  of not  less  than  six  per cent. Why  does  it not say that  this  rate  will  be  determined  at  the current rates of interest?</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN  HON.  MEMBER:	How much  are  they?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  WABUGE: What  is  it  now,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir?

(?).After  all,  what we  are doing is commercial  in that when you acquire a piece  of land-for  somebody,  this  is  a commercial deal. 	Therefore,  the  rate of  interest mentioned  in  the  Bill  should be a commercial rate and in line with the  prevailing commercial rates. This  is  the  point  I  am  trying to  put to my friend,  the Minister.  To say  that this rate will not be less than six per cent is  not  enough. It  should  be</Newspeech>[Mr.  Speaker  left  the Chair][Mr. Deputy Speaker took the Chair]  <Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT  MINISTER  FOR  EDUCATION(Mr.  Karauri):	On  a  point of  order,  Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir.

DEPUTY SPEAKER: 	I  am afraid that  I am not looking at the Bill myself,  but  I  think you can proceed so lohg as4yOu take cognisance of that point of order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  WABUGE:	Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  what I am saying  is  that the rates should  be  equivalent  to  the current commercial bank rates at any given time.	I  amsaying  that because when you are acquiring people's land, you may have the intention of making that land commercial:, may be you are acquiring that land for the purposes of putting up a factory or something bigger. That  is  why  I  am  insisting that whatever  interest rate  that  is to be charged should be equivalent to the existing commercial  bank rates. Mr.  Deputy. Speaker,  when you are moving somebody a lot of things happen in  the  sense  that our people And  I  have  seen this.  For  example,.  I  know that people's  land was  taken for public  interest when the Webuye Paper Mill or when Nzoia Sugar Company were being established.  I  know of people whose alnd was acquired for public  utility and they were given money,  but up  to now some of those people  are destitutes. They have gone  looking for land to buy with the money they were  given but  all  in vain;  the money  they were paid is completely diminished and they  are now destitutes who  cannot even educate their children. They  do not have anywhere  to  settle and,  therefore, live along roads.	That  is  why  I  am  saying  that when  a piece  of land belonging to  individuals  is acquired,  the Government should taken  an  interest of ensuring  that such people are given alternative settlement. That way,  they  can  use  the money they are paid to buy  the alternative land. If that had been done when people were moved from Nzoia and Webuye,  they would be haVing  some  settlement  somewhere. When  the Government  is dealing with  the  lives of wananchi,  that-matter  should  be  given a lot of seriousness.   After all, people should  lead decent lives.	It does not reflect well  on the. Government when  it acquires  a persons  land  and  that person  is rendered a destitute. It  is  the  duty of the Government to ensure  that whenever people's land is taken away for public  utility  those people  are properly  looked after and given alternative.settlement. 	With  those  few  remarks,  Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to support the Bill.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT  MINISTER FOR  INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING-(Mr.  Nassir):  Bw.

Nawataka waandishi wa habari  walioko hapa wawafaha'nishe wananchi wa Kenya kwamba Serikali  Ina  imani  nao na haina dhamira ya kuwafanya ng'ombe au punda. Imahi ya Serikali ya Mtukufu Rais ni.kuwatumikia wananchi wa Kenya kwa dhati,  na hiyo  ndiyo  sababu yao kutuchagua kuja katika Bunge hili. Bw.

Ni lazima Sheria ya Kenya iwe wazi kabisa kuhusu ardhi ya Serikali inayopewa wananchi. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu hakuna mtu Peyote anayenatiwa ardhi ya Serikali,  ana kibali cha kuiuza hiyo ardhi.   Vile vile,  ni lazima ardhf hii  ipatiwe mwananchf wa Kenya na si mgen1. Nasema hivyo kwa sabalnininafahamu wazi kwamba kuna wageni  aroao wanauziwa ardhi hapa Nairobi,  lakini ningetaka kuwaonya wasidhubutu kuja katika sehemu ya Mombasa.   Katika sehemu ya Mombasa ile kpffinti ya Maendeleo ya Mambasa ipewe mamlaka ya kulichungua jambo hill, na kuNatam'cua wale wananchi wasio na ard1-11,  ill wapewe ardhi ya Serikali..  Bw Naibu Spika,  ni mmk jambo muhimu kila mtu kuwa na makao na hili jambo linaungwa nkono ulimwengu mzima. 	Kwa bavyo,  ni  lazima watu wetu ambao hawana makao, 	 aratiwe haraka.   Tunafahamu kwamba Serikali ina wadibu wa kutoa huduma kwa wananchi,  na inanofanya 	moo,  wakati.mwingine inachukuaardhi ya kujenga miradi ya aina mbali mbali.   Lakini,  ni lazima Serikali  ifahamu wazi kwamba kuna wananchi wengine ambao hawana hata nahali pa kujenga nyymba.   Vile vile,  kuna wananchi wengine ambao wamekaa katika ardhi ya Serikali kwa miaka mingi.  imgex Lingekuwa jambo la busara kama serikali ingekata sehemu ya ardhi hii na kuwagawia   watu kam hawa. Katika sta. 	sehemu ya Lamu, kuna ardhi ambayo imetengwa kwa ujenzi wa viyandi iii  watu wapate kazi.   Vile vile, kuna ardhi ya aina hii katikaMombasa,  Nairobi na kadhalika. 	Ikiwa kuna watu binafsi ambao wangetaka kujenga viwanda,  ingefaa kama watu hawa wangepatiwa-ardhi hii haraka iwezekanavyo,  iii wamapojenga viwanda hivyo,  watu wetu waweze kupata kazi. Hata mgeni akiingia leo na kusema kwamba,"ningetaka kuanzisha kiwanda,  na nina mashine za kufanya kazi aMbazo  zitawanatia kazi watu 100", bast ingefaa aoatiwe ardhi ya kujenga. Ni lazima sisi katika Kenya tuendelee kuyapatia moyo wagenl  ambao wangeoenda kuanzisha viwanda hapa Kenya ili  tuweze kupata nesa za kigeni na pia kazi kwa watu wetu. Ni kwa ni ni mpaka leo Serikali haijatoa ardhi kwa watu binafsi wanacpenda imiOmm kujenga viwanda?   Hatutaki wanacpenda kuanzisha viwanda vyao binafsi  wazuiliwe kufanya hivyo.  Pengine wengine wao. wangependa kuanzisha viwanda vya samaki na kadhalika. Tungetaka wapewe ardhi  mara raja iii waweze kuwasaidia watu wetu. Bw Naibu Spika,  sisi  sote katika 3unge leo tunayo furaha kubwa kwa mi- kuona Mswada huu mbele ya Bunge.   Mswada huu una maana sana kwetu kwa sababu unawatia moyo watu wa Kenya. 	Ikiwa mhe.  Nassir amekuwa na sehemu ya ardhi na hajaitumia ile ardhi kwa muda wa miaka 50, ni lazima apokonywe ardhi hiyo na kuipatia wasio na ardhi.	Nasena hivyo kwa sababu mtu kama yeye niadui ya Kenya.	Kuna watu Fulani katika sehemu ya pwani ambao wamekaliaardhi kwa miaka mingi  sana na hawayalimi mashamba hay, bali wanayatumia to kwa kupata mikono katika benki iii. kuweze kuyalima mashaMba yao mengine ya trphaws.-.  wasinichezee kwa sababu ninaweza kuroboka maneno. Ningetaka kuiomba Serikali vile vile iwasaidie watu katika jambo hili.   Niggetakailkuwaogya wale xzgaakovicismemakx ambao  si  Wabunge warryamaze kwa sababu sisi kama Wabunge tunafagya tuwezavyo ili kuwasaidia wananchi wetu. Kwa hayo machache,  naunga mkono.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT  MINISTER FOR EDUCATION	(Mr. Karauri):  Thank you very much,  Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  for allowing me  to  contributeto  this Among the reasons  given by the Minister for bringing these  amendments  is to  ensure prompt payment  of compensation and prompt  settlement of disputes arising from lance  that has been acquired by the  Government:   I think this  is  a very good move:   The minister has done  a good thing to brine an amendment  to the  former Act  so  that wananchl  are  paid  compensation on time. Mr. Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  where the construction ofroads  is concerned,  wananchi have  suffered  Quite  a lot.   I have examples. You will  find that where  a road  is being constructed from point  A to B,  valuers  come  around to value  the  land and propertyalong the route:   What  happens  in most  cases is  that people  may stay  even for five years without  compensation   A mwananchi's house may have  been demolished In the process but you will  find that  he has to wait  for five years before  he  gets  compensated.   Here  I have  in minim a tea road which was  constructed in Tigania and  Igembe Divisions  in 1980 and  compensation was not paid to a lot of people. There  were  some  fraudulent  activities  involving personalities. So, the  files  from the Ministry of Public  Works may have been taken to the police 	for  scrutiny:   But those  files may have been lost  there:   This  is because although these people  continued asking for their compensation,  they could not  get So,  I would like to urge the minister concerned to think of having properly designed forms  or documents  so that  in the  event  of the documents kept  by the Ministry getting lost,  then the people who are  supposed to be  compensated have a proof of the   property valued. I  say this because  in most  cases, where land has been acauired properly maybe  for the  construction of a road,  people are given smnil  notes  just papers plucked from a notebook, to show how many coffee trees or  tea  stumps,  banana trees have been destroyed.  However,  Mr. Deputy Speaker,  Sir, you will find that there is no proper document to identify the property in the event of the records  kept by.the ministry getting lost. I  support  this Bill wholeheartedly because  its purpose is to ensure that there is speedy compensation for property acquired. I also wish to state here that the Minister has brought a good amendment because the tribunal that  is  going to be  chosen here comprises  of relevant and qualified people	qualified lawyers who have served  for not less than 10 years and also valuers who have  served for about the same period of time. This will ensure that compensation is done  fairly. It will  also  ensure that the valuation does not have any disputes. I say this because  it is not	impossible to  see  a valuation being either under  or above the normal rate  or cost.   So, this tribunal, with this  cadre  of valified personnel can always ensure that . compensation that is  supposed to be paid to So-and-so is the right amount  of compensation.Mr. Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  since  this Bill talks aboutCompensation It  is unfortunate that in my area,  when you are talking about compensation, except  in the  construction of roads, we  have very little  to be  compensated for   This  is because  although  land adjudication in that  area started in	June,	1966,  you will find that	todate,	24 years  after,  it  hect.not been completed: So, the  land you have  is held in	trust by the County Council   Indee what  is  supposed to be paid as	compensation is peanuts because  you do not  have  any title  deed.   Maybe the  compensation rate  is KShs. 500/- per acre  because you do not  own that land.  Mr. Deputy  Speaker, Sir.  I would like  to request the Minister who  is a very good friend of mine,  to see to it that people in Tigania do not continue to  suffer	just because  they do not have title deeds:   I am sure  that eventnAlly there is going to be a crash programme to	issue people with title deeds:   I must also tale  this  opportunity to 	congratulate  His Excellency the President  for moving into :	areas where people were being asked to  contribute money to buy huge  chunks  of land and they were not seeing this land.   The President moved in and directed that that landhad to be sub-divided  and  share holders given title  deeds:   We would like the Minister to think of areas where land has not been demarcated and people  do not  own land:   We  all need title deeds:   We want to be able to plan our land:   If I knew that my land was two acres   I would know where to put up   my house and where to do zero-grazing, where to plant a few coffee trees and so on.	In fact I pity some of my constituents who  have businesses. I do not  even know where they get  money from. This  is because  they cannot  go to a bank and ask loans  because they have no title deeds.   So,  I hope that  the Minister will assist us.Mr   Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  while  talking about  areas that are undergoing adjudication and demarcation,  I would like to touch on another form of compensation which I would like the Minister to ensure that it  is  done  fairly and promptly.   You will find that in the  adjudication process,  a person gathers his land:   This is in accordance with the  Act  that has been effective In Meru and a few other parts  of the  country.   So,  you gather your land together; you measured your first piece  of land  on very fertile ground, maybe on a coffee  farm or on a tea farm:   But you will find that when the gathering is  completed this is shocking but it is true somebody who  bought land on a rocky area where no crops can grow, because he  has  some  influence,  is transferred to your land. He  is transferred to your land where your  grandfathers lived for centuries and where you have built  a permanent house:   So,  you are  surprised when the demarcation officers tell you "This  land now belongs to So-and-so" who has been moved  from a rocky area which he bought with the full knowledge  that  he would  still have  some influence to enable him to be placed  on very good land:   These things  are happening in areas where  demarcation of land  is not yet  competed:   I would therefore like  to request  the Minister to ask his officers in the field to  ensure that those  kinds  of complaints to not  arise  at  all. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,  the Lands Act  spells  out very clearly the  compensation for the kind  of land you measured.   If you are  not placed  exactly where you 	measured,  you must be put In an area as  good as the place you measured. With these  few remarks, I beg to  support  the Bill.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  P.J.  MASINDE: 	Thank you very much; Mr. Deputy Speaker,  Sir; for  giving me  this  opportunity to  contribute  to this Bill:   This is  a very important Bill in that  it  is  going to help the people who have land and whose land has to be taken for puttingup public  utilities: I want to  start  off by tallcing about land that is occasionally acquired by county councils for the development	of markets, hospitals	administration centres and so  on. 	You will  find that markets are  sub-divided into plots and probably these plots are  given to individuals who are made to pay rents  or rates  every year:  Mr.   Deputy Speaker, Sir, sometimes  that  is done  before the owners  of  that  land  are  compensated. Sir,   some  people  may  be  earning something  from  those  plots,  but  that is  not  enough. 	If  the  people  carrying out  busine ses  on  those  plott want  to  borrow money  in  order to  improve  their  businesses,   they cannot use  those  plots,   because  they. do  not  have  title  deeds. I would therefore,   request  the  Minister  to  ensure  that  plots  in  all markets  are  surveyed and  title  deeds  be  issued to  owners. I  know  that  he  has  been  requested to  do  the  same  thing by other  people  and  I  also  do  remember  that  this  issue was  raised during  the  Parliamentary  Group  Meeting. 	I  know  t  hat  in  some  provinces title  deeds  have been given  to  the  plot  owners,   and  therefore, I would request the Minister  to  survey  the  plots  in  Busia  so  that  title deeds  can  be  issued to  the  owners  in order that people  can use  them to  borrow money for  improving their various businesses. Also  the  people  who,provided land where  markets  have  been  established should be well  compensated.	I  was  glad  to  hear  the  Minister  saying  that he  intends  to  speed up  compensation.	I  hope  that  compensation  shall be  done  in  time. There  has  also  been  some  tendency of  some  Ministries approaching the  district  development  committee  with  a  view of identigying  certain  areas  whereby  they would like  to  have  public utilities,  maybe,  prisons,  hospitals  and so  on. 	When  people are  informed  that  there  is  such  a  move  by  the  Governmetn,   they stop  being development  conscious,  because  they  expect  to  be  moved  from the  area  any  time. When people  are  told to  stop  carrying out  any further  development  because the  Government will  soon be  acquiring the land,  they are  quite  happy. 	But  the  plan may take  such a long-time  to be implemented that,  eventually,  a new -Minister,  or a new Permonert Secretary may be  brought  to  the Ministry,  and when he  goes to visit the  area which was  formerly identified for the project,  he may say that  the  laps is not  suitable  and,  therefore,  he  selects another site. 	The  owners  of that  land are  discouraged by such things because  they stop  to  develop their pieces  of land in the hope that the  Government will  acquire  it. Sir,  I would like  to  suggest that when the district development  committee  decides and  advises the Ministries concerned,  on what  they intend  to  do,  that  should be  done quickly so that the people  who  are  supposed to be moved from their areas know of that in time  so  that  they can begin making arrangements. They  should be  allowed to reke  their own arrangements until they are  compensated. They should not  be  given a short notice  to make moving arrangements. Sir,  compensation should be  promptly paid. I would  like  to congratulate  the Minister for lands  and Housing for paying the owners  of the  land at Busia which was acquired in order to construe a prison. Sir,  the  people  living in Sofia erd  Maraclii  estates  inBusia Town have been waiting to move  out for many years. They had been told that they would move  out eight years ago because they live  on the border of  "No man's land" but up to now that exercise  has tot materialised. It was  started  just  the  other day but  it  is  too  slow.	I would like  to  request  the Minister to take  up  that matter,  so that  meople miam can be moved out  of that area,  and also  be  promptly compensated. I would like  to  suggest that  the  commensation is not made  at the  discretion of the Minister,  including  the six cent  that my hon.  colleagues have talked about, but  at the  current  land value.	We  have  land valuers  both  in  the public  and private  sector.	The  Government  is  not poor	and, therefore, those  people whose  land is  being acquired by the  Government should not  be  disadvantaged. 	They  should  be  compensated  for  their  land according to  the  current  market va ue  of land. Sir,  there  was  one hon. member who  mentioned of some  areas  in  Meru  where  land was  acquired for  construction of roads,   but  the  owners  have  not  yet  been  compensated. 	I  would also  like  to  say  that  I  have  a  similar problem in my constituency. In Bat  Butila  Division roads were  constructed through peoples land;	estimates  were  made, and	all the  property  that  was  destroyed was assessed. That  was  done  ten  years  ago but  to-date  those  people  have  not  yet  been paid.	Many of  them have come  to  Nairobi;  which	 	over	300  miles  away;  but  some of  them have  been  told to  wait for 	the  Ministry to get in  touch with them, Others  were  told  that  the Ministry  does  not have records showing  that their  land was interfered with. I  would like  to  support  the  Assistant  Minister who  said that when land acquisition  is  being  considered,  gam the a Ministryis  officers  should have  proper  records,		Even  if  that  issue  isdealt  with  after ten years,  any person  should be  told what the  fate of  his  land is,  and not  to  be put  of,  by being told that there  are  no  records  showing  that  his  land was  acquired. 	The  best that  the  Ministry  can  do  right  now is  to  begin looking  for  those records. 	It  is  not  enough  to  tell  somebody  whose  land was  acquirdd thz there  are  no  records  about his land,  without giving him any more  advice  Sir,  when the  Government acquired land,  and the  owners were  compensated, they obviously started logkiag  or land elsewhere. 	They may wish to buy land  "under-hand". I would like  to  emphasise  that the people who are  selling land to those who  have been given money in form of comnensation should be invited to attend meetings of the land board.  The  district officers should  also  make  sure  that the  immediate family members are  involved. Although His Excellency the President has  sounded this  warning quite  often,  I am sorry to  say that on a number of occasions the  district  officers merely decide to  deal with an individual. who  claims  to be the owner of the land,	and the  land is  sold,  indiscriminately,  probably leaving the  family with nothing at  all,  and by the  time the  children realise  that their land has been sold,  the new person has already acquired a title  deed.	After that  they are  told that  there  is nothing that  can be  done  about  it.	If the  Provincial administration can tell the  affected persons  that there  is nothing   at they can do,  then I  do not know where  those  affected persons  should go.   Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  it is  a good thing that the Bill is  introducing  Land Compensation Tribunals. 	It is  also  suggested that  each Tribunal  be  headed by a lawyer  of outstanding experience,  not  less  than 10 years,  and he will be  assisted by two Land Valuers. I would  also  like  to  suggest  here  that while  the  Chairman of the Land Tribunal may. wish to pick up a Land Valuer,  I wonder whether one mzee  or one  elder from each Province  should not be  included lot the  Tribunal  so  that  if there  is  a land issue  being tackled " from a particular Province,  then this  person is called upon to  be able  to  advise  the  Tribunal  on what  otherwise  traditionally goeson in that particular area of  the province rather than depend entirely on Land Valuers and nothing else. A Land Valuer may have a lot  of book knowledge  and a lot of experience,  but  that maybe mainly town experience  because  I have  not  seen many of them staying in the  countryside  to  know the  problems  of wananchi..  So,  I would like to  suggest  that a few more  elders are  also  included on the  Tribilnnl. May  I also  suggest,  Sir,  that this land Tribunal should meet more frequently. We  have  had for a long  time  the  Industrial  Court which has  had  only one  Judge.	He  used to run around the  countryside all the year round and a lot of cases were  pending.	Now,  if  the Minister is really  serious  in making  sure  that those whose  land is acquired are  paid  Speedly and that those who are aggrieved can also appeal,  then the  Land Tribunal  should be  able  to meet or to  sit  frequently  so  that problems of those  aggrieved can be looked into without  any urnecessary delay. Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  may I also  suggest that after land has  been acauired for public  utility,  especially schools and hospitals,  any neighbouring piece  of land there  should be under the  surveillance  of the Minister for Lands  and Housing to make  sure  that whatever goes  on there  or whatever is Constructed next to  those  areas does not interfere with. the  institutions  that are  located there. For example,  it it  is a school, we  need the  children to  study and not to be  disturbed. So,  we would not  like  to  see that next to  a school,  the  land there  is acquired for a discotheque  or a bar, or such other sort  of thing. Neither should we  like  this  sort  of plot to be  issued next to  a hospital where  the  sick people need a lot. of Quietness ari rest. This  sort  of land  should probably be  restricted to  the  type  of uses that would be  coming Closer to these  areas. Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  in this  regard,  perhaps  to  assist In this respect,  I would like  to  suggest that when planning  our towns,  whether the  towns  include  personal  land,  individual land or not,  it  should be  planned in such a way that certain areas are for certain uses  only. For example,  industrial area should be  for manufacturing only,  whether that land belongs  to an individual or not,  let  it be marked as  "industrial area";  and if the  individual sells it to  somebody else who wants to  use  it for industrial Purpose,  it is  okay,  but if somebody else  comes and wants  to use the  area as a residential  area,  the Minister and the Commissioner for Lands  should be  able  to refuse  the  sale  or the transfer of that land.	However,  if it is  a place  for commercial purposes, then it should be  specifically for commerce.	This  will also help to control the  types  of areas that we  have  in towns  and it will also  avoid the  "mix-ups"  of proper planning,say,  where you have a bar here, a residential house  there,  a clinic  next door,  a school on the other  side  and so  on. With those  few remarks,  Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER,  OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE 	(Mr.  Keah): 	Thank you,  Mr.  Deputy Speaker, Sir,  for giving me  the  opportunity to contribute to  this Bill. From the  outset,  I would like  to thank the Minister for Lands and Housing of course Settlement is also included and congratulate  him for bringing this Bill together with the amendment which I fully  support.  In supporting this Bill,  I would merely like  to urge that through this Bill,  we  are  setting up a machinery for expediting the  compensation to  the  people whose land has been acquired by the Government. I wholeheartedly support  this move,  but  I urge  that my colleague,  the Minister, sees to  it that  the  Land Tribunes  does its work promptly. I  say  so, 	Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir, because I have a case in mind of my own property coconut and cashewnut trees relating to  the  road from Mwarakaya to  Shilulu to Kwamadamba in Zaloleni Constituency which were  knocked down for purposes  of road development some 15  years  ago,and  todate  no  compensation has been made Not  only compensation has not been made but, in fact,  the  road was subseauently-abandoned. It  was not developed  as  intended  simplybecause  the  road was  not classified at the  time. So,  we  have suffered a great  deal  as  a result  of  this and,  therefore,  I do welcome  thiS  Bill  in totality. I am sure  that we  are  going to give  it the  necessary mandate  and consent. Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I donot want  even to go  to  the  other aspects  of the  Bill. I note  that  the land Tribunal  is  only composed ofthree  people.	Well,  I  suppose the  fewer the number the moreeffective  it  will be, and  I would like  to  wish the hon. Minister every sucess  in the  execution of the business  that is  contained through the mandate  we  are  giving under this  Bill. 	 However,  I would like  to  avail myself this  opportunity 	since  this  Bill  touches  on land to  bring in a couple  of things  that  are  not  directly related to  this Bill,  but which are  of paramount  importance,  particularly  in so  far as Kilifi people  and  people  at  the Coast  in general are  concerned. We  have  about three  or four different types  of land. We  have  what  is  called the Settlement land which  has  been set  aside  for  settlement;  we  have  what  is  called the  Government Land (G.L.);  we  have  the Trust  Land which is adminisfeted by the  County Councilsas well Private  Land. I  would like  to talk  on those  four aspects  of land because  the  life  of the people  at the  Coast  has  been affected.  I  am talking in particular about kilifi, with respect to a manner in which action has been taken with regards to  this  aspect  of land. Let me  start  off with the  Settlement  Land. The  Settlement Land is  set aside  for the  landless,  and here  I am not being a tribalist at  all. 	But time  and again,  we  have  witnessed incidents where  the  people who have  been living on a piece  of land have been left  out in the  allocation of the  Settlement Land in preference to people  from areas  totally not connected with the Settlement area.I would like  to  emphasise  this  fact here  very strongly simply because  this  aspect has  hurt  our people.	As you mow,  Sir,  Kilifipeople  "hakuna matata".	Kilifi  people  are  very humble,  but humbleness has  been misunderstood and misconstrued to the advantageS of several  other people who  are  greedy. In fact,   as  far as  Settlement Lands  are concerned,  there is ample evidence in the Ministry and  I  am not  tackling my hon. friend here Darius Mlela, because he 	only came  in the  other day where  Government officers or the 	settlement  officers are acquiring land for their own use.   There  is  available  and ample evidence  in the Ministry's records where in settlement areas Government officers who have been assigned the duties of settling the landless have allocated themselves chunks of land in those settlement areas to the  detriment of the  people of that area who are supposed to be settled there.	There are  cases of such officers  allocating themselves two and half acres.	Mtwapa is  a typical example of where  some people have allocated themselves land that was  supposed to  be.for the  landless. Even  if they  have  to allocate themselves some piece of land,  let them allocate  themselves  just two and half acres and not  50 acres.	This  is  a big shame.	So  while  talking about this  particular aspectI  am merely urging the Ministry to be vigilant  in ensuring that landless  indigenousKenyans  are given priority  in preference to all other people.Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  my other point relates to Government landpopularly known as  GL.	The  Kilifi  people have  lived  in Kilifi  from time  inmemorial.	The  malpractise  that goes  along with Government land  is  where-cnefinds  such  lands  being allocated from the  Ministry's  Headquarters  to  a certain person when there  are  people  who have been Living on those  lands  for centuries. You will  find that the great-greatparents,  greatparents,  fathers  and their children have  been  buried on those  lands.	After that you  find a  person  coming be  occupy  such  lands  saying:   "I  am  sorry  but  this  land is  mine.	You have  to more  away".	This  leaves  the  people  of Kilifi  in wonder and they run to their Member of Parliament asking:  "What  is all  this?"	His  Excellency the President has recognised the plight of these  people and on his  several trips  to the Coast Province has  said that the  Government  land should be given to the people who are  living on  it. 	So all  I  am  urging is  that his  instructions should implemented with speed and in all  fairness  to the people who are  indigenous and have  lived there for generations. If  that  is  done  then  equity  will  not only be  done but will  also  be  seen to  be  practised. I would  also like  to 	mention  a sad  case  in mind as  an example where Government  land has been allocated without taking  into consideration the people  living there. Although  I  am taking that case administratively I would like to put it forward purely  to emphasise of factors that affect land issues down there at  the  Coast province. There is in Mariakani a piece of trust land on which some structures  stand.	These  structures  were put up  by the  county council of'Kilifi,  but  were  later on allocated to the Mariakani Onu Branch. So  these offices serve  the  people  of Kilifi.	Unknown to us  the other day we were confounded by  a person coming to us  and telling us:   "I  am sorry this  is my land and this is  the  title  deed  to prove my  allocation". This  was  done without taking  into consideration the  fact  that  these premises are  owned by  the Mariakani  Kanu Branch.Of course, I  realise that what. the Mariakani  Kanu Branch should have  done wasto go  to  the  country  Council  and make their  claim  known there  and then  from  thereto  the Ministry's  Headquarters. I appreciate  that that ought to have been done.But the  point I am  emphasising  is  the-feet  that there are  cases of Government  landbeing allocated to a person without any  person going to the site  to see whether thereare  people  or buildings  on that particular  land. In  this  case,  if a person  had bothered to go to  that site he  would have  found out  that that piece of land was being appropriately  used by  the  Mariakani  Kanu Branch  in  which  they would have asked themselves  this  question:   "If we allocate this  land,  what are we going to do with the  Mariakani and Branch?" 	In  fact,  to make matters worse this is the place where  we hbld our  Kanu and political rallies. which means  that even I will be  left without a particular rallying point  in Mariakani. This  Government land has  been allocated to  a private  individual. These  are  the points  that  I would like  the  Ministry  to take  seriously  so  that equity  is  done and seen to be done. I  will  not like  to talk about private land.  sThere  is  a lot of private land  in  the  Coast  Province which  belongs  to absentee landlords. These  landlords were given these  lands  during the  days  of Seyyid bin Said and Said bin Said. These  landlords are no longer living in Kenya. Now,  there are  indigenous Kenyans who were not only  there during that time but are still there today.So these absentee landlords contract certain people to sell these pieces of landfor  them.	I  am saying so because  I have'an example  in mind and I am sure that  when hon.  Lewa gets  an opportunity to speak he will  elaborate on it because it touches  on his  constituency.  The  place  I  have  in mind  is  called Kazinoni  Location. There  is  now  somebody trying to  sub-divide this whole area when there are people living  there  who have their, coconut trees,  cashewnut trees,  orange trees and permanent houses. Unknown to these poor  Kenyans,  this  itrivate  land which is now being sold. We  have  such  cases  in that area. So  I  would  like  to  urge  the Ministry  to  intervene  in  such  cases and ensure  that the  local  indigenous  people who have lived there  from  time  inimemorial  and generation to generation are given the opportunity to acquire that land first and if need beithe Government should assist  in the acquisition of this  land. This  is  because although these peoplehave  been living and developing this  land,  they are not wealthy. This  meansthat  it  will  be  almost  impossible  for  them to  meet the  on-going land market rates. So I am urging the Ministry to come to the rescue of the local  indigenous  Kilifi people  when  such cases  arise. My  final  point,  Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,   is  that although my  people can have  a portion  of land on which  they  have  built  their houses,  they also own other  three,  four or  five pieces  of land elsewhere. Such  pieces  of  land may  be  Government  land. So  traditionally,  such people  will  move  from one  piece  of land to  another  while  leaving the  other pieces  of land  fallow. They  do  this yearly.  Unfortunately,  the administration and the Ministry officials have refused to appreciate this concept about   our people down there. When It comes to allocating them a Piece of land,  they merely give them a stretch around the boma because they believe  one  can have several pieces of land here and there. This  is a Point I would like  to emphasize because it touches the very root of the development of the people of Kilifi in so far as land is concerned. I urge  the Ministry to recognize  this aspect to the full so that a person’s three or five plotsrwherever they may be, are recognized as his Property and not merely the piece of land around his boma.	These are very fundamental points which touch m on the well-being of our people in Zinn_	We are humble people and we welcome visitors to our Place but   I do not want our humbleness to be misunderstood as being stupid. In conclusion,  I would like to say that I agree with the sentiments expressed by hon. Nassir to the effect that those people who have acquired land at  the  Coastk should utilize it for the development of that area. They should not use  those title deeds to acquire loans for the development of other plots elsewhere. 	This is a very soak serious aspect indeed and I would like the entire Kenya to recognize this and to understand what is happening. For example,  when people pass around the Coast Province,  they see bushes and they take it that the people of that  locality are lazy. He have never been lazy at all! We have never had massive flights of food to the Coast at any one given time. Therefore,  we do not want this misnomer to be perpetrated   in presentday Kenye.	There should have a degree of respect for the people of the Coast.With these few remarks,  I beg to support.</Newspeech>(Mr.  Deputy Speaker left the Chair) (The Temporary Deouty Speaker 	(Mr.  Wabuge)  took the Chair)  <Newspeech>MR.  MALEBE:   Thank you,  Sir,  for giving me this opportunity to support the Land Acquisition 	(Amendment)  Bill. 	From the outset,  I would like  to say that the area I represent,  Igembe, has no title deeds. The land in this area is under adjudication apart from one or two sections which were given title deeds.   Where  there are no  title deeds and Cbmpulsory accuisition of lana takes Place, the  land owners get subjected to a lot  of Problems. For   example,  some tricky people   pretend that that land is theirs so that they can be compensated. 	I  am saying this because such a thing happened in Igembe when there was construction of a road from Maua to Mikinduri and the people whose land had been taken were denied compensation which was instead made to the wrong People. Now there  is hue and cry immtkatizarga i,aking into account the high population in that area. This is route 11 and I  think it  is a D462 road I might be mistaken 	which runs from Maua to Akachiu   and Mikinduri. This road was murramed in 1982 and the wrong people were compensated. Some  of the people who did not own a piece of land there made a fortune from the compensation which was rade and they are now the tycoons in the area. I would like  to say something about the land acquisition compensation Tribunals.   The membership to thes   tribunal is not atm adequate. We have achairman,  who is a lawyer,  and two valuers. (Noise) There is another  'meeting' going on here and I hope that the Chair is taking note of it. This constitution of only three people is not adequate. We  all know that  lawyers are known for swindling the poor peasants. Although   this lawyer, who is the chairman,  will be assumed to be impartial, he may not necessarily act so and it is something which must be looked into by the Judiciary. We know that sometimes lawyers have certain interests and I wonder how fair the tribunals will be.  We have  two valuers in every tribunal and it  is disheartening to find that land is being under valued a great deal. For example, an acre  of land was being valued at Kshs.50/= with respect to the case I mentioned about the acquisition of land for  the constrdction of the Maua Mikinduri Road in my constituency. I am wondering wiam whether such valuation was being done by registered valuers or the contractors who were doing this road. When it  comes  to the valuation of land, we should have an independent person doing that  job and not the consulting engineer or the contractor. The Ministry should,  therefore,  come up with an independent valuer who will  .asm the correct value  of the land. 	Such a person should have no interest at all in whatever that is going on and his duty should only be its to give professional services as far as valuation is concerned. On the composition of the  tribunal,  I. would like to suggest that the number of members should be increased so that,  say,  two extra members can be co-opted from the  locality such commensatiOn is to be effected. For example,  the chief of the area should be there to identify the ownership of that land. One elder from that area should also be a co-opted member. I do not know why we have two valuers in this tribunal. 	We  should have an a independent valuer who will give impartial valuation of the land to be    acquired.	In this way,  if there is a dispute,  then this tribunal will follow theprofessional valuation which was done.  I would propose  that we  increase the membership of the  tribunal from three to at least five and it should include an elder and an administrator,  preferably a chief or assistant chief; of the where compensation is to be paid. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, currently there  isa proposal to  split Meru District into Meru District  and NyambeneDistrict. Land has  already been set aside  for the  construction ofthe  proposed district headauarters. This is a an example  of comulsory acquisition of land. In the  past we have  seen that people who are  displaced as a result of compulsary acquisition of land are not given priority when it  comes to allocation of plots.   When land is acquired for demarcation and allocation of plots, you find completely new people being allocated plots.:   Despite  the  fact that  previous  owner  of the  acquired land is  compensated,  the  plots allocation should give him a preference  and allocate him a plot in the now public  land. I know that the  Commissioner  of Lands is supposed to  look at applicants impartially,  but he  should give the previous owner  of the land preference.   This is because  he was displaced and,  perhaps,  put in an infertile  land. So, on top of the  compensation he  got, he  should get  "ex-gratia"  in the  form of a plot in his former land which has now been set aside  for demarcation and allocation of plots. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir, the  periodsdf 24 months  and 60  days  are  too long for prompt payment of compensation.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS,  HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr.Mutiso):	On a point of order,  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir, I think the hon.

MALEBE: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the  hon. Assistant Minister did not understand me. I was referring to specific area where the proposed Nyambene  District will be constructed  and where  there  will be  public  plots  to be allocated to members  of  the  pulbic  after the  process  of compulsory acquisition is  completed. So, I was not referring to SettIment schemes.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER,  OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr.  Onyancha): On a  point  of  order, Mr. Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir. With all due  respect  to  the  hon. Member,  during his  speech he  has twice made very serious and generalized allegations  that  lawyers  are  known to be suraders I want  to  the  guidance  of chair because it is not fair  for  the  hon. Member  to  generalise  and  say that  all  lawyers are surndler. There  may be  a few black  sheep these  are  found  in every  profession and  even in families. So,.  I  ask the  hon. Member to withdraw his generalised remarks  because  they are  unafair to the  lawyers:	I  am a  lawyer, but  I  am not  a surndler.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR.  MALEBE: Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,.the.hon.  Member hassaid  exactly  what  I  said. I  said  that a few,  and not all,  lawyers have been proven  to  be  swindlers. This  is what  the hon.  Member has repeated.Turning  to  plants  and  machinery,  if a pece of land in which there is  a plant  and  machinery  is to be compulsorily acquired, I wonder what will happen. A  new  clause  is  to  be  inserted  in the principal  Act which requires the owner to remove  such plant and  machinery  unless  they will  be required by the new owner. My  question  is:	Who will bear the expenses  involved  in removing this plant and equipment?	I  would  have  thought  that when  the Government compulsorily acquires a piece  of land with such plant  and  equipment,  it should actually compensate the owner  for  the  expenses  he  incurs.in  removing  the  plant and machinery.	I  do  not think  that  this  point  is  properly spelt out  in  the  Bill.	The  Bill  just  says  thatfor  compulsory  acquidistion,  if there  is  a  plant  and  machinery,  the  owner  is requested  to  remove  the  plant  and machinery,  but  it does  not  say  whether  at  the time  of valuation,  this  plant  and  machinery  will  be  valued. Since  it is  not  the wish of  the  owner  of such  land to remove  his plant  and machinery  from his  land, I  think  the  Government should  be  able  to  pay  him  compensation or meet  the cost of removing such plant  and machinery  from  the  land. The  other practice  that  I  have witnessed  relates  to the powers of  land  registrars.   You  will  find that  they  have powers  even to change  the  boundaries of registered  land. With  all  due  respect  to their profession and administrative capability,  you  will  find that  some  land  registrars  tend  not  to  be  fair  to  some  party.	 The  poor suffer,  whereas  the  rich go  to the  land registrar,  who tends to favour  them.	The  poor man suffers  from this favouritism,  and  I would urge  the Commissioner of Land and  the Minister concerned to</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR  LANDS,  HOUSING AND  PHYSICAL PLANNING(Mr.  Mutiso): 	On  a point  of order,  Mr.  Temporary-Deputy Speakler,  Sir. 	Surely, the  hon.  Member knows  that you should not make  a general allegation here unless you  are  prepared  to  substantiate  it.

However,  as  far as  I am concerned,  I made  a general  statement,  but  I  have  a specific example which is currently under investigation. Until this  is  completed</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT  MINISTER FOR PUBLIC  WORKS (Mr.  Maiyani):  On a point oforder,Mr.  Temporary. Deputy Speaker,  Sir.

I  do  withdraw  the  remark  until  the case  is  over. 	Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir, the other thing  I want to say  is that  I  do  thank His Excellency the  President for having directed  land-buying. companies to  sub-divide  their  plots  and give  shareholders  title deeds. The  longer the  land-buying  companies keep  on  retaining  the  land  the  more  the  shareholders  lose.   You find  that  the  rich people</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON.

Members  are  favouring  the  rich  people.  You  find that particularly in an area where  there  are  do land  title  deeds In  fact,   I  would like  this tribunal  to  be  extended  to  cover areas where  land adjudication  is going on because it will  be  fair and  impartial. Even where  we have elders  attending  to  land cases, somewhere  somehow the rich man-penetrates through and  in the end  the poor man loses his  land. If the  tribunal  is  unable  to determine any  dispute,  then I  do not see 	any  need of going  to a higher court because we expect  the  tribunal to be fair. If cases have  to go  before the  Court of Appeal,  then  there must be  something wrong. I  think the  tribunal  membership  should be  increased from a lawyer and two valuers to  a lawyer,  two valuers and two elders from an area where compensation is to be offered. With those few remarks,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to support the Bill.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT  MINISTER FOR  LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr.  Chesire):  Thank you very. much,Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,for giving me a chance to contribute to this Bill. I will be very brief and only touch on two points that touch on land acquisitn. The  first point is  that one  of dealing with the  land  that during the colonial  days  belonged to clubs or societies. 	We  all  know that during those happy valley  days  the  colonial. farmers used to have clubs virtually everywhere. 	For  example,  in Trans-Nzoia District there were clubs  like Cherangani, Saboti and  Endebbess. 	What we know is that those properties had free-hold titles and the members  of the  various  clubs  appointed  trustees  to administer  the  land. 	The  trustees had absolute power  to  do  whatever they  liked  with  the  land..   On  the other hand, in  1964,  the Attorney-General gave exemption to these clubs.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I am saying  so because, this did happen sometime in the past  and it  is now happening again.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR RECLAMAYION AND DEVELOPMENT OF 	ARID, SEMI-ARID AND WASTELANDS(Mr. Ndotto):  On a point of order,  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.   There is far too much noise in the House and we cannot hear what the hon. Member of the Floor is saying.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr.  Wabuge):  Order! I think hon. Members should consult  silently.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTM FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT(Mr. Chesire): Thank you very much,  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker.  In fact,  I had to shout to the  top  of my voice  to be heard. I was saying that during those  days,  land that used to be owned by the clan was given exemption by the Registrar of Societies.  In fact,  land that was givenexemption way back in 1954 still enjoys that exemption.   However,  most  of  these trustees have gone out of this country While others are dead but because of the exemption that was given to this land by the Attorney-General,  nobody can touch that land. I would therefore,  like to appeal to  the Minister for Lands,  Housing and Physical Flaming,  to look into these exemptions with the assistance of Attorney-General,  with aview to making sure that  this land is owned and controlled by the  Commissioner of Lands. Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I am very glad that  this Bill has brought to the House  today, particularly because we have been assured by the Minister that the purpose of  this Bill is to  speedy the payment of compensation.   Let us hope and trust that the office of  the  Commissioner of Lands, will actually carry cut payment of this compensation speedily. I am saying this because  I have heard of cases that have been pending in my constituency for 11 years. 	These cases have been dragging on since 	1979 when a lot of land was acquired for Government purpose and valuation carried out and the people involved were informed.   None of these people had an option and therefore, they  took the money but quite a number of them refused to accept that compensation money and up  to this day,  the money is still lying in the district  commissioner's office.	At the moment,  these people have been unable to getland elsewhere, but the fact is that their land was acquired for a proper Government use. However,  the unfortunate thing is that the va1uer grossly undervalued the land to the extent that the people were unable to bwr land elsewhere.   The land that was available at. that time, has already been bought, but what  has compounded this issue is that the Commissioner of Landscontinues to  send land rent demand notices to these people 11 years later.When they inquire  as to what these notices Mean,  they are told that this land is  still in their possession. 	Even as late as December last year,  the Commissioner of Lands is sent demand notice for payment of land rent in arrears of 11 years amounting  to  Shs.35,000/-.  When these people go to the office of the Commissioner of Lands to incuire,  they are told that the land is theirs and yet they know that  the land has been taken away from them.   The question now is, what happens to land  of this nature?   This is land where very little compensation was supposed to be paid and now wananchi whose anti was taken are now being asked to pay land rent in respect of this land.   These people are now coming to us as their leaders seeking assistance to get the land,but we know it is impossible for them to get the land back. Therefore,  Sir,  I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to the Minister to reconsider the plight of these people and agree to value the land at the current market value of land so that they may be able to buy alternative land elsewhere.   These people are just hanging around hoping that one day a good Samaritan may say that the land has been given back to them.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  while  on the same issue of land,  I would like to  say that even though the survey was carried out,  you will find that up to today the surveyors have not been able to determine the correct boundaries for this piece  of land. I thought that  I should bring up this ease because I am sure that this particular Bill we  are debating very much applies to this case. do hope that  the bon: Minister will take up the matter seriously and also review the case.   This is because this is a matter that has been nagging for a long time  and  I believe there haS	been a bit  of	 bungiling in the  office  of the  Commissioner of Lands regarding this  issue:   	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  land  is  a very sensitive thing and especially where people have been dislodged.   Indeedwhere people have been dislodged,  their cases Must be  settled as quickly as possible. This is because where people who have no hope  of getting land elsewhere  are given hope that  one day they will go back to where they were before, that hope continues to be rekindled. I now appeal to the minister to give this matter the serious attention it deserves. If it is  a Question of reviewing the  value  of the  land; let  it be  done quickly:   If it  is a question of determining the  boundaries,  let  it be  done  speedily:"  But the delay,in this particular issue will not help  any of us.  With those remarks,  I beg to  support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING  (Mr. Mutiso):	Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary DeputySpeaker,  Sir, for giving me  this  opportunity to  say a few thingson this  important Bill.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister will be responding to the  views expressed on the Bill by hon. Members. But  Iwould like  to make  a few points  only to emphasise  a few thingsFirst  of all it must be understood that Kenya is a democratic  and  also  a fast-developing country. The leadership of this country wants to make the  citizens  of this country very happy. This  is why we  are up-dating our laws  so that,they can cope up with the  situations prevailing locally and internationally. I say this because when you,read the reasons why this Act. is being amended, you will  rind that when the  present Act became effective in 1968, the highest bank rate  at that time was 6 per cent:   But when you compare that rate with.today!.s-bank rates and the  state  of inflation throughout the world,  you will. find that there  is a great need	for reviewing this law and up-dating it  so that  it can cope up with the  socio economic  and political  situations that  are prevailing,  not only here in Kenya but  also throughout the world. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,  the  Government of Kenyahas a great love  for the citizens of this oountry and it is for this reason that the  Government wishes to up-date the laws of this couniuy 	so that  they can cope with the development  of the people  of this country and the  development  of world economy in general.   If we were to  apply the present law as  it  is to  compensation,  you would find that there  is no  speedy way in which this process can be gone  through.  No time is stipulated in the  present law. But the law which we are trying to enact here  gives a time limit  of two years and 60 days  in which this process  of compulsory land acauisition has to be  completed 	All the procedures involved have to be completed within that period  so that the  owners  of the land can also benefit.  	 	Mr.   Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,   I heard  somehon. Members complaining that  some  people  have not  been  compensatedfor land  which  was  taken by   the  Governrme some 15  years  ago.That  is  because the operative clause in the old act give no time  limitThat  is  why  the  Government  found  it  fit to  set  a  time  limit  for paying the compensation. I  think  that  is a  very good move,   and  I  think  the  hon.  Members  should support  the  Bill  fully  so  that  land compensation  to  their constituents  can  now be  done  faster. Sir,   I  would  also  like  to  mention  the  issue  of land tribunal.
