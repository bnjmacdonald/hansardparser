Members know, this is the first day after the opening of Parliament, and as is the custom, it is the normal order of the day that we exempt the proceedings of a day like this one from the provisions of Standing Order Ho. 33 in order to use the day to make arrangements for the Session's Business. This is a normal arrangement of which hon. Members are fully aware, and so I do not need to labour in giving more explanations than are necessary.With those few remarks, I beg to move.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Mibei): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second this Motion. The Mover has given a satisfactory explanation which, I am sure, the hon. Members, will agree to. It is not our intention to rob> the hon.

(Prof.) G. Saitoti, M.P. (Chairman)The	Hon.	K.N.K Biwott, M.P.The	Hon.	Burudi Nabwera, M.P.The	Hon.	Ndolo Ayah, M.P.The	Hon.	J.J. Kamotho, M.PThe	Hon.	G.M. Ndotto, M.P.The	Hon.	D.M.

Bonyo, M.P.Mr. Speaker, Sir, as hon. Members will notice this list was prepared very carefully and it drafts nine every segment of the composition of this House. We have as usual His Excellency the Vice—President and Minister for Finance and the Leader of Government Business as the Chairman. The rest of the Committee is composed of hon. Members from the Front Bench; and the Back Bench. We believe that this composition will be sufficient and effective enough in transacting the business of this House to the satisfaction of all the hon. Members. Of course, I leave it to the hon. Members who are responsible people to judge whether the Committee is effective or not. But all in all I do not expect divergent views on the nomination of the Committee Members..With these few remarks, I would like to appeal to the hon. Members to express their necessary views to expedite thethe appointment of these Members so that from here they can move into the Sessional Committee in-order to prepare the workload for this House.With these few remarks, I beg to move.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Mibei): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to second the Motion. Looking at the list I realise that it is quite representative and as such I would like to appeal to all hon. Members to support this Motion.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second.</Newspeech>(Question proposed)<Newspeech>MR. MATE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, looking at the list of the nominees for the Sessional Committee I also support the view that it is a representative cross-section) of this House. Although that is so it is my opinion that there are far too many Members from the Front Bench. So in future we would like to see a far more fair distribution of Front Wbenchers and Back-bencher, Infact, despite the fact that Back-benchers have a lot to contribute towards the running of business in the House, you will find that., out of 20 Members of the Committee there are only eight Back-benchers. So it is my view that there should be an equal number of Front¬benchers and Back—benchers in such a committee.Apart from that I support the Motion and hope that the Committee will effectively transact the business of this House by providing it with enough work. With few remarks I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MANG'OLI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for allowing me to express my views on this Motion. Although that is so I do not have much to say because I can see from the list that there is a fair representation of the House. That being so would I be in order to call upon the Mover to reply so that we can move on to more serious matters?</Newspeech>  <Newspeech> MR. WABUGE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr.. Speaker, Sir. My point of order is that. I would like to call upon the Mover of the Motion to reply, so that we can move on to the next</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order! Order, Mr. Mang'oli! If you had really wanted to move that the Mover be called upon to reply, then you should not have made any statement at, all. Do not take advantage of the situation by expressing your views and at the same time asking for the Mover to be called upon to reply. You cannot have your cake and eat it at the come time.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WABUGE: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to say a few words on this Motion. On the face of it I have no dispute towards the appointment of the hon. Members on the list to the Sessional Committee. All that I wanted to say is that the Sessional Committee of this House is regarded as the steering committee of this House. Hon. Members selected to serve in this Committee should realise that they have been given the responsibility of planning the business of this House. If that is so then it is up to them to take the matters of this Committee seriously such that when there is a meeting of the committee every member of this committee unless he has other more urgent matters to attend to should make an effort to attend that meeting. This is because on some occasions although there might be about 20 members who are supposed to attend a meeting, you find only a few attending it. This includes even the Ministers who are supposed to be members of this committee. Very few of then attend such meetings. In fact it is not surprise to find only about three, four or five Ministers attending a given meeting. This means that they take lightly the matters that are supposed to be discussed in these meetings. Now when such a thing happens, it transforms—</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASIXE-NDOMBI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.I happened to have served in this committee during the last Session of this House. If one was to go through the records of this committee he would find that about 99 per cent of the members attended meetings. I do not remember any occasion when we had only four Ministers in a meeting. So I think what the hon. Member making very serious allegations. Hon. Wabuge should have goner through the minutes of the previous committee: before coming to that conclusion. So I think he should be asked to apologise and withdraw his remarks.(applause)MR. WABUGE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if what the hon. Member has said is the truth, then I take my hat off and ask that they continue doing so. They should not relax even for a minute. My fear is that as time goes by some of these members might fail to attend the meetings of this committee. But if the situation has been as hon. Wasike-Ndombi has described it, then I would like to him to urge the spresent appointed members of this committee to attend the meetings. It is a good thing to hear that about 99 per cent of then attend these meetings.Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that the question of fair representation in the Committee, "being a Steering Committee of this House, to me, does not arise. If the Committee is really interested in the affairs of this Mouse, then business brough "before it for its consideration should be considered fairly. More so I am talking about Private Members1 Motions by Back-benchers. I say so because we should not at any moment consider Back-benchers as an opposition or as an obstructive organisation within Parliament Whatever they "bring here should be in the interest of the nation and, as such, their business, should always be given fair considera-tion. That is all I would like to appeal to the House, otherwise I have no quarrel with the list of hon. Members who have been listed here. I wish them best of luck and hard working for this louse.Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.</Newspeech>(applause)<Newspeech>MR.MWAMZABDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to support the selection of this Sessional Committee Members. I happen to have served in the last Sessional Committee and I greatly differ with hon Wafula Wabuge who has assumed that there was not good attendance. The attendance was very good. There has been no time when we had lack of quorum whatsoever.Mr. Speaker,. Sir, with experience,, we used to benefit a lot from the Sessional Committee in that normally we used' it as a ladder from the Back-benchers, to His Excellency the President for whatever problems we had in the House. We used to channel our grievances through the. Sessional Committee to the Government. For instance, sometimes we complained that our pay was little and something needed to be done about it. We used to do this through the Leader of Government Business. However, things did not work out that way during the last Session, but this time we anticipate to use theservices of the Sessional Committee very well. For instance, the mileage, claim rates for hon. Members are very compared to the cost of running a car these days. The price of petrol has "been increased recently and it is very high gad whatever We are given to supple¬ment our mileage claims is very little. We are left with almost nothing after paying for the petrol. Therefore, we would like to use the services of the Sessional Committee to see that these things are looked into seriously.Another important point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that we have the Standing Orders Committee of this House. We would very much like the Sessional Committee to give powers to the "Standing Orders Committee so that instead of us sitting in the afternoon on Thursdays, we sit in the morning. Ways and means should be looked into to make this possible. I am sure if there would not be any Cabinet sitting in the morning on Thursdays, then this would be possible. I say so because there has been a tendency of having very few hon. Members in the House on Thursdays afternoons as a result of most of them having gone home. Again, those who are late would also like to go home and they end up by driving at night thereby landing in ditches along Nakuru Road, Mombasa Road and so on.So I would like the Sessional Committee to look into this question of our  sitting in the morning on Thursdays very seriously so that hon.Members can go to their homes in the afternoon.With those few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I would like to support the statements expressed by hon. Members with regard to the Sessional Committee.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I appreciate the fact that in nominating representatives to this Committee all factors have been taken into account and that it is balanced. We only expect members do a goodquality job for the House. We do not expect hurried programmes for the House "because this" is a very senior Committee of the House. It is the managing Committee of this. House and, therefore, hon. it Members would expect it to do a good job.	I also wish to congratulate the members previou of the Sessional Committee of the House where we are told attendance was 99 per cent.Hopefully, this one will be 100 per cent this time and that will be a very good performance.I would also like to support what the previous hon. Member has mentioned. Transport costs for hon. Members have become veryprohibitive" and,therefore, the Sessional Committee should look it as an urgent matter. I would also like to add that other issues affecting the welfare of hon. Members should also be considered. I would, in fact, suggest that they should look at the remuneration of hon. Members. Life has "become very expensive. Everything has gone up, and hon. Members are expected to lead people and also to look respectable. But they cannot look respectable unless they are able to do certain things.So with those few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. BUDU: Bw. Spika, kwanza, nakushukuru kwa kunipatia wakati huu ili nami niunge mkono' Ho ja hii ambayo iko mbele ya Bunge.Bw. Spika, ni naami rri kwamba aliyetoa Hoja hii hap a alifanya.

KIILU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Since we have heard the views of hon. Members, could the Mover be now called upon to reply?.</Newspeech> MR. SPEAKER: The decision here lies with hon. Members.      (Question that the Mover be now called upon to reply, put and agreed to)<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Biwott): Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think hon. Members have had an opportunity to comment on the nomination of the members of the Sessional Committee. It is true that the Sessional Committee, as it is at the moment, is heavily tilted towards the Front Bench but, as hon. Members know, the guiding of Government business is normally done by the Front Bench, and this is why we have the Vice-President and Minister for Finance as the Leader of Government Business. However, I would like to support what hon. Wabuge has said with regard to the fact that the question of the representation of the Front and Back Benches should not give the impression the Front Bench is. on one side while the Back Bench is on the other side because we do not have an opposition party in this House nor do we have Nyayo people versus non—Nyayo people. I think all of us are 100 per cent Nyayo people.(Applause)Our guiding principle should only be the best interests of this House and the nation. So, we never we transact business in the Sessional Committee, we will look solely for the best ways and means in which Parliament can enhance the welfare of the people of this country and upholding the dignity of this House. Every idea that is helpful in this respect will be heard. Since the best idea usually prevails, even if such an idea comes- from a Back-bencher, it will carry the day, and this means that the effectiveness of the Sessional Committee will not depend on the number of its members, but on the quality of the contribution offered by each"individual member of the Committee. As you know, there is no. voting in the Sessional Committee. Therefore, the question of the number of its members will not matter because everything the Committee does is done on the basis of concensus as to what is best for everybody.I think the hon. Member for Saboti should be forgiven because I think he has been in the "wilderness" for some time, ana he may not be aware of the enthusiasm with which hon. Members have been taking their responsibilities in the Sessional Committee. I myself have been sitting on the Sessional Committee for some time now, and I can confirm that participation in the Committee is between 90 and 100 per cent, and it is never below 90 per cent.(Applause)     Therefore, we do not really have any problem here.Mr. Speaker, Sir, one hon. Member talked about sitting on Thursday mornings. I think this was hon. Mwamzandi. He said that if we sit on Thursday mornings, we will save the afternoons, but I would like to say that this is not practicable because Thursday mornings are normally reserved for Cabinet meetings. I think we should leave this matter the way it is. Nevertheless, what we ought to do is to ensure that we become responsible because we are elected to sit in this House, and not to come here, briefly and then rush back home. Our people expect us to sit here on Thursday afternoons to transact Parliamentary Business before we leave for home the next day. Hon. Members have already made a move by changing from sitting on Friday mornings to sitting on Wednesday mornings. I would like to appeal to hon. Members to be punctual and ready to sit long hours in this House in order to fulfil their obligations. There is no business in this nation that is more important than Parliamentary Business, and nobody is. more highly regarded than an hon. Member of Parliament. So, I think the dignity of this House should be upheld because it is the supreme organ of our state. Hon. Members should, therefore, live up to this level.I would also like to stress the point that we, in this House, should become responsible in setting the example of Nyayoisra, that is, by appearing to be really united. We should aim at teaching our people what unity, peace and love mean. In other words, we should never be found to be wanting in terms of demonstrating our peaceful intention of being considerate and fighting very hard against tribalism and any other tendencies that drag back our country. In the case of rumour-mongering, for example, I think every hon. Member of Parliament should be in the fore front in attacking all forms of rumour-mongering and offering suggestions as to how Kenya should be run. We have a perfect example that has been set by His Excellency the President, and even if we emulate him 10 per cent, we will achieve what is required of this House.      Hon. Members are aware that this Saturday, there will be a Hararabee funds drive for the Presidential Bursary Scheme. I wonder what they think about this Scheme. Conributions towards the Scheme have been made from various quarters, and I do not know whether Parliament is going to take advantage of the situation and contribute something. I would like to warn hon. Members that this is one of the items that we.1 will be discussing in the Sessional Committee immediately after this Motion has been passed. If there is any contrary view as to what is likely to happen, I would like to hear it right now before we sit and more or less associate ourselves with what every Kenyan is doing.       Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am very happy that hon. Members have started off well this morning, and I have no doubt that they will maintain this spirit throughout this Session.       With these few remarks, Mr. Speaker,. Sir, I beg to move.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. WASIKE—NDOMBI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Arising from the remarks made by the Minister for Energy, who is also the Deputy Leader of Government Business, I would like to say that it has been normal in this House that when we have important occasions such as the one to be held this Saturday, hon. Members contribute to them. The House suggests the sums of money to be contributed by ordinary Members, Assistant Ministers and Ministers, and this money is recovered from our salaries or mileage allowances. I think the Sessional Committee can decide on the figures we should contribute in this case so that this money may be recovered from our resources.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: I fully agree to the suggestion made by hon. Wasike- Ndombi, but we should leave this matter to the Sessional Committee as soon as we approve the list of its members.(Question put and agreed to)Members of the Sessional "Committee will meet immediately at the rise of the House.</Newspeech><Header>ADJOURNMENT</Header><Newspeech>MR.

Procedural Motion which deals with the manner in which we shall be handling private Members Motions in this House. The passing of this kind of Procedural Motion in the past has proved satisfactory and has enabled as many hon. Members as possible to parti¬cipate fully in their private Motions. Therefore, I now commend.this Motion to the House.	With those few remarks, I beg to move.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION (Mr. Munyi) :Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand to second" the Deputy Leader of Government Business in what he has said about this Procedural Motion. With that remark, I beg to second the Motion.                           (Question proposed)does not have to listen to Motions that would appropriately raised at the various district development committees. So, when hem. Members bring Motions to this House, they ought to make sure that those Motions are national and not parochial. With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech>     <Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the hon. Assistant Minister really in order to anticipate debate on Private Members' Motions? He is now trying to tell us what type of Motions we should bring to the House. Is he really in order.</Newspeech>       <Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order Mr. Mang'oli. The hon. Assistant Minister is expressing his opinion but you are entitled to tell the House what your views are regarding that opinion.</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Mbori): Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important for this House to take note of the importance of Private Members' Motions. These Motions touch on the various areas in the country, such as districts, provinces and so on. These Motions are very important to the House and to the nation as a whole and I would therefore like to advise hon. Members to avoid parochialism when they bring their Motions here. This House stands for the interest of the entire nation and therefore all our Motions in his House should look national.With these few remarks, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASIKE— NDOMBI: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I would like to support this Procedure Motion. In doing so, I would like to urge the Government to make store that any Motion that is passed in this House is implemented. I would like to take this opportunity to urge the Members of the Sessional Committee to act as an implementation committee in order to make sure that any Motion passed in this House is implemented. I am saying this because this House, may back in 1983, passed a Motion that all working married women will be entitled to house allowance. I was not in this House at that time, but I know that the House debated and passed the same Motion again in 1984- Mr. Speaker, Sir, today, married women working in the private sector have not realised this payment and I think this is discrimination. You will find that subordinate married women working in the civil service get house allowance but those married women in the senior cadres do not get house allowance and I think this is discrimination between married women in the lower and higher cadres. So, I appeal to Government to make sure that any Motion passed in this House is implemented and if there are any difficulties in so doing, Government should come back to this House and inform hon. Members the type of problems they have come across in trying to implement these Motions With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech>     <Newspeech> MR. MWAMZANTE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would not have liked to speak on this Procedural Motion, but I have decided to speak in order to respond to what hon. Karauri has said in this House regarding Private Members' Motions. As far as I know, any hon. Member is entitled to bring a Motion concerning his constituency, district or province or concerning the nation as a whole, and when he does so, the Motion becomes the property of this House which is entitled to accept or to reject it.When a Motion is passed in this House it is upon the Government to look for ways and means of implementing that Motion. However, we in this House is have been worried about the non-implementation Motions and Questions raised in this House.We ask questions in this House to is help the Minister, the Ministry and even the President to take action where there are malpractices and other forms of corruption. We speak out these things openly so that action is taken to rectify the situation. However,we have seen cases during the last Session where Ministers came here to answer Questions for the sake of answering than. This clearly shows that they do not make any follow up and it is entirely wrong. When we ask Questions here, we intend to assist the Minister and therefore, when the Minister just stands up to reply for	the sake of it, them he is not helping the country or the President, I know that the Minister has the duty to defend his Ministry and members of staff, butwhen any hon. Member makes any allegations here, the Minister should try find out whether these allegations are true or not.Last year we experienced problems like, for example, a Minister standing up to answer a Question for the sake of it. Sow the people have the opinion that nothing is done as far as the Questions raised by the hon. Members are concerned. This is very unfair. We raise Questions here so that action can be taken. This is the only way the Government can run smoothly. In this way, all complaints will be rooted out.With these few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Omido): On a point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Can the hon. Member tell this Souse which Minister came here and answered "bla bla...." to a Question?</Newspeech>(laughter)<Newspeech>MR. MRAMZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have concluded and I support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDEHT (Mr. Onyancha): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. hon. Mwaazandi has not responded to the point of order, raised by hon. Oaido. He should not be let to escape. Be was asked to tell us which Minister came here and answered bla bla ... to a Question? If he does not substantiate, he should be asked to withdraw that remark.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order. What the hon. Member was saying is that Ministers should take Questions seriously.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Omido): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think it is wrong to imply that Ministers do not take Questions raised in this House seriously. I know that the Ministers do not come here to joke but take all Questions very seriously.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order. You should not challenge the Chair.The hon. Member is merely expressing opinion. Let us continue.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASIXE-NDOMBI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. What I am going to raise is in connection with the remarks made by hon. Omido. I asked a Question in this Souse about payment of N.S.S.F. benefits and I was told by the then Assistant Minister for . Labour, Midika, who is now a Minister, that payment would be made on 5"th August, 1989 but to-date, Sir, that particular employee has not been paid. This is why we are complaining.</Newspeech>(applause)<Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order. I do not think that that was really necessary because it is difficult for the. House to prove whether that gentleman has a been paid or not. Let us here what Mr. P.K. Kinyanjui has to say.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the past, hon. Members have complained that the Motions which have, been passed in this House not bra an implemented. It is possible for us to have a follow up system, to show the Motions which have been passed in this House and implemented similar to the one used by the Chair to inform the House a certain Act was debated on and approved. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SOI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for giving me this chance to say a few words on the Private Members Motions. It has been noticed in the past that whenever we are debating Private Members' Motions, the Front 3ench is almost empty. We, the House, demand that when we are debating private Members Motions which are at times disregarded by some Ministers as being minor all the Ministers concerned or at least half of them, should be present in the House to listen to what is being said.Sir, in future, we will not tolerate the absence of Ministerswhen such Motions are being debated. If such a habit persists, it willfarce us to move a Motion to discuss their absence.Another thing is that nobody takes into account the response ofthe Ministers towards Members' Questions For example, during the last Sitting, I asked a Question with regard to roads in my constituency. I was told that the roads in question would be graded within the next two weeks, but up to now, nothing has been done. If that Question was answered by a Minister on behalf of his Ministry, did he tell a lie?That Question was answered by the Minister for Public forks.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL HERITAGE(Mr. Lalazrpaa): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I hate to interrupt the hon. Member who is on the floor but I an sorry he has used the word 'lie' which is unparliamentary. Cam he withdraw it?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SOI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I withdraw the word 'lie'. Now, the  Minister misleading this House by not saying the truth? For example, many Motions brought by the hon. Members were debated and passed and were carried in the newspapers and aired over the radio. The wananchi who elected the hon. Members who raised such Motions applauded, them. The wananchi wait anxiously for the implementation of such Motions but they are shelved instead. Hon. P.K. Kinyanjui suggested that there should be a follow-up with regard to those Motions. I think there should be a follow-up committee of this House so that it can be given power to interrogate the Ministers who just lie in their offices doing nothing. That is my proposal and I will raise it as a Motion because the Ministers just seem to listen as the Motions are being debated, accept them but they never implement them.(applause)I bee to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BISU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for giving me this opportunity to support this Motion. I have a small observation which I want to make before this august House.In the past Ministers have not "been doing enough research on Questions raised in this House before coming to answer them here. I have seen in several"cases that when a Minister does not do his own research on a particular Question his officers-do not give him a proper answer. As we start the Third Session of our Sixth Parliament I would request our a hon. Ministers to ensure that they verify the answers they get from their various offices, instead of relying wholly on the information they are given by those officers. There are many ways in which Ministers" can get proper and correct answers to the Questions raised in this House. They can visit the places about which we complain.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKTDOR: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think it is not good to generalise and say that all Ministers do not bring correct answers to this House. While 3ome of them are terrible in this respect, most of them do a good job.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Sid do I What is your point oforder?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKTDOR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said that it is notgood to generalise and say that all Ministers do not answer Questions correctly.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: I am sure you have been here long enoughto know that is not a point of order! </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sorry that my hon.Colleague did not raise a proper point of order; he should read ourStanding Orders again in order know what a point of order is.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I heard hon. Sir do using the word "terrible". Is this word Parliamentary'".</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: I did not hear him using it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to conclude my  comments by requesting our hon. Ministers who are our comrades, to be very sincere in their answers because we are going to have more Questions during this Session than in the past. We shall expect to be told nothing but the truth. the matters we will raise here. With those few remarks, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. LAGAT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think we have exhausted debate on this Motion. So, I move that the Mover be now called upon to reply.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Well, the decision lies entirely with you, hon. Members. I. will, therefore, put the question.</Newspeech>(Questions that- the Mover be now called upon to reply, put and agreed to)<Newspeech>MR. WASIKE—NDOMBI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. When an hon,. Member wants to interrupt the debate, he stands up on a point of order. Was hon. Lagat in order to take advantage of having been given a chance to speak on the Motion to interrupt the debate?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Yes, he was in order because he aid use that opportunity to first of all debate the Motion and at the eame time move that the Mover be called upon to reply.</Newspeech><Newspeech> THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Biwott): Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think hon. Bidu used the word "comrades", which is crumbling all over the world and becoming archaic.' I hope hon. Members will also update themselves. If hon. Members are so keen that Ministers should serious and up to date in their replies, I think they should also be up-todate in all their terminologies. With these few remarks, Sir, I beg to move. (Question out and agreed to)<Header>PROCEDURAL MOTION</Header>Limitation of Debate - Motions for the Adjournment <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr- Biwott): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the following Motion:-THAT, the debate on any Motion for the Adjournment of the House to a day other than the next normal Sitting Day shall be limited to a miximum of" two hours with not more than five minutes for each Member speaking:-Provided that, when the period of Recess proposed by any such Motion does not exceed nine days, the debate shall be limited to a maximum of thirty minutes, and shall be strictly confined to the question of the adjournment.with those few remarks,. Sir, I beg to move.</Newspeech>     <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Oloo-Aringo): Thank you, Mir. Speaker, Sir. I stand to second this Motion, which is also a procedural one." It is well catered for in our Standing. Orders; it is there to facilitate the work of this House, particularly on Motions for the Adjournment. I" commend it to the House and, therefore beg to second it;-</Newspeech>(Question proposed)<Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to support this Motions I have noted that when the House goes into a long recess hon. Members have to keep on coming to Nairobi to collect their allowances.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZATTDI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am sorry to interrupt my hon. friend. But before we continue, there is something here which worries me, I have one Order Papers on whose top-right-hand corner is indicated "Third Session", and I have another Order Paper where it is indicated "Second Session". I do not know what other hon. Members have to say, but I thought we were in the Third Session. This can be confusing to somebody who is leaving this country today.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Mwamzandi, rest assured we are now in the Third Session.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the hon. Member for his observation. I am sure he is referring to the administration of the Order Papers. Sir, before I interrupted, I wanted to make approposal. Sir, currently there are only twos recess trips allowed by our StandingOrders, but "if a recess period is more than one month, hon.Members have to come to Nairobi to check for their allowances orsalaries regularly. I would therefore like to propose the Sessional Committee to look into the number of trip allowances that should be paid during recess period. Sir, every month that an hon. Member comes to Nairobi, he spends some moneys to travel from his constituency, but there are only two recess trip allowances that are allowed. I would therefore, like to propose that the Sessional committee should sit and review the trip allowances for such periods so that each month there is a recess trip allowances which a member will get when he comes to check for his other allowances. Sir, with those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIILU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to support this Procedural Motion on adjournment, but it is my opinion that during such a Motion, there is big competition because every hon. Member wants to contribute. During debate on suchra Motion, the Ministers come in to contribute and they prevent the Back Benchers from getting a chance to contribute.(Noise )Sir, if the hon. Members are so interested in contributing to the for theMotion for the Adjournment, they should also be present during the other periods so that they can also answer our questions. They should not come to the House only when we have a Motion for the Adjournment of the House With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech>affairs of this country; he also interacts with his own people, no matter what the status of the person is, and no matter what condition the person is in. Sir, we are truly thankful because, due to his leadership we have achieved quite a lot of developments, notably, the discovery of medicine which the rest of the world has been struggling to discover. That medicine will assist in the alleviation of the AIDS disease which has spread to all parts of the world. I would therefore, like to thank His Excellency the President for his leadership in that direction and all those people who participated in the discovery of KEMRON. Sir, this also applies to the invention of the Nyayo cars. This, issue was mentioned by the President during his speech, and I think that you also mentioned it in your speech, Mr. Speaker, Sir.Mr. Speaker, Sir, everything that is good should be looked after. Every valuable thing must kept in proper custody. We must be vigilant. That is why His Excellency the President told us that for us to succeed in this country, we must be vigilant". We must be alert always in order to protect what we already have. In order to do that we must have absolute unity. We cannot allow any defanation or any sluggishness in our quest for unity in this country, because unity is the pillar of our nation. Sir, if we want to be strong, and united, we should get ride of any romours no matter where those rumours come from. We must also avoid intrigues, because to entertain any intrigues is to be impure. Any person who is involved in intrigues is impure himself, and is incapable of being a leader.Sir, we need leaders who are beyond reproach, leaders who recognise their leaders, and those who are also aware that</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION (Mr. Munyi): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

I hope that the hon. Members will take that chance to commend the Government for what it has achieved and also propose useful ideas which they have attempted to raise during the Procedural Motions.With those few remarks, I beg to move.</Newspeech>(Question put and agreed to)<Header>MOTION</Header>Thanks for the Presidential Address<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Biwott): Mr. Speaker,:Sir, I beg to move the following Motion:-THAT, the thanks of this House be recorded for theexposition of public policy contained in His Excellency'Presidential Address from the Chair on 13th March, 1990.Mr. Speaker, Sir, Kenya is a lucky country because it has gat a President who is not only a President, but a person who loves his own people. He is a person who involves himself in thethey are there to protect their own nation. Sir, the other point which His Excellency the President it mentioned, which was very important, was that x at all times we must be truthful . We must be truthful to oursevles and to what we say and do. It is only the truth that can withstand, and last. Our own leaders are supposed to be truthful, and if they are truthful, then they can be sure that they are providing justice to this country. If we have a just and fair play, a Kenya will always be stable, and it will always sustain any temptations to disrupt its tranquility. Therefore, what we need is justice, fair play, visions and hope for the future. If we forget about the future, we might be careless today, and therefore wreck the future. All these things requires soldiers, who are the hon. Members of Parliament, members of the public mothers, children and even the disabled. They should be vigilant, and ready to defend the hard worn Uhuru of this country, the territorial integrity of this country, and the prestige and honour of this country.Sir, we cannot cheat ourselves that we do not have any a enemies. We have very many enemies who are jealous of our success. We have some enemies who are actually the prophets of the devil,while others are sadists, and others do not want to see anything good from our country. Therefore, we should all be alert and make sure that enemies do not distruct this country. We should always follow what the President has asked us to do. We should be mindfull of other peoples welfare.should be Nyayo people,, people who cherish peace, love others and unity above all things. We can see from what he himself has done. He has preached about peace everywhere in this country, so much so that the rest of the world has heard about that peace, and that is people come to Nairobi to hold their peace talks here. The Sudanese people come here to for peace, thanks, as well as the Angolans, Ethiopians and many other people. They all want to share that peace that we have in this country. The President has also talked about love. The spirit of reconciliation is being sought all over the world, and it can only be prompted by love. Unity lacks all over the world, yet, we process those three important things as Kenyans. Therefore, since Kenyans have that unity, we must cherish and protect it. Some other people have lost it, and they are looking, for it.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Presidential Address was very much encouraging and it will provide us with the spirit that will enable us to lead our nation to many years of peace and progress.Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was really pathetic and shameful and a terrible 1st thing to see our own people succumb to mass hysteria following the untimely death of Dr. Robert Ouko. People were running around hysterically and they were also gossiping a lot. Even the most responsible people engaged themselves in gossip. These responsible people do not realise that they are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that nothing like that happens. We are very- sure that the perpetrators of such acts were very, very few people. There people with ill motives. His Excellency the President, in his Speech, said that these are people with ill motives whose intention is to ruin this country.' But what is so surprising is that we have become very careless and we take everything for granted. We have laid ourselves open to go by default. You could see from the way people were moving and from the kind of rumours that were spreading everywhere that some people were really hoping that things would go wrong in this country.' I think the time has come for every leader to stand up and fight for any elements who are bent on creating chaos in this country. If such a situation had been allowed to continue we would perhaps have ended up in a situation which we would not desire to have. So, it is really important that we should guard ourselves against complacency. This is because complacency is something which creeps in without anybody noticing. It is therefore our duty to make sure that we safeguard our Uhuru. We must safeguard our Independence and territorial intergrity and above all we must safeguard the peace that we have in this country.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must safeguard that development that we have so far achieved in this country. We must also safeguard the organizations and institutions that we have in this country and that are difficult to find in other countries.Mr. Speaker, Sir, earlier on some hon. Members talked about seriousness in our work. This is something that is really wanting. We must be serious in everything we do in this House. All of us in this House, Sack-benchers as well as Front-bencher must be serious in whatever we do so that each individual becomes an agent of progress and a shining star which must shine and guide this country to greater heights of developments This, therefore, demands that every Member of Parliament must study Bills carefully. Hon. Members must read Bills many times so as to know exactly what the Bill is seeking to achieve. Each one of us must refer back to other Bills to see what has gone wrong so that when debates take place on Bills in this House our contributions will be relevant" and helpful to the cause for which the Bill has been drafted.      Mr. Speaker, Sir, Questions form another aspect of our Business, in this House. Hon. Members who ask Questions, mainly from the Backbench, should be serious about the Questions they are asking.  They must also know exactly what needs to be known. They should be in a position to accept answers that are relevant to what they are asking. This is "because there are Questions which are asked for the sake of asking. The Members of the Front bench answer Questions because they have to be a answered. However, Back-benchers ask Questions and they expect a particular type of answers. So, I plead with the House that we should be very serious with the Questions and the Motions we move in this House and particularly the Private Members Motions. I was very pleased to hear that the hon. Members are concerned about the non-implementation of Motions passed in this House.But if hon. Members bring in Motions that are practically impossible to implement then it is no proper to expect any action. So, I would really appeal to hon. Members to raise relevant issues and be reasonable so that if the Government accepts a Motion. We sometimes accept Motions after amending them. The amendment is intended to make the Motion workable. In fact the Front Bench has been very helpful. This is because we amend Motions to make implementation possible. So, let us all strive to deal with Motions that are actionable. We should also be concerned about the development programmes and plans in this country. We should study these documents well in order to understand them. We should a also be involved in the implementation of development programmes especially at the district level. Every hon. Member should be knowledgeable about his own district. Members should thoroughly understand the projects they ask Questions about in this House. This is because the people who elected us to this House will be listening to what is being said in this House. So, hon. Members should raise relevant, actionable and reasonable matters in this House.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the annual reports and accounts of various parastatals and Ministries are Tabled in this House every year. I hope that the hon. Members will look at those annual reports and accounts and study them and be able to contribute effectively during the deliberations of the Public Accounts Committee and the Public Investments Committee and so on.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the same goes for the laws.' When we. bring amendments to laws in this House it is important that hon. Members should understand those laws being amended so as to be able to contribute effectively to the debates. It is us who enact those laws in this House and it is very important that we understand them properly. We should also try to set good examples outside in trying to conform to those laws. This is because we must practise our own laws so that our people can learn from us.Mr. Speaker, Sir, every hon. Member is expected to be knowledgeable about current affairs; he must know as many things- as possible so as to be able to lead his fey constituents. This is because if you know less than the people you lead you will find, your¬self trailing behind the people whom you are supposed to lead will lead you and at the end of the day you will find yourself in difficulties. So, hon. Members of Parliament should be very  brilliant people; they should be shining stars in this country. I do not think that is a difficult thing because I believe that all of you here are brilliant people; all of you have fought it fierce election battles. It is-not an easy-.thing to be elected into this House; it is a difficult thing and that is why you are so sane valuable in this House. So, let us hope that we will not be fighting election battles all the time." Let us work so hard that our "own people will acknowledge what we are doing re-elect us so that we can become more and more effective in building this nation.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do believe sincerely we must strive to know who we are. We must realise that we are leaders. So, an hon. Member should be very knowledgeable about his roles as a leader so as to provide sound leadership. He should know what leadership entails. I say this because leadership carries an awful lot of responsibilities.' It also carries an awful lot of risks.Mr. Speaker, Sir, recently a certain District Commissioner told me that when students were demonstrating following the death of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation, Dr. Robert Ouko, he looked for Members of Parliament to come and talk to the students and none of them was willing, to stand and talk to the students. So, the District Commissioner himself had to stand and address the students. So, you can see that the District Commissioner, was much more courageous than the Members of ± Parliament. We do not need to see a situation like that one. We would like to see the District Commissioner writing his reports and supporting hon. Members in matters of development. All hon. Members should be in the front line in every battle. If anybody is. threatened In this country we would like to see all hon. Members moving to the forefront to defend that person.Mr. Speaker, Sir, hon.1 Members called for the formation of an Implementation Committee. I think if establish such a committee, it will be turned in a "Witch-hunting Committee." I think it is better to be responsible and it is good for us to know what our duties are and it is better for us to accept our duties wholeheartedly and fully and to be committed to our work 24 hours a day.I also do agree with the hon. Members that there is no business that is bigger or more important than the Business of this House. We are elected by our people to come to this House, sit here and participate fully in the deliberations of the House, and to represent their interests adequately. So, there is really no excuse for us not to be here all the time. I therefore, appeal to hon. Members to see to it that we leave, all the other businesses aside when Parliament is sitting. Let us all sit here and listen to each other making-contributions. Let us also play our own roles individually by contributing to whatever Business in on. Let us provide that leadership so that the people will know that we are serious about our Parliament. Let us make sure that there will be no quorum problems.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I. was saying that the Implementation Committee, if it is allowed, might be genuine. We had one before. It is not that the Government, had not thought about it. We had. thought about it, but when it came to implementing it, it was found out that it was not: really workable- because there is nothing more important than a person, through his own mind  his own conscience - committing himself to do a job properly so that he does not need to be supervised. If we follow what His Excellency the President told us in. the Presidential Address, it means that we will be truthful and whatever we will be doing will be the right thing. Therefore there will be no need for a supervisor. The moment we accept to be supervised will mean that we have failed in our own obligation to serve our people in the manner we are supposed to.Hon. Members have also talked about their salaries, to those items whose prices have gone up. I also heard hon. Members talk about the need to have their mileage allowance increased because of the increase in the prices of petroleum products. I am, perhaps,more concerned about oil prices because I am responsible for oil. But I would like to inform this House and the country as a whole that the prices of oil products are largely determined by external factors. It is the suppliers of. that oil who determine the prices. If the price of crude oil goes up, we have no choice but to accept it. These oil prices are also determined by the fluctuations in foreign currency rates. If the rate of the dollar versus the Kenyan Shilling goes up and down, if affects the price of oil. So, there is the problem of choice. We could either resist the price increases and risk being short of the product, or to accept to do something about the price and have the supplies necessary for our own economy I think the. choice is clear-cut. To everybody's fair judgement, it is better to have the oil than not to have, it. It is better to have it even at a high . price than to resist the high price and have an acute shortage. As you. know,, oil is very important, it is, a prime mover. Without it, we cannot drive any car, all the trains, matatus, and ploughs-will come to a stop. And if everything comes to s stop like that, then the country will be placed in a very difficult situation. But if the commodity is available, though at a higher price, it will mean less consumption,, but at least some prime moving activities will continue and the economy will take off. I thought I should explain that so that the hon. Members and those others who have been talking about this problem can see that the problem goes far beyond our own abilities.With those few remarks, I beg to move.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Aringo): Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to preface my remarks by once again paying tribute to the late Dr. Ouko, an accomplished Parliamentarian, a dedicated patriot and nationalist, and a good friend of us all here. He was a friend and colleague and I think we will clearly miss his smiles, his normal interactions with us and his lively participation in the Business of this House.Let me also take this opportunity to thank His Excellency the President and the Government for all the steps they have taken to unravel the truth surrounding Dr. Ouko's tragic death. I want to say that it is the President who led this country through a very difficult and trying time. It has been a very difficult and trying time because this tragic death caused genuine anger and sorrow and we should not gloss over that because it could be Dr. Ouko today and somebody else tomorrow. Those who know something about this cannot, be interested in unity, peace and stability We condemn the murder as well as those who might be behind it. But we thank the President for his leadership in this very trying time. After all, leadership is measured when there is sunshine and when -there rain; when it is calm and when there is a storm, and this country's institutions and systems, were being tested in this very difficult time Our survival is also a measure of maturity. Many countries, could have cracked and collapsed and institutions could have failed to measure up. with the demands of the. management of a complex system such as the State. But the people of Kenya, manifested their maturity.. That they have come through this is an act of maturity. And we must rise as a people and show that Maturity in difficulty as well as when we are on a honeymoon. And not many times are we going to have honeymoons- But we must rise.Those who aimed to divide this country along tribal lines to promote ethnic confrontation failed. And I want to congratulate my colleagues and leaders from Nyanza Province for rising to the occasion and taking a stand that people should not exploit the situation to plant seeds of discord and disunity in this country and therefore, wreck what we have tried to build. Buildings require architects and professionals to wreck them require mad people such that if you want to pull down this building, you do not have to go to the experts, everybody can pull down a stone. We, as Kenyans, must avoid making attempts to wreck what we are trying tobuild. Painful as this experience-is, let us learn something from it -that those who promoted such activities are not in the interest of Kenyathey are not interested in national unity. I will quote the operativeparagraph which His Excellency the President included in his beautifulremarks to this. House yesterday:-Hon. Members of this House will in particular have to set the pace in consolidating our unity..And, indeed, in this crisis, hon. Members have consolidated that unityby rising above tribalism and ethnic confrontation, and institutions havesurvived. Even though we are under pains, we are suggesting that thesociety is greater than any one of us. I will continue to quote theparagraph: -There, is no room in the present-day Kenya for personality clashes and hollow accusations. Political intrigue is of no benefit to anyone. As hon. Members of this House, we should uphold truth at all times and place the interest of this nation before our own.And I want to thank the President again for assuring this country that notruth will be left unturned in unravelling the truth surrounding this tragic death.Why do we support our President? Because first and foremost he is transparent. He leads this country in a transparent manner or through transparent management. The people of Kenya can see through their President by his sincerity honesty, dedication, patriotism and nationalism. It is this transparency which adheres the people of Kenya to their President. We should always ask ourselves the following: questions: Are we as leaders of public opinion good disciples of our beloved President? Are we transparent? Are we genuinely condemning tribalism or are we condemning it in day time and doing other things at night? If we are churchmen are we preaching national unity? Where we honest in dealing with, the public or do we see the public as a nuisance?These are the questions, Sir, which will onsolidate the aims and objectives of the Independence struggle in enya. Let me here recapitulate one or two of these aims. One of the aims of our Independence struggle was to restore the dignity of our people by abolishing, poverty in all forms and make life liveable by providing basic needs. We have said in the context of Africa that we abhor and hate apartheid. It is apparent in the Presidents Speech that we shall continue to dimantle that corner¬stone. Kenya's policy under President Mai has been correct. We, are one country that gave diplomatic recognition to the African National Congress (A.N.C.) and have continued to support that struggle. We must not only be proud that this first step has been taken but we must also move on to the next step in supporting sanctions against South Africa until apartheid is dismantled. That is the message in the President's Speech which is the expression of the people of Kenya and it is also the nlightened leadership that His Excellency the President has given us.His Excellency the President has talked about the need"for Kenya to move to the industrial stage. We have all see how the President has overhauled the education system to lay the basis for scientific and technological society. We have also seen the strength that we have given to the universities and research institutions. We are how proud that our research findings are being recognised the whole world over. The discovery of the Kemron drug is a breakthrough. So let us count our blessings while we look at some of our shortcomings, The resent car that was manufactured by Kenyans using Kenyan resources is something to be proud of because it is something that is leading us towards the industrial stage. Why are we modernising agriculture? We are doing so to improve food production. Thailand which is a small country ,supplies 45 per cent of the rice consumed in the world. We also can do the same. What do we need to achieve this? The basis of that success is irrigation. We must and need to apply irrigation technology in our agricultural activities. This is what we learnt when we went to Thailand and a number of countries in South East Asia. Through, proper management of our water resources the country will not only be self-sufficient in food production but we shall also have a surplus and become a net exporter of agricultural products.        Mr. Speaker, Sir, this should be the pre—occupation of leaders in this country and not personality clashes or whether somebody has big eyes or small eyes. These are irrellevant. So long as the eyes are functional the personality of a person does not matter. Unfortunately some of us brood too much on personality clashes like, say, somebody has big buttocks while another has smaller ones. It is a unfortunate that such issues become big discussions over lunch. Some people dislike others not because they are going to bring something new in terms of improving the skills of the peoplebut rather in terms of how they can get over others and sit on them. We cannot succeed through personality clashes. We should instead address ourselves to the issues of development for the present and future generation.Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the field of. agriculture we have done a lot in improving our seeds and the extension services. This should be our pre-occupation at the district and divisional level. It should also be the agenda in this House. We should, address ourselves to issues that are of great importance to us.Let me say, Sir, that Kenya is on the verge of industrial take—off. We can become an industrial state although we do not have to be the size of the United States of America, Japan, the United Kingdom or West Germany. We have new industrial countries like Korea, Taiwan, China, India, Canada and Brazil. Kenya should join the ranks of medium industrial states because- we have the capacity to do it. This should be our agenda. If we did so then we would be supporting our President in elevating the standard of living of our people and providing them with the knowledge and skills for this century and the century beyond. This is the reason why this country is investing colossal sums in education because we believe in the human resource. We believe that if we train our people and give them the capacity they will manage this country.With those few remarks, I beg to second.</Newspeech>(Question proposed)<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR RESEARCH, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (Mr. Mihoho) Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity first to join the previous speakers in paying great tribute to the late Dr. Robert Ouko, a great son of this republic and indeed a very loyal and steady-fast member of His Excellency the President's Government.In mourning Dr. Ouko, I hope that the lessons he gave in life shall be emulated by all of us who love this nation and use them to benefit our own contributions to this nation in the future. In mourning him we also condemn any acts of violence and any person who might have wanted to hijack the emotions of the nation and the genuine anger that was recorded all over the country and the shock of his death. We also condemn any person or group of persons who might have wished to hijack the genuine sentiments of the people so as to create ill motives or ill feeling to other people,institutions or the Government. We strongly condemn such callous acts. We are confident of the promise the President that no stone shall be left unturned until the perpetrators of this crime are brought to justice. We also confident that the Government is committed towards this direction.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency the President for the exposition of public policy in his address on State Opening of Parliament yesterday. In his brief statement he gave us his ideas on what this country stands for and what is expected of this Parliament; during this Third Session.In his Speech, the President was consistent as he has always been in matters of right and just Government of the people of Kenya.       Indeed he appealed to both this House and to the nation to use everybody's conscience in the exercise of our duties as public servants. Nothing short of the very clear conscience of every individual will make us go anywhere near success. Unless every person is honest and true to himself to challenge his own conscience in private and in public" unless every individual does what one has to do in private and in public for the good of this country, we will never succeed.We have gone past the stage of pollution. We are an indepe¬ndent state; we are a democracy and, indeed, democracy calls for responsibility and personal integrity. That is what His Excellency the President pleaded for yesterday both in his Address and in some of the off-the-cuff remarks he made. He went directly to appeal for that conscience on every individual.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the people of this country are with His Excellency the President because he speaks and acts with his cons¬cience, and his conscience is in the service of the people, of this country. That is why His Excellency the President carries the people" with him. Therefore, the rest of us are very transparent to the people, and unless our actions and our own words match, people will see us through. So in appealing for that conscience of the public leadership, we are doing so because we know that is the wish of the people of this country.Most of us, Mr. Speaker, Sir, who are in the research and scientific community want specifically and very specially to thank His Excellency the President for the support he has given us and the leadership he has given us in the research activities of this country.In his Address yesterday, he did give us honour again in men¬tioning some of the positive results of research. Kemron is a very major breakthrough in research. For a long time, a lot of people were doubting Thomases as to whether this was ever going to be another hoax or whether it was indeed going to be supported by the world community. The fact that the World Health Organisation (WHO) has come out publicly to endorse the efforts of Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) in the discovery of Kemron and also the fact that WHO is collaborating with us so as to have the drug tried in other centres around the world is a sign of the seriousness of our research efforts.We stand to thank those good friends and, indeed, Mr: Speaker, I, as Minister responsible for Research, Science and Technology, want to pay very special tribute to our own friends because they have made us proud. They made Kenyans stand tall, because of their dedication, devotion and. perseverance. This has taken many years. This has been an effort in the more or less long dark alleys of research laboratories, but indeed their perseverence has now made Kenya a proud member of the scientific community.Indeed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not the only area of research Kemron is only one area of research. There are several other aspect of research where breakthroughs have been made, and we commend those other areas.. Be it in the traditional areas of research of the seed Kenya has made some very dramatic discoveries and, indeed, a formula¬tion of seeds, be it in the maize or wheat fields, or be it in the areas like coffee. The "Ruiru 11" is one of the fast heralded and praised varieties of coffee and yet it is one variety that is a very, very major breakthrough in the world. It is the first time anywhere in the world that a scientific community has come up with a variety of coffee that is resistant to Coffee Berry Disease (C.B.C.)That was a major achievement and I know our friends both in the Continent and elsewhere, are trying very hard to get some of the seeds so that they can go and propagate them in their own countries. We know there have been efforts even to smuggle them out of the country and that, in itself, is a recognition of the efforts we are doing.        Mr. Speaker, Sir, in treating some of these issues, I would like to appeal to the Press to be responsible too. It is very dis¬heartening when we know of a composition like Kemron very serious achievement of our scientists to have it is taunted along by some of the members of the Press as just another "Mitishamba" affair. This is not a joke.          As you had seen in the Press yesterday and today, Mr. Speaker,Sir, I was personally misquoted having said that we are going to reward a particular "mitishamba" person because he contributed in the making of Eemron. This is absurd because I was on television myself and I explained the origin and composition of Eemron. I was giving a Press Conference and I was asked questions; by members of the same newspaper. I am not a loose talker. So how do I go all of a sudden and change the policy and suggest that there is any connection, between Eemron and herbalists? Indeed, herbalists do a serious job, but in this particular case they did nothing and they had no contribution. So we would like an element of seriousness, otherwise we shall consider some of these newspapers work as sabotage. There are some people who do not believe in he seriousness of our research.	Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Ogle): Ahsante sana, Bw. Spika, kwa kunipatia fursa hii ili nami niweze kuungana mkono na wenzangu Wabimge waliotangulia kumshukuru na kumpongeza Mtukufu Rais kwa Hotuba yake aliyoitoa katika Bunge hili jana.Kama ilivyojiesturi yake ya kila siku, Mtukufu Rais. ame kutupatia mawaidha ya kutosha. Alisimama hana yeye mwenyewe na. kutoa mawaidha ya hekima haliyeuwa nayo, na haifai hayapaswi mtu mwingine kuongeza, maneno mengine yoyote ila tu nrfcu, kama vile mhe. Oloo Aringo alivyosema, nd. kusoma, kufahamu na kutekeleza yale aliyo- tueleza hapa.	Baada ya kusema haypy, Bw. Spika, ningependa kuchukua furs a hii kuungana na wenzangu Wabunge komkumbuka ndugu yetu mpenzi ali ye aga hivi" majuzi. Pia nachukua fursa hii kuwashukuru na kuwa pongeza viongozi wote na ndugu wetu wa ijyanza kwa kuweza kusimaaa imara zaidi wakati huu wa msiba. Hii ni kwa sababu nina haki ka kwamba kama hawa ndugu wetu wa Nyanza hawakusimama imara na kuli saidia taifa hili na kuungana na wananchi wengine wa Kenya, basi wale maadui wetu ambao walikuwa na mambo yao ya uchochezi na kui chafua nchi hii wa.ki.wa na nia ya kuwagawanya watu wangepata nafasi kubwa zaidi ya kufanya hivyo.Baada ya kusema hayo, Bw. Spika, ningetaka tu kogusia kidogo juu ya yale yaliyotajwa na Mtukufu Hais, Waziri Oloo-Aziingo na pia Waziri siaa.. Biwott kuhusu uvumi. Kwa kawaiaa, uvromi hauna nia nyingj fdz. Uvami wa juzi ambao ulikuwa umetambaa kote nchini Kenyaulikuwa na nia moja. uvumi huu ulikuwa na nia ya kutupotosha, ama kuipotosha Serikali, kufuata na kuweza kuhakikisha na kupata thibitish, kuhusu kilichosababisha kifo cha mare he era Daktari Ouko.Palikuwa na nia ya kubekua uchunguzi kamili uliofaa kusudi tusiupate ukweli wa yale mambo ambayo yalifanyika, na hata sasa maofisa wetu wa usalama na wale wengine walioagizwa kuja hapa na Mtukufu Rais kutoka ng'ambo bado wanaendelea kuiambia nchi hii kila hatua wanayochukua katika uchunguzi wao.Bw. Spika, kuna mambo fulani hapa ambayo tunapaswa kuyasema wazi wazi kabisa. Kwa mfano, utaona kwamba wakati polisi walipofanya uchunguzi na kuwakamata wale watu ambao walihusika na uvumi eti kwamba Serikali imefanya hivi na vile, waliyatoa majina ya ajabu sana. Mmojawapo wa.watu: hawai ni. Mungai, ambaye alikuwa assistant commissioner wa polisi. Sioni haya kusimama hapa na kutoboa kwamba Mungai akisema eti kwamba kuna mtu fulani anayehusika na uuaj i wa Waziri, taifa hili na dunia nzima inajua kwamba Mungai ndiye "baba" wa wauaji wote na kuwa yeye ni "ngoroko" mkubwa sana aliyetenga silaha zake akiwa na nia ya kuwamaliza viongozi wote katika nchi hii.Mtu mwingine ni Gethi, ambaye alikuwa commissioner wa polisi katika nchi hii. Gethi. alitajwa kinaganaga kabisa kuwa alihusika na uuaji wa marehemu J.M. Kariuki.. Yeye ndiye aliyekuwa mtu wa mwisho kuonekana pamoja na marehemu J.M. Kariuki. Wakati huo, sikuwa nimeingia katika siasa. Kamati Teule ya Bunge ilithibitisha kwamba Ben Gethi ndiye aliyekuwa mtu wa mwisho kuonekana pamoja na marehemu J.M: Kariuki. Ben Gethi anafaaje kukaa na watu ndani ya baa na kusema eti, "Fulani ndiye amemwua Dkt. Ouko"? Yeye ni nani? Kwa sababu kesi haizeeki, ninahimiza kwamba.uchunguzi mpya ufanywe ili tujue vile Gethi alihusika na uuaji wa marehemu J.M. Kariuki. Hatuwezi kuwakubalia watu walioshusha ghasia katika nchi hii hapo zamani watukatize katika mambo yetu.Ngumba ni mwizi kabisa. Katika mawakilisho yangu kuna madereva, turn—boys na makarani ambao bado wanahangaishwa na vitabu vya hesabu vya kampuni ya Ngumba, na hawana habari kwamba Ngumba amekwisharudi hapa tayari kwa sababu huko kwetu hakuna magazeti. Mtukufu Rais anajishughulisha na kuwatafutia rawizi huyu ambaye aliwaibia, pesa zao ndipo watu hawa waweze kuwalipia karo watoto wao na kuyatimiza manitaji mengine. Ngumba ana shughuli. nyingi destablising Serikal ya Mtukufu Rais wakati ambapo Mtukufu Rais anashughulika na kuyarekebisha yalematokeo ya wizi alioufanya Ngumba. Ninaiomba Serikali imsamehe Ngumba kwa dhambi yake ya kuiahlnirjichi hii, lakini isimsamehe kwa kuwaibia watu mali yao ya kibinafsi. Polisi wanafaa kuchukua jukumu la kuliangalia jambo hili.Jambo lingine, Bw. Spika, ni kwamba ninafikiri tuliwapa polisi uwezo rakubwa sana katika kuwaoji watu. Tuliwapa uwezo wa kumhoji mtu kwa muda wa siku 14 ikiwa anashukiwa kuhusika na uahini. Kwa sababu kueneza uvumi ni kosa la kuahini, haifai kumhoji mshukiwa kwa masaa matano tu. Ikiwa umemshika mtu kwa kumshuku kuwa anajiuzisha na uahini, uchunguzi wa masaa matano utafaa nini? Watu hawa wana mazoea fulani, nasi tumekuwa tukiwaonea huruma sana, lakini hatufai kuwa tukipiga domo tu juu ya watu watano au sita. Mambo haya yalianza wakati watu fulani waliposema eti Mungu anakaa katika hema, na hali hema ni kitu kidogo sana. Uvumi uliendelea mpaka ukamhusu Ngumba.Kile ambacho ningesema ni kwamba kuna mambo mengi ambayo yanafanana, na polisi wanaofanya uchunguzi wanfaa kuyaangalia. Kuna ile Law Review magazine ya Gitobu Imanyara. Magazeti kama Beyond na. Financial Review yalipigwa marufuku. Kila kitu kilichorao katika Law Review ni subversive,, na mmojawapo wa waandishi wake ni Gibson Kamau Kuria. Gazeti ili linaitusi Serikali. Gitobu Imanyara alisema kwamba wale watu wa Tent of the Living God walinyimwa haki yao ya kumwabudu Mungu, na hii ni kwa sababu aliiba, akafungwa na hawezi kushughulika na practice yake ya sheria. Kwa sababu watu wanapenda kuyanunua gazeti hili Isnys uvumi, Gitobu Imanyara, at the expense of the stability of this country, anapenda kuandika mambo ambayo yanaikashifu Serikali ili watu waendelee kulinunua gazeti lake. Kuna kikundi cha watu kama Muite na Gibson Kamau Kuria katika Law Society of Kenya, na hatuwezi kuficha jambo hili. Polisi hawafai kuhangaishwa na kitu kimoja tu bali wakiona kwamba kitu fulani kimetokea, wanafaa vitu vingine ambavyo vinafanana na kile ambacho kimetokea. Katika Law Society of Kenya, kuna kundi lile nimetaja, bali sijasikia waheshimiwa Wabunge wakisema hivi hapa. Bunge hili linadharahuliwa sana na gazeti la Law Review.Ningependa kusema tena vile mhe. Oloo-Aringo alivyosema, kwamba watu wanafaa kuonekana kindani kama Mtukufu Rais. Wananchi wa Kenya kulevijijini wana imani asilimia 100 katika Mtukufu Rais isipokuwa tu wale ambao wanajulikana. Kuna msemo unaosema kwamba wakati. mtu ana haja na bibi yako, hata ukimpa binti yako hawezi kumkubali hata ingawa msichana huyu ndiye kijana. Watu hawa hawaridhika hata wakipewa nini, na ni jukumu la Wanakenya wote kushirikiana-kwa sababu watu hawa ni wachache tu. Mimi na watu wangu, hata ingawa tulianza kuonekana hivi majuzi tu,. tutasimama imara huku tukimjua yule aliyetushirikisha na Wanakenya wengine- ndugu zetu.Kwa haya machache sana, Bw. Spika, ningependa kusema.kwamba wananchi wanafaa kusimama imara kulilinda taifa hili.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to join my colleagues, firstly, in thanking His Excellency the President for his great qualities of leadership. There is hardly any area of development of the country in which His Excellency the President has; not: been in the fore front. In agriculture, for example, he has played a. very important role, encouraging the development of our economy. In education. His Excellency the President has spearheaded the building of many schools in various parts of the country. In this respect, he has also spearheaded the establishment of our four public universities which are playing a very important role in developing our human resources. However, I would only like to concentrate on a few points.We have been requested on many occasions to be mindful of the less fortunate people in our society. This has been the theme of many speeches that His Excellency the President has delivered on many occasions. I would like to appeal to my colleagues here, particularly those in Government Ministries, to consider what their role is in assisting the country. If I may give one example, I would like to make a special appeal to the Ministry of Public Works to assist the people of Gikambura.Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a tarmac road between Thogoto and Gikambura, which has been completely worn out. I thank the Ministry of Public Works because it voted the money for the reconstruction of this road.</Newspeech>(Hon. Muturia crossed the Floor without bowing at the Bar)<Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for the Assistant Minister to cross from one side of the Chamber to the other without first going up to the Bar and bowing to the Chair?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: He is not in order!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: That is not in order, but I did hot see him do that. An hon. Member is supposed to cross at the: Bar after bowing to the Chair.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, before that interruption, I was appealing to our good Ministry of Public Works</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker,. Sir. Would it not have been in order for the Assistant Minister to apologise to the House for having crossed the Floor at the wrong area so that the dignity of this House is maintained? Since this House is the one which makes laws, its dignity should be observed and, therefore, the hon. Assistant Minister should respect the House and apoligise for what he has just done.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Muturia): Mr. Speaker,. Sir, I made sure that I walked up to the Bar and I bowed to the Chair before I crossed the Floor. It is only this hon. Member who is trying to make false allegations against me.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the hon. Assistant Minister trying to challenge your ruling? You did say that he might have crossed the Floor at the wrong place, and we did see him do it. Is he trying to impute that we are also becoming</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: He should apologise!</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Muturia): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am just confirming what the Chair has said, that one should walk up to theBar, bow to the Chair and then cross the Floor. I did not say that I was challenging the ruling of the Chair. Indeed, I was just confirming what you said.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Muturia); He is a rumour-monger!</Newspeech>(Laughter)<Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The hon. Assistant Minister has made the matter even worse by saying that I am a rumour-monger. Can he withdraw that remark because it is a very serious one? This country has been undergoing a period of rumour-mongering where His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance has. been said to be dead. The Assistant Minister must withdraw; that: remark and apologise so that the people of Webuye can be assured "that I am not part and parcel of this rumour-mongering.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Muturia, of. course, I do not think you have referred to the distinguished hon. Member for Webuye as a rumour-monger.. Hon. Members of Parliament do not rumour-monger around.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Muturia): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to apologise to the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: Hear! Hear!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: All right. Carry on, Mr. P.K. Kinyanjui.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I sincerely hope that during this Session there will be fewer interruptions of this nature. Before that interruption, I was appealing to the Ministry of Public Works to assist the people of Gikambura who have been put in a very difficult position. At the moment, bus services between Thogoto and Gikambura have been withdraw because the road connecting the two areas, which has previously been tarmacked, has become completely impassable. If we are to follow what we have been told by His Excellency the President, I expect the Ministry of Public Works to be mindful of the welfare of the residents of Thogoto and Gikambura, who have had this important bus service withdrawn. I am not blamingthe Ministry but I am simply appealing to them to have mercy on these people who are suffering because they are finding it difficult to travel from their homes to their places of work.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have been asked to refrain from porojo because porojo retards development. We would like to see bur leaders concentrating on development activities rather than concentrating in attacking each other throught Press every day. The newspapers in this country appear to relish in writing about squabbles among leaders, and we would appeal to them to write more about development. I was at a meeting where we talked a lot about the development of education but, unfortu¬nately, there was a small squabble among the leaders present at the meeting, and that is what was reported by the Press. I am sure that hon. Members would agree with me that the time has come when*, not only leaders but also other sectors like the Press should assist in highlighting development activities instead of highlight¬ing squabbles.Sir, I would like to. conclude my contribution by appealing to all hon. Members to forget the past and concentrate on development activities of this country as we have been requested by His Excellency the President. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT (Mr. Otwani): Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker,. Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my hon. colleagues, first on a note of mourning the late Dr. Robert Ouko.. I would like to commend His Excellency the President and. ail Kenyans for proving beyond doubt that Kenya is a rock" and not a sponge easy to punch like some people would wish to believe. On that note, I would like to call upoin any international and local agent of discord to please stop testing His Excellency the President. Our President is unbeatable; he is a combination of millions of Kenyans. Instead of testing the President, those local and international agents of discord should try to prove their worth. Let them stop testing a man that has gone beyond testing.Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President called upon us to uphold truth, justice and unity. If we are going to achieve or realise, this goal, we must stop, and call upon all nationals to stop, paying lip service to the principles and the spirit of Nyayo. I think it is the high, time that all of us- started to know the Nyayo philosophy properly. If need be, we should study the Nyayo Philosophy a little more and act Nyayo. That way, I believe, we shall reduce the so many abuses that confront us every day. I have in mind abuses of speech,, abuses of Press, action and even abuses of worship, which lead to untruth, injustice, personality clashes, political intrugues and even elimination of personalities.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to go ahead and comment on the various challenges that our beloved President has presented to us. I would like, first of all, to touch oh one of these challenges, that is, our new 8 4 4 system of education. I want, to take this, opportunity to caution: the many Kenyans who have started worry¬ing about the 8—4—4 system of education because of the apparent poor examination results of 1989.A lot of questions have been raised following those results; questions whichhave challenged the system. I was a teacher when this system was introducedand one would be quite right in saying that the system was properly introduced.At that time, the Ministry of Education organized a lot of seminars for theteachers and the members of the inspectorate department underwent a good numberof courses. Most of us still remember the amount of campaign that was undertakenbefore introducing this system. However, all systems do have their own problems Although the Kenya Examinations Council went to the extent of sending questions long before the examination started, we know that a few teachers and studentsdid not take things seriously. However, as I have already said, this system was properly introduced and everybody really went out of his way including the teachers parents and leaders to ensure that the system was properly introduced.Mr. Speaker, Sir, perhaps same of the problems arose due to the change of the system itself and if this is the case, then we must give the system more time to mature. If you consider the number of subjects that people seem to be complaining about, it is hardly different from the number of subjects that the Advanced Level students visited to take. Although these students were doing three or four subjects, in terms of paper work, they used to do as much as the students currently sitting for the K.C.S.E. So, I think we should be more patient and allow the system more time to mature. However, I would like to call upon the Ministry to "be consistent in this system. For example, there have "been many changes in Mathematics and English and these changes have shocked many Kenyans. However, if the system we have already established was given more time, it would stabilize and consequently, the Ministry of Education, the Kenya Examinations Council and those operating the system in the field would be used to the system after leaning how it operates. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was only yesterday that we were told that a change in the style of playing on part of the Harambee Stars, caused a disaster. Therefore, parents and the whole nation should realize that these changes should be given time to stabilize.Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the question of rumour mongering, I would like tocall upon the Kenya News Agency (K.N.A.) journalists, to join other journalistsm reporting what is going on out in the districts and provinces. Most of the misleading information that we read in the newspapers has caused a lot of protests these days but we hardly ever read, from the K.N.A. regarding events in the field. lie believe that the K.N.A. will always give us the correct version of events and we are wondering why they are not coming out in the open, particularly to cover what the leaders in the various communities have to say.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to urge the editors of the variousnewspapers to ascertain the authenticity of the reports they receive from thefield from the various journalists. I am saying this because in many cases, you will find that one- journalist may be is present in a function, but the following day, all the newspapers report very confidently about the function. This is because after leaving the function, the journalist goes and tells his collegues working for other newspapers what transpired in the function. This gives the readers fourth or fifth hand information, which quite of ten, is extremely inaccurate and distorted. I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to our newspaper, the Kenya Times, to come out and lead in accurate reporting. When we hear of rumours being spread.! from one place to another, we would like to believe that when we read the Kenya Times, we shall find out the truth. Eowever, you will find that some Kenya Times journalists  give the most distorted information and I am sorry to say this. I would like to call upon this Party newspaper to come out and lead, the way for others in accurate reporting, so that journalists from other newspapers do not continue to-feed us with their version of stories. We should be told exactly 2 what the leaders in this country are doing "and saying not and what these journalists would like the leaders to say. I an saying this because some of these journalists are not saying what the leaders actually say. If they are not sure what a certain leader has said, they should consult him first and ask him, "If we put it in this way, would it be okay, Sir?" If the leader says, "It is fine", then they should go ahead and have it printed. If not, then they should not say what they think the leader wanted to say and I caution them about very  seriously about this. With those few remarks,  I beg to support.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech> THE  ASSISTANT MINSITER FOR  EDUCATION (Mr.  Karauri):  Thank you very   much,  Mr.  Speaker,  for giving me this opportunity to support this Motion.  In his Presidential Address from the Chair on the occasion  of opening of the new Third Session,  and indeed in all his Speeches in the past,  the President has given a lot of advice to  Kenyans regarding the manner in which they should conduct themselves in order to maintain peace and stability for progress as a nation. We as leaders in this  country must at  all times be ourselves during the  day  and night.   What we say in public should also be said in private. We should be true in What we say and do. We have a President in this country who is effective .and practical because he practises of what he preaches. When you consider, for example,  the  spirit of Harambee which has successfully built this nation,  we have  seen tremendous development during  the  time when President Moi has been in the leadership of this country. This is why we must  support and continue to  support him.  Leaders must be supported when they  are doing a good job.   to the  country, so that they may  realize that the people for whom they are doing these   things, are supporting then and will remain loyal to them  so that they are encouraged. to continue doing those good deeds. The  strength of  any nation is vested in the country's economy and therefore,  we must do  everything possible in this country to improve on our  economy. Recently, we have heard about rumour mongers and as the President has said,  any leader worth his salt should never be involved in rumour mongering. He should use his energy to build the nation. When talking about  economy,  I would like to say that we-need to establish industries in this country. It  is a great achievement  for this country to be able to assemble its first car.   However,  it is going to be very expensive to run these cars because we do not have fuelindustries. At the same time,  most of the materials used to  assemble thesecars is imported. Therefore,  I think we  must move into the area of establishingindustries and make  sure we move a bit faster.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  electricity must be taken to all the trading centres and homes in this country's' rural areas. When we talk about encouraging investors to  invest in the  rural areas,  we must know that they cannot do so if there is no$ electricity there. In my constituency,  for example,  it is very difficultto put up  even a welding industry in certain areas because there is no electricity. The Ministry of Energy has done quite a lot in trying to take electricity to the people, but we would like them to hasten the process to ensure that within a short period, every area in this country has electricity. This will encourage   investors to go to the rural areas to invest there in order to provide employment for our young people. Instead of young people coming to Nairobi to look for employment,they can find jobs in the rural areas.Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the President has rightly advised onthe Harambee  spirit. Harambees should not  continue to be forced onthe people. If leaders just sit down and decide  that everyone must.contribute KShs.1,000/.,  then we will kill the Harambee spirit. The people should be left to contribute what they can, be they rich or poor. In that way,  the Harambee spirit will be with us forever and will  continue building, the nation. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I as the Chairman of the Kenya Football Federation Caretaker Committee. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER:  Congratulations. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATTON (Mt. Karauri):   Recently, Harambee stars went to represent Kenya in Algeria because we had qualified as a nation. I would like to inform the hon. Members thatbefore we were allowed to go there,  we had to qualify. We are oneof the eight countries  that qualified to go to  the finals in Algeria. This is not the first time Kenya has been represented there. In 1988,  before the Caretaker Committee was appointed, the Harambee Stars went to Morocco and were beaten in all matches   three goals to nil except  for one. I would like to   comment about this because a lot has been said   about the performance of Harambee Stars in Algeria. I was surprised that  the Kenya Broadcasting Corporatian. aired. a statement blasting the Caretaker Committee without investigating what  is causing the_ failure of football in this country.  There were eight national teams in Algeria and all of them were fielding Professionals Countries  like Camercan, Senegal and Algeria were  fielding professionals but it is only Kenya that fielded amateurs. Zambia had only three Professionals in   its team. This is a terrific change inthe football world in that people are training in professionalism and you cannot match amateurs against those professionals.  In this country we want to start Professionalism but we must  start somewhere.   We have started youth football where the youth are competing in the districts. These  competitions are heldnationally in August every year. In this Way,  we will be in a positionto pick young talents to be footballers of the future. This cannothappen in a day.   For example,  a committee  cannot be appointed today and its team becomes the best   in Africa the next day. This is not possible. We Must start with the Youth football which is a nursery for players. As I said,  we have now started Division II football fromyoung players can be picked. We have requested the Ministry of Cultureand Social Services to provide a Vote for the development of football. Football is not like athletics and boring which need individual initiative and effort. This is because athletes can wake up in themorning and train on their own and become world beaters. In football,you need to train a team. In order to do so,  you must have a budget for it as is the case everywhere. For example, we should be in a position to plan that,  say, next month, we will train our players in Saudi Arabia,  Germany or even locally and give them allowances.  I would like to see a situation where school leavers even at Form your level with football talent are employed and trained to Play football and nothing else. In this way,  we will   have somekind of professional football. This is what h is happening everywhere.It is difficult for us to win a situation where professionals are fielded against amateurs.  We have started and I am sure we are going to get somewhere. Thank you,  Sir. </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. MANGIOLI:  Thank you, Sir, forgiving me this opportunity to contribute  to this very important Motion. First of all,  I would like to comment on the state of football in this country where hon. Karauri is the  Chairman  Ministers and other people, irrespective of their positions in society,  should learn to resign when they see that things are not going on well. (laughter)The time has come when those Ministers who know they cannot excel should resign. They should not wait until His Excellency the President tells them to do so. Kenyans are not prepared  to take anything shorter than winning even one football match. There is no way they can take that because these players are  the  sane people with the same legs, eyes and hands I  would like to ask the Caretaker Committee to member re-examine themselves and resign so as to pave way for those people who know football.Football is a very important sport in this country and there is no way we can take anything for granted.   I leave it at that. Now let me come to a very serious matter. The serious matter I want to involve myself in . </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MILISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. M’Mukindia): On a point of order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir. Can the hon.  Member tell us those peoplewho know football? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, I stated clearly that if leaders cannot excel in their duties,  they should resign. Who maplays now is not the issue but who played that day.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): On a Pointof order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir. Is it  in order for the hon. Member to saysomething which he cannot substantiate?  He has said that other people have done it and we would like to know them. I said that in 1988 when  Harambee Stars went to play in Morocco they were not under the CaretakerCommittee  then there were six goals against them and they won no matchand came home quite early.  The hon.  Member is insinuating that there are people who mow football better. This is the problem that we have.  The hon.  Member should tell us who these people are so that they can go to represent us. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  SPEAKER: Order.   Allow the hon.  Member to continue expressing his opinion. He is only expressing his point of view. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Muturia): On a point  of order,  Mt.  Speaker,  Sir. Hon.Marg’oli has  said that if those people excelled in football at that time,  then we should have done  it also. He also said that  they have  the same legs, eyes and hands.Is hon. Mang'oli suggesting that he can run as fast as Kipchoge Keino because he has two legs also? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI:   Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there is no relationship between running and football.  Perhaps,  the Assistant Minister does not know that football is different from running (laughter) I know the shortcomings very well and I do not want to bring them here because I am not here for the sake  of personality as His Excellency the President pointed out in his Presidential Address. The Assistant Minister  for Education, Mr.  Kamauri, said that when Harambee Stars went to Morocco,  they beat only one team and they had to come home earlier than scheduled. This time, we did not beat any team but we were beaten all through. </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr.Karauri): Ona point  of order, Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  I said that when we went to Moroccoin 1988  — the  hon.  Member  should know what happens in football — we were  beaten three  goals to  nil in every match except in one match. where we  drew nil with Cameroun. We did not win anymatch and  so were more  ashamed that time  than this time. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  MANG'OLI:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we were  equally ashamed this time. On a serious note, I wish to  appeal to  all hon.Members to take  time  off and mourn our dear brother; who was an eloquent leader and a defender of this nation,  the late  Dr. Robert Ouko; I recall that when we had a kanu Parliamentary Group meeting, his Excellency the  President stressed that the  peace  of this nation should not be disrupted.  However,  when Ministers  stand  up here they talk about issues  other than those which concern this nation. This makes us wonder whether the Ministers understand the President's vision for this nation. </Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER:They  know! </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MANG'OLI: If they know ,then they should do what thePresident is  doing. This is  a serious issue because it involves the  death of our dear brother. If we treat the matter lightly, like the Ministers  are  doing things can become  very serious.  This House  should note that had it not been for the  efforts of his Excellency the President things would now be different in this nation. I want  to  state very clearly that if the  President had not attended Dr.  Ouko's funeral at Koru things would not be  same  in this nation today. That is why we  do not want  to take  things lightly, the way our Assistant Ministers are  doing.  We must be  prepared to  stand up and be  counted when it becomes necessary. Our dear brother was  shot dead for no reason. He was  patriotic; he stood with our President both inside  and     outside this country.Some  people  took advantage  of his  death and started spreading rumours to  confuse  people;  they were ringing people  to  say that  the Vice-P resident and other people were also dead. Sir,  we  have  a courageous President  and this  nation stands because  of him.  His  attending Dr. Ouka's funeral  Service  at  a Valley Road church saved this  nation from possible  chaos. Even when advised not  to  go  to Koru,  the  President  took things  askiero  and went to Koru where  he  controlled the  situation. In fact,  the situation was controlled by only one man because  the Ministers are not with the  President. We want to tell the Ministers that they should come out during this session and defend this nation with their blood and words.  We  should not condemn  tribalism casually and practise  it at the  same time.   We cannot allow the President to shoulder every responsibility as if he  does not have Ministers to assist him.They are taking casually about issues here  as if such issues  are not serious. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR RESEARCH,  SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (Mr.Muhoho):  On a point  of order,  Mr. Speaker,  Sir. While  I  appreciate the  emotion of the  hon.  Member, is  it really in order for him to suggest that Ministers  are  not with the  President? That  is  a very serious  allegation. I demand that the  hon. Member mentions the Ministers who  are  not with the President  or withdraws that  statement. </Newspeech>  "<Newspeech>MR.  MANG'OLI: Mr.Speaker,  I said that with a veryheavy heart. The President raised the  Ouko issue  in the  KanuParliamentary Group meeting and also in this House. But when Ministersstand up they speak about chiefs and  co-operative societies while we  are  at  a cross-road;  We  cannot afford this kind of thing anymore. </Newspeech> <Newspeech> ThE MINISTER FOR RESEARCH,  SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (Mr.  Muhoho):  On a point  of  order,  Mr. Speaker,  Sir. With all due respect,  if you allow me  to  say,  that is not  substantiation. The  hon.Member has made a blanket accusation of all the Ministers. So,  can he say which Ministers are not with the President,  or withdraw his  statement? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  MANG’OLI:  Mr.Speaker,  Sir,  I have  expressed my viewsabout  the  death of the  late Minister and Call upon the Government to investigate  and tell this nation who killed a Ouko. Perhaps  the Minister is being hurt by something else other than the truth. I have  only said that those Ministers who  are  not with the  President. I do not know whether there  are  any  should come out  and be  counted,  and I am saying so without fear or favour. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR RESEARCH,  SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (Mr.Muhoho): On a point  of order,  Mr. Speaker,  Sir. I do notreally believe  that hon. Mang'oli  should take us  for granted asif we were not listening to him;  as if we  are not serious.He  is         changing his  statement now   at not time  did he  say ""some Ministers"".He  said ministers are not with the President and this statementis in the HANSARD. I believe  the  hon. Member  should withdraw it. </Newspeech><Newspeech>R. MANG’OLI: Mr. Speaker, the Minister insists whatI  said is  in the HANSARD. Can we wait  for  the  HANSARD to  see  ifI  said it? If the Minister wants to take  issue with me withregard to m Ouko's  death before have known who  killed him,  then that is  a different matter. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR RESEARCH, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (Mr. Muhoho):  Mt:  Speaker,  as  I said at the beginning,  I appreciate the  emotions with which the hon. Member is  speaking;  but what he  is  saying also becomes the  property of this House.  My statement is not personal.  I  am just following what the  Standing Orders demand  of the Members of this House  and the responsibility every hon.  Member must take  for the  statements he makes. I am not taking any issue with hon.  Mang'oli  at  any personal level, but,  on the  other hand, I am  a Member of the  Government  and take collective responsibility for all the Ministers, whom his statement is accusing.So, the statement is not hurting me as person because  I feel just as  strongly about  the  matter. However, this is no reason why we  should be  emotiveand make  statements which we cannot  subtantiate.  I still hold thatthe hon.Member  said clearly that  "the Ministers are not with the President",  and demand that he withdraws it and  apologises. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.MANG’OLI: Mr,Speaker, I do not know what is troublingthe hon. Minister,  who is the  Kannu Chairman for Kiambu District. If I said something like  that we  can still wait for the HANSARD. Mygeneral opinion is  that it  appears as if the Ministers are not with the President.   This is because,  although at the  end they converge  somewhere,  the  line  taken by the Ministers is  different from the  one  taken by the  President.  If I referred to specific Ministers who  do not  seem to be with the  President,  and you feel I should correct this,  then <Newspeech>MR.   SPEAKER: Order ! I do  not  think  it  is  proper  forthe  hon.  Member  to  bring in matters which  were  discussedby  the  Kanu  Parliamentary Group  meeting. Again it  is  wrong tosay  that  the Ministers are  not  with  the  President. If  you  thinkthat  you  know  of  any Minister who  is  not with the  President and  I  will  advise  you  later -  then  mention  him,   but  think you  better  withdraw that  statement. </Newspeech>(applause) <Newspeech>MR.  MANG'OLI:  Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,  in  that version,  and if  it  is  so,  with  your  counsel  advise,   I  withdraw and apologise. </Newspeech><Newspeech> THE  ASSISTANT MINISTER  FOR  HOME  AFFAIRS AND  NATIONAL HERITAGE (Mr.   Lalampaa): Ahsante  sana  Bw.

Spika,  naunga mkono </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.ANASWA: Thank You very much,  Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  for giving me  this precious  opportunity to make my comments  on the Presidential Address First  and foremost,  our beloved President has very good attributes  and which are very rare. He has  got very good  qualities which many leaders in the world do not have. First  of all we  have  seen that during that day of great disaster in the country,  His  Excellency the President  showed a lot  of sympathy to the family  of the late Dr.Robert  Ouko.  His Excellency the President,  along with other mourners  in this  country, was always together with the  bereaved family. He visited the  family Personally and comforted the widow and her children. Ministers,  Assistant Ministers,  Members  of Parliament,  church leaders and  friends  also went  to  comfort the  bereaved  gamily. All these people showed real sympathy to the bereaved family.  Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  there  are very many people in the worldwho do not show such sympathy. I real ly respect  His  Excellency thePresident  for being a very sympathetic  leader.  I  say this becausesympathy is  a very rare  quality in mankind.  There are  only few people who are  endowed with that  kind of quality. </Newspeech>  Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  you will also remember that there was a very  old couple whose land had  been sold. But it is was His Excellency the President who  sympathised with that  old couple.  He went  and  took back that  land  and  handed it  back to that  old couple together with a title  deed. This  a very wonderful. deed in the  eyes of Kenyans  and the world. He  is a President who  is  always  sympathetic; he  sticks to his  own policy  of being mindful of other peoples welfare. He was being mindful  of the welfare  of that  old couple. They were very,  very happy . Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  apart  from possessing this quality of sympathy His  Excellency the  President is also able to spare  some time to have  fun together with his people. This has been seen several times whenever  we  have had international sporting events   He has been to the  Nyayo National  Stadium several times to watch football matches.  Even during the 4th All Arica Games he was with us at the Moi International Sports Centre,  Kasarani,  and he  gave us  a lot  of inspiration as a fan. So,  because  of this we  give him a lot  of respect. He finds time, something which is very rare with other leaders,  to share a few moments  of relaxation with us particularly when our teams are competing and  so  on. At this  juncture,  Mr. Speaker,  Sir, I would liketo  say  something about the  current Africa Cup  of Nations tournament taking place  in Algeria;   I feel very sad when some  of us try to belittle  our leaders who  are mmigx organising soccer in this country. In fact  it  is  surprising that Harambee  Stars did very well. I have been following the performance  of Harambee Stars very keenly as a footballer. I watched Harambee  Stars  on television in 1988 and also this year I have watched them on television during the current  tournament  in Algeria.  I have therefore  arrived at the conclusion that Harambee  Stars have improved very much.  We have been give  our teams  a lot  of material and moral support.  Also His Excellency the President  has thmitascmx done  it  and he is  still doing it.   Harambee  Stars did very well because they improved from number 8 to number 7. This was no mean achievement given the fact that our team consisted  of only mm amateurs.Those playing in the Senegales and Ningerian tearnS were all professionals. So, I thinkHarambee  Stars did very; very well given the  fact that they had very little time to prepare  for this type  of  tournament;  they  only wentto Thailand and Uganda and  they went  to play in Algeria. So,  given that  short time  to prepare  and the fact that they wereable  to become number 7,  their performance. was really wonderful. The   defence  system of Harambee  Stars   was  excellent withthe best  goalkeeper in the tournament.   This has beenorganised by the Kenya Football Federation ""Including hon. Karauri with his friends who did a good  job to select the  best  goalkeeper. Although the Nigerians are  professionals they were impble  to penetrate the  defence  of Harambee  Stars. TheNigerians  scored-only  one  goal which was by  sheer luck.  At the time of Cameroon versus Zenya our boys had  already been disappointed because they had  already known that Zambia and Senegal had already aualified. So,  they were  taking the  game very lightly.  Only the reserves played but in spite of that they were beaten only two goals.  I think Harambee Stars did very well and    I commend hon. Karauri very much for this.  All that we need to do is to  give  him more support so that  our teams can do better. I am glad that they have  looked into the problems and they  have  set  some strategies which they are  going to  execute in order to get rid of these  problems. Let us give them our co-operation.  Mr. Speaker, Sir,  turning back to the Presidential Address, I would like  to  say that  our President hes a lot  of foresightedness. A few years  ago during a graudation ceremony at the University of of Nairobi,  he  challenged our engineers to produce a Kenyan made vehicle He  challenged the University  of Nairobi to design and build a Kenyan  car. This  challenge was taken up,  and recently, we were  surprised to  learnthat Kenyans have produced their own cars.This  was the  result of the  encouragement  from the  father of the nation.As has  already been said,  our President has  foresight;  he  leads us,  and through him,  we see exactly what is  going to happen. He  is  like a father,he is always encouraging us. Whenever he  foresees difficulties ahead,  he is the first person to suggest that we need  changes  so that the  common man  an benefit. For example,  in the  Presidential Address,  he talked about some changes which will be  introduced through various  Bills  to be  discussed in this  House. He talkedsomething  about land and engineering as as profession. He  also  broughtgood news  to  those men and women who have retired from Government service when he said that the issue  of the  Pensions  Act will be reviewed  so  thatthese  people can enjoy the fruits of their labour. The President is  a personwho  looks  into  the problems  of his people; he wants them to benefit from the good work they have done.  He has realised that the cost of living is rising. He,  therefore, wants to ensure that those people who have retired.from  Government service keep abreast with the cost of living. That wasvery good. That is  being mindful of other people's welfare.When we look at international affairs, we find that His Excellency the  President has rendered a lot.of help to some countries,  for example Namibia.  I  remember Mr.Sam Nujoma said that when Namibia becomes  independent, it  is  going to  copy Kenya's  system of Government. It  is  through Kenyans'working hand in hand with their President that other countries alas admire  Kenya. This  is  wonderful as  far as  I am concerned. When you  look at our education system,  you find that people have talked a lot  about  it.  We now have  the  8:4:4 system of education and have  done away with the new mathematics  and reverted to the traditional mathematics,  which  is  much better. With  those  few remarks,  I  beg to  support. </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR.  TANUI:  Thank you very much, Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, for giving me  this  opportunity to  support this Motion on the Presidential  Address which was delivered yesterday by His Excellency the  President duringthe  State  Opening of the Third Session of the Sixth Parliament. HisExcellency the President mentioned the following important issues tobe  discussed in this august House during this year. The  first thing he said was:— I am glad to Welcome back Hon.  Members of Parliament at the  start of the Third Session of our  Sixth Parliament. Our happiness, is,  however, incomplete on this occasion due to the absence of an enthusiastic and eloquent legislator, the  hon.  Dr.  Robert Ouko who met his death last month. In mourning his  death,  I, therefore, request this  House  to rise up and observe a minute's  silence  in honour of our friend And colleague whom we shall  all miss dearly. The  President is  the first person who made sure that the system was cool. He personally visited the  late Minister's family to give his condolences. We  praise him for the  action he   took Hon.Dr.Ouko was one of themost devoted Ministers of the Government. His  Excellency the President also  informed this august House that he  was happy that Mr. Nelson Mandela has been released from jail.  He told us  that he took an active part in ensuring that Mr.  Mandela was, released from jail. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, the third thing the President mentioned was that Kenyans  were very happy this year when they learnt of the three cars which were invented locally which are the Nyayo Pioneer 1,  Nyayo Pioneer 2,  and Nyayo Pioneer 3. We thank the  Engineering Department of the University ofNairobi  for that  achievement.                    The President also stated that Kenyans were happy that the KenyaMedical  Research  Institute  (KEMRI)  has  come  up with a drug,  called Kemron, which reverses Aids symptoms.  But although this  drug has  been invented,  I urge hon.  Members  to  inform wananchi  not to relax since  this  is not a cure for Aids.  Yesterday,  it  was  announced  that the  State of California had  discovered a cure  for Aids which has already been used on 130 patients who have got better. Our Kemron has now been used by 23 patients who have hadthe  Aids  symptoms  reversed. So,  Kenya is going ahead because of HisExcellency  the  President's  devotion in ensuring that Kenya progresses  dayafter  day. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  President also said that peace  should not be taken  for granted,  it should betaken seriously as  it  is our health and wealth  in this  nation."Without peace,  people can neither be healthy nor wealthy. Therefore,  we  should always  follow His Excellency the  President's philosophy of love,  peace  and unity  day and night. The  President told us  to talk nothing but the  truth.  Rumour mongering  is  the  opposite of the  truth;  it spoils  instead of developing. A lot of conning and corruption are  being perpetuated by small  jobless people. I  ,  therefore,  suggest that Jua Kali  industries  be started,"especially in the rural  areas  so that those  jobless people can be gainfully engaged in development activities. If a man is  idle, he tends to talk nonsense and rumours. The  other thing the  President mentioned was that the House during this  Session,  debate the retirement procedures  for retiring civil servants. The procedure  is  crude;  it has not been refined. I  hope that this  time,  we shall refine  it so  that when a Government employee retires, he gets his  retirement  benefits  within  a very  short  time. When some  civil servants  retire,  they wait  for their benefits  for such a long time  that they  die  before  they get them. The President  also emphasised the  fact that village elders  will, through a Bill  to  be  introduced to  the  House  soon,  be handling land cases. As  we  all  know,   land cases  all  over the country  are a thorny issue. In nearly every district,  location or sub-location in this country there is  chaos  concerning land cases. So  the  sooner this  Bill is  passed in this  House the better we will be in this country.  Finally,  Mr.Speaker,  Sir,  in his  Speech the President cautioned us  about lack of  quorum in this House.  He  said that without quorum the business of this House cannot be conducted effectively.  So  it  is  surprising that after that warning from the   President today three-quarters of the benches in this House are empty. With these  few remarks,  I support the m Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  KITELE:  Thank you very much,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for giving me this  opportunity to  also  air my views on this  important Motion. I would like first to  join my  colleagues  in echoing their sentiments that in Dr.  Ouko’s death we have lost a brother,  a colleague,  a great son of Kenya and an international distinguished person who will   be missed not only by the people of this country but also by the international world. We appreciate the President's gesture towards the  death of this son of this country by asking us  to  stand up in  silence for one minute during yesterdays Sitting and during the Kanu Parliamentary meeting.  We  are glad that the President is leading us very well and at the speed that is comfortable to us. We  in this  country and in the outside world know only too well the late Dr.Oukots  contribution towards the interpretation of this  country's policies. During the press  conferences that he attended,  the late Dr.  Ouko  explained to the world the policies of this  country. To  repeat this country has lost a great son. We would also  at this juncture like to request all those who  are involved in rumour mongering to put a stop to their activities because they are  doing a great  deal of injustice to this country. Infact , such people  are enemies of this  country. These  people  shouldinstead concentrate on nation building.  Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,  the President has done quite a lot  for  this  country. In  fact,   he  is  one  of the most  senior politiciansin  this country. In  fact, as  far back  as 1955 he was activelyengaged in politics. After Independence  the country's policieswere  geared towards  conquering these three enemies of our country: ignorance,  disease  and poverty. We  have  all  seen what  he  hasdone to achieve results  towards these  goals. Through theHarambee  spirit  many primary  and secondary  schools have been built So  this  is  something for which we  should be thankful to the  President.            Apart  from the primary  and secondary  schools,  we  now  have  about  four  universities  in the country.  All  these  institutions  are  tools that  are  being used towards  overcoming ignorance  in this  country. The  President has,also, through his wisdom, introduced the 8-4-4-  system of education where  apart from being taught  academic subjects, our  children learn  all  types  of trade  subjects  like plumbering,  tailoring,   carpentry  and masonry. Through  such skillsour  children after completion of their  education, become self-employed.  In  order  to  cater  for all  people  of  this  country the Government  also  introduced  adult  education  where  the older  members of  our  society  can  also  get  education. The  other  area  where  a  lot  of  improvements  have  been done is  in health  services. Through  the  introduction of the Nyayo Wardsand  the  building dispensaries  through the  Harambee  spirit,  healthservices  have  now been provided to  almost  all  people in this  country. For  this we  would like to thank  the  President and wish him well  so that  he  can  continue to  lead this  country. The  Government  has  also  done  a  lot  towards  the  improvement of  the  people's  standards  of living.  Through organisations  like  the Agricultural  Finance  Corporation (A.F.C.)   and the  Agricultural Development Corporation  (A.D.C.)  the Government  advances  loans  to  farmers so that they can improve food production in the country. On the  other hand the banks are  also providing small loans to  traders to  improve  commerce  in this country. This is why today when one goes  to  River Road here in Nairobi he-will see many shops that are owned by Africans which was not the case before  Independence.  So we  are grateful to the Government for these things. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  are very many small  scale industries in this  country that belong  to Africans, which issomething to be  proud of. I would like to take this opportunityto  appeal to the Government to encourage foreign investors to Invest in this  country.  I am saying this because  I have  some  interest in that  direction.  I have very many unemployed people in my constituency who  could benefit a lot if an industry was opened there. Of  course,  such industries would not only employ people frommy  area but  even those 3 from other parts of this country. Such a  thing would help reduce unemployement in this country.  With those  few remarks,  I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CO-OPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT (Mr.Ejore): khsante  sana,  Bw.

Lakirrinataka kuuaambia""Wakenya na wale wachache kuamba ""haku.na kabilandogo""katika nchi hii. Wakati  wa vita hakuna kabila ndogo. Hatahii kabila ndogo  inaweza kuwa mbaya na kuimaliza ile kubwa. Thereis  no  small tribe  in Kenya:   What is in Kenya today is only warriers I want them to know that. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu kila siku tronaambiwa kabila sate  tulikuwa tuneishindani ya misitu laki  ni Mziingu mbuzi.

Spika,  ni  lazima nirudie  kusema kwamba hakuna kabila ndogo katika Kenya.  Makabila yote yaliyomo nchini ni makubwa.  Kwa hivyo, wale wanaohusika wanafaa kukoma kuwadanganya wazungu kwamba kuna minority  tribe,  kwa sababu huu ni  upuzi  tu. Kabila hilo wanalofikiri ni  ndogo linaweza kuwamaliza kwa sababu watu wake ni.wakall kama pill pill na hawabaklzi cho chote nyuma;  wanaua-kila kitu. Watu hawa wakikamatwa na Serikali wanafaa kuletwa uwanjani  ili wananchi wawatuange paopo hapo kwa sababu hapana haja ya kuwapeleka jela wakale chakula cha bure huko.   Kwa haya machache,  Bw.

Pia,  ningetaka kuungana na waheshimiWa Wabunge ambaO wametoa pongezi kwa waheshimiwa Wabunge wenzetu na viongozi wa Nyanza kwa msimamo waliouweka wa kutuliza hali iliyokuwako huko kwao. Tunawapongeza sana. Nchi  hii yetu  iko  vile  ilivyo kwa sababu ya Mtukufu Rais,  lakini wengi wetu husema kwamba tuna imani na Mtukufu Rais kwa mdomo tu wakati ambapo kuna watu  fulani katika nchi  hii  ambao hawampendi Mtukufu Rais hata kidogo.  Matendo yao yanaonekana wazi.  Mwenzangu mhe.  Mbunge  aliyezungumza hapo mbeleni   kidogo  aliyataja majina ya watu kadha na kusema ninadhibitisha  kwamba watu hawa ni  wauaji manaojulikana kama professional murderers,  na vitendo vyao vinajulikana. Ni  ajabu  kwamba mpaka leo Ofisi ya Mkuu wa Sheria haijaona kwamba ni  haki kuwaweka watu chini ya sheria na kuwaadhibu  jinsi  inavyotakikana. Wakati  Bw.  ngumba aliondoka katika nchi akienda ng!ambo,  alisema kwamba alikuwa na wajibu fulani  aliokuwa akienda kutimiza na hatarudi hapa mpaka atakapoutimiza wajibu huo. Tunashangaa ni  wajibu.gani huo aliokuwa akiendakutimiza. </Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON.

Ngumba yuko  hapa nchini.akitembea huru na kuzidi  kuchochea na hali tuna sheria katika.nchl  hii. Hii  ni  kusema  wamba  "inkono"  wa sheria umekuwa mfupi kiasi  kwamba hauwezi  kuwafikia watu fulani? Mwenzangu ametaja hapa. mambo yale yaliyotendeka kuhusu uuaji wa marehemu J.M. Kariuki.  Bunge  hili  lilifanya uchunguzi na kuhakikisha kwamba.watu fulani.ndlo waliomwua marehemu Bw.  J.M.  Kariuki,  lakini mpaka leo,  hakuna hatua yo yote. waliyochukuliwa. Ni  haki  kwa Bunge hili na nchi hii  kujua kama kweli "mkono"wa sheria umekuwa mfupi kiasi kwamba hauwezi kuwafikia watu fulani na, kama hivyo ndivyo  ilivyo,  ni kwa sababugani. Katika nchi  hii,  inasemekana kwamba sheria inawasimamia watu wote. Leo,  nchi inauliza,  "Ni kwa nini watu hawa ambao wandfanya matendo ya uchochezi na ya kumwangamiza Mtukufu Rais na kuidhalimu Serikali  bado wanatembea huru?" Watu  hawa wamekuwa na mazoea fulani, na inafaa tujue kwamba huruma yetu ikizidi,  tutakuja kuwa na taabu katika nchi </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr.  Biwott): On  a point of order,  Mr.  Speaker,Sir. I  think there should not be any doubt as  to the decisiveness of theGovernment  in  terms of enforcement of the  law. The  President made  it very clearthat there will  be no stone left unturned in establishing what happened in the latest  tragic  case. (Applause)  The  arm of the Government has never been,  is not,  and will never be short;  it will  always  be long. This  tragic  case,  which is  really regretful  for all  Kenyans,  will  show the determination of His Excellency the President's Government in  pursuing law to  its  logical  conclusion. So,  I  think the hon.  Member should take bearing from what the President himself said rather than to create a doubt as  to whether something has changed or not. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR  EDUCATION  (Mr.  Omido):  Ahsante,  Bw.  Spika. Ingelifaa mhe.  Biwott  anijibu wakati  atapokuwa akijibu Hoja hii. Ningetaka kutoa pongezi  kubwa kwa Mtukufu Rais  kwa Hotuba ambayo alitoa.  Kwa muda mrefu sasa,  the  Factories  Act  imekuwa pingamizi  na dhuluma kubwa kwa wafanyakazi  katika nchl  hii,  na ninamshukuru Mtukufu Rais  kwa kuona kwamba ni  vizuri  sasa sheria hii  ibadilishwe. Sheria hii  ikibadilishwa,  wafanyakazi wengi  wa viwanda na wengine wataona kwamba Serikali yao  sasa inafanya kazi  kama inavyotakikana iii  iwalinde. Wakati  tunapoitumikia nchl hii,  kila kitendo tunachofanya tunafaa kukiangalia na kuona kama king manufaa katika nchl hii. leo,  utaona kwamba tangu kiwanda cha kutengeneza magunia cha Juja kilipofungwa kwa sababu ya magunia Yaliyoletwa kutoka ng'ambo,  wafanyakazi wengi wamepoteza kazi  na hata sasa bado wako nje wakitafuta kazi. Hii  ni  kwa sababu watu fulani walileta magunia kutoka nje  huku wakitambua kwamba magunia yanatengenezwa hapa Juja na kwamba kazi hii  inaajiriwa wafanyakazi wengi. Tunaishida pia kuhuswIuundaji wa redio kwa sababu redio nyingi huletwa hapa zikiwa zimekwishaundwa tayari.  Mtu  anaweza kukaa hapa na kuuza redio hata 1,000 za namna hii,  lakini  ukileta vipande vipande vya-redio hapa ili viunganishwe,  kazi  hii itahitaji  wafanyakazi wengi. Kwa hivyo,  inafaa tuliangalie jambo hili kwa sababu tusipolichunga, litawatoa wafanyakazi wengi kazini,  na economic sabotage  hii  itahatarisha usalama wetu kwa kuwa watu wenye njaa ni  hatari. Jambo-lingine,  Bw.  Spika,  linahusu kodi ya nyumba. Kodi  hii imepanda sana na wafanyakazi  wengi  wanaumia kwa sababu mishahara yao haitoshi kulipia kodi  ya nyumba wanamoishi. Kwa hivyo,  sheria  ingefaa kuwekwa vizuri  huku  tukijua kwamba kutegemea Rent Tribunal peke yake hakutoshl.  Ingefaa tuwe na kamati maalum itakayochunguza hali ya kodi ya nyumba katika  miji yetu yote na kuweka kiwango cha kodi hii ambacho kinalingana na mishahara ya wafanyakazi. Sisi,  ambao tumekuwa viongozi wa wafanyakazi kwa muda Fulani,  tunajua kwamba kuna shida hapa kwa sababu hata.leo wafanyakazi huja kwetu wakilia na kusema kWamba kodi ya nyumba inawamalizaTunapozungumza juu ya usalama wetu,  tunaamini  kwamba vyombo vyote vya kueneza habari  katika nchi  hii vitashirikiana na Mtukufu Rais na Serikali katika kueneza na kuhimiza mambo yote ya kuleta amani  na utulivu katika nchi Zaidi  ya vyombo  hivi  vyote,  kuna magazeti ya chama,  yaani  magazeti ya Kenya Times. Ni  lazima magazeti  haya yawe yakiutekeleza wajibLuwa Serikali na wa chama chetu.  Ninaaminl   kwamba hiindijo sababu gazeti la Kenya Times liliarzishwa.  Vyombo vile vingine vya habari  vilikuvia vikipotosha siasa ya chama na pia nia ya Serikali. Je,  siku hizi  tunaona nini? Gazeti  la Kenya Times linasema kwamba viongozi wa nchi hii wafaa kuangalia mfano wa Gabon na Corte D'Ivore. linasema kwambakatika nchi  hizo rnbili vyama vya wafanyakazi Viiisimama upande wa rata na kwamba wananchl wa nchi hii wanaultza ikiwa Chama cha Cotu kitaungana nao wakati utakapofika   Kama huosi  uchochezi,  bast sijui nikitu gani kinachoweza kuitwa uchochezi. GaZeti hilo hilo  la Kenya Times linazidi kuuliza kama watu katika nchi hii wake katika halt bora kuliko walivyokuwa tuiipopatadhuru. Pia, kama huo  si uChochazt mkali,  basi  sijui uchOchezi ni nini,  Niwazi kwamba kuna nia ya kuwagonganishawananchi  waKenyana Serikali yao;  kunania pia ya kuwagonganisha wananchi na viongozi wao katika vyama yya wafanyakazi ni mahalt kwingine. Bw.  Spika,  kama vile mtukufu Rais anavyosemawakati wote,  kuna watu ambao hutoa  lip service, na hao ni  wale wanaosema, "TUnamwunga Mtukufu. Rats mkono", na huku waruimchimba,  Nataka kuichukua nafasi hii kuMpongeza.Mtukufu.Rals kwakuongeza idadt ya mahakimu kwa sababu hatua hiyo  itahakikisha kWamba haki  inatoiewa kwa raia,Ingawa hiVyo, nataka pia kusema kwamba majengo yalcorti ya Makadara yako katika.hali mbaya sana kwa sababu yamezungukwa na maji na hata paa yake  uiavunja wakati wa mvua. Ningependa hatua  iChuknItwe  ill knirekebisha hall hiyo. Kwa hayo machaChe, naunga mkono. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. M'Mukindia): Thank  you very. much,Mr.  Speaker, Sir,  for giving  me  this opportunity to support this Motion on thePresidential  Address  when he opened  this  Parliament yesterday. I  must also recordmy  sadness at the  sad departure of our  illustrious  colleague,  Dr.  Robert Ouko. Ican only pray that God will keep him where he keeps his loyal servants. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  many items of policy were enumerated by His Excellency the  President.  but  I  think  I  will only  touch on one which covers all  of them. We must  stand  for royalty  and patriotism,  and  this  is one aspect that His  Excellency  the President pointed out.  He  said  that the late Dr.  Robert Ouko had loyalty and patriotism  in plenty; he loved his country and his President. We, in this hon. House,  must also stand to be counted so that our loyalty and patriotism are not in doubt. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in a nation such as ours,  the Presidency is the nucleus Around which the whole  country  revolves.  The Presidency,   especially when held by such a person as His Excellency Daniel. arap Moi, who.is a Christian and an upright man,   is even more  of that nucleus.  Without that nucleus  in a nation such  as ours, the nation will  fall apart. We,  therefore,  must concentrate all our efforts  in ensuring that the Presidency is at all times above any form of intrigue and suspicion such  as  was  trying  to be propagated during  the  recent  storm  that we had in this country. We,  in this House, mist make our position very clear.  We must tell the world, in no uncertain terms, that we stand by our President and by our  country we are patriotic and we love this  country and our President. Sir,  the Otherthing that I  would  like to mention  is that loyalty and patriotism really go beyond just a person. In everything we do,   if We are going to  maintain the integrity of His Excellency the President's Government and if we and to maintain that  image  of perfection, we must do  everything  loyally  and     patriotically For  instance.  if I do not domy job as an Assistant Minister in the Ministry of Energy,  who am  I letting down?'How cad I.claim to be loyal if I am not doing the job have  been given? If a certain civil  sevant is supposed to  lOOk after public  fund   and  it  is  found  that those funds are finding their way outside, how  can  that  civil servant  claim  to  beloyal  and patriotic? Who  is  that  civil servant letting down? It is  the Government of His Excellency the President that he  is  letting down. All  of us must  go  beyOnd the mere words; we must go down to the job  that we do every day and ask ourselves whether we are upholding the image of the Government that we all wish to have.  If not,  we should change accordingly so  that  at all  times  we hold  the esteem and  dignity  that His  Excellency  the President deserves." Therefore,  the   question of loyaity and patribtism goes beyond mere words  but cutsacross-everything we do. This does not only apply to hon.  Members of Parliament, civil servants and parastal employees but even to businessmen. I am saying thatbecause whatever businessmen carry out in this country reflects badly or positively on Kenya as a whole. Therefore,  all of us must,  whenever we see anything that might bring any suspicion whatsoever on the  standing of this country,  come out and oppose it.  That way,  just will be done and will be seen to be done,  and that will uphold the loyalty and patriotism of our people. Mr.  Speaker, Sir,  there have been diSturbing tendendies in some areas of this Country in the recent past. In particular,  there have been cases wherecircumcision of girls has mushroomed. This has happened in Meru District and inother parts of the Country. Initially, we thought that it Was merely the physicalact that was being carried out but,  on looking back and going deeper into the matter, We have realized that some elements are propagating a philosophy of going back to the roots.  This philosophy of  going back to the roots does not have national looks but tribal looks;  we are going backwards. When we ask ourselves why we are going back,  we find that there are some elements in this country who are actually propagating the re-emergence of the former Gikuyu,  Embu,andlMeru Association (GEMA) We  in Meru stnnd to be Counted with the rest of the Kenyans;  we are not for tribal Organisations;we stand above those because we know what GEMA stood for GEMA was a political machination that was used to divide people and we arenot prepared to go back to those dark ages. We must make our position very clear and tell the Kenya nation that the re-emergence of tribal  organisations,  no matter whether in religious forms,circumcision of girls or going back to the roots,  we can see them and we stand to be counted against any of those tendencies. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that point  should be very clear to whoever has been trying to mislead our people. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the other point which I would like to make is that we  should believe in ourselves. Like His EXcellency the President,  I am a great believer in the black man and I am extremely proud to be a black man.   However,  it it unfortunate to note that  on several occasions, our brothers and sisters, have looked down upon themselves.  There is nothing worse than looking down on oneself because then,  one would be saying that one is not  able to do anything by oneself. So,even before you try,  you have already condemned yourself.Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  8-4-4 system of education has been questioned bycertain sections of our society,  especially in the teaching profession.  I am oneof those unfortunate people who did not do any arts and craftS subject atprimary school level. However,  I know people older tbar me, who areable to repair chairs and they are a lot better off than I am because where Ispend money  to repair chairs,  they use their hands and keep themselves busy.When they go to do engineering work,  they have an easy time in the work becausethey are already used to using their hands to do that kind of work.Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the fact  that there were large failures in the recentK.C.S.E. does not in any way detract us from  the fact that  this country needsthe 8-4-4 system of education. If you look at the education systems in othercountries such as Thailand,  which I was very hiahly priviledged to visit recently,  Thailandthey have a similar education system,but in Thailand they call it 6-4-4. This systemworks exactly in the same way as our 8-4-4 system. In fact,  I understand thatthe United Kingdom  has recently also gone into a similar education system.Therefore, we must learn to believe in ourselves because indigenaus Kenyanscan come up with ideas that are worth to be emulated by the rest of the world.Our press,  our writers,  our philosophers and our leaders must  run fast.I am saying this because if our people do not  run fast,  the people who propagatewrong information, may teach our people the wrong things about themselves. Therefore,  I plead with all Kenyans to be proud of themselves because they were   made in the image of God."   With those few remarks,  I beg to support. </Newspeech> MR.K'OMBUDO: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to say a few words in support of this very important Motion.  Now, Sir,  hon.  Robert  Ouko is  not longer with us  and his death came to us like lightning or like a bomb. We have received the death of Robert Ouko as a great Shock in the Luo land,  particularly in Kisumu District. Even as  I speak inthis House today,  we still have a heavy heavy heart and are mourning. However,the only consolation that we have  had is having heard from His Excellency the President and the  Government,  that every effort is being made and will be made, to trace the killers of hon.  Dr. Robert Ouko,  the son of a humble peasant,  who worked his way up through pulling up his own socks.  He was just a simple P.3  teacher,  but he studied privately and attended various educational institutions including the highested institution of learning,  that is the university. He exelled in his work as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation. I would like to say more about this tragic event,  but I regard this whole episode as sub judice as they say in the legal language since investigations are still going on. However,  I would like to say that we are not used to policemen giving press conferences everyday and I would like to give a piece of advice here by saying I wish these people would stop doing so. I wish they could continue doing their work silently and then give us their report when they are through with it. I think it  is common knowledge that the killers of Dr.  Ouko are the subversiveelements who are amongst us. These are  the anti-progress elements and they arethe killers of Dr. Ouko   and I daresay that these people are here in Kenya and it behooves us now  as Kenyans to help the Government to net them out   I am happy to note that the leaders in Luoland,  including the Members of Parliament,  that is the  Assistant Ministers,  Ministers and hon. Members,  stood like men. We have told our people to be patient and we are still telling them to be patient, but this  tragic  event has  shaken us a great deal.  Now,  Mr.  Speaker Sir,  I do not have to  say much about the ability of the leadership in this country.  However,  many times we have heard eloquent speeches made  in this House which are  just empty flattery;  uwongo mtugul There  are very few genuine utterances and this is not good for our country. We are a young nation and are entitled to make our own mistakes, but the important thing is that we  should learn from our own mistakes. We are proud to govern ourselves and that is why we went to the forest to fight our former colonial masters. Indeed, this Government is lead by a black man and rightly or wrongly,  something has been achieved. The fact that we are governing  ourselves is most important. When we get incidents like the one we experienced the other day,  we  should get the couraged to say that nothing can go beyond Government's control. That is to our credit as a nation.   Sir,  I would like to appeal to those of us who are lucky to be in the Front Bench  to be more serious. The President  is one human being;  he cannot be omnipresent in the Ministry of Labour,  Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Agriculture and    so on. The  team that is in these offices should help him. I would liketo tattoo  talk about the Ministry of Agriculture. We are importingsugar  when we are short of foreign exchange  when sugarcane inthe whole  of the Nyanza sugar belt is rotting in the fields. We arenow using the scarce foreign exchange to import sugar. Somethingought to be done and I do not expect President Moi to go to Chemlil to order  the transportation of wananchi's sugar-cane to the factory when there   are officers who are supposed to do that, like the PermanentSecretary for the Ministry of Agriculture, the Minister,  the Assistant ministers and so on.What is this now?  The sugar-cane is rotting in the  fields. The President had made a policy decision that Miwani Sugar Factory should start arishing sugar-caneas, we were told by no one other than the Vice-President and , Minister for Finance of this country. He said it here but um to now the factory is lying idle   as the machines stopped working while crushing sugar-cane. Another point is with regard to education.  We have  to be more serious as far as education is concerned. In the recent results of the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education,  we were told that nobody had failed. The following day we were told that everybody had failed and that schools were not going to be compared to show who had excelled. Later,  we were given a list showing the schools which had performed well in order of merit. Where are we going?                                                                     We do not expect President Moi to so to the Ministry of . Education to instruct on what should be done.  He has delegated that job to other people and they should do it. There are omnipresent floods at Nyakach, Sangorota and Nyando. Do we expect the President to go there and drain the river?   What is this?   Those  in  the Front Bench should be serious because they are the ones who have been given the responsibility to do these jobs.  With those few remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech>(applause) <Newspeech>MR.MASINDE:  Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this very important Motion. I wish to thank His Excellency the President for his Presidential Address and advice which he gave yesterday.   I also wish to take this opportunity to join my hon. colleagues in expressing my sincere sympathyand regret far the loss of our dear beloved brother the late Dr. Robert Ouko. We in this country are lucky to have a President who ispractical all round. He loves this country and his people.   The Addresswhich he made yesterday was based on his love for the people of this country and for this country in general. Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  his Excellency the President has shown his love  for us  and  this country  in many ways.  He  has conducted Hrambee meeting for construction of schools. This has shown his  love  for children who will be future  leaders of this country.  He  has  also  conducted Harambee meetings  for constructions of hospitals,  Nyayo Wards,  dispensary and also for the assistance of the  disabled. In this way he has  shown the whole world that .hecares  for disabled. He has  also  spearheaded and encouraged ourinstitutions  of higher  learning to  carry out research in various fields. e  are  pleased to note  all these  things and wish to congratulate  him for the  successes that have resulted from his encouragement in researcht  agiiculture,  medicine  and even in engineering. At the  end of this week the President will hold a major Harambee meeting to raise money to enable bright children from poor families who  are unable to pay school fees to continue with their studies. His Excellency the President has show love for this country in many other ways. Duing our last recess he travelled throughoutthe  country tomeet this people  and see their activities. I hopethat  the  Front Bench copied his  example  and went  out to see for themselves what is  going in the  countryside with  respect to their Ministries. Probably this would help accelerate  development in this  country and at  the  same  time  curb wastage  in finances. must,  however,  congratulate  the  few Ministers who have  tried their best to carry out on the spot  fact finding of what is going in the countryside in connection with their Ministries. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  If his Excellency the  President has  alsotravelled outside Kenya. He  has explained  to the world what we  areand made other people in the world understand Kenya better.He  has  also helped other countries to achieve  peace  and others toachieve  their  Independence. In his Address yesterday he told us what he  is doing and what the  intends  to  do to help bring peace to Sudan and Ethiopia.  We  are well aware  of what he  has done inNamibia,  Iran and  South Africa.It  is  surprising that instead of us Kenyans, and particularly as   leaders,  complementing his Excellency the President to maintain     peace, which he has struggled to  establish here  and which is   enbling  him to  assist  other  countries,  we  are more  or less trying to help in destroying that product of the Nyayo Philosophy through rumour -mongering and  loose  talk. These  two  are definitely intended to destabilise  this  country.   I wonder whether we are really serious in trying to  follow the  Nyayo Philosophy. Mr. Speaker,  Sir, by  rumour  mongering  and entertainingloose  talk,   we  are  scaring away  investors,  tourists  and also     development  of  this  country.We  need  those  people,  whom  His  Excellency  the  President  has  worked hard to  bring hereSir,   I  am  appalled  by  the  recent  reports  in the  newspapers,  more so  about  my  own  district,  that  is, Busia  District,  about some subversive  leaflets  which  are  being distributed there. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>HON.  MEMBERS: Tell  us more  about  them! </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.J. MASINDE: Sir,  during the  whole  Recess, I havestayed  in  that district  and  I  have  not  heard of  such  issues. Let  the  Government  carry  out its  investigations,  but  I will  wait to  have  it  confirmed that  that  is  really true. But  if  it  is  not true,  what  are  we  all  upto? Sir,   just  before  I  come to my conclusion,  I wish to thank. His  Excellency  the President  and  the Ministry of  Agriculture  for recently  announcing  place for  the  building of  Nambale  Sugar  Factory. I  wish  to  support  hon.  Kanindo,  that We have   plenty of  sugar cane  which  is  rotting. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  K'OMBUDO:   On a  point  of  order,  Mr.   Speaker,   Sir.Mr.  Kanindo  is  no  longer  in  Parliament. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  P.J.  MASINDE: Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,   I  apologise  forthat mistake,   I meant  hon.  K’ombudo. I  wish  to  support  hisstatement which  he made  here  because  sugar  cane  is  actually rotting.  I  would  like  to  urge  the ministry  to  get  in  touch  with  the  person  who  has  been  given the  contract,  so  that that factory  can  be  constructed  as  soon  as possible  so  that  we  can begin  producing  sugar.  If  that factory is ready tommorow we  shall also  be  ready  to  produce  sugar  because  sugar cane  is  already  there  and mature.  If  we  do  that,  definitely we  shall  help  in saving foreign  exchange. Sir,  with  those  few  remarks,   I beg to  support  the Motion. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER  FOR  INFORMATION AND  BROADCASTING (Mr.   Kanja): Thank  you, very much, Mr.Speaker,  Sir,  for  seeing this head of Waruru  son  of  Wairimu  who  has lived to  see many moves.  Sir,   I  rise  to  say  what  I  have  said  in this  House  for the  last  twenty years  because  uwazee  hukumbukau.  Sir, His  Excellency  the  President  has  repeatedly  said that we  are hon.  Members  and whatever we do  must  reflect what k this  House stands for. It is very crucial,  whether one is in the House or  outside  the  House,  to  dare  or  have  the  audacity to  say a,   b,   c  and  d  is  going  to  happen,  thereby perpetuating rumour mongering  just  like  any  other  Kamau  and  Onyangn  in  a public  bar drinking  changaa. It  is  amazing. It  is deplorable,   Sir,  to  saythe  least,  when  those  who  have  been with  us  in  this  House  are  thesame  people  who  are  perpetuating  rumours. I  agree  with  hon.   Chesire,""shame  on  them"" We should  help  to  correct  the  situationwhen  the  going  is  still easy to  tackle. Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  I would like to hammer home three main Points.The  time  has  come  for us as a nation to take stock of every  thing;  see where we come from, how far we have come, what we have  achieved,  where we have  erred, where we have taken a wrong turning and what we  should do to correct  things. There  is no  shame in doing that. Every businessman, at the end of the year, takes  stock of what he has bought and sold In his business and draws a balance  sheet. Similarly,  we as leaders  should reflect and see what  our freedom fighters  fought  for. Why did they have to die? Iswhat we  are seeing   today what they fought for? We  should addressourselies to these  issues. That  is my first point. Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  we  should now observe,  maybe using a microscope,  if not  a pair of binoculars,  to see where we are. What are we doing? Are we delivering goods?   We have been elected to this august House by the people to serve them but not to serve ourselves. Corruption is rampant;  it is everywhere. It is  common knowledge that if you want  something to be done  for you quickly,  you have  got to give  ""Chai”. Corruption is  a terrible cancer. It is going to kill not  only Kenya but whole Continent  of Africa;   We  should be satisfied with the  salaries we  get  without having to  ask for kick-backs  from wananchi before we  can render service to them. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. M’Mkindia):  Onapoint  of  order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir. It  is not  my  intention tointerrupt  the  hon.  Minister.  But he  asked a question and left it hPnging in the  air. He  asked: ""Is  this what  the  freedom fighters fought  for""?   He  left that  question hanging.   I believe  that the Minister should teil us whether what he sees is what he expected or what they expected  so that we may know. If a question is left  hanging in the  air it  causes problems  in peoples minds. What  exactlyis  he  alluding to? What  are  you leading to? Could you tells  in morespecific  terms what you really mean? </Newspeech>"<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING  (Mt.  Kanja): Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  I wish I had three hours  to address  this august House. I would tell you in specific  terms what we  fought  for. But  I do not have  the time.  I  expect the hon. Member to know better and understand what  I mean when I  say that we  should ask ourselves what we  fought  for. Is this  the  freedom we  fought  for? Did we  fight  for   freedom to  eliminate  one  another? Is  that what you want  me  to  ask?I am asking you now. I have  been in this House  for a long time  andI know that leaders who come into  eminence have  gone the way the late  hon Dr.Ouko has  gone. We  talk using very  strong language  but notbing happens.  Up  to  this moment we  have never known   who took the  late Mr. J.M. Kariuki  to Ngong;   We were  led to  believe  that we shall eventually know the truth even if we  live for 100 years.   Mr.Speaker,  Sir,  you will not  be  in this world  in 100 years to come;  you will  either be  in Hell  or  in Heaven. May God help you to go to Heaven. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I wanted to  go  to point  number three. Having analysed what we  have  achieved and  whether we are  delivering the  goods,  we  should then focus on the  future  and  ask where we  are  going next.  Thank you. </Newspeech> <Header> ADJOURNMENT</Header> <Newspeech>MR.

Everybody knows that our President is the only person who   has the interests of this country at heart. The philosophy of of Peace,  Love and Unity, actually means the sustenance of, prorgress In all fields of human endeavour. It also means that we have  tomaintain the  security of this country at allcosts. The security of our country is not comnromisory.  Allow me,  Sir,  to quote fromthe Presidential Speech as follows: "It  is  imperative  for all Kenyans to be vigilant against possible ill motives of enemies of our development." Of late,  these ill motivated enemies of our development have been active  in the form of rumour mongers. These people are within our borders and they are the agents of doom'and we must stand together in order to defeat them. We do not want the clock to be  turned backwards;  we want to move forward and champion the motto "foward ever backward never. " If we remain a united country,  all  these  enemies will not dare touch us. With regard to our security,  I  think our Government should consider revamping our intelligence network so that it can aplly and swiftly foresee and forestall ill motivated moves by our enemies. Our organs of the state must cultivate and promote closeness of the Goverment to the people at all times Of late,  I think,  one of the local   daily newspapers has notbeen doing that. It has instead tried to alienate the people from theGovernment by introducing .rumour mongering. All  the  local newspapers especially at  this  time of the year  should be able to cultivate and promote tb   closeness of the Government with the people as that will scare away the rumour mongers. I will auote further from the Presidential Speech as follows:-""Human beings are and must remain the focus of our development effort."" If human beings are the focus of our development, then things like  shortages  of certain commodities should nottoccur in our Independent Kenya. We have been Independent for over 25 years  and onewonders why we run short of sugar when sugar-cane is grown in. the country.I am not sure of this,  but I think there might be agents workinE against our Government.  Perhaps,  these people have started with the sugar initstry so that  the people get.disatisfied with the Government.  This is because if the people lack essential commodities like sugar, they get dissatisfied and start blaming the Government.  What is actually happening? We have  often seen people  in the rural areas,dueueing for sugar whereas sugar-cane  is rotting in the sugar belt areas and the sugar factories grounded to a halt. What is the problem? We  need to  ask ourselves what is happening,  or whether it is sabotage.  We  should look for  answers to  these  questions. Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  of late  diesel has also been in short  supply.  Diesel is,  actually,  used in the  transport industry and without it work in our farms may be grounded because things like  fertilizers  cannot reach farmers. Perhaps this shortage  of diesel affects the  farming community much more than other  communities. Even schools may not be  able  to  get books and food  since  these  items have  to be transported. Sir, once  more  I would like  to  touch on roads. For along time roads  have been a headache  in this  country;  I do notknow what we  are  going to do because  all the  time we are told that  our roads are being improved. I would like  to  suggest thatthe Ministry of Public Works  sets up district roads advisory committees and charges  them with the responsibility of the maintenance and construction of roads in their respective districts. Perhaps,  we  shouldfurther and establish similar committees in the  divisions,  because wananchi actually know their roads better. We  could even introduce cost-sharing, in road work;  wananchi  are ready to  construct and maintain roads in the rural areas,  because without roads products like  milk cannot get to the factories. In my constituency tea is rotting because  it  cannot get to  the factories; it  gets to  the  factories  it cannotbe  transported out  of the  factories after being processed. We are  very worried about  this matter because  tea is an important foreign exchange  earner,which we are always short of 14 our country. So unless we  can transport  our tea to  and from thefactories,  then we  are  going to  face  problems. This may in turndefeat  our District Focus-for-Rural Development strategy.  More Over, wananchi will be unable  to pay school fees for their children even when they have  picked their tea. Therefore,  Iwould really want  to  see  something done  about  our roads. We  donot want  to have  officers who  are  answerable  to  other  officers; we  would like  wananchi  to  supervise  officers involved in road work. Mt.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  our 8-4-4 system of educationis good for  pupils in standards  one up to form two. But  in the  caseof forms  three  and four the  syllabus  is  a   bit  overloaded;  I think the Ministry of Education should do.something about  it. I note that we  do not have  many Ministers here but  I think all the Ministries  should be, represented here whenever we have  debate. We have Ministers  and Assistant Ministers  and it  is not good for us to make  our  contributions without Ministers to take notes;  this may show that we  are  not taking our deliberations in, this House very seriously. I hope  the Ministers who  are here will take  notesand pass  them over to their colleagues. I think students informs three  and four should be allowed to choose from six to eight  subjects, but not 10  subjects doing 10  subjects is  a bit too much. Sir,  most  of the  county councils now have  a lot  of money because  they are  collecting Cess. So, Ithink it is high time we increased councillors  allowances in order to attract the right  people  to man our councils. At  present  councillors  are  notgiven travelling allowances. I think  county councils must alsobe represented. in our district  development committees.With those remarks,  I beg to  support the Motion. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  P.J.

MASINDE:  Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  the Presidential Address is very important - in fact it  is  the  theme of  our work in the whole  of this Third Session. Yesterday I hadthe  chande  to contribute  to this debate,  and I  joined my colleaguesin congratulating the  President for whatever he has done  for this  country;  I  also  joined my colleagues  in expressing our sympathy for  the  loss  of our colleague  the  late hon.  Dr. Ouko and I  thanked the  President for the  efforts he is making to assist Nambale  Constituency.  I am sure  my constituents would very much have  liked to  associate  themselves with me,  as their spokesman, in the  sentiments  I expressed here;   Unfortunately,  I listened over the Voice  of Kenya but nothing was reported about my speech. The Minister  for Information and Broadcasting spoked immediately after me,  and talked about corruption and so  on:  Do  I understand that no  corruption is involved in omitting some  peoples  contributions in this House  from Voice  of Kenya coverage? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Mr. P.J.  Masinde,  your point  is Taken,  but the Chair is at a loss as to what it should do because your point  of  order  comes right in the  middle  of the business before  the House. I would have  preferred that you raised that point of orderbefore  the resumption of the  debate.

SALAT: Thank you very much,  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,for giving me  this  opportunity to  join my colleague in contributing to this Motion  on the  Presidential Address. First  of all,  Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  we must thank the Almighty  God  for giving us  a God-fearing,  peace loving and a magnanimous President. God's creation is vast  the whole  of mankind belongs to  God. So,  we  as members  of the human race,  have been blessed by the  Almighty  God  in giving us  a President who has led to great  heights  of prosperity. The achievements which this country has  attained  since  His Excellency the President  took over the reigns of leadership are not  easy to count. His  Excellency the President has  spent  a lot  of time preaching about the Nyayo philosophy  of Peace,  Love  and Unity. However,  his  efforts  are beingfrustrated by a few disgruntled elements who do not represent thewishes  of the majority  of Kenyans. The same people  have been.spreading rumours. They are  people who like to take  advantages  ofnational tragedies.   They are the  same people who would very much.like  to  see this country being plunged  into  a state  of chaos.   But who will benefit from chaos  in this country?"  If this  country is thrown into chaos  every Kenyan will suffer. It is not  our wish to see this  country plunged into  chaos where  children,  women and other innocent wananchl will suffer and die. There  are  a few harmful people whose  intention is to  create problems  for the  majority of  Kenyans. Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  the time has come  for us leaders to  sit  back and ponder over the  achievements  this  country has made since Independence. We should  also  look back and ponder over the achievements that this country has attained  since His Excellency the  President  took over the reigns  of leadership. The 8-4-4 system of  Education is a good  system of  education which has 172made Kenya a unique country in Africa. The number of our universities has increased, and we also have the Nyayo Wards, Nyayo Tea Zones, the Nyayo Buses and the recent discovery of the anti-AIDS drug, Kemron, by the Kenya Medical Research Institute. Also the University of Nairobi has been able to design and build a Kenyan car using locally manufactured components. These are wonderful achievements and one wonders as to why some people find it proper to sit down and engage themselves in loose talk that is aimed at creating Inst ability in the country. They just want to create problems for over 22 million Kenyans who are peace loving.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we, as leaders must emulate His Excellency the President. If we want this, country to be better than what it is now, we must emulate His Excellency the President." I just wish we could have really committed leaders in every province. If we had leaders in very province, who are as committed to this country as His Excellency the President, this country would, not be what it is today. But we spend most of our time in. idle talk and HE gossip." We are not helping His Excellency the President- We must all realise that we have, been elected into this House so that we can lead our people in following the footsteps of His Excellency the President. Without acting responsibly it is not possible for us to attain peace and property. I say this because Members of Parliament are the eyes of the people and as such we must all join hands and assist His Excellency the President to make this country a prosperous nation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no reason why God should lookon us with favour when in fact we do not appreciate his blessings. Wehave neighbours who are already in political turmoils and are fighting bitter civil wars. Famine is threating to wipeout populations in those countries. But here in Kenya we have a lot food and we are peaceful. Therefore, we must thank God for making this country a unique country. I say this because Kenya is not immune to the misfortunes that have "befallen other countries. But God chose to make Kenya a unique country in the world. So, we should be very grateful to the Almighty God. We read from the scriptures that there was a time when the Almighty God wiped out generations of mankind from the face of the earth because of their wickedness. They did not appreciate what the good Lord was doing for them. I personally pray that the Lord does not allow this country to plunge into chaos for being ungrateful to Him. As leaders we must realise that none of this is indispensable. Leaders will come and go and our country is on the run. So, we should be at the forefront in defending our national integrity and sovereignty. We have sac sworn in this House to defend the Constitution of this country and therefore we should be in the front line when it comes to maintaining law and order in this country. If we do not abide by our vows then we will suffer.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, security is a very crucial thing in the development of any country. A country cannot develop without an effective security network. I must thank His Excellency the President for allowing Members of Parliament to become members of the district development committees and district tender boards.  This is because these are organs which are very crucial to develop¬ment at the district level. Security is of paramount importance because there can be no development without security. Since Members of Parliament are part and parcel of the people who defend the security of this country, I urge the Government to consider allowing Members of Parliament and other elected leaders to become members of the district security committees. This is because thedistrict security committees are organs which act as security watch-dogs at the district level on behalf of the Government. However, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, you will find that civil servants are being to the districts when in fact they know nothing about the security aspect of those particular areas. These officers may not be able to give good guidance to the Government as far sis the maintenance of law and order in those areas is concerned. So, I believe that hon. Members who are very well conversant with the security situation in the areas they come from should be allowed to become members of the district security committees.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Members come here to represent the people who elected them. Over the years there has been a tendency by Members of Parliament to ask Questions in this House pertaining to their constituencies. Through asking these Questions hon. Members have not achieved a lot. We ask Questions in this House on behalf of the people we represents So, we expect to be given answers that are going to hkhb±3± solve the problems facing our people. But you will find that when Questions are asked in this House they are not treated with the seriousness they deserve. The Front Bench must pay close attention to the Questions we ask in this House. I believe that the Front-benchers defend civil servants just for the sake of it. There is no shame in accepting that civil servants make mistakes and there is no shame in saying that things are going to be corrected. But you will find that whenever we bring Questions here, Ministers just stand to defend their officers in the field just for the sake of it. The Ministers tend to push aside the serious Questions asked by hon. Members in this House. So, when you go back to your constituency the officer and he tells you "You asked that Question in Parliament and I prepared the written reply." This has been very insubordination to hon. Members. So, during this Session in the second Nyayo Decade, Ministers must be very serious in answering our Questions. They should give relevant answers to our Questions.With those few remarks, I beg to support the Motion.<Newspeech>MR. KAGWIMA: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, forgiving me this opportunity to talk on the Presidential Address which wasdelivered by His Excellency the President on 13th March, 1990. V.First of all, I would like to congratulate His Excellency thePresident for the very able leadership that he has rendered services to this country and for the way he has continuously endeavoured to advise the leaders of this country and the wananchi in general. At this juncture, I call upon all leaders myself included, to take heed of the advice the President has given us.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would, at this juncture, like torecord my sorrow and sadness on the death of the late hon. Dr. Robert Ouko,something that we did not expect. Death is a very difficult thing tostop. So, I say from my heart, that, this is a sorrowful time for Kenyans.The other item I want to cover in my contribution concernsFreedom. This is the freedom that we, Kenyans, have enjoyed and continueto enjoy. This, freedom might be taken for granted, especially by the youngpeople who were born after Kenya, attained Independence. These are the peoplewho were not old enough to realise the problems that some, of the old peoplewe have encountered. I was not really involved in the struggle for Independencebut I was old enough to realise the problems that ray parents and other peoplewho were adults at that time underwent during the colonial rule. It is,therefore, important that we use every means available to us to safeguardthis freedom that was earned the hard way. In fact, we would not want toremind ourselves of the things that were happening at that time, otherwise.we would be very hostile to the wazungu. With freedom comes developmentand many other good things. So, it is my sincere hope that with the freedomthat we enjoy; the freedom that we must use to develop our country, our human resources will be properly utilized for the development of this country.		We have many examples of countries that do not enjoy freedom, including  South Africa. We hear of and see many atrocities being committed in those countries because there is no freedom. We also know of countries that have gone many miles behind the point at which they attained their independence because they have not been able to safeguard that freedom. So, we should be careful that we do not start going backwards after having done so much for our country. Peace is important for education and many other spheres of development.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in his Presidential Address, His Excellency the President mentioned the discovery of Kemron. This is an Aids drug that has been discovered by a Third World country. There are very few people, if any, who believed that" Kenya-would be the first country to discover this drug. In fact, this is unbelievable even to some of us. We, therefore, congratulate the scientists who came up with, this drug, together with the Minister for Research, Science and Technology. We hope that these scientists will continues to come up with new discoveries for the development of our country.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the next item I want to talk about is about the Kenyan car  the Nyayo Pioneer 1, Nyayo Pioneer 2 and Nyayo Pioneer 3.. It was only four years ago when His Excellency the President challenged the university community to come up with a Kenyan car a car manufactured locally using local, materials. Today this is a reality. These three cars have been designed, manufactured and assembled by our own local people. We are now looking ahead with the expectation that a production line producing these cars will be started. We hope that the people involved in the manufacturing of these cars will be efficient enough to keep the prices low so that the vehicles will be appreciated. Otherwise, if the cars cure made more expensive than the ones we import, the ordinary wananchi will not realise the fruits of the labours of the local scientists. So, the price and -efficiency of the car will be of paramount importance. Ibelieve the able Minister for Research, Science and Technology and those involved in the production of the car will take time to ponder over these issues so that we are able to buy them cheaply so that our people can use them to bring about development.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I agree with His Excellency the President that unity is important for the continued enjoyment of our freedom and development. The entire nation requires a common bond all of us should head towards the same direction. This should be taken seriously. It has been mentioned here in this House and in many other fora that we should take unity as a very important tool for development. We should be thinking of the needs of this country and working for the betterment of the conditions that we found in the country. We should be united to do justice to those, who elected us. Some of the disagreements that have come up at a personal level are as a result of personal, greed, not saying that hon. Members are greedy at a personal level, but there are few of us who, instead of. using their positions to deliver services, they use them to reduce others to low levels so that those others are not anywhere near them to compete, with them. The moment one starts worrying that his-position might be taken by somebody else, he wastes a lot of time If a person is in a position today, he should do the very best to ensure that he delivers the goods to those people he is supposed to. You should not worry about your position, if it has to be taken, it will be taken. But we should not undermine our friends especially at the district level. I mention the district level because such things are quite common at that level. Of late, His Excellency the President has been going round "reconciling leaders in various disagreements. I think it is as a result of personal greed that people are afraid of others. A leader thinks "so-and-so is capable of doing this or that to me".To wind up, Mr. Deputy speaker, Sir, let me say that attendance of" hon. Members to this House is very important because very important Motions and Bills are passed here when many hon. Members are away. With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. MCHARO: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for this opportunity. First of all I would like to congratulateHis Excellency the president for the tremendous peace that this country has enjoyed over the years. I pray that the same situation will continue for the benefit of this country. Unfortunately, this peace can be destroyed by the leaders of this country and especially by hon. Members of Parliament. This is because we are the spokesmen of our people who always look upon us to maintain this peace that His Excellency the President preaches about all the time. So it is upon us as leaders to do everything possible to ensure that this peace that has been established by the President is maintained in this country forever and ever.I would like to emphasise that if every hon. Member concentrated on his own constituency doing what is expected him in building his constituency and in rallying support of his constituents by maintaining effective leadership there, I am sure that we would go a long way in assisting His Excellency the President in maintaining peace in this country. That way I am sure that it will be easy to identify those who are out to spoil peace in this country.Wrangles in an area makes the intentions of the leaders in those areas questionable. This is because, for example, you might have an hon. Member of Parliament and a Kanu Chairman always at loggerheads. Such clashes between such two leaders make their integrity questionable. We in fact have had cases where for example an hon. Member of Parliament is wrongly accused by a Kanu chairman in that area just because this chairman is an opponent: of the hon. Member. I would like to suggest the political leadership of a given area should be vested in our person. This is because when we, for example, have an area where the hon. Member is not the Kanu district.chairman or the sub—branch chairman, then there will always be wrangles in this area. This is because the hon. Member will always be at loggerheads with the Party leaders of that area. When such a thing happens then peace in that area will be threatened.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the President should be thanked for the I recent discoveries like the drug Kemron and the manufacture of the Nyayo Pioneer Cars. I hope that our researchers will intensify their activities to make more discoveries On our side as leaders in this country we should support our researchers so that more inventions and discoveries are made for the benefit of this country. We would welcome very much the discovery of a vaccine for malaria and other diseases that affect people in this country. With such discoveries, we can set up industries locally, manufacture some of these drugs and sell some overseas to earn this country the much needed foreign exchange earnings.While still on that point I would like to appeal tothe Government to set up car manufacturing industries to produceas many cars as possible for sell locally and abroad. Of course,we expect these cars to be a little bit cheaper than the imported ones. Since these cars are very expensive it is very difficult for the ordinary wananchi to afford them. We have come to a stage in this country where a car is no longer a luxury but a necessity. We would have expected that since some cars are assembled here in this country they would be cheaper than the imported ones; but this is not the case. Because of these exorbitant prices people in this country cannot afford them.We would also like to see as many local industries established here and there as much as possible to provide employmentto our people. Sometime I ask myself in vain why we should beexporting raw tea and coffee instead of establishing industries, to locally process these products and export the end products abroad. We should in fact aim at manufacturing goods locally so that we can export them instead of importing them. If we did this then we would earn this country more foreign exchange than we are earning at the moment. This is a point that needs looking into to generate more employment thus maintaining the peace that is prevailing in this country at the moment.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to commend the Ministry of Education for the work that they are doing. Although some people are saying that the 8—4—4 system of education is a failure some ofus are of the opinion that it is succeeding verywell. The only problem is that the performance of our studentsin the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education: was not as goodas it should have been. I think the solution here should be toreview the curriculum and the syllabus such that during theexamination there should be a system whereby schools where there are no laboratories or workshops the students do not sitfor the practical, examinations. The performance in most schools	especially in the Harambee schools where these facilities are non-existant was very poor just because the students were sitting forexaminations which they knew nothing about. So the Ministry shouldlook into this issue very seriously so that the performance of ourstudents can improve. In fact it is not that our students are notintelligent but it is just because they lack the facilities necessary to do those subjects. In this regard I would like to urge the inspectorate to go round the country and recommend which schools should offer practical subjects and which ones should not. Schools which do not have laboratories and workshops should not be allowedto offer practical examinations. This is because if they are allowedto do that then the students in those schools are bound to fail in those examinations. So the Ministry should take that point into account for the benefit of the children of this country and their parents who pay the school fees.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Harambee spirit should be encouraged so that facilities can be improved in our schools. In this regard I must commend the President for initiating the Presidential Bursary Fund to aid the poor children and to assist the schools in developing the practical facilities. With those remarks, I support.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Nassir): Ahsante 3ana, Bw. Naibu Spika, kwa kunipatia nafasi hii. ill naxni nitoe maneno mac loach, kuhusu Hotuba ya Mtukufu Rais.Swanza, nataka ifahamike katika Kenya na ulimwengu vro te kwa jumla namna tunavyoiendesha Serikali yetu, namna Mungu alivyotu patia Mtukufu Rais mwenye i Tnani na mpenda watu wote. Kifo cha marehemu WaiirriDaktari Ouko kinachunguzwa kwa kila njia. Kwa mfano, kuna makachero wengi, yaani Criminal Investigation Depart¬ment (C.I.D.) officers, askari::kutoka Scotland Yard na kadhalika. Habari zote kuhusu kifo cha marehemu Dak taxi Ouko zikishatolewa, Kenya n.zima itajulishwa ni nani aliyehusika na kifo cha marehemu.Kwa ajili ya imani, ya Mtukufu Rais, - alihudhuria mazishi ya marehemu Daktari Ouko na pia aliwashawishi watu wawe na umoja na imani. Kwa sababu ya imani ya Mtukufu Rais, hata wale ambao ni waovu kwake- na wako karibu naye, bado- hajagusa hata mmoja wao.. Hii ni kwa sababu Mtukufu Rais huenda kanisani kila wakati. Ye ye amekuwa kama yule mtu ambaye alikanyagwa na mtu mwingine mguu na alipomwambia Yesu maiabo hayo Yesu akamwambia amsamehe kwa sababu ni binadama. Mtukufu Rais Moi ana tabia kama hiyo hiyo- Lakinikomtukana na teie. kumvunjia heshima sana,SI Igeuka, tusije tukamlaumu nrfcu yeyote kwa sababu yeye ni binadamu na Mwafrika kama mwenzakelBw.

Mtukufu Rais Moi alikuwa Makamu Rais waV.Hayati Mzee Jomo Kenyatta wakati huo.  Alisukumwa hap a na pale na	amri ana uwezowowote. Lakini. kwa sababu alikuwa anampenda Hay at i Mzee Jomo Kenyatt; hakufanya lolote. Watu hawakuweza kuiuliza Serikali ya Hay at i Mzee Jomo Kenyatta "Mbona hatupatiwi ripoti kuhusu kifo cha marehemu J.M.? "J.M." aliuawa na kutupwa msituni. Sasa leo Mtukufu Rais Moi ambaye alikuwa Makamu-Rais 11a ambaye alikuwa akiandamana na Hayati Mzee Jomo Kenyatta 11a hakuwa na uweso vvowote kuhusu mambo kama hayo, mbona anaulizwa masvvali kuhusu kifo cha mars he mu "J.M."?

Naibn.iSpika, tunataka ukweli ndani ya Kenya na pia ia±££t- traira heshima. Kama tumemkubali Mtukufu Rais Moi kama 2ais weird, pia ni lazima tumpe heshima sawa na vile tulimpa Hayati Mzee Jomo Kenyatta. We are going to do that I Ni lazima tumpatie heshima yake vile vile. Hatuwezi kuketi chini tukiwaona Mawaziri wengine wakizungumza na Mtukufu Rais Moi na kuinua kiLdole juu hivi we are not going to allow some Ministers to talk  against the Government while they are still Government:Bw. Naibu Spika, tumo katika en am a. lei mo j a cha kuiendeshal Seri¬kali hii. Nataka kuwafaharaisha kwamba tutaiendesha Serikali hii na tutaendelea na Mtukufu Rais Moi, na hqTcna. atakayefanya ujeuri wowote Mtu akileta ujeuri wowote, mume.:kwa iffujftrwa; husema "mundu kwa mundu". Hii ni kwa sababu tulijitolea.na kama kuna madhara, basi tutakuja kudhulumiwa sisi sote.Watu wote Kenya nzima wanampenda Mtukufu Rais lakini kunao wachache ambao wanafikiri kwamba labda Mtukufu Rais aki wakosaKenya haiwezi kuendelea mbele. This is what I think is in theirminds. Lakini nataka kuwaambiaJsraaiba niliwaona wengi nilipoingia katika Bunge hili lakini siwaoni leo. . Wao walikuwa na makoti makubwa na walikuwa waki fur a. Sasa hawako lakini Kenya inaendelea mbele. Kwa hivyo, watu. hawa sasa. wakikosa adabu, vile vile watafanywa hivyo. Badala ya kufikiria yale mambo mazuri ambayo Mtukufu Rais ameifanyiaKenya hii, wanafanya mambo yao.j Hebu niambieni ni. Rais yupi katikaBara Afrika ambaye hufi ki.ria. mambo kama ya mtoto kukosa karo yashule, iiiliiigi kwa watoto wa shule, kuunda motokaa ndarri ya Afrika,kufanya Harambee na mambo yote yale mazuri? Yale mambo yote mazuriambayo ameleta hatuyaoni lakini tunauliza kuhusu yale mambo ambayo  hakuwa na uwezo juu yake. Lakini tuliogopa kumwuliza aliyekuwa na uwezo. Basi hii ni sawa na kusema tumheshimu Mtukufu Rais na tutaheshimi ana. Nami namshiikuru Mungu kwa sababu wale watu wote wa kawaida wa Kenya wanamheshimu Mtukufu Rais kwa sababu wameiona kazi yake. Lakini kama kunao wachache ambao wanafikiriL eti wanaweza kumtejta Mtukufu Rais, the time is gone. Tumekubaliana juu ya loyalty. If non-brother is against President Moi, I will also go against. Ha.kuna haja ya kusema eti huyu ni ndugu yangu asibaye ana-i	Sor-i kni i halafu we we ni Waziri na huwezi kusema kitu.If you do not want his Government, just resign. Ingefaajumwache aiendeshe Serikali pamoja na wale watu ambao wanampenda pamoja naSerikali yake. Sisi tunataka kuona mambo mazuri katika Kenya. tuna mambo mengi ya:kui anya katika Kenya, na ipimojavrapo ni kushauriana, kama hakuna mtu ambaye anamwogopa mwenzake. Mimi nilizaliwa Barawa. Nilienda Lanru- halafu Mombasa. Kabila langu ni ldogo sana na lina watu wachache. lakini ukinifanyia ujeuri eti kwa sababu kabila lako ni kubwa, basi nami nitatafuta yale makabila mengine madogo madogo, tuungamane halafu tupigane na kabila lako ambalo ni kubwa na nitakushinda. There. is no minority tribe in. Kenya! Dkitufanyia ujeuri k»va sababu ya kabila lako, basi tutaungamana sisi sote halafu tukupige. So one had better be very careful.Bw. Naibu Spika, sisi tunataka kuiendesha nchi hii yetu ya Kenya kwa amani, tunataka mapenzi na pia ukweli. THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Nassir)(Ctd.): Sote tuliokula kiapo siku ile tulipoingia katika Bunge tuliweka sahihi ya kuthibitisha kwamba tutakuwa waaminifu na. watiifu kwa Rais Moi, na tutamsaidia. Mbona mambo haya yote yanatokea leo? Ningependa kusema kwamba hata kama huna pesa za kumpa Mtukufu Rais, yeye hana haja ya pesa zako wala haitaji umshikie bunduki, bali anahitaji tu uichunguze wilaya yako ili ujue ni kwa narana gani . alivyo mwema kwa watu wako. Kufanya hivi ni bora kushinda kuongea tu katika Bunge. Ukiita mkutano wa waandishi, unafaa kuwaambia watu wako, "Jamani, kuna fulani machafu ambayo hamfai kuyasikiliza. Mtukufu Rais ni mtu mzuri, na tunahitaji kuiendesha Serikali yetu sawa sawa." Lakini hatufanyi hivi, bali hunyamaza kimya tu. Unafikiri shirika la utangazaji la British Broadcasting Corporation na mashirika mengine kama hili yanapata habari za kutangaza kutoka wapi? Yanazipata kutoka kwa watu wetu. Ikiwa mtu hasemi kwamba hiki ni cha uongo na kile ni cha kweli, yeye huwa mwongo, na kimya chake ni dalili ya. uongo wake.Bw. Naibu. Spika, ninaomba leo sote tuungane pamoja ili tuweze kuilinda. Serikali yetu na kuyadumisha.makabila yote katika umoja kwa .sababu. uchafu wo wote ukiingia hapa nchini, utatufikia sote. Ahsante.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chance. I strongly support the Address that His Excellency the President delivered in this august House on 13th March, 1990. It is our duty as Kenyans to promote unity in the country. I am sure that the layman has no problems in this, regard because our policy is clear, and so is the Kanu Manifesto. One of our policies is to protect this country against external enemies. The lives and properties of the people of this country should be protected, and it is the duty of all patriotic Kenyans to do so.In order to support the President and the policies of Kanu and the Government, we, leaders must be implementers, who implement our policies practically. We should promote unity and uproot corruption from among ourselves and from those people who want to get rich overnight. We cannot make Kenya a better country when we have people who want to grab other people’s property.Such people are greedy and selfish, and they do not support the President. I want to say that some Ministers do not support the President. We have a lot of shortages in the country today, and yet no Minister has dared to say anything about the situation. They are waiting for President Moi to speak about it. How are we going to promote the Nyayo Philosophy if we do not make relevant decisions before the President directs us to do so. Some Ministries have not reached the district level although we have the District Focus for Rural Development Strategy which states that every Ministry go down to the district level. In Turkana, the Ministry of Technical Training and Applied Technology, for example, has not opened its offices since its creation. We have polytechnics there, but they are not under the Ministry; they just float like that. We have allocated some land there to the Ministry and we have been promised sheds there, but the Ministry has not fulfilled its promise. How are we going to</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TECHNICAL TRAINING AND APPLIED TECHNOLOGY (Mr. Thuo): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I do not want to interrupt my friend, hon. Ekidor, but I am an Assistant Minister for Technical Training and Applied Technology and as hon. Ekidor would know, the Ministry is very busy trying to see that all areas of the country are reached". It is not only his area that has not been reached; other areas as well have not yet been reached, but we have not forgotten these areas.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is a point of information, and not of order, and what I am saying is still true.The Ministry of Reclamation and Development of Arid, Semi-arid and Wastelands was created only recently and yet it has reached even many at as everywhere in the country. Why is it that the Ministry of Technical Training and Applied Technology has not reached certain areas so far? I praise the Minister for Reclamation and Development of Arid, Semi-arid and Wastelands for his effectiveness. His Permanent Secretary has travelled everywhere in the country, and the Minister himself has gone even to Israel to get experts to assist us. I am sure that his projects will succeed, and this is how to support The President by making decisions to implement what we are supposed to do-Why do we have shortages of commodities that we have here? There is plenty of food in Kenya, just as is the case with sugar, but the Minister in charge has never dared to say anything about the shortage of these commodities. What, are we supposed to do? How are we going to support the President? Are we going to leave everything to the President? The President is a decision ¬maker and he has around him leaders who are supposed to implement things. Why should we blame the layman for nothing?The other thing I want to say, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, regards retired men. People who have retired from the Civil Service and the political system are the ones who are going round spreading rumours because they already have got their pension and now they want to spoil other people’s pension. The Government should get rid of these people. They are enjoying their pension, but they want to spoil other people’s pension, and I appeal to the Government to get rid of them.</Newspeech> 		<Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: How? How? MR. EKIDOR: Waweke ndani.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to mention something about education, although I do not see the Minister concerned here</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: It is all right. There are other Ministers</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the education "bread" should be properly shared throughout the country. It should be shared equally everywhere from Lokichoggio to Kilifi and from Tana River to Kibis. The first Kenya Secondary Certificate of Education examination was terribly poorly done in the country because there was no proper distribution of teachers and educational facilities. The distribution of school equipment that there was only favoured Central and Eastern Provinces. Candidates from other provinces failed the examination. If you take Turkana District, for example, you will find that not even a single student will go to the university because none of the students there got even a "C+" grade. This is because we were not supplied with qualified teachers; we only got untrained teachers. Teachers are the most under paid workers in the country. They should be paid highly so as to arouse their interest in teaching. Most teachers have run away and joined other organisations, which give them a lot of money. What does the Ministry of Education, do about this situation? The Minister for Education, like the President, should visit all districts in Kenya and see to it that qualified teachers and physical educational facilities are equally distributed everywhere.There are some poor districts in Kenya where the residents cannot participate in the so-called cost sharing exercise. For instance, my district cannot be compared with others in Central and Eastern provinces. The funny thing is that the few facilities that are provided by the Government are given to the already advanced districts and the so-called national schools. Every school in Kenya is a national school. Why should some schools.be equipped with everything, including trained teachers when others have nothing? That is discriminating, against children belong¬ing to one father. The Minister for Education and his Ministry should be fair in the distribution of trained teachers. I also feel that teachers should be paid properly so that they can concentrate in their work.With those few remarks, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. BONYO: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to join my hon. colleagues in supporting the speech by His Excellency the President in opening this Third. Session of the Sixth Parliament during the second Nyayo decade.	 Mr. Deputy Speaker. Sir, before contributing to the debate. I would like to make one small, correction to the Press. In today’s edition of The Standard newspaper, I am reported as hon. "Obonyo". Although. I would like to be baptised, I would not like it to be that way. I think, this is the second or third time tiiat this mistake has been repeated and I would like, my friend, the reporter from The Standard newspaper to know that it is hurtsome for one to be called by a wrong name. I know that there are people who believe that people from my community who are male should have names starting with the letter "O" and females should have the names starting with the letter "A", but that one is not the case it is a wrong belief.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, allow me to pay tribute to the late Dr. Ouko for the invaluable contribution he made to the debates in this House, for the friendly diplomatic and humane approach he had towards problems and for his complete loyalty to the President. I say complete because if there is any who was loyal to this country and to His Excellency the President, Dr. Ouko was one. The late Dr. Ouko, vividly and saccintly articulated the policies of this country and alsb the aspiration and wishes of our beloved President while he lived. We in Nyanza Province, are still having the shock lingering among us because of the late Dr. Oukos untimely death. We buried his remains and not the body, but we believe that the good that he did while living will lives after him and that his departure should not cause us to be indifferent.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, during the time when we were busy mourning the loss of our brother that dedicated and committed servant of this country some people took advantage of the situation to cause chaos and despondency among Kenyans. Those people began to circulate unfounded rumours, but I am glad, that the leaders of Nyanza Province kept their heads and showed their ability to manage the leader¬ship of the: people, in that area Had." It not been, for the enlightened and dynamic leadership of His Excellency the President, a lot more would have happened during that sad period. We know that the perpetrators, of the late. Dr. Oukos death must have had an aim an aim of trying to destabilise the Government of this country. We are not for them. Those of them who thought that the Luo community would yield to their pressure are misled. We are resolved and we have, come together to review the situation, and we have come out with a resolution that irrespective of what the situation may be, nobody will drive a wedge between us and His Excellency the President; between us and the Government of this country or between us and the ruling party. We remain loyal and dedicated to the service of this country and we shall continue to serve this country under the leadership of His Excellency the: President with all the faithfulness deserved.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that during that, particular time when we were mourning our late colleague, a few uncalled for things happened. Even when the person responsible for the security of this country, was trying to explain to the country the findings, of the police then, there were people who penetrated a feW young people to call for his resignation. The call was far fetched, very much untimely and completely out of place. We renew our solidarity with the system in this countrtyvand hope that thosek people who would like t6 see us plung into problems are dealt with when the truth comes to light.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, His Exaellency the Presideat talked about the need To be ensure that in this country as facilitated. In hisPresidential Address, the President said:"Hon. Member of this House will in particular have to set the pace in consolidating our unity. There is no room in the present day Kenya for personality clashes and hollow accusations. Political intrigue is of no "benefit to anyone. As hon. Members of this House, we should upheld truth at all times and place the interest of the nation before our own.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, some of the leaders have fallen vietims ofrumour mongering. I would like to say that we as leaders,must always standby the President; We must at all times support the Government and must alwaysgo by the truth and not by rumours. If the rumours which have been circulatingwere aimed at causing chaos in this country, then those who started those rumoursshould be dealt with firmly. These people should not only be questioned, but should also be brought before a court of law, tried and if found guilty sentenced.With those few remarks Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. ole Ntimana):Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I stand to support very strongly, the PresidentialAddress from the Chair. I think this was a very inspiring Speech andI will go a long way to influence our lives and activities in this Republic.The most important thing that the President talked about was peace. It isimportant far us as leaders to remember that peace is very important for thedevelopment of our country. We have come a long way in our socio economic and in all fields of development and this has come about as a result of the peacethat we have in this country. His Erellency President Daniel arap Moi, hasled this nation into an atmosphere of peace and stability life all know that His Excellency tie President himself has been one of the pillars of economic development in this country. These pillars of economy and social advancement include things like education. His Excellency the President has personality spearheaded the development of education in this country which has now reached a very highlevel compared to other African countries.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President has also established the Nyayo Tea Zones, the Nyayo Wards, the Disabled Fund and so on. On Saturday, we are going to have a big Harambee to raise funds for the bursary of children from poor families. This money is going to help the children from poor homes all over the country. I am saying this just to indicate how His Excellency the President has personally spearheaded a lot of development projects in this country, something that nobody else has ever done before. I know that we as Parliamentarians and the public as a whole, support His Excellency the president and give him a high credit for this. He is a great leaderwho have led this country to greater heights of development.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch a little oh the death ofHon. Dr. Robert Ouko. In the Maasai culture, when somebody dies, we forget him.and that becomes the end of him. The death of Dr. Robert Ouko has given a field day to some bad people in this country the opportunityto spread rumours and create tribal feelings. It has brought to the surfacesome of the people who are never loyal to the Government and the ruling PartyKanu. The utterances and behaviour of these people have been, well taken Into account but this is very unfortunate. I know hon. Ouko was a great man.but.Death has no limits and can go to anybody. This time death has taken Dr. Ouko and. we must take it as it is. we must all go back and work hard to develop thiscountry and forget all the rumours that have been circulating around.Mr. Speaker, Sir, tribalism is a very bad disease. A few days agoI read an article in one of the newspapers in this country where a Lawyerwas talking about a liberal multi-party rstemo As hon. Members know, our eldersin this country sat under trees and deliberated on a lot of things to lead theircommunities. After these deliverations, these elders came out with one reasonableanswer. At that time, there were never two groups of elders opposing each other.Fas that not democracy?. What is all this about multi-party system? I think this is a way of bringing about tribal feelings in this country as has been the case inin the past. This kind of move would bring about tribal hatred, tribaljealousy and tribal wars and this is something we cannot accept. This countryhas been led His Excellency the President who has all the tribes,the youth, workers and everybody else. However, somebody now wants to comeand take us back to tribalism but we are not going to accept this We shallcontinue as one united country under one ruling Party Kanu and we shall continueto achieve greater heights of development in this country.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that we in the Front Bench.must show total loyalty to the Government and to His Excellency the President.Some of us have gone out of their wr to say things that really raise a lotof doubt regarding their loyalty not only to the Government, but to the leadership of this country I think these people must now start correcting theirways because we are all soldiers of Upayo and we have to match as one team and make sure that we renain loyal to the President so that we can serve this country in unity. If we are told ty the g President to turn right, we should turn right. If we are told to turn left, we should turn left if we are told to match forward, we should match, forward. However, we are not going to have people who back-pedal who do not show loyalty to the Party President.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I fully support this Motion and personal thank His Excellency the President for what he has done in niy district. 3ecause of his inspiration, a lot of things have happened in Narok District especially in the field of education. Because of his fatherly advice and his personal visits both private and public, the people of Narok who had been left behind by the colonialists for many years and who were told to go and sleep and have four blankets on top of them, have now woken up and are going to school in large numbers. We believe that we shall also take a reasonable place in the development of this country.The same also applies in the field of agriculture. There is a big revolution now in Narok District because the Maasai people who everybody knew as pastoralists are now farraers and produce a lot of food for themselves. I would, therefore, like to personally thank His Excellency the President and the Government in general for having supported us.On the aspect of water, I would like to say that now there are many projects coming up. Dams are now being constructed and we are very grateful, indeed. I only urge the Government to further help us move forward.I beg to support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): Thank you, Sir, forgiving me this opportunity to participate in this debate. When HisExcellency the president opened this abuse, he led us in proclaiming the principlesupon which our society is based. The House will recall that, once again,His Excellency the President read the sot to of this Housewhich is "For the welfare of society and the just Government of men."This is exactly what the President has done all these time that he has been in this House both as an hon. Member, Vice-President now President  He has, shown us, in every respect, how he lias at heart, the welfare of society and the concept of the just Government of men. He has done so very effectively and we are grateful to him. We had a national tragedy when the Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation passed away. We should, therefore, stand together, as a nation, and support the Government is resolving the 2 mystery that surrounds the death of so important a person. Dr. Ouko was not a small person amongst us. His was a very clear thinker, a free hearted man and a friend of everybody. He stood for and shoved some of the best qualities in the public figures and personages of this nation. The fact that hepassed away is	, of course, natural and all of us mast die one day. Deathbeing the final thing it is, there is no ray we can complain but wecan only say that it is very sad that it has happened. The manner in whichDr. Ouko met his death is the tragedy that has befallen this nation.In this respect, Sir we should all be together in condemningwhoever did this heinous act of causing the demise of hon. Ouko so earlyin his public life. This is because he had just reached a point at whichhis contribution to our social well, being and to the international affairsof this country was climbing towards the peak. But he was, unfortunately, gunned down.The President has led us in condemning the perpetrators of such, a hienous act. We should follow him without hesitation because that is what he stands for. Personally, I stand here to support the President entirely and without any hesitation, whatsover in what he is doing to resolve this mystery. His has done the best that any human being on earth, could do." He even brought in an impartial international organisation to look into the death of Dr. Ouko. Sir, we will support the. President in this task and in every¬thing he is doing. So, any of us either in this House in the Cabinet or in the country who finds that he cannot support the President in this activity and in everything that he does, should step aside and letthe President continue because those of us who support him willcontinue doing so. We will not hesitate to remove from amongst us those who want to put impediments in the path of progress which is led by His Excellency the President. We will have no mercy on such people be they inside or outside this House. This is because what the President is doing for us is so great and in many cases, it isunprecedented that a President should reign for 10 years and still have the force, ability and intelligence to cut across the problems of this nation the way President Moi does.These are things which some of us sometimes tend to overlook, or tendto think that if we had another Government, it would work better. Itmay not. How do you know that it would work better? We must, therefore,stay with what we have, improve on it and help the President to build a better Kenya and not to look, for other, things that they may never, beKenya	Those of us who live near the border are at times fortunateand at other times unfortunate. We are sometimes fortunate in the sense that we can stretch our necks, stand on our heels and toes and lookacross the border and see what is happening there. This is a countrythat as has more wealths potentially than Kenya and yet you find people starving, without clothes and shelter whereas some of us go on complaining, and withholding support from the President. Some of us even go further by trying to influence others to withhold support from the President. We reject those characters. Our neighbouring countries are in a terrific situation of poverty and death itself and yet Kenya, with fewer resourcesthan some of those countries,is doing so well that people come hers and marvel and say "This is England." Some international organisations nowthink of us as a developed country. Who has achieved all these? It is name other than His Excellency sas President Daniel arap Lloi. I give him my support without hesitation the source of power is there and that is why I stay. That is what I do and that is what I follow. We should not have rumours involving civil servants circulating,because those civil servants have been appointed by the President.So if you criticise civil servants on certain matters, you arereally trying to criticise the President in a coward by manner. Ifyou have something to say against your President, then say itopenly; do not go behind his back and start saying he is tryingto involve civil servants in this and that.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the solidarity of thisGovernment is total. Through the efforts of the Vice-Presidentand Minister for Finance we have established in this country theright for anybody to manufacture goods in bonds and export them,which is what many people have been crying for. For a long timepeople have been saying in this House that if this is done, thencertainly kenya will, take off; but Kenya will not take off because . it has already taken off For those who do not know. we are already manufacturing and exporting goods.Where else are we expected to take off to? We already have an independent and self-sufficient economy no country in this country does without imports and exports. We have the example of Japan, which is, perhaps, one of the biggest importers in the world. So, the fact that we still import things does not mean that we have not reached the take off in our developmentThose of our detractors who still say that we are not doing enough must have something else in mind. Some of them say that we will not get enpugh investors here until we allow everybodyto take their money out of this country freely. Those are the peoplewho are sitting here now waiting for the time when the ga Government23± will allow them to do that so that they can "wipe" out all our foreign exchange earnings and leave us with nothing with  which to pay for our imports. We are moving towards that directionhut we want to do it gradually and properly. Since our Presidentis leading in this respect, I fully support him it and also indeveloping our nation.With those few remarks, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Thank you very much, Mr.Deputy. Speaker, Sir for allowing me this chance to contribute to his Excellencythe Presidents Address which he delivered here on 13th March, 1990. I want to start by congratulating the Presidentfor his Address which was, actually, very inspiring and touching.If we all emulate the President and sincerely follow what hesaid in that Address we shall be doing electorate very goodservice. Sir, if I remember well, the President said in his Address that we should not pay lip service to our electorate.Whatever we promise in this House must be fulfilled rather thanjust it here and forget it. I remember that last year I askedthat some very urgent things be done in my constituency, and I.was promised that these things would be worked on.If I maymention a few of them, I gave a list of  dispensariesand health centres the Ministry concerned here knows about them some of which needed renovations and others to be opened.I was promised in this Housed in June, 1989that Shs.164,000/ had been set aside for the renovation of these dispensaries and health centres.However, we are now approaching another financial year, yet when I toured my area on the 16th of last month I noticed that nothing had been done in that regard. I wondered for how long we shall continue to be given promises in this House which are not fulfilled. When these promises appear in newspapers and are read over the radioy wananchi hear them. So, nothing is done, wananchi starts asking their Member of Parliament what happened, to the promises they had read and heard about. I was very much embarrassed when I was asked that question. I am sure other hon. Members in this House have faced the same situation in their areas Therefore, I sincerely request the Ministers to ensure that when they give promises in this S august Housewhich are heard by the public they make a follow up to see that such promises are fulfilled. I am sure the Ministers can use their officers right from the divisions to the Permanent Secretaries to get the correct information for their replies in this House.Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, I now turn to the Ministry of Public works. We have been repeatedly promised here that roads would be repaired. I am surprised that nothing has been done on roads in Mwala Constituency despite the promises I was given that they would be repaired We should stop paying lip service to our electorate, as the President said in his Address.	It is better not to make any promise that will not be fulfilled. The same Ministry had a vehicle in my constituency, which was very much needed, there, but it was removed in 1987 from that area to Makueni. I am sure the Ministers concerned do not know the problems I am talking about. They should visit that place one day to see what we talk about. The Ministers should go there and assess the situation for themselves instead of sending their officers to do that for them.	I also want to once again kindly request the Minister for Information and Broadcasting to air "Today in Parliament" Programmeafter the 6.00 a.m. news. This is because when this programme	is aired at 8 a.m. nobody listens to it because people have gone to work and children have gone to school. If the programme reverts to the time I have mentioned it will be useful to ananchi.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have another request for the Ministry of Technical Training and Applied Technology. We have many very young Standard Sight school leavers and wananchi are quite ready to construct youth polytechnics where these school leayers can go and acquire skills in mansory, carpentry and so on. I would, therefore, urge this Ministry to consider helping wananchi by carrying out a research to determine the exact numher of pupils who would be leaving Standard Eight in a particular year." 		 Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have councillors in ourvarious municipalities. These people earn very little money. They earn Kshs.1,200/-. Sir, Could the Minister concerned think of increasing the allowances and salaries of those councillors? These are the people who deal with the daily problems of the wananchi. The people ask the councillors to help them in various ways and therefore, the Minister concerned should think of increasing the emoluments of our councillors. They do a very good job but they are faced with problems. They do a very good because they prepar a way for us people who are herein Parliament. From Monday to Friday we are here, but when we go"		Back Home we find that	councillors are still dealing with our people.We spead a few days with them and then we come back to Parliamentand we leave those councillors with the people. The councillorsare there permanently dealing with the people.Sir, the other thing that I would like to mention is concerns the Ministry of Education. When vacancies at tour localuniversities are filled during university admission, and some studentswho had passed, well do not get vacancies there, oetrard the Governmentconsider giving educational loans to those unlucky students so that theycan join other good universities abroad. The Ministry shouldinterview these students, and if they find that they are peoplewho can go abroad and study well, then they should give themeducational loans just as those students who get admission lifeour, local universities.The other thing that I would like to raise is whetherwe as Members of Parliament could be given offices and be 		supplied with by manpower by the Government.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Mibex): Thank you,Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to airray the Presidential Address.Sir, I would like to join my colleagues in paying tributeto the late Dr. Ouko who was our effective Minister for ForeignAffairs and International Co-operation. Dr. Ouko was a true advocateof Kenya. As we all know, Dr. Ouko held various press conferences inEurope, America and some other places, which made our country tobe respected. After he held those press conferences theworld understood the position of Kenya. The world understood thatKenya was a democratic society. Sir we welcome the changes that are taking place in other parts of the world and especially, the changes that are taking place in South Africa. We salute Mr. Nelson Mandela who has stood firm for 27 years awaiting freedom. I would take k this opportunity to appeal to the white South Africans to take the example of Kenya where colour does not worry anybody. When you walk along the streets £ of Nairobi, you can. rub shoulders with a white man without even being conscious of his colour. If the whites in South Africa follow the good example of Kenya, then a peaceful South Africa will emerge where all the races will be equal.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are happy and we thank God because he chose the first President of this Republic, and later also chose the present leader of our nation, His ExcellencyDaniel arap Moi. God chooses to bless a country through its leaders.It is because of Gods choice that we are enjoying the peace that some other people are learning for. We are also enjoying peace because we have shown obedience to the leaders whom God has chosen. Due to the peace that we are enjoying, our sons and daughters are busy inventing things. As we are all aware, Kenya discovered the AIDS medicine, Keraron, and also came up with our own Kenyan made car. I am sure that those discoveries could not have cone about if there was no peace in this country.Sir, as all hon. Members are aware, after we passed the Industrial  Property Act, the position now is that the Kenya Industrial Property Office which will be handling patents and" some other things has already been established, and a director has been appointed to man that office under the auspices of the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology. Kemron and ourmotor cars will receive the protection they deserve. Sir, we have heard about detractors, people who gossip, people who want to waste time in trying to defend ourselves against gossips those detractors might not be foreignors. They are some of our sons and daughters who have accepted, to be used by foreigners to disturb our peace and tranquility. It is the responsibility of every leader in this country to try and get hold of those people. They must be hiding somewhere, but I am sure that if we continue being united,"they will perish in the cold.Sir, the concern of His Excellency the President as humbly elucidated through his address was to improve the quality of life of the wananchi. For the last three months, we have been in the field, and I am sure that we have been able to advise and rally wananchi into development. Sir, I had a good opportunity of going round all the provinces of our Republic including North Eastern Province. I was very much impressed by the efforts of our people in various fields of development.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are making use of the DistrictFocus for Rural Development Strategy and I am sure that hon.Members will try their best to attend D.D.C. meetings so that anydevelopment proposal comes from the grassroot level. I also wish topay great tribute to the workers and their employers in this country.They have worked peacefully and they have brought oura industrialpeace to this country. I would to mention particularly the teaworkers in Eericho and in Sotik and waw elsewhere who go outinto the fields when it is still dewy or even when it is raining topluck tea leaves. Everybody in this country knows that tea earns this country a lot of foreign exchange.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, His Excellency, in his Speech,indicated that there will be Bills which will come before this Housefor debate and they are aimed at improving the welfare of theworkers and also pensioners. Therefore it is very important forthe workers to rally behind the Government so that these things canbe made a reality.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to mention somethingabout professionals in this country. I would like to appeal to themto be true to their, professions. I have ind mind the teachers whomI believe should stick to teaching and leave politics alone.If theydid that the standard of education in this country would improve.It is therefore important for the Ministry of Education to deal withany erratic teacher who indulges in politicking instead of teaching.Those who engage in politics instead of teaching should be disciplined.We also have the lawyers and I do not need to say much about thembecause you have all heard of the wrangles which they are having. They cannot evenvote properly like we do in Kanu where the election results are out within one day or during the day of voting.They a themselves have to wait for three months before they can get their own election results. So, it appears that the Kanu system of voting by "inlolongo" is the surest way of democracy. You do not have to find out how elections went on you get that result on the same day. What other type of democracy do you want?Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have been told that it is the intention of the Government to allow elders to participate in determining land disputes. I wish to appeal to those concerned that they should ensure that these elders should be real elders. They should be mature people say this because some of the elders are young people ia who do not even know what an oath is.With those few remarks, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR. BOY: Ahsante sana BW. Naibu Spika, kwa kunipatia nafasi hii ili nami niungane na Wabunge wenzangu katika kuzungumza juu ya. Ho tuba ya mpendwa Mtukufu Rais. Ho tuba ya Mtukufu Rais in a mawaidha mengi, kwetu sisi ss. kama Wabunge na vile vile kwa nchi nzima kwa jumla.; Katika Hotuba yake, Mtukufu Rais a±±sna aliyatamka maneno yafuatayo:SSa "Tnatubidi sote tuungane pamoja kadumisha amani na umoja ili nchi a yetu izidi kuendelea mbele. Haitupasi kueneza uvumi SH± usio na maana, bali ni wajibu wetu kutumia ujuzi wetu na uwezo wetu wote kuimarisha maendeleo yetu."Bw. Naibu Spika, hapa Mtukufu Rais an as e ma kwamba sisikama Wabunge haitupasi kuwa katika msitari wa mbele katika kuenezauvumi na mambo mengine ambay.o hayastahili. Hakiendelea katika Hotubayake, Mtukufu Rais anasema hivi:"Kenya ya leo haina nafasi ya ugomvi na porojo. Siasa za dhuliima hazimsaidii mtu yeyote."Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ukweli ni kwamba siasa za dhuluina hazimsaidii mtu yeyote, kwani ni siasa za kufanya mambo am mabaya. Kiklwa kizuri, nl ciia wananchi; V IWM leiIriharibika ni cha Rais Moi. Kikiwa kizuri, ni cha wananchi lakini mambo yakiharibika wanamlaumu Rais Moi.: Haya ni makosa. Kwa hivyo, sisi kama viongozi yafaa tuwe katika msitari wa mbele kwa sababu tunamweelewa Mtukufu Rais. Yeye  huwa Mwenyekiti wa Kanu Parliamentary Group. Yeye huwa nasi kila mahali. Yatupasi kama viongozi kuufafanua msimamo wa Serikali katika kila jambo.;Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, utaona kwamba wakati jambo lisilo la kawaida ±±aas±Hk2 limetokea Waziri mzima anasema "Haya ni mambo ya Serikali." Je, Waziri Vama. huyo huwa anaongea juu ya Serikali gani? Anawezaje kusema hivyo na hali yeye yumo ndani ya hiyo Serikali? Yafaa utueleze badala ya kusema kwamba "haya ni mambo ya Serikali." Haya ni makosa. Hivi majuzi nchi hii ilikuwa inaomboleza kifo cha marehemu Dkt. 2mc 2hb± Robert Ouko. Lakini utaona kwamba badala ya viongozi wanaofahamu mambo kuwaeleza jtaaasakE wananchi msimamo wa. Serikali walikuwa katika msitari wa mbele katika kutoa porojo.  Haifai kiongozi kueneza. uvumi	usiokuwa na msixigi; "Mi.mi nasikia kwambahuko Kisuinu mambo ni mabaya" Mambo gani? Umesikia kutoka kwa nanj  Mtukufu Rais. amesema mara nyingi kwamba Serikali haitaficha jambo lolote kuhusiana na mkasa huo. Kama wewe uaajua lolote kuhusu mis mkasa huo yafaa uzitoe habari hizo kwa Serikali. Haifai viongozi kuharibu wakati wakiwalaumu watu wengine. Haifai kusema kwamba unataka tuelezwe ni kitu gani kilichosababisha vifo vya marahemu Mboya na J.M. "SarV. Kariuki. Haya ni mambo ambayo hayana msingi. Nasema hivi kwa sababu .uchunguzi kuhusu kifo cha Dkt. Ouko unaendelea kufanywa na kwa hivyo yafaa tuyasubiri matokeo ya uchunguzi huo.  Lakini utaona kwamba hata kabla uchunguzi huo haujamali zika, twaanza kutoa porojo za kila aina kukiwa na nia ya kuonyesha kwamba matokeo ya uchunguzi huo hayatakowa ya halali au ya haki.Bw. Naibu Spika vva Muda, ninayasema maneno haya kwa sababu fanr leo kuna watu ambao nia yao iii kuonyesha kwa wananchi kwamba Serikali haitafanya uchunguzi wa haki kuhusiana na kttrT ykifo cha Dkt. Robert Ouko.". Kuna watu ambao wanataka" kuihusisha Serikali na kifo cha Dkt .Robert Ouko. Kitu tunachopaswakufanya ni kusubiri hadi matokeo ya uchunguzi huo yatakapotolewa." Baada ya uchunguzi huo, Serikali itatoa maelezo yake."	Haifa! viongozi kukusanyika katika aiakundi na kuanza kuulizana, "Je, wayajua mambo haya"? Nawe Waziri mzima unaanza kuuliza, "Haya ni mambo gani? Sasa hakuna usalama nchini" Ukisema hivyo naye raia wa kawaida atasema nini? Inavyofaa ni Waziri, wakati kuna jambo kama hili, awaambie wananchi "Tunayangoja matokeo ya uchunguzi. Serikali itafanya</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR CO-OPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Cheruiyot): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The hon. Member, is making very wild statements, to the extent of demonstrating how Cabinet Ministers are saying this and the other. That is unusual and I think the hon. Member should substantiate those, allegations if they are true. If there is any Cabinet Minister who has done what the hon. Member is saying, we should be told.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. BOY: Bw. Naibu Spika, nayaondoa maneno hayo ya Waziri mzima",lakini ni lazima. sisi viongozi, wakati .kunapotokea.tatizo kama hili, tuwezekuwaeleza.wananchi mambo wazi wazi kama yalivyo. Haifai kwetu kuenezauvumi. Mtukufu Rais, katika Hotuba yake alisema kwamba siasa za.dhulumahazimfaidi mtu yeyote.kwani si siasa za maendeleo.	Bw.Naibu Spika, kama Jambo fulani bado linachunguzwa na h aljifilciauamuzi, hakuna haja kwa mtu yeyote kumlaumu mfanyakazi wa Serikali. Kablahatujawalaiimu wafanyakazi wa Serikali, ni lazima lakza tusimame tujueukweli ukowapi. Nasema hivi kwa sababu kila kuingiapo tatizo, kunatafutwa mtu wa kulaumiwa. Ukweli, kama Mtukufu Rais asemavyo raara kwa mara, ndio utakaokuwa nguzo. Hili ni jambo la muhimu sana.Mengi yamesemwa juu ya swala la Chama kimoja cha kisiasa. Lakini ni lazima ieleweke kwamba msisimko ulioko katika nchi za Ulaya si sawa na ulioko huku kwetu. Wao watu wa Ulaya wali lazimishwa kuufuata mfumo huo. Sisi ni tofauti kwa sababu wazo hili letu la kuwa na Chama kimoja cha kisiasa ni wazo ambalo lilizal-ishwa hapa na waheshimiwa Wabunge wa Bunge hili. Tofauti ndiyo hiyo. Ni jambo la muhimu watu waweze kutofautisha mawazo hayomawili.Kwa vile katika nchi ya Romania watu wameanza kupigania kuwe na  Jyama vingi vya kisiasa, wale ambao wangependa kuona matatizo humu nchini  Kenya wameanza kusema kwamba iuajadxe ile hali ya zamani ya kuwa na Jyama vingi vya kisiasa. Watu hawa hawaelewi kwamba wazo hili letu la kuwa na  Chama kimoja tu cha kisiasa halikulazimishwa kwetu. Sisi sote tulikubaliana I, C kwamba tungependa kuwe na Chama kimoja tu cha kisiasa.Kuna watu ambao kazi yao ni kutafutatafuta vijisababu vya mambo yote. Kwa hayo machacha, naunga mkono. Mr. Deputy Speaker left the Chair?The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kagwima) took the ChairMR. MWAMZANDI: Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Mudakwa kunipa nafasi hii. Mimi pia.ningependa kuungana na wenzangu katika kuizungumzia Hotuba ya Mtukufu Rais. Hotuba hiyo ilikuwa nzuri, inatupa moyo sisi waheshimiwa Wabunge, na tukiichukulia kwa makini, huenda tukawa watu wazuri.Bw. Spika, ni lazima kwanza kujiulize tumechaguliwa kuja hapa kufanya nini. Tuliomba kura ili tuweze kuwasaidia wenzetu katika maendeleo na amani katika nchi hii. Kisha, tuliapa hapa kwamba tutailinda na kuiheshimu Katiba - na tukamwomba Mwenyezi Mungu atusaidie. Vile vile, tulisema kwamba tutara— saidia Mtukufu Rais kwa hekima, na hekima ni ule ujuzi wa mwisho uwezekanao.-Basi, ni juu yetu kuona kwamba tumeiweka amani katika nchi hii. Nakubalikwamba wanaoweza kuiweka nchi hii vizuri rjn sisi, na wanaoweza kuiharibuni sisi vile vile. Maneno yetu ndiyo yanayoweza kuharibu au kuweka amani. Kwa hivyo, ni juu yetu sisi viongozi kuichunga midomo yetu na kujua tunasema (iv, mbele ya rais. Tunafaa kuwa watu wa kukosoana kukitokea makosa; tusiwe watu wa kusengenyana. Haya ndiyo mambo ya muhimu tunayotakiwa kuyafanya.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, tumempoteza mwenzetu Mhe. Dkfe. Ouko.Ubaya umetokea kwa hivyo tumwombe Mwenyezi Mungu kwani hili si jambo lakupendeza, hasa katika kipindi hiki cha Enzi ya Nyayo. Kumekuwa na vifovingine vingi vya waheshimiwa Wabunge kama vile Bw. Pinto, Bw. Mboya naBw. J.M. Kariuki. Hakuna uchunguzi wowote uliofanywa kuhusiana na vifohivi vyote vingine, lakini baada ya hiki cha Mhe. Dkis. Ouko a, Mtukufu Rais aliwaitisha wapelelezi kutoka Scotland Yard kukichunguza. wapelelezi jambao wanaaminika katika dunia nzima kwa ujuzi wao katika upelelezi wa mambo kama haya. Tungependa Mtukufu Rais alifanye jambo lingine lipi? Mtukufu Rais anajua kwamba uchunguzi huu utaigharimu Serikali kiasi kikubwa cha pesa, lakini angependa kujua ni nani aliyekisababisha kifo cha Mhe. Dkt. Ouko. Kiongozi wetu amejitokeza kuonyesha hivyo. Kama kungekuwa na ubaya, kiongozi wetu angewaleta watu kama hao? Sasa. kila mraoja aliye na jambo lolote linaloweza kuwasaidia wapelelezi hao anakaribishwa ktwenda kutoa habari kwa wapelelezi hao.  Hakuna uchunguzi wowote uliofanywa kuhusiana na vifo hivyo vilivyotokea hapo rabeleni. rapaka tukaitisha kamati teule ya Bunge kukichunguza kifo cha Bw. J.M. Kariuki. ii ameharakisha k mambo	kwa kuwaleta wachunguzi kutokaScotland Yard ili wayachunguze mambo. Je, ni kitu gani zaiddya hiki tnotioTq afanye s ili tujue kuwa alikuwa ana imani na karehemu Dr. Ouko?		Bw. Naibu Spika wa" Muda, mimimmo jawapo wa wale Wabungeambao wamewahi kuwa na Mtukufu Rais katika Bunge hili tangu 1963.Hii ina maana kuwa ninamjua sana na ninavyojua ni kuwa mambo kamahaya ya dhuluma hanayo. Hii ndiyo sababu anataka ukweli ujulikane.Hakuna haja ya kulichanganya jambo hili na mambo mengine kama vilevifo vya akina Pinto,;.Tom Mboya na J.M. Kariuki. Je, watuwanaoyauliza mambo haya. walikuwa wapi enzi hizo? Mbona hawakuyauliza mambo hayo wakati huo? Kwa nini wanayaingiza mambo hayasasa? Hayo ni mambo- ambayo yamepita na inafaa hili jambo la sasa	uache mpaka uchunguzi ukamilike. Wewe nayenyewe, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda. unakumbuka vizuri. kuwa Mtukufu Rais alisema kuwa haja yake ni usalama katika nchi hii na wala si kuuharibu usalama wa nchi hii. Kwa hivyo nina hakika kuwa uchunguzi utakapokamflika Mtukufu Rais atachukua hatua ifaayo. Hana haja yoyote ya kulificha jambo lolote kwa sababu angekuwa ana nia ya; kuiificha ukweli basi yeye angeagiza jambo hili lichunguzwe na watu wa hapa hapa. Lakini kwa kuwa yeye hana la kuficha basi amewaleta wataalum kutoka. huko ngambo. Kwa hivyo inafaa tuzidi kumwombea Mwenyezi Mungu aendelee vizuri.Jambo la muhimu lc£a sisi viongozi wa kisiasa kufahamu ni kuwa tuna maadui wengi ambao lab da ttxliwashinda wakati wa uchaguzi. Hawa hawa tuliowashinda pia KSSB wana marafiki ambao pia ni maadui wetu. Kwa hivyo tuna maadui chungu katikataifa hili. Kwa hivyo inafaa tujue kuwa mm uchunguzi huu utahusu mambo mengi. Wakati huo huo kuna jambo moja ambalo ninataka nguze sana. Kabla Bunge hili halijafunguliway kuna Mawazirx waliokuwawakisema kuwa kuna njaffia za kuwaua pamoja na watu wengine. Watukama hawa inafaa waulizwe ltama	kama hayowaliyatoa wapi£ Hii ni kwa sababu kuna Mawaziri waliokuwa xiC wakisema kuwa kulikuwa na njama za kutaka kuwaua pamoja na watu wengine.	yanatakxwa yayaeleze mambo haya kwa sababualipokosekane yndlpo alipopatikana Dr. Ouko Kwa hivyo hawa. watu lazima wachunguzwe na waeleze walikoyatoa mambo hayo.Kwa nini wao walisema maneno kama hayo na walikuwa wangapi? Je, maneno hayo waliyasikia wapi? Kwa hivyo haya mambo yanahitaji kuchunguzwa. Je, uvumi huu ulimhusu yyo peke yake au uliwahusu watu wengine pxa? Mambo kama haya ndiyo yanayohitaji uchunguzi.Bw. Naibu Spxka wa Muda, Mhe. Boy aliposema mambo yana wahusu Mawazirx.mmoja wao alisimama kwa jambo la nidhamu akimtaka	adhibitishe mambo hayofLKwa nini mhe. Boy aliwataja Mawaziri? Bw. Naibu Spxka wa Muda. ninataka kukuuliza swali moja tu: Mambo ya uvumi yalxpoanza kando ya" Mtukufu Rais XK na Makamu wa Rais na k Wazirx Wa Fedha, ni Waziri gani. alxyesimama buqflnttiumu jambo hxlo? Wote bado hawajasema kxtu.Kwa nini hawamsaxdii Mtukufu Rais kulxshutumu jambo hxlx? Je, huyu Wazirx alxyesxmama kwa jambo la nidhamu amesema kitu chochote juu ya jambo hili?Kwa hayo machache, naunga mkono.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION (Mr. Ayah): to. Temporary Deputy Speaker, "Sir, I feel happy to join my hon. colleagues in congratulating His Excellency the President for his Presidential Address which,as usual was full of information and adiice to this House and the nation as to how we should run our country in peace, love and unity. Before I comment on that Address, let me join my colleagues in a sincere tribute to my late honourable friend Dr. Ouko whojas many of us knowcame from the same district that I come from. He was also a man with whom had worked both in Party matters and in the Government. I am proud to say that he was a personal friend. I would like to join hon. Members who have askedas indeed the President did askthat we in this country who knew hon. Dr. Ouko can do not less than re-dedication ourselves to the ideals which he stood for which were simple but sincere. One of them is that he thought to unite the people of Kisumu. He thought to ask all of us to follow His Excellency the Presidents advice that we should unite, forget about tribalism division and he so eloquently put it: he did not like siasa ya kumalizana. So I would like to pay tribute to a great man who has passed away.		doing that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me repeat something that I have already said. His Excellency the President himself has contributed a great deal to the peace andstability in District Kisumu Nyanza generally and the wholeof Kenya since we lost hon. Dr. Oxxko. This is because his death	wapotentially divisive thing which some people were trying toinstigate. But the conduct of the President as usual has broughtpeace and dignity to a great loss. I would thus like to repeatthat we owe a great deal on this occasion as we have done on otheroccasions to the President for what he has done both to the familyand the people who were immediately concerned. I pay great tributeto His Excellency the President.In his Address, the President asked us and I am sure thathon. Members will agree that this is the most important 		thing to do to maintain peace. I would like to say that there has not been in my experience, a greater man for exortation for peace both nationally, regionally and internationally than thePresident who has gone one ectra stop on every s occasion to ensure that	we not only advocate for peace as Kenyans but also encourage others tomaintain peace in our region and in the whole world. This is because without peace it is not possible to think of development. In fact without it it is impossible to build schools for our children or for that matter to plan for anything be it agriculture or otherwise. I would like to say that we have to copy and follow His Excellencys exortation that we should maintain peace amoving ourselves. I am saying so becauseoccasionallyand in every society, there are people who have doubts to begin with, about themselves, their ability to co-operate with others and about their societys ability to maintain peace. These are people who have no confidence in themselves and in their own society. Kenya is not different in this respect because there are others among us who feel that they will not feel happy until there are doubts about what we are doing. 	I would like to tell such people I know they are very fewindeed that we feel confident of our ability to run our own affairs. We have in this nation a great leader and a great country, and I see no reason why anybody anywhere at any time should have any doubts at all as to our ability to run our own affairs our ability to determine our own institutions, how to run them, and how to keep peace in the country.I say this, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, ana you will forgive me if I baring a specific case. Recently, I was amazed to read in the newspapers that among our lawyers,for instance there are people who want to divide themselves into what they call people who are soft" towards Government and people who are tough" towards the Government. That kind of division to me is not only academic, but in some cases it is malicious, beeeswe how do you, as a member of a society with its own Government and institutions, divide yourselves into people who, on the one hand, are "soft" towards the Government, and on the other hand, people who think they are "tough" towards the Government. Who is the Government, if it is not all of us in this country?I would like to ask my friends who are lawyers, Members of the Law Society of Kenya, that we look upon them to give a good example to the young people of this country, to the people who have not had the opportunity to go to the extent of learning that they have gone through and so on. We expect them to give an example of how to build and respect our institutions, how to build and respect institutions of Government and institutions of society, generally. I do not think it helps anybody if people are going to polarise themselves because, in most cases, the polarisation is not based on anything more fundamental than just people looking for leadership I am sure that, it is possible for somebody to look for leadership without having to polarise the society. I would like to request the Members of the Law Society of Kenya, like I would like to reques any other society in Kenya, to ensure that whatever divisions we have or whatever different opinions we may have between ourselves and our society it does not degenerate to the level of mere person¬alities to the level of dividing ourselves into "pro" and "anti" Government groups. I think, in my opinion, that in the long run you will find that these divisions are not based on anything more substantial than just people :-looking for personality differences.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, I have said that the maintenace of peace is our primary responsibility. I have also said and I want to repeat ity that it is not necessary trnfet all of us iqfeet be leaders in politics. It is possible and, in fact, it is desirable that each one of us should maintain his or her position in. whatever he£is doing in such manner that he or she shines in what have found that what bring a lot of, differences in our society is when people think that they cannot be leaders until they are political leaders. This is not necessary, in my opnion. But I say so be it that. I am in politics. But I say that it is possible to be a good church-leader and be a leader of society. It is also possible to be a good teacher and be a leader of society and so on. So I danot see why it is necessary, that everybody 		should want to be a leader only the impolitic al field.</Newspeech> 	|<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): Too long </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL .CO-OPERATION (Mr. Ayah): I see that my hon. friend the Minister for Labour is feeling a little jealous, but he and I know I am told that by a general resolution, I should be allowed to speak for the next 15 minutes, but I do not want to monopolise the speech. However, I want to make two other points.In Kisumu District, the most important industry is in thefarming of sugarcane. Now, we are having problems which are withinthe capability of the Government to resolve,and I am sure they aregoing to be resolved But I would like to say that if anybody isgiven the responsibility to encourage the farmers to grow eithercotton or sugarcane, they should do so diligently. I know, forinstance, that the Government has decidedand it is going to be dneand it is being done, that cotton farmers should be paid directlyand as soon as they deliver cotton to their sales points. Butvery often we now find in Kisumu District, and other cotton growingareasy that farmers are discouraged because of very, very careless sattitude that some of our public officers have towards the farmer. I have a feeling that until wa take farming seriously, especially those that have anything to do with extension services, we will not be able to have a take off in industrial development and we willalso not be able to take-off in our economic development. Farmingis a fundamental activity in this country in s°me areas wefind that farmers still practise what they practised 20, 30, or 40years ago. We have increased the number of extension officers and so on, but very often we still have people in this field who still think of farming in academic terms. They are not able to go and advise the farmers on what they should do. I would like to encourage them, particularly invars as of cotton, growing, in areas of primary products like millet which have been traditiona in some areas. Farmers should be encouraged to plant more of these traditional crops because, basically, these are the ones, that can stop us from having famine, people are beginning to want to consume lie a, which is not a traditional food, with all due resnect to those who consider rice to be an important food.Ithink we should grow move of our traditional crops so that people can develop in agriculture and also have secondary industries arising out of agriculture.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, I have said more than I wanted to say, and I want to conclude by saying that I feel parti¬cularly grateful that His Excellency the President has chosen, in his wisdom, to make me the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I International Co-operation. I want to assure him, as I am assuring my colleagues here, that I will do my best to the image of this country in every respect that I am capable of I know that I am taking on a very difficult job because my predecessor was such an exemplary person, but I have commitment to myself that whatever I have to do, I will do because I have a leader that wants me to do it.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. Nyagah): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, for giving me an opportunity to contribute to this debate Kenya is Independent and nobody doubts that. We occupy very and prestigious position in this continent. Ghana, came first Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda followed and then we also attained our. But comparing the list I have just mentioned, we stand miles out intothe sky. We were not given our Uhuru on a platter, but people had to fight for it. However, they did not fight for this Uhuru everthinking that it will get to a position where we can ruin it.We also have a Eiswahili saying "Mvunda nchi ni wananchi". I amsure that nobody no Mzungu will come from outside "kuvunda nchi hii but ourselves. This is the message nis Excellency thePresident.when addressingthe Sixth Parliament Sassier brought to this House. He placed it squarely on the shouldsof this august House the need to work hard, to uphold the truth, and to the mindful of other peoples welfare. He very carefully reminded us of the Motto written very prominently for every one sitting in this Chamber, wherever he is, except a few people at the back, but even them, as they go out, they see that we are working herenot for our own selfish ends, but For the Welfare of Society and the Just Government of Men". Democracy, after, all, is the rule of the people, by the people and for the people. Millions of Kenyans look upon us to try to lead them and they expect us to lead them with actions, and not empty words. Recently, a lot of gossip and rumour¬mongering has been going on,, but these rumours have not been helpful. If the Government had kept quiet from the very first day of the disappearance of our beloved friend, the late Dr. Ouko, and done nothing, perhaps people would have had reason to talk the way they have been doing. However, from the first day, the Government started looking for our disappeared friend, and when his body was discovered, the highest authority of investigation was mounted and fortified by one of the best known investigators in the world, the Scotland Yard. Our President, in search of the truth that he told hon. Members of Parliament to uphold, that he decided to mount this investigation so that the truth may be known.I know that we are in a hurry, but we are not in hurry to destroy; we are in a hurry to construct, by giving water, schools, hospitals and peace to our people. We are not- in a hurry to undermine one another or the system upon which Kenya has stood leading for the last 26 years We should consolidated our unity, as the President said in his Address, and avoid idle gossip focussing all our development efforts through the Harambee spirit and other peaceful means to uniting our people.Having said that let me now turn to what I have discovered during the time I have had the opportunity of going outside the country. Kenya is respected. The country has been placed here by God purposely. What a wonderful opportunity we have been given The other day, I had the honour of visiting a country that calls itself independent and I noticed that its people are not as independent as we are. Look at our factories, educational system and farming and you will see that we occupy a very special position in the developing world.Why should we spoil this opportunity? We have a leader who mingled with colonialistsin this House. From within, he fought for the day when the African could govern himself, and he saw it. So, when he advises us today, we should listen to him. When he tells us to work for the welfare of society and the just government of men, we should listen to him. Very few countries have a leader of the calibre of our President Daniel arap Moi.I know this because I am working under him as one of his Ministers and I have worked with him as one of his colleagues in this House. I had the greatest honour in working under him as an Assistant Minister. What a man with foresight! He had this foresight even in those early days, and since his turn came to hold the steering wheel of this country, he has continued to steer the country very well. In the last 11 years, Kenya has made wonderful strides.(Applause).It was only today that I heard an American radio say that Americans have discovered something that can take care of the scourge of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), but they are only following our footsteps whichv.we set at Muguga. Kenya has already taken the lead in this regardWe have a car that has been manufactured by our own indigenous people, and the President has already set aside an areawhere a big factory will be built so that wananchi can put this discovery into reality. We also hear of other discoveries that are very exciting in the field of animal diseases. What more do we want? The surest of way of curbing the speed of development in this country is to engage in idle talk and gossip, personality clashes, envy, and so on. It is for this reason that I would like to quote the Presidents last words of his Address as an appeal. The President told the House and the nation, "Let us all during this Third Session of the Sixth Parliament rededicate ourselves in serving this country through hard work, constructive ideas and genuine love for our motherland."Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MAKAU: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this time to contribute to the Presidential Address. Firstly, I would like to preface my contribution with glowing tribute to the late hon. Dr. Ouko, a man who stood for true Nyayoism. He was very dedicated, sincere andfull of patriotism. When he held press conferences in Oslo and the United States of America, he defended this country and explained very clearly what it stood for I join my colleagues who paid glowing tribute to the late hon. Dr. Robert Ouko and urge everyone to adhere to the peace that we believe in. Let us forget everything to do with, rumours because the late hon. Dr. Robert Ouko would not have liked to have any confusion in this .country.Having said that I would now like to comment on the Presidential Address. Firstly, we have His Excellency the President, a man of vision. Within the time he has been Head of State, this country has moved forward very fast Of late, we have witnessed technological advance in the form of the discovery of KEMRON and another drug for the treatment of hypertension. Recently, His Excellency the President unveiled three Kenyan—made cars. These are very important achievements for a developing country. His Excellency the President stresses that we should be a nation for all tribes. When you look at the other countries that are coming up with computer technology and industrial revolution, you will see that they made discoveries because they first had to become united nations. The discoveries we have made here show that Kenya has become a nation, under the leadership of Hi8s Excellency the President. What we now need, to do is to support him in all he shows us by action or tells us. These discoveries are going to place this country in a very advaned stage of development. When commercialisation of KEMRON and the three Kenyan-made vehicles is done, Kenya is going to be one of the most developed countries in the world, and a lot of employment is going to be created for Kenyans.What every leader should do is to look into the big problem that the country is facing in terms of unemloyment. This problem will be solved by the discoveries that have been made. When we commercialise production of KEMRON, a lot of jobs will be created both in the pharmaceutical industry and elsewhere. A lot of jobs will also be created by the commercialisation of the production of our three vehicles. We will also earn a lot of foreign exchange. What we should do is to appeal to everybody to be dedicated, sincere and patriotic.If, at any given time there is any personal conflict, let the national interest prevail. National interest shbuld be paramount. We should be prepared to defend bur country by being patriotic whateve happens. The most, important thing is to think about the generations that, will come after us. Whatever we do today as leaders reflects a lot on what will happen to our children. Whatever happens, we should heed the advice given to us by His Excellency the President, that we should avoid idle gdssip and have creative ideas that will bring development. We should not concentrate our energy in personality clashes. We should, rather, concentrate our efforts in the creation of ideas that will help to develop this country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I have said, the biggest problem that we face and that can only be solved by commitment to duty and patriotism is the one of unemployment in this, country. We have students who have just sat for their examinations and it is upon us to create employment opportunities for them. All of us must be concerned about encouraging foreign investment in this country so as to create employment for ouryouth. Those Kenyans who can afford to invest should do so in order for us to have entrepreneurship in this country that can create employment opportunities. Many countries.have created employment through small scale industries.Sir, as I said at the beginning the late Dr. Robert Oukos way of life should be emulated by everybody in this country. We should all be guided by the fact that patriotism is the most important virtue for any country to develop. So, for usto create a cohesive society, we must be patriotic and loyal to the President.With those few remarks, I beg to support the Motion before the House.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Chesire): Thank" you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, sir,for giving me this opportunityto contribute to the Motion on the Presidential address to this House. First of all, I would like to join my colleagues who have paid tribute to the late Dr. Robert Ouko, that great son of Kenya who left us prematurely during the time we were on Recess. To those of us who knew the late Minister, we knew him as a very sincere, honest and articulafe person. Not only that but his last two Press conferences in both Washington and Oslo will go down as memories of Kenyans for many years to come. In those two Press conferences, the late Dr. Ouko did a lot to improve the image of this country and to place Kenya in its proper perspective. It is only a pity and a shame that his life was cut short so soon after having done such an excellent job for this country. We knew him for his love for his country, his love for His Excellency the President and his love for Kenyans in general. He cherished this country and we shall greatly and dearly miss that honest, sincere and arti¬culate Kenyan. Our condolences go to his family.At this juncture, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, I would like to suggest that portraits of great leaders such as the late Dr. Ouko and others who went before him should be hung somewhere prominently within the precincts of Parliament Buildings. I know somewhere, within the gallery where ve.still have some works of art that was done some many years ago by some colonial women"the East African Women League showing the Kenya of the past. Why do we not change that gallery and dedicate it to heroes of Kenya such as the late Dr. Robert Ouko, the late Tom Mboya and others so that we can also know that our sons who forught for justice and the integrity of Kenya can also be seen by our future generations within Parliament Buildings?Mr.. Temporary Deputy Speaker,Sir, this country owes a great deal to His Excellency the President. For the last 35 years that His Excellency has been in this House, he has dedicated the very best part of his life to the welfare and development of this country. We know His Excellency the President as one person who hardly rests; he has no time for his own personal or private affairs. All his life has been dedicated to the service of Kenyans. His Excellency the President wakes up very early every morning. He is the earliest riser in this country. He rises earlier than most of us and leaves his office as late as seven oclock every day, all working for Kenyans. The President has put Kenya first and has fully sacrificed his life for the service of Kenyans. Therefore, the only thing we can give to His Excellency the President for all that he is doing for us is total loyalty. We should live in unity and peace as borthers and sisters.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, the sad part of our life is that instead of some Kenyans appreciating the role that His Excellency the President has played to make Kenya a good place to live in, they spend most.of their time despising all the good achievements that have been attained. Those people spend their time talking ill of the good that has been done. The unfortunate thing is that the very people who are undermining His Excellency the President and the Govern¬ment are the same people with the best houses in Nairobi. They are the people with the fattest bank accounts and they are the people occupying the most posh offices in the city. It is not the common Kenyan who is undermining the Government but the people who should.be grateful that they are enjoying the best Of the fruits of this land, thanks to the protection given to them by His Excellency the Presi¬dent. These, are the people who should be making sacrifices and contributions towards the advancement of the development of this nation. Instead, they go to bars, clubs and all sorts of meat roasting places and dedicate all their\ *time in idle gossip talking ill of the Government. We have an extremely tolerant President and those people should be thankful to him; they should be most grate¬ful that they have the millions of shillings they have and that they have the posh cars that they drive. Those people whould be the ones to come forward and contribute to Harambees. They should be the ones to take the front lead on Saturday when His Excellency the President conducts the Harambee for the children who are unable to pay their way through school. In so doing, we shall know that they appreciate the good that is being done for them in this country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like to touch on the question of collective responsibility in this Houseo Those of us in the Front-Bench should always bear in mind that we have a collective responsibility to protect the image of the Government and the country as a whole* It is a shame for anybody to talk ill of a Government that he serves. This happened yesterday when a Cabinet Minister, namely the Minister for Information and Broadcasting said that there is corruption in the whole Government system. When a Government  Mj raster stands up to make such a statement, one wonders where we are heading to. How can a Minister condemn the whole qystem in a Government under which he himself works? We do know that we have isolated cases of bad elements within the Govern¬ment and these are the people we would like to identify and uproot. However, the moment somebody in Government stands up to condemn the entire Government then definitely he is wrong. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have letters of appointment clearly statet that if any Minister  or Assistant Minister disagrees with any Government policy oar is the manner in which Government conducts its affairs, the most honourable thing is to tender his resignation,, rather than undermine the Government from within. We have been vested with the responsibility of protecting the image of the Government and we cannot at the same time cane here to condemn the Government. If your conscience tells you that you are in the wrong place, then the most honourable things to do is to quit and go where your conscience is clear and free. However, to just stick in a place where your conscience is not free just because you want to enjoy extra benefit is not honourable at all. It would be best to be honourable and quit under those circumstances.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch on certain problem which we are experiencing at the moment as farmers and this is regarding the shortage of fuel. For the last few weeks, we have been having a problem in the farming areas due to this shortage of fuel. This is a time when we should be planting maize, but the oil companies in this country, have chosen this moment to deny us fuel. When I go back to the past records, I have found that oil  companies have been capitalising on this critical moment when we want to plant or harvest wheat, This is the time they start hoarding fuel and  demanding price increases and because Government has no option, itagrees to increase the price. I would like to appeal to these oil companies to be more patriotic and esure that during the critical period of planting and harvesting, they supply us with enough petrol and diesel for our agricultural activities, we do not want them to continue frustrating the farmers who are very keen in feeding the nation by making sure they produce plenty of food So, the oil companies should also be patriotic "by making sure that they supply the farmers will enough fuel during planting and harvesting periods. with those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech> THE MTNISTER FOR INDUSTRY (Mr. Otieno): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to express my support on the Presidential Address from the Chair. I only have one point to make regarding this Address. I would first of all like to quote what the President  said when we attended a breakfast meeting in America,  the last journey that hon. Dr. Robert Ouko made with with him In  referring to the events in the world today,His Excellency the  President said, "God works his things mysteriously".Sir, in the world today, we are seeing communism and apartheid coming down so faster than none of us could have predicted. I see there is a very strong message for Kenyans contained in the Presidential Address which was delivered on 13th March, 1990. There is also a very strong message from God to Kenyans. I say so because we all know that it is only God who sanctions the taking away of somebody's life. If somebody succeeded in killing Dr. Ouko in this country, definitely, there is a message that God is passing to us and which we should hear.I have been thinking and found out that the message to Kenyans is "Please Kenyans, hear your President." (applause)I say so because the President has been very consistent in his lovefor all Kenyans and that is why God is asking us "Kenyans do you hearyour President? Do you all love one another?"' He is telling us-	_  that by bringing among us a person who hates some Kenyans and who could dare kill Dr. Ouko. The President has been very consistent in his desire for peace among Kenyans, in Africa and throughout" the world and that is why God is asking us "Kenyans do you hear your President?" There is somebody who, after killing Dr. Ouko, wanted to divide Kenya.The President has been very consistent in his desire for unity in this country and in Africa. In the killing of Dr. Ouko, God is asking us "Kenyans do you hear your President?" This is because after the death of Br. Ouko, there were people who wanted to divide the country. God is asking Kenyans "Do you hear your President? Are you serious?"Most of us in this House have admitted that we have a God¬fearing President and a God-sent leader who is determined to develop us in unity, peace and love. The President has been very consistent inhis tolerance right from the time he was the Vice-President of this nation. He Las been very consistent in his  magnanimity and in preaching against hatred. In fact, I remember when we were sending in delegations at the time when he was about to be elected President, he told us "TJkipanda chuki, utavuna chuki. That is the time he was trying to formulate the Nyayo Philosophy.. In the death of Dr. ouko, God is asking us "So you hear your President?" Mkiendelea kupanaa chuki, mtaivuna. This country will only develop from the day every Kenyan will open his heart  that another Kenyan is free to develop in whatever way possible by his own efforts or by sheer luck. So long as we continue to have people who harbour jealousies and who will not accept another African getting equally rich or richer, our problems will continue to multiply. God is asking us "Are you ready to develop? Are you ready to open your hearts and see another person more efficient than you?" That is the efficiency which, will  help this country. Kenyans are you ready to see someone who is more dedicated and  determined to defend this country in the interest of the future generations? God is asking us "Kenyans are you surely hearing what your President is telling you?"My own conclusion is that the death of Dr. Ouko. is a  rude awakening to our people in Kenya to the effect that after 26 years of Independence, it is necessary that they listen to their President.  whom they have had for the last 11 years and practise what he says. Thank you. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILDLIFE (Mr. Gakunju): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I would like to start "by thanking His Excellency the President for his very wise speech which was full of guidance and inspiration. I would like to thank his especially for his wise and guided leadership during the difficult period after the tragic death of the late Dr. Robert J. Ouko. I would also like to say that His Excellency the President did everything possible to keep us calm and as a result of this everything went on very well. We should all be grateful that we have such a President. We should all pray to God so that His mighty hand will continue to lead and to guide His Excellency the President.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the rumour mongers had a day and I think that we all agree that we have had  enough of these rumours now and they should stop. Parliament has resumed and we should all sit down and start working. His Excellency the President advised us to ensure that the Business of this House is not interrupted "because of lack of quorum. we should be more serious about our work.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, many people have spoken about freedom and how we attained our freedom. Many people who fought for freedom are being phased out by time and we will only be reading about them in history books.My worry is that we are losing the sense of patriotism that we had during the struggle for Independence.I still remember those days and I know how good it was to throw away the yoke of colonialism and become independent. We now have that freedom and we are enjoying it. But we still have among us people who ask for and accept bribes before treating a sick patient. There are others who hide files so that they can be bribed. Is that freedom? Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, "the freedom I am talking about is the freedom to love one another; where we will work because we have accepted jobs. we have been trained "by our Government and we are lucky to have gone to school or college and we have "been put in that responsible position. But we are demanding bribes from the very people who helped us to get education. That is not the kind of freedom we fought for.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am very grateful that His Excellency the President indicated in his Speech that a system of enabling elders to hear land cases is going to be worked out. This is because the rich are exploiting the poor, we have seen in our constituencies cases of members of rich families taking away land from other people by using their colleagues in offices or through arm-twisting. They have managed to get land from other people. They have  managed to get this land and have the owners evicted from land which they Inherited from their parents. This unjust thing happens just because these people are able to go to the High Court, then to the Court of Appeal and to everybody else.So, if we really have to safeguard our freedom, we have to make sure that we treat each other with the love that we started with. It is just like in marriage. When people are newly married, they have love, but this love wanes as they grow older. I think it should be the other way round. We have been with freedom for so many years and so our. love for each other should be greater than it wets at the beginning. We, leaders, should show the people the way.The other issue I want to raise is on the local newspapers. You find that newspapers put words into people's mouths and nothing is done about it. I would like to single out the Kenya Times as the main culprit. The reporters of this newspaper normally come to Gatundu Constituency to report on what the Member of Parliament for the area does not do and not what he does. I hope they are hearing me. Who is going to ask them? Is there nothing that can be done to them to ensure that they write the truth; a balanced statement of what has actually happened?	</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Not the Kenya Times. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILDLIFE (Mr. Gakunju): Not the Kenya Times, I am glad to hear an hon. Member say. "I think we should be protected in this House, and even outside as leaders. The truth should be told, not just about us, but about everybody. We are responsible people and we would like the truth to be told. We are free people. We are elected people, and because we have people to lead, it is important that these matters are taken care of properly. The truth should always prevail. I do not mind being reported on what I have actually said or done. But it hurts me when lies are reported and repeated.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as a businessman, I always like talking about the econonmy of this country. I was recently thrilled to see His Excellency the President unveil the three Kenya-made cars theNyayo Pioneer 1, the Nyayo Pioneer 2 and the Nyayo Pioneer 3. This is agreat achievement, and I hope that within a few years we will all be drivingcars of that make and that our wives and brothers in the countryside willbe driving pick-up cars of the same make. This will enable us to create morejob opportunities and communication will be easier.We should not spend our money in importing big cars. I hope that this will succeed. I also hope that since God has blessed us with good rains this year and last year, we shall have a good harvest and that the economy will continue to improve.In conclusion, Mr . Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to remind my friend  the Minister for Public Works, that we are still waiting for the repair of the roads in. Gatundu. This is because it is impossible to pass through during these heavy rains. We hope that something is going to be done to get the roads up to date so that farmers can be able to transport their produce.Withe those few remarks, I support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mr.Mak’Anyengo): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my colleagues in contributing towards this wonderful Address exposing the policy of the Government that was made by His Excellency the President. The Address covered everything that needed coverage. In a way this Address exposed a lot of things that we should as hon. Members or law-makers question ourselves as to whether we are doing them right.The President challenged us to do what we were elected to do. He challenged this House by reading the words that are on the door of this House. As he was doing that I asked myself, “Have we been doing what we were elected to do?” The answer that I get is to the contrary,  It is true that all of us when we stand, we talk of Nyoism and of supporting the President. But do we only support him by words of mouth or by deeds? To the contrary, many of us do not do so. This is because if we were doing that we would not be leaving the President to discover things for himself when there are those of us who are appointed to look after certain Ministries. Let us take, for example,The introduction of cost—sharing in medical services. During that time the Ministry of Health came up with programmes and charges that were going to be levied, regardless of what wananchi were going to think about them and the fact that we are all not equal just like these fingers of mine which are not of the same length.it is not until the cries of wananchi about the charges reached the ears of the President that we acted. It is not only that last week a child was detained in a hospital because the mother could not meet the charges. This is happening when the President has asked us to be mindful of other people’s welfare.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, on Saturday the president will be conducting a Harambee for those clever children whose parents cannot pay school fees for them. That is being mindful of other people’s  welfare. Are we mindful of other people's welfare when we detain children just because their mothers cannot afford paying certain hospital charges? By doing such things are we helping the President or inciting people against his Government?When an ordinary mwanahchi is discontented, we cannot rule in peace because there is discontentment, and this is what we have to fight against it is also this that we have to follow to help the President and the Government know exactly what would help wananchi.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, referring to the tragic death of Dr. Ouko,it was a very trying period, particularly for those of us who are from Nyanza. We had all sorts of suggestions, all sorts of propaganda and so on going on, but thank God that we stood together and our people also stood together with the Govern¬ment. I say so because some heinous fellows kept on. running  around and telling the Luos, particularly their leaders, to leave the Government. Our question was: "We leave the Government to go where?" These rumour-mongers went on saying, all sorts of things. But we said "No". We are with the Government and there is no other Government that we can go to other than this one. I am now glad and happy that our people heard what we said and stood firm.Mr. Temporary. Deputy Speaker, Sir, when one of the run-away fugitives came back, immediately he he started making a lot of noise. I studied what he was talking about. This was Mr. Ngumba. I made a statement in the Press, questioning his intention. Before Ngumba left he said that he had a mission to fulfil, and that he would not come back until he had fulfilled that mission, well, everyone of us should ask Ngumba's intention in connection with that. when we had a tragic death or situation like the one we had, the same, same Ngumba had a mission to cause rumour-mongering and chaos in the country. I think the Government has been very much tolerant, and it is high time that people like Ngumba, Mungai and so on were dealt with. There isnothing that is feared. Unless these people are dealt with they will continue to cause a mess in this country and make other people suffer when they have money to run around with. After stealing money from poor wananchi, they use it to cause chaos in the country wananchi to suffer.Mr. Temporary Deputy-.!Speaker, Sir, it is a sad situation that  people are taking advantage of the "big heart" that our President has as a weakness, and think they can do everything and anything and get away with it. I think it is high time that something was done against such people so as to be a lesson to others that might think they can behave in that manner.Before I conclude, Sir, I would like to appeal to the Ministry of Education. It is true that wananchi have agreed, cost-sharing in education, but the way it has been put is hurting wananchi. All the schools in all the areas are developed equally. There are some schools which are in very remote areas, but it is strange to find that the parents are required to buy things like chalk, exercise books for the teachers. scheme of work and so on. For instance, In a place like Nairobi where parents are capable of doing that, there is no problem, but when you get to an area where a father or a mother takes six months or more to get KSh.10/- or kSh.50/-, it is very disheartening. It is rather unfiar. I think we have contributed enough by putting up schools, buying desks and meeting other requirements. The Ministry of Education should think again about the circular it sent out saying that even chalk should be bought by parents. If we are to help our President, we should remember that such things as this cause discontent among wananchi. As far as the mwananchi is concerned, he knows that after doing all he has done, things like chalk and teachers' books should be provided by the Government without requiring parents to pay for them.With these few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg tosupport. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Mutiso): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my colleagues who have spoken on this important Motion that is now before the House. Before I go far, let me start by paying great tribute to the late hon. Dr. Robert Ouko, that great son of Kenya who will never forgotten in this country because he dedicated his life, to the true service of Kenya since he finished schooling. I personally had the honour to be outside this country with the late-hon. Dr. Robert Ouko when Kenya, as an independent country, sent its second delegation to the United Nations, headed by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Joseph Murumbi. The late hon. Dr. Robert Ouko was then the Permanent Secretary in that great Ministry. This occurred way back in 1964, soon after we attained our Independence, and I had the privilege of being a member of that delegation. I worked with the late hon. Dr. Robert Ouko in te United Nations for a period of three months. This was my first time to know him closely as a very dedicated son of Kenya. I want to say that this country has lost a very sincere and dedicated son. May God place his soul in eternal life.Having said that, let now take this oppportunity to join ray colleagues who have contributed to this important Motion that was set here the day before yesterday by His Excellency the President. Normally, it is just human to take a long time to see the truth. It is only after a long time has elapsed that people begin to say, "We were actually being told the right thing. We wish we mended our ways at that time." Quite often, His Excellency the President has told us that when troubles: - comes to this country, it will not affect just a selected few or only certain individuals, but for us a all those who engineer the trouble. What wise words these are! Certainly, the people who were behind the death of Dr. Robert Ouko were, and are still looking for problems and chaos for this country and whatever benefits they exprect is what we cannot see or understand. He who takes one else's life goes contrary to the word of God because God says that it is only him who has the right to take away a person's life since it is his and it is he who bestows life. Surely, the people who killed Dr. Ouko had an aim of causing chaos in this country. I want to thank the people of Kenya, headed by our President, for the restraint they showed. The people of Kenya refused to be seduced to taking the dangerous action of participating in chaos; they were patient enough. In fact, the President himself restrained himself so much that even when university students were demonstrating and uttering all sorts of words, in fact, pointing an. accusing finger at the Government, nothing was  done by the Government to provoke chaos. Thanks to God that we have a God-fearing President. He restrained himself and the Government and the matter of Dr. Ouko's death was handled with great skill. Today, the people of Kenya have cooled down over this great emotion.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, people cannot know a great man living among themselves in their own time. I want to say that we have a great leader who is not an ordinary person. To me, I would say that we have a saint living among us today but we cannot see that. Some of us who have eyes do not have the grace to see. President Moi is a man of great humility; he is a man who is God—fearing and a man who hates to hurt anyone. He has forgiven even those who have hurt him physically and given them the chance to enjoy their life and to mend their ways. Surprisingly enough, you find that not many of us see these qualities of our President. If those ambitious people who want to take the leader ship of this country were in the President's shoes and something like the death of Dr. Ouko happened,this country would be in great chaos. May the Almighty God who has given us this great son of Kenya bless him with more wisdom and longer days to continue leading Kenyans to greater heights of development. With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, although I have but a few seconds, I will try and say something in support of this Motion. I want, first of all, to thank the President.

We shall leave his Question until the end then.Next Question.	Question No. 18 	Delay in Payment of NSSF Benefits.MR. BIDU asked the Minister for Labour what is delaying the payment of NSSF benefits for Messrs Ndegwa Chidudu Kwachidudu, NSSF No. 030-333-027 and Stephen Kazungu Kilonga, NSSF No. 001-043-51x. <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Both, claims have been paid but unfortunately both cheques have been returned to my office as being unclaimed from the post office. The particulars are as follows:-The payment of Mr. Mwachidudu was made on 15th February, 1988 by cheque No. 012915. for Kshs.. 26,152.30. It was sent by registered mail to the chief's office, Kilibole Location, Mazeras Post Office. Unfortunately, this cheque was returned to us in  August 1988 as unclaimed. It has now been cancelled as stale. Mr. Mwachidudu can, therefore, come back and give us a correct address and a fresh cheque will be issued to him.The payment of Mr.Kilonga was made 4th August, 1987, by cheque No. 062582 for Kshs. 44,446.80 addressed to him, care of K.P.& Lighting Company Limited, P.O. Box 90104, Mombasa. Unfortunately, the cheque, was unclaimed returned to us on the 2nd of February; 1983. Mr. Kilonga. should, also give a correct address so that we can send him a fresh cheque. </Newspeech>		<Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I appreciate the answer given by the Minister. "Is it possible for him "to post those cheques through my address? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.OKGNDO:. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is always possible  and we can do everything that needs to be done to facilitate payment provided that the payees will confirm to us that they have changed their address to that of the hon. Member. We will have no objection unless, of course, the hon. Member wants to make other arrangements. Normally, we require that the payee tells us where he wants his cheque to be sent. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, these people are suffering and that is why I want to avoid delay by giving the Minister  my address or I collect the cheques from his office. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Bidu. What is your question? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the Minister allow me. to give him my address? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: He accepted. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the Minister consider sending all NSSF benefits to Kenya Commercial Banks in all the districts in the Republic for onward transmission to the owners? This is because it takes long to get those benefits and some of the payees die without receiving them. What future plans does he have in that respect? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we do not have any future plans in that respect. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, will the Minister tell the House whether there are designs to ensure that the cheques are not easily cashed? We have seen very many cheques which are sent but never received by the payees. Are there plans by the National. Social Security Fund to retain workers money so that it benefits from interest accruing from such money? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we do not have any ill motives; our intention is to serve wananchi fully. The point is that we send a cheque to the address that the payee gives. If a payee asks us to send his cheque to a certain bank, we will do so this because we cannot send a cheque to a place other than where a payee has directed us to send it. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from the  Minister's answer, these payment have been delayed for a very longtime because one cheque was sent in 1987 and the other one in 1988. Since the beneficiaries have been incovenienced for a long time, could the Minister arrange with the hon. Questioner to take these people to the" NSSP so that they can be paid their money across the counter? That is better than using the long process of asking them to give other contact addresses. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKDNDO: Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have no objection whatsoever to paying  these people across the counter, as the hon. Member is suggesting, provided they produce adequate identification. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, is the Ministeraware that these cheques are normally dishonoured  because his officials have given themselves loans and loaned other financial institutions money that has not been repaid? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. 0KDND0: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not aware. </Newspeech>Question No. 1 Lack of Examination Papers in MakueniMR. KYONDA asked the Minister for Education why the K.C.P.E. results, 1989, for Mwisa and Kithuki Primary Schools in Makueni Division missed Maths and G.H.C. papers respectively.<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Oloo-Aringo): Mr. Deputy. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.	 I am aware that the 1989 Kenya Certificate of Primary Education Examination results for Mathematics paper in respect of Mwisa Primary School, centre No., 37446, were cancelled because the candidates were involved in examination irregularities. However, I wish to clarify that my Ministry released the Geography History, Civics and Religious Education paper for Yikithuki Primary School, centre No. 37415, but cancelled the Science and Agriculture results because the candidates were involved in examination irregularities. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while thanking, the Minister his reply, I would like to know what examination irregularities the pupils were involved in.	</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OLOO-ARINGO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I hope that my hon. friend and colleague will support us in maintaining the integrity of our national examinations, because if we do not do that our national examinations will not be respected. In this particular case our expert examiners were capable of discovering irregularities. I do not know whether my hon.friend wantsme to bring the scripts here to show our proof, beyond any reasonable doubt, that there was cheating in that particular paper</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, we would like to know who between the  candidates and the examination officials was responsible for the irregularities. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.OLOO—ARETGO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have proof that the candidates cheated. We have investigated the matter and taken appropriate action: first we have definitely cancelled "the results for those papers... We will not condone cheating of any kind in our national examinations - I shall certainly not.MR. MATE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.The question put to the Minister is very clear Can he tell thisHouse what kind of irregularities were committed? We agree withand support him when he assert that he cannot condone examinationirregularities. However, can he tell us the kind of cheatingthese pupils were involved in?MR. 0L00—ARIHGO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have very simple proof of this one, namely that of candidates givingthe same answer. For example, if the answer is 10 and then you find all candidates get answer 10 including those who had. 20 + 50, 100 + 10,2 + 2, we go back to investigate and find someoby somewhere, released the answer, to the candidates but they could. not prove their competence in the examination. We have trained and professional makers. SO when we allege cheating we happen tohave done enormous homework. I do not know whether the hon. Member would like me to produce examples of cases where there  was cheating of that kind.MR. KYONDA: Mr." Deputy Speaker, Sir, in fact, I "would be happy to get those results. However, I would like to assure the Minister and  this House, that I would not condone any examination cheating and I fully support him in not condoning examination cheating. But we have to know whose mistake it was. There are responsible officers who are paid and charged with the supervision of the examination. After the investigations, isjjpossibie for the Minister to noint out whether the pupils or the officers were responsiblefor those irregularities? We are talking about many pupils whose future has been messed up because  of a mistake that could have been corrected. We want to know whose mistake it was so that the culprits can be dealt with otherwise this kind of thing will continue. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  OLOO—ARINGO: Mr. Deputy Speaker,Sir, I would like to assure the hon. Member that we do not take these steps lightly. We take them after very thorough and professional investigations, and where there have been cases of cheating we have taken firm action.I really want to appeal to this House and the country to support us, as it were, so that people do not take advantage and cheat,because that is the beginning of corruption which we will neither tolerate nor allow. However, let me assure the hon.Member that we do investigate and punish all collaborators, be they teachers, pupils or invigilators. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I think I will allow two moresupplementary questions on that Question. We have to go on. Mr. Mangdtoli.	</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANGOLI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there were someintelligent children who have filled victims of that particular kindof cheating. There were some intelligent children who used to get position one or two in that class, and therefore the Minister cannot just punish the whole school. There were some children who could have done better even without cheating. What criteria did they use to say that all the children had cheated? When you condemn the whole school., Mr. Minister, we as leaders get very concerned. There must have been a child who could have gone to Alliance High School, but he is being frustrated because of that question of cheating. What do we do, Mr. Minister? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OLOO-ARINGO: Mr. Deputy Speaker,Sir, I do thank my hon. colleague for his sentiments. We must however, root out cheating, of any kind, just as we have to root out corruption,, tribalism and so on, because such things undermine the fabric of our society,  they cannot be practised in our schools system, and therefore, they will certainly not be practised in our examinations system. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MATE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the Minister is using some good language, but he ismeandering a lot when he starts giving us the answer. We would like to know in this particular case who is to blame, is it the young children or those few invigilators? Can he tell us so that we can know where to lay the blame? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. OLOO-ARXNGO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it takes more than one person to cheat. We shall  punish all those people who were involved in cheating, and we have already done that. All collaborators, whether they are pupils, teachers or invigilators shall be punished. </Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker,Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: We have to get on now. I will allow the hon. Questioner, to raise his poihti of  order. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Would the House be told what action has been taken againstthe . We know that the pupils have already been punished</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Kyonda, that is not a point of order, it is a supplementary question, however, I will allow you to raise it. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, The pupils have already been punished by  cancelling their examination papers.  What, action has been taken against those people who collaborated in the cheating? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR.OLOO—ARINGO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,, action has been against those people who were involved including invigilators. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let us have the last supplementary question. Mr. Mwenje. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: Sir, the Minister seems to coincide one fact, that the children and the officers were to blame. If we agree to that fact, the children were led by those officers,, and those were young children in primary school, therefore, they were simply misled by those adults Would the Minister, therefore consider allowing those children to repeat another examination on the same papers so that they can be considered like any others. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OLOO-ARING0: First of all I would like to appeal to my hon. colleagues again to assist me to remove the culture of cheating in examinations. It must be removed so that we can have respect for our national examinations. I am not prepared to compromise. If the children are guilty, they will be punished just like any body else because as citizens, they should report to us any cases to cheating. </Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Wasike-Ndombi, I am not allowing a± any more points of order, if they are related to that Question. Let us move on, Mr. Wambua’s Question. </Newspeech>Question No.2<header>Delay in Completion af Mbiuni Water Project</header> MR.WAMBUA asked the Minister for Water Development what is delaying the completion of Mbiuni Water Project in Mbiuni Location, Machakos District.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Mweu): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.	Mbiuni Water Project is an existing water supply which was completed in 1975, under the Rural Water Supply Phase II. So,	-there is no question of it having  not been completed.  What the hon. Member is referring to is perhaps the rehabilitation work that is being done by the ministry to improve the supply. This work is still continuing. Already, half the number of pipes required to rehabilitate a 7.9 km stretch are on site. Additional work will involved extra pumping sets,a composite infiltration unit, a pump house a 100 cubic metre storage  tank. I cannot, therefore, give the completion date as this work is on-going. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: I.would like to thank the Assistant Minister for informing the House that the Rural Water Supply Phase II has already been completed, but I was to referring to the other water supply project which is under construction right now. It has taken too long, from 1987 to-day. The people dug some trenches for the water pipes, but today, those trenches have become dangerous to the animals and the people themselves. Would the Assistant Minister tell us when that water supply project will be completed, because without it the existing water supply system is not sufficient to the people? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWEU: Sir, I would like to plead with the hon. Member to be patient. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Sir, I have been patient enoughs. Now,I would like the Assistant Minister to tell us the specific Date when that project will be completed. </Newspeech>	~<Newspeech>MR. MWEU: Sir,, it is very diffficult to say exactly when, because some work has to be done on it. Therefore, it is not possible to say when that work will be completed. I cannot say whether that work will be completed tomorrow,, or after one month or even after one year, but my Ministry is working hard to complete that project. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. MANG’OLI: Sir, arising from the Assistant Minister’s reply, I think he is not serious enough. The hon. Member has asked him when that project will be completed, and the Assistant Minister has the audacity to tell this House that he does not know when will be.completed, The hon. Questioner has the right to know when that project will be completed. If the Assistant Minister does not know when that project will be completed, then we do not have a Ministry. The Ministry should know approximately  when that project will be completed. The hon. Member and the people back home have been patient enough. Can the Assistant Minister now tell us when that project will be completed. The Ministry should  have a record on that project,and  therefore, the Assistant Minister should be able to tell us roughly when that project will be completed. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWEU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I maintain that it is not easy to say when a project of that natureis likely to be completed. All that I am saying is that my Ministry  I think that is what the hon. Member should accept  is working hard towards the completion of the rehabilitation work. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG’OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. MR.DEPUTY SPEAKER: . What is your point of order, Mr.. Mang’oli? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG’OLI: My point of order is that the Assistant Minister is not answering my question. ... I asked him to tell this House approximately when that project will be completed. He is now talking about a project which is not existing. When will that project, be completed?" </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWEU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not prepared to mislead this House. I  maintain that my Ministry is working hard towards the completion of that work. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Sir, is the Assistant Minister convinced thathe was given the proper answer by the officials in his Ministry?he is not convincing the House as to when that project will be completed. Is he convinced that the answer he got is satisfactory? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MWEU: The answer I have given to the House, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, is satisfactory. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir. We need your protection against Ministers and Assistant Ministers. If these are the answers they will he giving to our Questions here, then it means that we are doing nothing. Can the Assistant Minister tell us when this project is going to be completed? I am sure the designers of the project must have indica¬ted when the project is going to be completed. If the wananchi  hear these things over the radio they will get the impress that we are doing nothing in this House. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWEU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have already said that we know what remains to be done. Since we know what remains to be done, and we have the will and the materials, I do not know why the hon.Members are so anxious to know when the project is going to be completed. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.G. GODANA: Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to assume that the Ministry of Water Development has competent officers who can design a project and indicate how long it is going to take to implement such a project Could the Assistant Minister,therefore, tell us when this project is going to be completed?	</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWEU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have already saidthat this is not a new project. We are doing rehabilitation workon an old project. It is therefore not easy for me to say when thisrehabilitation work will be completed. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.I. MOHAMMED: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister is telling us that this is not a new project. We know that it is not a new project. But they must have known how long this rehabilitation work will take to complete. Can he therefore tell us when they are going to complete this work? </Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR. MWEU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I still maintain that I am unable to tell the time. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell us whether any money is available for the implementation of that project? Are there any workers on the site? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWEU: Mr.Deputy Speaker Sir, there are people at the site. They have been  working on the project. That is why I am saying that there are some pipes at the site and we know what requires to be done on the Rising Main and from the In-take to the main storage tank. we know how much money we need for this project and that is why we are saying that we need a filtration unit, an additional pumping set and a pump house  and also a storage tank with a capacity of	100 cubic  metres</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Here we need your ruling and your guidance. I say this because there must have proposals indicating when the project would be completed. But the Assistant Minister does not want to tell us when they are going to complete this projects Since he is now  avoiding that reply, can we have your guidance so that he can come up with a paper to show us when the project was supposed to be completed? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon.Mweu, would you like to carry out someinvestigations into this matter, for the satisfaction of the House? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWEU: I will, definitely, do that, Mr.; Deputy Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I appreciate thehon. Assistant Minister's promise to carry out further investigations.However, the pipes are there and the trenches were dug a long timeback. In fact, they have become snares for our people as well asto our livestock. Who is responsible for that half-done work? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWEU: Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, I did not get that question from the hon.Member. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Mweu, perhaps you could give an indication as to when you propose to bring hack the results of your investigation, to cut short  these arguments. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWEU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will, perhaps, he able to come back with my report next week, on Tuesday. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr.Deputy Speaker. Is it in order for the  hon. Assistant Minister, after you have asked him when he expects to be ready with a report, to reply to the effect that he will "probably" do that next week?MR. DEPUTY SPEAEER: I am sure he meant next Tuesday.Let us now go on to MT. A.K. Kimemia's Question. </Newspeech>Question No.8<header>Modification of Menengai Chipboard Factory</header> MR. A.K. KIMEMTA asked the Minister for Industry since the by-product waste emanating from Menengai Chipboard Factory Ltd.; of P.O. Box 1088, Nakuru, is posing a health hazard to the members of the public whether he could direct the management to modify their factory to meet the necessary helth requirements.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR. INDUSTRY (Mr.:. Kibugi')': Mr.; Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Measures have already been taken by the local administration to have the management of the 'factory modify their machines so that the emissions of obnoxious gases and saw dust are controlled. Also the management has been told to improve the situation by taking the following meausres:(a)Installing a wetting system;(b)Improving their mixing system and(c)Rectifying their grading system.Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, the company is also taking measuresto rectify the mistakes and it is expected that by the end of March, 1990, the mistakes will have been corrected.	 <Newspeech>MR. A.K. KIMEMIA: Mr.: Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not know what measures the Assistant Minister is talking about because the company is still in operation. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIBUGI: Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, as a result of complaints by the local residents, a committee was formed and that committee recommended immediate closure of the  factory. That factory was closed in October, 1989. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG’OLI: On a point of order, Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir." If I heard the hon." Member well, he said that the factory is still in operation.However, I am very surprised to hear the Assistant Minister saying that the factory was closed in 1989. who is telling the truth now? Hon.: A.K. Kimemia comes from Nakuru while the Assistant Minister comes from Meru.: So, we do not know who is telling us the truth. </Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: The Assistant Minister comes from Kirinyaga. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIBUGI: .Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, the factory was closed in October, 1989." The same committee also recommended the non-renewal of the conrpany’s trading licence until proper measures which I have just mentioned are taken. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.K. ZTYANJUI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think it is very encouraging to hear about the action the Ministry is taking. May we therefore know whether there is an Inspectorate within the Ministry to go round inspecting such factories which emit obnoxious by-products? I ask this question because I am sure that we have quite a number of such factories in this country. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIBUGI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in Nakuru  we have a District Industrial Development Officer who has already been co-opted in that local committee.This committee which was set up by the District Commissioner consists of a local councillor, the Municipal Health Officer, the Nakuru Municipal Engineer, four Health Officers a representative from the Mayor.' s office and the Factories Inspector stationed in NakuruMR. A.K. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the Assistant Minister is misleading this House. I come from that area and I can tell you that this factory is still in operation. What action is the Ministry going to take to rectify this situation? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KIBUGI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think I will have to investigate that information from the hon. Member because the measures that were to be followed are as follows :Firstly, the management of the firm had to install a working system which would be converting the emitting system downwards.Secondly, there was supposed to be an improvement on the emitting system  and electrification of the grading system.The factory was supposed to be closed in October, 1989. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think we are deviating from the point. The Assistant Minister has loudly said that the factory is 'perhaps’ closed. The people of the area are going to die due to the pollution, and the Assistant Minister is taking things for granted.He has not even gone to Nakuru to investigate the  matter and he comes  here and says that 'perhaps' the factory is closed. We want to know whether the factory is closed or not. If it is not closed, you, Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir,, should order him to go back and bring us a proper answer. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIBUGI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I did not use the word  'perhaps'. I said that as far sis the Ministry is concerned, the factory was closed in October, 1989. What is going on at the moment is that the management of the factory is undertaking the measures I have already enumerated, and it is expected that the exercise will be completed by the end of March, 1990. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, is the Assistant Minister aware that there are some companies that join hands with co-operators to deny the owners their dues? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon. Mutua, I am at a loss here. I am unable to know whether you were putting that supplementary Question in relation to the Question before the House. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MUTUA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister aware that Co-operators join hands with the Minister to grab money from owners of factories? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! I will overule that point of order. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The hon. Questioner has told the House that the factory is still in operation whereas the Assistant Minister tells us that it is supposed to be closed down. Which is which? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I have already overuled that supplementary Question. Hon. Members should please listen to each other because it is important." Hon. Mutua has brought up something that is totally out of what is happening here. For your information, Mr. Bidu, hon. Kibugi had just replied to that Question you are now raising in reply to the point of order from hon. Mang'oli. So, shall we proceed? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: On a point of order, Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir. It appears as if the Assistant Minister is misleading the House because the hon. Questioner says that the factory is still in operation, whereas the Assistant Minister says the factory has been closed down. Could the Assistant Minister go back and find out whether the factory has actually  been closed down or not and if not, stringent measures be taken against its management? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIBUGI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have clearly said that the factory has been closed down. The management is making rectifications so that they can be allowed to re-open it. The officials who were appointed to take care of the situation will visit the factory in April this year to verify whether the measures I mentioned were undertaken, before the firm can be allowed to resume operation. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Are you happy with that reply, Hon. Kimemia? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIMEMIA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I still insist that the factory is operating. The Assistant Minister, in his earlier reply, saidthat he was going to investigate this matter and report his findings to the House later. Can he now tell us when he is going to report his findings to the House? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.KIBUGI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the factory is not supposed to be operating because it has been closed down. If it is operating, it is doing so illegally. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIMEMIA: Mr. Deputy Speaker,Sir, I insist again that the factory is operating. I know there was a committee that was appointed to look into the matter, but even now, the factory has not improved its health standards. So, what action is the Assistant Minister going to take? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIBUGI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will find out why the factory is still operating while it is supposed to be closed down. </Newspeech>MR. A.I. MOHAMMED Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, according to the Assistant Minister, the factory is theoretically closed down but practically, it is not; it is actually operating. The lives of the people of the area are in danger. Can the Assistant Minister assure this House that the factory will be closed immediately and that its management team is punished according to the law?<Newspeech>MR. KIBUGI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,, we will take the necessary action. </Newspeech>		.<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let us go back to Mr.Chepkok's Question. </Newspeech>Question No. 4<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Chepkok is still not here? Okay, let us go to Question by Private Notice. </Newspeech>(Question dropped) <header> QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE</header> (MR. GALGALLO) to ask the Minister for Regional Development what urgent measures he is taking to supply enough water to tenants of Hola Irrigation Scheme in view of the fact that the cotton farmers in that scheme are losing most of their cotton and maize crop due to lack of adequate water supply.<header>POINT OF ORDER</header><Newspeech>MR.BIDU: On a point of order, Mr.. Deputy Speaker, Sir. This isin connection with the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. In thepast, the Voice of Kenya used to air the programme hec Katika Bunge at 10.00 p.m. and at 6.30 a.m. the following day. This has not been happening since the beginning of this Session. We, therefore, do not get that programme in the morning. We, therefore, require a Ministerial Statement explaining, the position. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Since there is nobody here from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, we will leave that matter there at the moment. </Newspeech> <header>BILLS</header> <header>First Readings </header>           The Factories (Amendment) BillThe Public Archives (Amendment) BillThe Pensions (Increase) (Amendment) BillThe Engineers Registration (Amendment) Bill(Orders for First Readings read Read the First Time - Ordered to be read the Second Time tomorrow)<header>MOTION</header> Thanks for the Presidential AddressTHAT, the thanks of this House be recorded for the exposition of public policy contained in His Excellency's Presidential Address from the Chair on 13th March, 1990.(The Minister for Energy (Mr. Biwott) on 14.3.90) (Resumption of Debate-interrupted on 15.3.90)<Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, before the interruptionof our Business on. Thursday I was saying that I support the Motionon the Presidential Address which he delivered to this House on theopening of the Third Session of the Sixth Parliament. I also saidat that time that we in this country are lucky to have a special man like His. Excellency the President who did not become a national leader just the other day. I recall that long before Independence around the 1950,he had the courtesy to visit the late President at Kapenguria.None of us at that time knew the importance of such a gesture. It is also interesting to note that it was only him who at that time decided to do this. Such an act shows clearly that from the very beginning he was being led by God. This is because he a could foresee things in advance which some of us could not at that time.So I can say that we have a special kind of man leading this country. He is a man who one day will chair a Kanu Parliamentarymeeting, another day he is opening Parliament and on other days he ison his way to Ethiopia, holding a goat auction in Maragat and conducting a mommoth Harambee in Uhuru Park without rest. What a special—energetic man we have in the name of President Daniel arap Moi! We are indeed very klucky that A this man does not tire in serving this country. This is in contrast to some of us who after travelling abroad cannot go upcountry saying that we are very tired. Our President can continuously hold major functions  in this country without  getting tired. We are very lucky to have such kind of man who is leading this nation to greater heights.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,we would thus like to congratulateHis Excellency the President for holding such a magnificent Harambee on Saturday where shs.141 million was realized which is the reflection of certain nation's national budgets.The strides that this country have made in developments, due to the wise, leadership of the President are so enormous that we have to be thankful to him. He has in fact made history in this country and indeed in Africa. Being so lucky in having such a man we have all causes to thank God for giving this country such a kind of man and leader. We hope that God will continue to guide him in his safaris to Namibia and other places so that our country will continue to flourish to greater heights and be able to reap the benefits that this country deserves.I would also like to join my colleagues in saying somethingabout the late Dr." Ouko.I would like to suggest here that nobodyshould capitalise on the calamity that has befallen this country asa result of that death. We have all lost an hon. gentleman, aMinister and, a man who we all loved. If that is so let nobodycapitalise on this issue. Since this was a national calamity weare hopeful that at one time the truth of the matter will come outand the people responsible for this malicious act will be brought to book so that others will learn from it. We also hope andbelieve that we will not in future have such beastly acts in thiscountry.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, X would also like to say something about a certain road that links the Mombasa Nairobi Road to the Nairobi Industrial Area. There is a bridge on this road that has broken down that needs to be repaired very urgently because the industrialists in this area are suffering. Because of this they have to go round a long distance to reach the Nairobi/Mombasa hard and to come back to their premises. This road needs urgent action and I hope that the authorities will hear my cry and do something about it. In fact, the businessmen in this area are complaining a lot. Although this bridge is currently under construction, it is taking too long to complete.The other sad affair is about the Dandora/Embakassi area where the City Commission has normally dumps rubbish around Dandora Phase I. This has made the area a health hazard. I do not know, what action the City Commission or the Ministry of Health is going to take because sooner or later there is going to be an  outbreak of a very serious diesease if no action is taken.The Press has tried to highlight the matter, but nothing so far has been done to date. If one went there he would find  the scavenging birds hovering above the site while on the ground about 100 people are busy collecting the rubbish. These two groups are competing for the same thing. This is a serious affair about which I hope that action will be taken soon. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTUA: (inaudible) </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order, Mr. Mutual! </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also liketo appeal to the Minister of Agriculture to do something about payments to coffee farmers. Although the the prices of coffee are going up, I would not like to forget something that we always keep on forgetingt Although the large—scale farmers continue to be paid as they deliver their coffee, the small—scale farmers have to wait until their coffee is sold before they can be paid.If these small—scale farmers were paid as they delivered their coffee then this would act as an incentive and will help them grow more coffee. So I would like to appeal to the Ministry and to those in the  Treasury who are responsible for these payments, to look for a way whereby the coffee farmers can be paid as they deliver their coffee. Even if they cannot be paid the whole sum amount, at least,they could be paid a certain amount that they can use while awaiting the final payment. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to conclude my speech	by saying that I would hate to see situation whereby somebody points to capitalise on national issues, particularly whereby some¬body refers to "certain big tribes". He tells a Mzungu that they will continue like that. This is a dangerous situation which nobody should refer to. Let us all work in harmony. let us all help one another and forget those stories.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER 0E STATE, OPPICE OP THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Kyalo): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you very much for giving this opportunity to speak in support of His Excellency's Address to the House.First of all, I would like to thank His Excellency the President for appointing me as a Minister in his Office which is not only an honour to my Constituency but also to the people in Ukambani.The Address that was given by His Excellency the President was a landmark in the development of this country. When he spoke to us his intention was to guide us so that this country could, continue to have stability and also develop itself to such anextent that the country should is united. What the President told us should be heeded. We should try as much aspossible to emulate what he does for the country.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President has created a situation whereby this country has grown economically. The country has moved from strength to strength, and today we are witnessing a country whose economic progress cannot be compared with most of oth er African countries. In view of this, we thank His Excellency the President for the stability that he has created So that this country grows economically, and as a result of this, we are respected everywhere.When we look around, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,we see that the President has played a major part at the Organisation of African Unity (O.A.U.). He was the christain of the O.A.U. for two terms and during that time he made everybody know that in Kenya we have a leader¬ship that does not only show Kenya where it is going to but alsohelp other African countries. For that, we should thank thePresident for showing  the other African countries the way they should govern themselves.Internationally, he has played his part in showing that Africa can produce Statesmen like all other developed countries in the world. For that matter, we are being, honoured and respected by most of the countries in the world because of the leadership that His Excellency the President has given to us.Not only that, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The President has become a peace-maker in Africa, and for that matter, in the world. He has mediated in Angola, Sudan, Ethiopia and so on. He has also shown that Africans can do whatever is possible so as to make Africa feel that it is united.In the Preferential Trader Area (P.T.A.), he has played a major part to make Kenya more or less a kingpin for that organisa¬tion. This means that the part our President played is so great that we should assist him so as to make Kenya a better place to live in. This has also ensured that Kenya is given the sort of honour that it deserves because of what the President has done for it.He has also toured every part of the country so as to encourage		_ People to feel that they are one,and also to ensure that they feel that they are Kenyans. For that matter, we should try as much as possible to assist the President in maintaining the unity that he has created in this country.Mr. Deputy .Speaker, Sir, I will not say much about the Harambee movement which has become a hallmark in this country, and which he has encouraged for the purposes of developing the country. For that matter, it is upon us to assist the President to further that movement.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the President has become a light for this country, and during Dr. Ouko's death he maintained the peace w!hich was very difficult. He also tried his level best to calm the country and we should be thankful for what he did. The only thing that we should do is to ensure  that we should not take advantage of the crisis that took place during that time. There have been quarters that have tried to take advantage of the situation. We, in this House, should ensure that such a thing should not be encouraged; it should be stopped so that we assist the President in uniting the country. We should be grateful for what he did during that crisis and the only way of showing that we are grateful is by ensuring that wherever somebody tries to take advantage of the crisis, we stand against such a person.Mr. Deputy Speaker,Sir, for that matter, we, as a country, should support him. There is a need for the country to realise that the President played a major part here. So when it comes to the question of collective responsibility, we should know that the important thing in Parliamentary democracy is to maintain the spirit of collective responsibility. This is the issue the President has spoken about for a long time. We should ensure that this collective responsibility is maintained so as to maintain not only the unity but also democracy that we are following in this country. The President has done a lot. He has shown us the way, and it is now upon us to show that we follow this way. He has practically moved into every sphere of our life. He has given us the 8-4-4 system of education, which is a hallmark in the development of this country. He has also shown that by following the new system of education, this country will, within a very short time, be able to move from the old system of education which did not take us anywhere. With the new system, we will move forward to a stage where we will become an industrial nation. There have been some doubts among some people regarding the 8—4—4 system of education. I would Ike to say that this is a system that will make this country great. If there are some mistakes in any system, we should be able to correct them; if there are some particular mistakes that are not making the 8-4-4 system of education successful, we should ensure that they are promptly corrected. This is the only educational system that will enable this country to pregress as it ensures that we even overtake countries that are normally referred to as indust¬rial giants. By developing this system, we shall ensure that this country will be heading in the right direction to becoming an industrial nation in the African Continent.With those few remarks, Sir, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, forallowing me to contribute-on the Presidential Address. As usual, His Excellencythe President's Address was very fatherly, full of wisdom and advice. I wouldgo further and claim that we, as hon. Members of Parliament, know His Excellencythe President better than anybody else. This is because he is one of us and isalways with us. I think we are duty-bound to preach, to those who do not knowhim as we do, what he really stands for and who he really is. If we are to help him in his work, we have to carry out that duty.Let me touch on the unfortunate death of the late Dr. Ouko. When rumours come up about the manner of our late colleagues death, and even to the extent of putting the responsibility on this Government, it is really a shock; a very disappointing thing. We know of terrorism in Kenya; we know of people who dared cross His Excellency the President's path, and they are still living in comfort in Kenya today. It is not in any historical records that the late Dr. Ouko ever dared cross His Excellency the President's path. Why should anyone then imagine that it was the Government, or His Excellency the President, as a person, who was responsible for the late Ouko's murder? This is shocking.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is why I say that it is our duty, as. hon. Members of Parliament who really know who Daniel arap Moi is, to tell those others who do not know him, who he really is. We should go ahead and preach to them about what His Excellency the President is capable of doing, and what he can never do.Let me take this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency the President for the recent very successful Harambee fund—raising meeting at Uhuru Park. It was a record-breaker. However, there is an observation I would like to comment on. I am basing my observations on something I noticed and, I am sure, others did too. I appeal to our Asian community to be coming out just like anybody else during such events. Acha haya mambo ya watu wachache kwenda kwa Mzee kupeleka cheki za kampuni wakidai ni za Harambee. Even the personal appearance there should be considered. I did not notice a single Asian there. If it is the question of money, Asians are more connected with financial matters. Why then do they not join other Kenyans in such national issues? How Kenyan are they, then? Are they true Nyayo followers? His Excellency the Presidentis always preaching that we be mindful of our colleagues welfare and he is also calling upon us to come out in great numbers to contribute in such Harambee efforts. Does it mean that the Asian community will not benefit from these funds or does it mean that Asians are not poor? I do not think so, because they are Kenyans. So, we have to watch out for these people. I saw many Europeans lining up, and if Europeans can do this, why not Asians?We have 30 Ministries in this Republic, out of which only about half have their representatives at the district level. When we say that development should start at the grassroots level, it means that all Ministries should be represented at the district level. There are some Ministries that are not  represented at the district level, and even we, hon. Members, just hear of them, but we do not know what they do. They are not meant to represent the Republic at the national headquarters only; we want to see them represented at the grassroots level. I do not want to mention names, but I know that there are many Ministries which I would say are only known theoretically because we have never seen their representatives in practice. I appeal to hon. Members of the Front Bench who have not yet had their Ministries represented at the district level to do so now.Turning to patriotism, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that if we want Kenya to continue the way it is or improve even more, we have to be patriotic. To elaborate the reason why I have said this, there are times when people who, by virtue of their offices, have access to money but they misuse it in millions of shillings, and yet this money is meant for development projects. All people who misuse public money should be transferred or sacked. If you have stolen millions of shillings, why should you care if you are transferred or sacked? You already have the money you wanted. However, I would appeal to the authorities concerned, especially	law enforcement officers, to see that,justice is done. If somebody steals, get hold of him and do to him what the law requires, because transferring or sacking him will do no good to the Republic. Transferring such a person is the same as transferring a problem from one place to. another.Finally, I would like to say something about the Ministry of Education in respect of text books. I strongly believe that there is a racket between this Ministry and text book publishers. If we are told to buy books</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PLANNNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Ogle):On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The hon. Member is making a veryserious allegation to the effect that there is a serious racket between the Ministry of Education and publishers of -text-books. Can he substantiate that allegation? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: Why do you not give me time to do that? If, as parents,we are going to buy books for our children each year You find that a verypoor father is supposed to buy one book for every subject each year. What is happening now is that parents are required to buy books for every class each year, after which the books become useless. If it was the Ministry or the school which was to buy the books and keep them, those books would last for years so that the next generation of students can still use them. We have to be convinced that there is no racket because I do not see why parents are required to be buying books for each class. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr.. Oloo-Aringo): On a point of information, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. My hon. colleague knows very well that we used to get very little money provided in the Budget for the purchase of equipment,, which little money is not provided any more. So, in its budget, the Ministry of Education has no provision whatsoever for any money to purchase text—books. If ay hon. colleague can vote money through this House for the purchase of text-books, I would only be too glad to oblige. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is no time that money for purchase of text-books was sought from this House and not given. What we would like the Ministry of Education to do is to think of a way through which text-books can be bought and kept by schools so that parents do not have to spend every single cent they get to purchase books every year. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Oloo-Aringo): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. This same House adopted the policy of cost-sharing, in which parents have to pay a certain cost of education, one of which is the purchase of text-books. What I am going to advise, through this point of order, is that the responsibility to purchase text-books is for parents and not for the Ministry of Education. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I agree with the policy of cost- sharing but not to that extent. The Ministry should improvise a way through which books can be bought and kept by schools and other education institutions.With those few remarks, I beg to support the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my hon. colleagues in thanking His Excellency the President for a most wonderful speech which gave us guidance as to what we must always remember and do, not only as hon. Members of this House but as Kenyans.Before I say anything else, let me say that I am one of the happiest men in this country because His Excellency, the President, found it fit to promote me from an Assistant Minister to a Minister, a job I want to promise to do and do it diligently. His. Excellency the President, in. his wisdom, appointed me the Minister for Regional Development, and I want to assure my hon. colleagues and this august House that as a regionally developed Minister, I intend to visit all regions to ascertain for myself what must happen in each region. My Ministry is responsible for the production of rice through the National Irrigation Board. and all regional authorities. We have a new authority that runs from almost North of the Rift Valley to the South, and it even passes near the home of the Vice- President and Minister for Finance, and I can assure His Excellency the Vice- President that the Uaso-Nyiro River, which passes near his home, will be well looked after-by my Ministry.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to say in this House that His Excellencythe Presideht has always Just like we go to church or to a mosque and readeither the Bible or the Quran  Both those books have never changed. If youlook at them, they are the same; the y have never been amended. His Excellency the President has had the opportunity to tell Kenyans, for over 12 years, that we must have peace because without peace we can achieve nothing. Recently that peace nearly got eroded by our own people. As I stand in this House, perhaps many people do not know that I am a very sad man. Those who know will sympathise with me because the tragedy of the death of the late hon. Dr. Ouko happened to have happened in my own constituency. The late Dr. Ouko lived in my constituency and, therefore, I should, and indeed I am, the saddest man here. My constituents were really saddened by the horrible death of Dr. Ouko. May I take this opportunity to ask Kenyans to please leave us alone. Let Kenyans not create rumours in Muhoroni Constituency. We are not interested in rumours in Muhoroni; we are interested in knowing who murdered Dr. Ouko. We do not want people to come to Muhoroni to tell us what we should do and what we should not do. We are mature enough. We are not political novices in this country.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have been in this House for quite some time and, during that period,, things have happened. We do not want, and I repeat, we do not want, any godfatheirs in Muhoroni Constituency. We do not want mouth¬pieces nor do we want amplifiers in that area. We do not want people speaking for our people because they think that our people are not capable of speakingfor themselves. I have never known, and the history of this country is very clear,of a situation where my people in Kisumu District and Nyanza Province in general actedlike political novices; they are mature enough to know exactly what to do andwhen to do it. Rumours have had it that many people have spent their money inKisumu District trying to create rumous in order to incite our people.Sir, it has been like the story of the hare and the spider. As it goes, the hare wanted to go and marry somewhere up in the air, and he had to use the spider who had the means of going up. The hare told the spider, "When we get up there, we will be: received by our hosts. If they offer anything in the name of the visitor, that will be mine. If they offer anything in the name of son-in-law that will be yours” of course, the hare knew that all the time the hosts would not address the in-laws but the visitors. We do not want that type of cheap tricks in Kisuam District.. We know where Kenya is and we know those who would like to use the opportunity to make our people gullible to things we can read through. Fortunately, the people of this country are far too intelligent, especially the children. Today, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if you went to a primary school and pose of a question to the children there, they would give you an answer that would shock you. So, we know exactly what we want to do and therefore, we do not want anybody to tell us what we ought to do.  We in Luoland want this country to be a united country, where, if anybody commits a crime, he is dealt, with in accordance with the law that is passed in this House. we do not want godfathers or amplifiers in the Luoland, and therefore, those who are postering us should leave us alone to handle the problem. If a mistake was done, we are not going to condone it. we have never condoned mistakes in the past and we are not going to start now. we are prepared to die for the truth. So, if something is wrong, we are going to say it is wrong as we have done many times in the past when some¬thing wrong is done.Therefore, it is very wrong, M. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for anybody to think that our people do not know what is going on. So, I would like to appeal to everybody through; this August House, to try and help us. We in the Luoland, particularly in my Constituency, are very sad people. In fact, we are the saddest people in this country today but we are waiting very anxiously for the outcome of the investigations. If too many rumours continue circulating, then nothing will be solved by these rumours. This is because these rumours will then divert some of the attention that ought really to be concentrated on these investigations which are currently being undertaken to find, out the truth. Therefore, nobody should say that we in the Luoland are like this or that because this is not the crux of the matter.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to remindthis House that sane of these rumour mongers are Jobless people. Unemployment hasbecome a major problem in this country and we must now do something collectively theto assist the jobless Kenyans to get something to do. We must do something now to reduce this problem of unemployment in the country, we must strive to make sure that all the young boys and girls who leave school have something to do. I would like to take this opportunity to advise those school leavers who will be lucky enough to get something to do, to do it diligently. One of the problems with our young people today is that they are too choosy. I have personally travelled to nearly every part of the world, and I have not seen better workers than the Chinese, the Japanese, the Taiwanese/ the Koreans, Why do we not work deligently like these people? Too much office work has ruined our people. Thereis no job that can be done without using hands, even if it is an office job. We must be prepared to dirty our hands to make this country what we would like it to be. We want to make this country a place where everybody is given an equal opportunity. Employment opportunities are available in this country if only our young boys and girls would be prepared to dirty their hands.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other problem that we have in this country is that there are far too many speakers. We speak too much in this country and do very little. From now onwards, let us speak less do more. With those few remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MB. WABUGE: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to join my hon. colleagues who have spoken before, in thanking His Excellency the President for his Presidential Address from the Chair on the 13th of Marcho.The Presidential Address is self-explanatory and after looking through it, one would say that it was formulated by a very intelligent leader who is committed to his country. It is true that the tireless activities of His Excellency the President, have uplifted the standard of living of the people of this country. When one considers the type of development that this country has achieved since Independence, one would be right in saying that Kenya has achieved this height in development as a result of peace and stability in this country. In fact, Kenya has done very well politically, economically and socially since Independence.However, Mr. Deputy Speaker, there is one point which, we as leaders, must consider very seriously with regard to our responsibility. Our main respon¬sibility is to assist His Excellency the President in his endeavours to serve this nation. Our President has done a lot for this country and we should assist himin all ways possible. Today, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if you considered development in other Africancountry, you would come to a conclusion that Kenya has done the best in herdevelopment. However, we as leaders should not forget what has brought aboutthis development. We all know that the peace stability that we have inthis country has enabled us to be where we are in our development. Above all,we have the President who has been preaching peace day and night. However,there are people who think peace is something that one can buy or make for oneself overnight, but this is not the case. We have to sacrifice ourselves toachieve and maintain this peace. We have to stand by the President and be countedwith him in all his efforts to develop this country, be it during a time of peace or a time of crisis. We must stand together at all times for the sake of peace and stability.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there  are very many countries in the world today who are trying to make peace, but they have failed. However, since we have succeeded in achieving peace and stability in this country, we have a lot of enemies. Some of these enemies are within the Continent of Africa whileothers are outside the Continent. We also know that some of these enemies arewithin our country and These people are being used to propagate rumours and totalk ill about Kenyan’s human rights record. These people should rember very well thatwhen our President took over the leadership of this country, he releasedall the political detainees and our country gained a lot of praise internationally.However, this did not make these enemies of Kenya happy and they had to find otherways of discrediting Kenya. Some of these enemies creat situations which warrant	them to be locked in so that they can then say that Kenya is violating human rights.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in order to continue with our peace and stability,we must remain united. I am glad that the Kenya Government has stood firm andremained united at all times. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President has stood firm and we should all support him so that we can continue the way we are to the year 2000 and beyond. There are many landless  people in my constituency. Now will they get land unless there is peace and stability? We Kenyans must ensure that there is peace stability so that the Government can be able to settle the so-called landless people.Because of peace and stability, Kemri has improved on its research a great deal. I am glad that we are the first country in the world that has discovered a drug that can treat Aids to a certain extent. We are a young country and we must be proud ofit. Kenya has also made a new car. All these achievements have been due to the peace that is prevailing in the country. I am sure that if this peace prevails, we will continue to discover so many things that are needed in this country.I am saying this because with peace, we will be able to fight unemployment. The rate of unemployment is going up every day. The Government needs a peaceful atmosphere in order to be able to fight unemployment which is becoming a cancer to this country.We will not get anywhere if we have a few disgruntled elements in this country.After a recent tragedy which befell the country, the President spoke very strongly against those who took advantage of the situation to spread rumours. Those people have failed miserably and I pray that they continue doing so. For example, those people who said that it was just a passing cloud when President Moi took over the leadership of this country.  have remained to see the passing cloud as a  clear sky and the President has continued to lead us majestically like other leaders in the world. There are people who are saying that this country does not respect human rights. I would like to say that if some lawyers become presidents of this country, they will be the first ones to lock in  people. For example, if I become the president of this country, I will want my country to have peace and to develop and if anybody plays around with the peace, I will lock him in and the Government will continue running. It is as simple as that.when a law was enacted in this House with regard to detention preservation of law and order, the very people who are now shouting on top of their voices, never said anything. His Excellency the President wants people to go about their duties in peace without detention.We have so many things that needs to be done in this country.. The economy of some countries is not comparable to that of Kesya; Kenya is doing well. We have our  own problems and we can sit together and see how best we can go about them. The people who are in the Government should be a in a position, to take decisions I see we are facing a problem here. Those in the Government are not making decisions and the only section that is doing so, is the provincial administration. Be it a bad or a good decision at least they try.	With these few remarks, I support. MR. KILIKU Bw. Kaibu Spika, kwanza ningependa kuapongeza. Mtukufu Rais  kwa So tuba yake aliyotoa hapa Bungeni. Kabla sijaendelea na maoni yangu juu ya Motuba hiyo, ningependa kusesa kwaaba nchi hii ilimpoteza mtu ambaye alikuwa na niaarifa kaaili katika mambo ya Serikali, ubalozi na siasa. Karehemu Ifct. Ouko alikuwa mtu ambaye aliifahaau kazi yake. Kifo chake kiliwatia watu wengi wasiwasi kwa sababu hakuiia na aakosa kaaa vile kuteta na watu. Sitasema mengi kuhusu jambo hili kwa sababu Serikali iaehakikisha kwamba itafanya jusdu kuona kwamba vale ambao waliauua Dtk. Ouko wamepatikana. Tunangojea kwa hamu kujua ni nani alifanya hivyo. Tk~i wa wale walionuua Dkt. Ouko hawatapakikana, oasi wanasiasa wataishi kwa uoga kwa sababu hawajui ni nani atauawa tonr Ikiua wale a waliomuua Dkt. Ouko watapatikana, oasi vasiwasi utakwisha. Sakuna haja ya uvuai wowote kwa sababu Serikali iaehakikisha kwamba ukweli utapatikana.Hivi karibuni tutajadili juu ya Ilswada unaowahusu wafanyakazi na nitakuwa nje ya nidhamu. ikiwa nitazungumsa kuhusu Mswada ambao haujawasilishwa Bungeni.(Mr. Deputy Speaker left the Chair)(The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Wabuge) took the Chair) Nashukuru kwa sababu Makamu wa Hais na vfaziri wa Pedha ambaye anasimaaiia uchumi wetu yuko hapa.Hi lazima ajue kwamba. mghahara imebato. pale pale, bei ,za bidhaa zixneparida.na hali ya maisha. iko juu sana.

Mishahara siku hizi </Newspeech> <Newspeech> THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR FINANCE (Prof Saitoti):On a point of information, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I would like todraw the attention of the hon. Member to the fact that the Annual Budgetof the Government basically states the expenditure programme of theGovernment and the manner in which it is financed. In the Budgetswhich are normally presented here, we usually never go to the extentof increasing the prices of essential commodities. This has always been the case. It is, therefore, misleading to say that the Budget has lost meaning. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech> MR. KILIKU: Ninakubaliana na Makamu wa Rais na Waziri waFedha lakini ningependa kusema kwaaoa Bajeti hupangwa kulingana naaapato ambayt Serikali inakusudia kukusanya. Ajabu ni kwamba tunaisifuBajeti inayosomwa kwa sababu bei za bidhaa haziongezwi papo hapo.Tunalalamika kwa sababu baada ya siku chache. bei za bidhaa zi.naa.nza	knongezwa.

Ningependa kunrwomba Makamn wa Rais na Waziri wa Fed,ha anaki kishe kwamba Bajeti inayospmwa iJeae vivyo hivyo kwa niwaka mmoja na bei za bidhaa cic^ona&gwe hapa ha pale. Sasa mishahara hailingani na hali ya mai.sha na wafanyakazi wanalia. Hata Wabunge hapa wanalia juu ya hali ya maisha. </Newspeech><Newspeech> THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR FINANCE (Prof. Saitoti):On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it inorder for the hon.Member to keep on relating the Budget with theexpenditure pattern? The rise of prices, Sir,  I doagree that there has been a rise in the cost of living  is entirelya different issue. I would like to explain here. For example, thehon. Member knows very well that Kenya does not produce oil.  Oilprices have gone a up internationally. It used to cost about seven dollars per barrel.  I believe that the hon. Member is informed and he has been able to keep in touch with the trends of oil prices. As the oil prices go up, we. have no alternative but to follow suit.The price of coffee has come down and we have no control over that area. The issue of the Budget is entirely different and it should not be confused in this House with, the cost of living, we can deal with the issue of salaries and the impact of prices separately but we should not try to mix the two issues. </Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR. KILIKU: Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda. Nitaongea wazi wazi juu ya jambo hili baadaye kwa sababu tuna  viwanda hapa nchini. Kwa wakati huu ninamuomba Makamu wa Rais na Wiziri wa Fedha atusaidie ili wafanyakazi waongezwe mishahara. kwa sababu wafanyakazi wa Changamwe, ninakotoka, ambalo ni eneo lenye viwanda, wanataabika sana.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, Mtukufu Hais alisema wazi wazi hapa kwamba 3h.ugh.uli za Bunge haziwezi kuendeshwa vyema ikiwa hakuna Wabunge wa kutoaha. Mwaka jana tulikuwa na matatizo mengi ya	na vfabunge wa kutosha katika Bunge hili. Jambo hilihuwafanya Wabunge kurudia mambo ambayo tayari yamezungumziwa a" tfabunge wengine." Ninakiomba Siti sasa lo haviki she kwamba Mbunge akltoka katika Bunge hili na baadaye arudi na kuanza kurudia mambo ambayo tayari yamezungumziwa na Wabunge wengine kama 2±" anayevunja ITanuni zetu za Bunge. Eii ni kwa' sababu tumechaguliwa kukaa katika Bunge hili hadi saa kumi na mbili ss unusu za jioni. lakini. utaona Wabunge wengine wanatoka katika Bunge hili baada wakati. wa Maswali." Inafaa tuwatambue wabunge watakaoitilia. manaani Hotuba hii ya Mtukufu Hais na frsrg kukaa katika Bunge hili wakati wa majadiliano juuya Hotuba hii. wrPann mwingine ni siku" za JumatanOj kama Issho ambapo Mawaziri hawafiki mapema xk ili kujibu Maswali. Ningetaka kesho Mawaziri. wawe hapa saa tatu za asubuhi na wahe shimiwa Y7abunge nao wawe hapa ili kuuliza jiaswali yao. Tnafaa tuamue tutakachofanya mhe Mbunge akichelewa kuuliza Swali lake au TCaziri akichelewa kulijibu. Tusipofanya.hivyo, tutakuwa. tukienda klnyume cha yale Hais alisema. 	Ingawa wakati wangu. ulichukuliwa na Makamu wa Hais naKisiri wa Fediaa aliponieleza machache kuhusu Bajeti, ningetaka kumalizia kwa kugusia yale Mtukufu Hais alisema kuhusu Harambee. Hakuna haja ya mali vya watu va kwa nguvu na machifu. kwa sababu ya Karaaftpft Harambee; inafaa sasa tuirekebishesheria inayowapa maciilfu  uwezo. Tunataka michango ya Harambeeitolewe kwa hiari ya mtu na kulingana na uwezo wake. Hii ni	kwa sababu watu hawana uwezo aar sawa wa raapato.Ingawa Waziri wa Elimu ameondoka hapa, ningetakakumweleza kwamba kuna ufisadi katika elimu.Hii ni kwa sababuwazazi wananunua .vitabu vya kusoma kila wakati kwa sababuvinabadilishwa kila nrwaka. Hii inaonyesha kuna watu katikaWizara ya Elinru ambao wanafanya biashara ya vitabu. Pi mpaka leo Waziri hajatueleza katika mfumo wa elimu wa 8-4-4 niwanafunzi gani wanachukuliwa kama waliopita; hat a hatujui ni ganiwanafunzi gani watakaoingia katika vyuo vikuu. Wazazi wengi wanatujiana matokeo ya watoto wao na kutuuliza  wamepita kwa kiwango ganiKwa. hivyo, tunataka TCaziri atufafanulie ili tujue mtoto akipitakwa kiwango fulani anaweza kupata kosi ya aina fulani.Kwa hayo machache naunga mkono. </Newspeech>	THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT(Mr.Nabwera):. Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my colleagues in paying tribute to his Excellency the President for his Address in exposition of public policy. I want to say that time has come for all of us in this House and country to take a stand as a matter of principle and say that we support the  President fully so that both our friends and enemies can get it from here loud and clear. Ever since the President took over the leadership of this country 11 years ago he has done so much for this country that I am sure even his successors will find it difficult to break his record in double that time. President Moi has not spared his efforts to establish isnational unity which is based on both philosophy and action. He has ensured that every corner and ethnic group has received its fair share, be it in the distribution of ministerial posts or other posts. However, there are some people who will never get satisfied. It does nof matter what the President does for them; it does not matter how many Ministerial or senior posts a particular ethnic group has been given; it does not matter how much power or responsibility they have been given, they will always feel dissatisfied.</Newspeech><HEADER>QUORUM</HEADER><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. While the hon.

You may now continue, Mr. Nabwera.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Nabwera): Thank you Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Just before I was interrupted, I was saying that we allowed let our friends and enemies hear it from this House loud and clear that our President has done everything in his power, in terms of fairness, in terms of distribution of senior posts including Ministerial posts. Sir, there are some people in this country it does not matter what the President does for them, for how many Ministerial posts go to them, or how many senior Government posts go to them they will never get satisfied. If They just want that one post but unfortunately, we are a constitutional people. That one post was held by Mzee Jomo Kenyatta after we got our Independence. Still, that post is not vacant and today this held by His Excellency President Moi.(applause) Sir, an overwhelming majority of Kenyans have got confidence,, and will continue to have confidence in the President, of this Republic, His Excellency-Daniel Toroitich arap Moi. That is where we are, Sir. Why do we support the President? It is because he has brought' national unity. We support him because he goes out of his way, 24 hours each day to work for the welfare of the weak people in Kenya. It was only last Saturday when the President, through his own initiative held a Harambee meeting to help the children of the poor people. That Harambee meeting realised a records of Kshs.142 million. When the weak people, the blind, the disabled and the children suffer, till they out President Moi also suffers. We support him for his humanity.Sir, those people who think otherwise should know that they are faced by millions of Kenyans who stand to be counted with President Moi.(applause)Sir, those people should leave us in peace. Sir, under his eadership, we want to continue developing Kenya, let them not ivert our attention by rumour mongering. Is there anybody in this country who can believe that the Government of President Moi, who is a God fearing President, the lover of children and the lover of humanity could be a party to the killing of one of the most able sons of this Republic, Dr. Robert Ouko?</Newpseech><Newpseech>HON. MEMBERS: No! No!</Newpseech><Newpseech>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr.. Nabwera): Sir, there are some cowards who do not want, to speak in broad daylight. They go round all the bars and strange hotels spreading stupid and obnoxious rumours.Sir, those people are irrelevant to Kenyas development. We shall remain united as Kenyans, Kenyans of all tribes. The right thinking Kenyans shall remain united. Time has come when the President in his magnanimity, if he finds that, Mr. Nabwera is an obstacle, and he is a member of his Cabinet, he should be set aside a little bit so that the Government can be clean.(applause)Sir, there is no way that I can continue to be a member of the Cabinet of His Excellency President Moi, if I am not a team player, if I do not contribute to collective responsibility. To be a Minister, it means that I must be loyal to the PresidentI must be loyal to this Republic, to the ruling Party Kanu and I must also contribute to collective responsibility. Sir, it is important for us to;do that if we want Kenya to develop. Kenya is developing very fast. Sir we are going through some economic difficulties, but we are weathering them very well.Sir, we are one of the few countries in the world that can feed itself. Kenya has got plenty of food. In terms of economic development, we are doing very well considering the difficulties that are facing the international community. We must continue to remain together. We must isolate the doubting Thomases. Even if somebody belongs to your ethnic group, and he is an enemy of this country, he must be isolated. He is a cancer to the body policies. Kenya cannot continue with such people. We say that we have maintain human rights in Kenya because everybody in this House and in this country is free to speak their minds. My friend, the hon. Member for Changamwe, has just been contributing. He spoke with complete freedom therefore, I do not know the kind of freedom that the foreigners would like to see in Kenya. I do not know what want freedom they want, we have freedom We choose tiny this House to be a one party system, and we shall continue to be a one party system until tribalism in Kenya has ended and until the peoples of Kenya feel that they want to have other groups other than tribes. Once we have tribes as a dominant factory a multiparty system means an alliance of tribes, one group against another group. That means that those people would want us to continue fighting the way some other people do. The Nyayo Philosophy means that whatever little we have in kenya is distributed to all Kenyans. We like that system. Even the smallest ethnic group is enjoying today because.it has some posts in the Government.With those few remarks, Sir, I beg to support.President Moi also suffers. We support him for his humanity.Sir, those people who think otherwise, should know that they are faced by millions of Kenyans who stand to be counted with President Moi.(applause)Sir, those people should leave us in peace. Sir, under hisleadership, we want to continue developing Kenya, let them notdivert our attention by rumour mongering. Is there anybody in this country who can believe that the Government of President Moi, who is a God fearing President, the lover of children and the lover of humanity, could be a party to the killing of one of the most able sons of this Republic, Dr. Robert Ouko?</Newspreech><Newspreech>HON.

We shall remain united as Kenyans," Kenyans of all" tribes. The right thinking Kenyans shall remain united. Time has come which even the President in his magnanimity, if he finds that Mr. Nabwera is an obstacle, and he is a member of his Cabinet, we	should be setaside a little bit so that the Government can be clean. (applause)Sir, there is no way that I can continue to be a member of the Cabinet of His Excellency President Moi, if I am not a team player, if I do not as contribute to collective responsibility. To be a Minister, it means that I must be loyal to the President <Newspeech>MR KIRWA: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to contribute to this very important Motion.Sir, His Excellency the President has been very clear in his mind as to what Kenya needs. He talked oof very important factors, but he  stressed! that we must be vigilant against our detractors That is an issue that we should collectively look at, whether we are at the Front Bench or at the Back Bench. I say so because during the last Session, a lot of time was spent in discussing the merits or demerits of either an hon. Member from the Back Bench or the Front Bench. We should all realise that when we are in this House, we are here for Kenya, and whatever we say, be it from the Back Bench or from the Front Bench, we are saying it for our country.Sir, the other issue which His Excellency the Presidenttouched, on is for us to uphold the truth at all times. It is very important that we as hon. Members of this House, tell Kenyans the truth Regardless of how bitter it is. In line with that, Sir, there is the just concluded results of the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education which, many Kenyans feel were below standards. The question that they are asking themselves is thai; where did we go wrong, is it the candidates who decided to develop some inferiority complex in terms of academic standards, or is it the. calibre of teachers or the lack equipment or the people who were supervising that particular kind of course?Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir, the blame lies some¬where in the air but we as leaders must be truthful. We must tell this nation the truth about the whole thing. Many of my colleagues here have talked about textbooks. It is pathetic to find that every year a Circular comes from the Ministry's Headquarters directing head teachers in various primary schools and secondary schools to buy particular textbooks. These people are fully aware that we have been struggling to provide the necessary facilities in order to make the 8-4-4 system of education a reality. But these people have the audacity to keep on telling us to buy different textbooks every year. It is unfortunate that there is nobody from the Ministry of Education in this House as I speak now.: They should be clear in their minds as to whether we are going to use a certain. set of books for a specific period of time. If it is a four-year course, we must know which books we are going to use in Eiology, Mathematics Geography or any other subject. The question of having to buy textbooks every year is a- great burden, that has been - placed on. parents It is not economically viable at a±±£ all for us to duplicate the same textbook, in Form-I,Form II Form III and so on.	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, any right thinking Kenyan can arrive at the conclusion that there is some collusion between the Ministry's officials, the publishers and the authors of these textbooks I say this because when you look at the subject content of some of these textbooks you will find that the difference is only on the cover and some minor alterations that have been done. Yet the book is now going to be recommended and that one of the previous year has been changed. The Ministry must look into this particular aspect for us to prosper as a country. We cannot blame the teachers.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry must tell us the truths A few days ago they told us that we cannot categorise schools as good or bad and that we cannot have a best or top students. But I think we must always have a the best school and the top students We cannot mislead the public We must speak clearly on this issue. If so many students have passed the examinations we must also be very clear as regards the University entry points. We must not leave the public guessing about these entry points to the universities and other colleges. When we leave it to them to guess then we are creating a lot of loopholes. I say this because it has been known that some people who do not mean the  minimum entry qualifications to the universities find their way into those universities. So, the Ministry should seal these loopholes;, if it is a C+ that is going to give adjustment regarding how many people are going to university it must be clear, in the eyes of the public. I say this because parents are very anxious to know whether their children are going to the universities, or not. So, the Ministry should look into this matter instead of just tossing the coin around saying You. may possibly go to the university or adiploma college. These issues must be very clear if.we have to support the President. When the Ministry was releasing the examination results they talked about a mean score of 31. This is a very poor performance whatever the system of education one is talking about. So, we must know what we are going to do in order to make sure that the students get the subject matter.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, to give another example to support my views, when I was in the field as a teacher, it was very interesting that people would come from the Ministry's Headquarters to discuss certain issues with teachers out they would always tell the teachers, "We do not know; those people at the Headquarters know." So, you will find that when these officers tell the teachers that they do not know what is to be done then a problem is created. This issue must be looked into. If these people have nothing to tell teachers then there is no need of holding seminars with teachers. They must come armed with the correct information and pass it on to the teachers because the teachers are the implementors of the 8-4-4 system of education. Therefore we must tell them what is supposed to be done. The feedback from the teachers must be taken seriously by the Ministry. It appears that for last four years, the Ministry has not taken cognizance of the problems facing teachers in the field. That, is why the system was. almost a flop. We must look into these things. The Kenya National Examinations Council must also be careful. They have to check these things; they do not have only to examine the students. The students must be examined according to the depth of the subject matter. The Council, should have sent papers in order to get feedback from ± various schools.- That would help them to gauge whether the students have got the subject matter or not.' It is not good to set an examination and then throw it to the students and get very poor results and then say that the system has failed. This is something which could be described as sabotage. If there are people who are employed to safeguard against these things, what have they been doing? As leaders, we must address ourselves fully to this issue.With those remarks, I support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEWA: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute on the Presidential Speech. Our President is a great man; he is a man who believes that for a nation like us, the greatest resource which make us a great nation are our people. We therefore have no choice but to assist His Excellency the President in mobilising the people to maintain peace and unity in this country. Our President reminds me of great people like the Biblical Moses who told his people "Jump on your camels and follow me and I will, show you the Promised land". Also 5,000 years after Moses there was another great man by the name of Mr. Franklin Roosevelt who told his people "Get down from your camels, hold your shovels and axes for this is a promised land and we have to develop it."For the last 12 years, our President has been telling us that there is no other country that belongs to us; this is our country. I do not see why any patriotic Kenyan cannot heed those words from a wise man, and work hard in order to develop this great nation of ours. There is no other promised land for Kenyans; this is our land. Our President tells us day and night that every patriotic Kenyans should be devoted; talk very little, but think very hard and mobilise the people in order to make this country a great nation.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we, if united, can do wonders. The Americans did wonders by going to the moon. There are other people who, in this century, have made tremendous discoveries in the line of new medicines, particularly after the Second World War. We, in Kenya, have done wonders, also. The Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) was started during, the Nyayo Era. That is another achievement on the part of His Excellency the President and I can assure you, from my humble experience as a scientist, that it takes great minds to set up an institution like Kemri, which costs, a lot of money. Research is expensive and it can only be done where there is peace. It also took a-lot off money to put together the scientists who worked so hard to come up with Kemron. No other company or Government in the world could make it. We now have an opportunity to make a name for ourselves by ensuring that the product as commercially available so that we can earn our royalties, if necessary that is if we cannot make the product in this country. What is important is that we have made a landmark in the discovery of such an important product.As I said, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the greatest resource our country has is its people. The people, therefore, have to be healthy. The Ministry of Health has shown, for many years, that for one reason or the other, they just cannot get to grips with the tendering policies. If you read the current issue of The Industrial Review you will find that it talks about yet another drug scandal which has gone on quietly without many people noticing. One wonders for how long we shall have to sit back and see the Ministry of Health buy medicines, plasters and other items at 10 times more than they could buy them elsewhere. It is, indeed a pity that such tenders are not published for the public, particularly the interested parties, to see and be able to compare as to whether they are within reach of the supplier who won the tender or not. There is a lot of secrecy involved, and there is no need of that. Most, would-be tenderers pay money for the tender documents, and I think it is only fair that such tenders are made public for fair competition. The Tender Committee of the Nairobi City Commission does exactly that and experience has shown, that this method reduces corruption.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, while I continue to talk on professional standards, I appreciate that a Government, has to take, care of the various cadres of technicians, be they engineers, clinical officers or pharmaceutical technologists, but we have to be,very cautious,at least we open the flood gates for too many people, and by so doing throwing professionalism down the drain. It is very disappointing to learn, as we sit here today, that there are some herbalists who call themselves professors and doctors. Professionalism is something that needs to be guarded, and as I said, while I appreciate that we have to take care of our technicians, we have to be very careful lest we open the flood gates and we are not able to control the situation.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, at the moment, on behalf of the people of Bahari Constituency, I am not a very happy man. This is because the money-earner of our people there the Kilifi Kenya Cashewnut Factory is being restructured. This means that about 2,000 employees of the factory are away on a three-months* unpaid leave. But I am confident that the Government is looking at the situation very seriously by way of instructing this factory. I just wanted to take this opportunity to urge that a speedy solution is arrived at because 2,000 workers mean 10,000 mouths to feed. It is, therefore, very sad to just sit down and anxiously wait to know, what is going to happen to these 2,000 employees. It would be better for the people of Kilifi and the nation as a whole to know the results soon enough.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, our President is a great man. He has assisted us to build what is our Kenya today. I just want to remind hon. Members that it is so difficult to build but so easy to destroy. We all have a duty to ensure that what we have built over the years remains intact, and is improved on, but not destroyed.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Dr. Onyonka): Thank you Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. I would also like to make some remarks on the Presidential Address which was delivered by His Excellency the President on the occasion, of the State Opening of the Third Session of the Sixth Parliament.I would like to take this opportunity to thank His Excellency the President, for having highlighted some important matters that are of vital importance to the welfare of the people of this country.To start with, I would, very briefly, like to refer to the question of the Harambee movement. This country has made a lot of progress, among other things, because of the tremendous contribution from the Harambee movement. In fact, the Harambee movement has provided a very important source of additional savings for investment in trying to develop our country.I do not have to emphasise the point that is well, known to hon. Members that out of about 3,000 secondary schools in this country, nearly two-thirds were built on Harambee basis. The same can be said about primary schools, dispensaries and health centres. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the important point that His Excellency the President made relates to the fact that, in some areas at certain times we have, had this problem of people being forced to contribute specially in cases where the donors are not given any receipts at all to indicate that they have made such a contribution. I personally appreciate the fact that His Excellency the President highlighted this point, that if we were to continue collecting funds from particularly the poor without giving them any receipts to show that they have made the contribution, it virtually amounts to some form of robbery. Although it is without violence^ is still, unfair. So we should thank him for highlighting this important, point.The other aspect that I would like to. touch on relates to the question of the 8-4-4 system of education. Speaking as a former Minister for Education and to some extent given my present interests, I know something about educational reforms. What we are going through, if I may be allowed to say so by the august House, are what we would call the birth gangs of a transition from one educational system to another. Anyone familiar with some of the changes in education that are being introduced in many countries. including European countries.(noise)Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I can hardly addressthe House with the present noise ^ the other side!</Newswpeech><Newswpeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Order! Order, hon. Members! Could we have some silence please?</Newswpeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Dr. Onyonka): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am perfectly aware that the Nandis are very close to the Muhoroni/chemilil Belt! This House is not opposed to some consultation taking place, but there is a need to bear in mind that there are other neighbour, too who would also like some silence in order to consult each other.(applause)Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I happened to have been in Britain two years ago when there was this on-going debate on the change over that was taking place in the secondary education system. I would like to say that the sort of debates that went on there are hardly any different from what we are witnessing in this country. The Government is not saying that there is no need to change anything; it is an experiment which in my opinion is very constructive where naturally; we expect to have some of the problems of transition in the shorter term. In the longer term we expect that there is need to re-look and re-examine to see. where things have not worked out as originally anticipated and planned. We know that this is a practical; problem that in practice we often work out things on paper but when trying to implement them welcome to realise that there are shortcomings elements and factors that need to be sorted out to realise the objectives of the change. I would say that the 8-4-4 system of education introduced a change that was long overdue in our country's educational system. But our having some of these transitional problems should not discourage us. The important thing, I think, is to be positive and to look forward to introducing the, sort of modifications that we consider necessary for this transition to become effective and useful in the longer term.It would be a mistake for us to behave as if the whole thing is a disaster. I do not think that is the best way to behave.I am hopeful and I believe that this House is also hopeful that what is required is to re-look and re-examine the whole thing and find out where we need to pull up our socks in order to initiate the sort of changes which we all seem to agree a need to be made in order for the system to work. In fact, those of us who were involved, in the planning exercise know that it was really remarkable that we have gone as far as we have. So the basics and the foundation are there; but there are shortcomings. It wouldbe foolhardy for anyone to say that there are none. If you come from a rural constituency,as I do, you will realise that there are problems. I entirely agree with what hon. Kirwa said that those who are involved in the actual teaching know that certain things are not feasible. So these are the sort of things that we need to look at in the medium term to see what needs to be done.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to briefly turn to the common theme of stability and unity. I have rather an unfortunate experience of having to say that this is a situation where things have gone out of order. I wish to take this opportunity to tell the hon. Members that if they have ever had an opportunity as I have had of facing, a disorderly and rowdy crowd that is totally out of control, they will realise that it is virtually important for us to keep law and order. So it is very easy and apparent for people to get excited, jump around and throw stones; but once that situation gets out of control,, nobody is in charge. The consequences could be disastrous and many disastrous events in history have started out with very very minor incidents initially. These have built up to national disasters. Sometimes one gets the impression that it is only His Excellency the President who is concerned about the peace and the need to have unity in this country. It is our collective responsibility irrespective of who we are. In the absence of that unity, understanding and trust, all these things about development become impossible. History is rich with such examples. We have an example of a country that is not very far from here. Once one gets derailed it might take decades to get back on the rails. In fact, one might never get back there. The cost in the longer term in terms of loss of human life and suffering is incredible. Sometime  we behave as if these implications do not amount to much. I would like to suggest to hon. Members that once they have time to spare they should go back and re-read history and see what has happened.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the most importantthing is that this country is not just for His Excellency the President. He is a man who at this particular moment is carrying the sort of burden that most of us are incapable of carrying. I can speak, about this with a certain amount, of confidence because I have been a Minister for the past 20 years in this country which means that. I know what I am talking, about I lived under the late President Mzee Jomo Kenyatta who made me a Minister at the age of 27 years. So I would like to say that unity is for all of us and it is crucial that we speak together in one voice.I support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR RESEARCH, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (Dr. Oluoch): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chance to contribute to this important Motion. In doing so, I would like to raise only four points.The first point is to congratulate the Head of State, His Excellency the President, for giving us a very good Presidential andris full of words of wisdom and advice to this House. The adress highlighted very important points for example, the fact that nothing can be done without peace. Peace is the basis for development, and without peace, there is nothing that can be done. This came out very clearly in the Presidential Address.In the address also we were reminded that unity is fundamental to development in this country and anywhere else in the world. Whatever we do, we must ensure that unity prevails. Also, in the Presidential address, we were reminded, that development must" bring about improvement in the welfare of the ordinary; mwananchi. Develop¬ment cannot take place it is meaningless if it does not affect the lives of the ordinary wananchi.In the address, we were also reminded of the tight time-table that lies ahead of this Session. We were informed that there would be many Bills to be debated many Acts of Parliament to be looked at again and one of them is the Pensions (Increase) (Amendment) Bill which has come, before us to look at it again. This is a very important exercise because unfortunately, many people in have not learned how to spend their retirement time well. Many of us are. not prepared for retirement life, not prepared in material sense and also not prepared in	psychological sense. So, it will be very important for us to take a look at that Bill.My second point, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, is that I would like to associate myself with all that my colleagues have said about the late Dr. Ouko. I am one of the few people who have had the pleasure of working. under the late hon. Dr. Ouko. I worked under him when I was in the Ministry of Economic Planning and he ably and very successfully guided us, For example, to produce the first comprehensive and successful National Manpower Development Plan. The surveys had been done many times but none of them had succeeded until the one that was directed by the late Dr.Ouko. The report of that survey is now available from the Government Printer and also  through; the Ministry of Manpower Develop¬ment and Employment. That survey was successful and the Council is able now to tell how many kinds of people are wanted and in what kind of field today, tomorrow, five years or ten years from now. It is an exercise that had. been tried many times but had failed, and had to wait for the skillful hands of the late Dr. Ouko for to succeed. All we can do is to pray to God to place his soul in the right place in Heaven. would also like to appeal to the murders or killers to come out and confess before the public and also before God. Even if they do not come out in public willingly, I am sure that the long arm of the law will take them. They will be apprehended and be dealt with accordingly. But it would be very good and helpful if they were to come out from hiding and confess before the public and also before God. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, my third point is again about the 8-4-4 programme of education. The 8-4-4 programme has a lot of "beatings" since the poor outcome of the Forn IV examination of last year Many people now say that the subjects are too many. They say that we should reduce the number of subjects by letting the pupils selectout of the range of the subjects being offered in the 8-4-4- programmeHow do you make a selection if you are not exposed to all the varieties that exist? You, will have to know everything so that you can make a selection. A selection cannot be made if you do not know what you are selecting from, and it is for this reason that we need to expose the children to a wide curriculum of a whole range of subjects, practical, theoretical and so on so that when a child goes to higher levels of education he can then make intelligent choices.We have seen many situations where students have sufferedbecause they were made to choose subjects which, they have neverhad anything to do with previously. For instance, we have- hadstudents being, asked to do French, Germany, Economics and so on,and in their background they have never come. across any of thesesubjects before.	Let us not throw away the 8-4-4 programme of education because of theimplementation problems. Those problems will always be there.The problems of implementation are always there. But we must understand the call the fundamental principles of the 8-4-4 programThat fundamental principle is the broadness of the curriculumwhich theoretical as well as practical subjects. Let usimplement this programme, look at the problems and solve them asWe go along. But to say that the number of subjects is too large, and that they should be reduced, and purpose to do only a certain number of subjects then that  would be to negate the whole principle on which the 8-4-4 programs is based. This is a national thing.Education and life generally becomes more and more involved, and I cannot see any time when the subjects Will be reduced. The subjects will be increased because of the day in day out knowledge explosion. What we need to do as teachers is to find ways of coordinating the learning activities that we are exposing our children to We must find ways of integrating the learning activities so that we cover as much as possible within the time available. But there is no time ever when we are going to have the number of subjects reduced.Everyday we hear of explosion in population, new discoveries, and so on. As we hear of those new discoveries, we must bring them back into schools so that the child is exposed to all those developments. What we need to do is to integrate and to co-ordinate these learning activities so that we can have the child master all the subjects, and there is no short-cut to this. All we have to do is to struggle to provide the facilities, the necessary back-up that is required, but there is no way we are going to reduce the number of subjects.This programme was a dream of none other than His Excellency the President the number one teacher distinguished educator. I cannot see how we are going to go back in what comes out of the mind of that kind of a teacher among us and educate among us.My fourth point, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, is to send an. S.0.S.message to my friends, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Livestock Development. In Bondo, we have been invaded by that menace called tsetse flies.Tsetse flies have come in big numbers and covered all the area around L. Victoria, and we would like to make an appeal to the Ministers for Livestock Development and Health to come to our aid and help us fight this menace. Our cattle are dying and, I am sure, even human beings are also going to die. I see that the same thing obtains even in Busia. We have also been invaded by army worms,which are wiping out our crops, and I would like to appeal to the Minister for Agriculture to help us to fight these worms. These insects are easy to fight, and we do not see why it should beat, the Government to fight them.With these few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg tosupport.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. JALANG'O: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my colleagues in expressing appreciation for the exposition of public policy contained in the Presidential Address of 13th March, 1990 I was greatly moved by this Address, and especially by the policy issues that were contained in the exposition. These are what we call words of wisdom and guidance. From these policy matters, we will take a clue during this Third Session of the Sixth Parliament. What concerns me most is how seriously we take these policy matters and whether implementors take them seriously. A policy document can be fantastic because it is meant to guide the country; through a particular period of time. Are we going to wait just once more for His Excellency the President to start asking those in authority when this policy is going to be implemented? Does he have to continue to tell Ministry officials to do this and that every now and then? We have collective responsibility, and the person who holds the steering wheel does not have to keep on reminding implementing officers to implement what has already been planned. Sometimes, I feel that something is wrong somewhere. Are we giving His Excellency the President the type of support he needs, or are we just giving him lip service? I hope that time will come, if it has not already come, for implementors not to wait to be reminded to implement policies that have been well defined. They should not wait for the person who has given us these policies to remind them to implement the policies. I am making a very special appeal to implementors to note that once they are given a policy, they should implement it because there is no time for them to wait to be reminded.I was happy that during the fund-raising we had last Saturday His Excellency the President minced no words in saying that time had come for those. people who were not implementing his policies and not following the Philosophy of Nyayo to be careful. His Excellency the President said that if you do not want to follow this Philosophy, you should leave him alone because, he has much younger people who are more committed to running this country the way he wants.I cannot forget to join my colleagues during this very sad time when we continue to mourn the death of the late Dr. Ouko. There are certain projects of his that have been left incomplete. Would not be ideal for the molasses plant in Kisumu, for example, to be revised and called Dr. Ouko Molasses Plant? The ~ late Dr. Ouko worked very hard on this plant. Revising this plant would be one way. of, firstly, creating job opportunities for the local people. Secondly, . this would ensure the production of additional ethanol, which is mised with various grades of gasoline to produce gashol. Would this aspect not be an extra means of reducing the amount of foreign exchange currently being incurred by the Government in the. importation of crude oil. Presently, the country is only using gashol in Nairobi and its environs. An increased production of gashol would, in my opinion reduce our over-reliance on crude oil. The country is spending at least 40 per cent of its foreign exchange earnings to import crude oil. Why are shy in increasing the production of ethanol so that we can increase the usage of gashol. I am making a very special appeal that the molasses plant in Kisumu, in which the Government has invested billions of shillings, to re-open it no matter what went wrong to firstly, create job opportunities and, secondly, reduce our reliance on imported crude oil. If it were my wish, this molasses plant would be used as something through which to remember the late Dr. Ouko.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are very grateful for the work being done by researchers in this country. In the last few months especially, our researchers have done this country proud, particularly in the field of technology and medicine, but I still have one concern. Why has there been so much controversy? Why should certain groups of people be talking about "our input in the discovery of KEMRON", saying, "We had the herbs"? If there is some role that herbalists: played in this discovery, why deny them what is due to them? If, on the other hand, there is no role that herbalists played, why not encourage them in their own line? Why threaten them with deportation, for example? There- was a time I was amused when one of our herbalists was being threatened with deportation. I thought that we were bringing in innovations and technology. Even if the herbalist in question was not a Kenyan national, why threaten him with deportation? Herbalists are doing good to the country just as much as engineers from the university and the Kenya Polytechnic. These latter people have done us good by producing the first ever Nyayo vehicles, and we are proud of them. Even some of these people are not Kenyan nationals, we still welcome them if they have innovations.I do believe that a lot should be done, and we would like to see that co-operation, oneness and togetherness in innovations so that even if it is an innovation from a jua kali artisan, it is encouraged. A jua kali artisan should not be discrimi¬nated against just for the sake of it. He should be encouraged, however crude his tools may be or however crude his ideas may be. A jua kali artisan should be encouraged the same as the herbalist who claims to have cure for Aids. Let those artisans be brought close to the professionals so that they do not seem to be left aside as outcasts.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, one last concern for the ordinary man, I inluded, is the recent increase of prices of basic commodities. It has been too sharp. This sharp, increase in prices started with the decontrol of the prices of some commodities. The. ordinary person today is finding it extremely difficult even to purchase one ki1ograanne of. sugar or half a loaf of bread. I do appreciate the fact, that scene of these things, are connected with, farm inputs like fertilizers, but the increase has been too stiff. I am, therefore, appealing to the Government, especially the Ministry concerned, to ensure that if there are prices increases they should not be too stiff. We would like the price of sugar to be regulated. It should not be KShs-10/- per kilogramme of sugar in one shop and KShs.15 in another shop.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIILU: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me this chance to join my hon. colleagues in supporting this Motion on the Presidential Address. Our President has been, and is always, busy. The speech he gave us in this hon. House was full of advice. It would, therefore, be adviseable to hon. Members in this House to support the President through action and not through mere word of mouth. If every leader in this august House followed the example of the President, this country would develop fast. I have seen cases where the President himself has had to tell the wananchi what should be done instead of the leaders doing that. It is of great importance for Minister, Assistant Minister and we, Back-benchers, to join hands together and assist our President. We are very lucky to have a President who knows what is happening throughout the country. Indeed, it is only recently that he saved a certain woman in Machakos District who had lost her land. How he got that information is really fantastic. Our President goes right to the local people to get proper information about what is going on within the country. We should support him and try to understand some of these things the way he understands them.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we know that the majority of the local people do support the President. Even the Nyayo children support the President. But do the people who know a lot about money people who have benefited a lot in this country support the President? I have travelled to some of our neighbouring countries and I have noticed that there is a lot of mess within those countries. In case there might be some people in those country who would like to create chaos in this country, they, should be seen as enemies of this country. Those people who think they can lead this country better than it is being led at the moment should be told to take time and wait for their turn. They should be told to give our President time to lead the nation. Those who were here in 1982 when the then Kenya Air: Force brought chaos saw what happened. A lot of people suffered and people should have learned a lesson. We know that there are some Kenyans who cannot leave this country in case of trouble, and we know that there are those rich Kenyans who, in case of problems, can easily disappear. If trouble broke out in this country, what would happen to those Kenyans who have not even been to neighbouring countries like Tanzania? What would happen to those people who only know their motherland, which is Kenya? How can somebody buy leader¬ship? Leadership cannot be bought with money; it is something that comes naturally.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, our President, having been in this House longer than any other hon. Member, is very conversant with, the requirements of the wananchi and therefore, the best man to lead, this nation.  We want to ask those rich people who want to bring chaos to bur country to stop doing so and pray that His Excellency the President be added more wisdom by God to lead this nation.Having said that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to request the Government, through the Ministry of Public Works, to do something about the roads in my area. We know that during this time when: the rains are pouring some areas are. inaccessible, and Masinga is no exception. It is very difficult for the residents of Masinga to reach the divisional headquarters because' the road is completely impassable. I do not know why it has taken up to four years to get graders taken, to Masinga. It is funny because whenever we put Questions here1 about the state of roads in Machakos District we are told that the district has only two graders that are operational. How can two graders do the work successfully? We were told that the district had nine graders initially, but seven are out of order. What is the Ministry going to do to assist: us? The Ministry should kindly, look into our plight and see how the people can be assisted. There is a lot of hue and cry from the public requesting the Ministry, through Members of Parliament, to do something about those roads. In fact, it is only the rural access roads that are passable today; those roads under Government maintenance are completely impassable. We know that the Minister for Public Works is very capable, and I want to appeal to him to do something to ensure that the residents of Masinga can get to where their district officer is so that they can be told what to do and what the Government has done for them. That way, they will feel that they are with other Kenyans within, the Republic Having said that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would now like to say something about the Ministry of Health, We have in my Constituency, a health centre called Hasinga Health Centre. Since Hasinga attained the status , of a health-centre, it has not improved at all. We have been complaining about shortage of drugs is this health centre because the amount of drugs that used to he supplied to Masinga when it was a dispensary is the same amount that is being supplied today. Therefore, I am appealing to the Minister for Health to ensure that enough supply of drugs is taken to Masinga because it is too far Health Centre from Machakos District Hospital.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, some time ago, the Ministry of Health promised to supply Masinga Health Centre with an ambulance, but up to this moment,nothing has been done and we still need the service of an ambulance. This promise was made by the Minister when answering a Question that I brought to this House,and I appeal to him to do something to help my people within Masinga. We also request the Minister to consider sending more staff to Masinga Health Centre to improve the service at this health centre. If he does these things our people would be highly appreciative. At the moment, our roads are very had and it becomes very difficult to transport patients to Machakos District Hospital, Therefore, I call upon the Ministry of Health to improve these facilities at Masinga Health Centre so that our people do not continue suffering.	Having said that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch on the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Physical Planning. In my Constituency, there are two sublocatians which have not he adjudicated and I would appeal to the Minister to send surveyors to this areaf so that our people can he given title deeds. These two sub-locations are namely, Kangonde and Kivaa and I hope that the Minister will send a survey team there so that the people in these sub can locations can also have their shambas demarcated and be issued with title deeds. We appreciate the survey work which is currently going on in Karakara.		With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BUJRA: Ahsante sana BW. Naibu.

KIPKORIR: Thank you Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to. contribute to this Motion on the Presidential Address. We must congratulate His Excellency, the President for being far-sighted, especially during the said time of the death of the late. Dr. Robert Ouko. The President ensured that peace was maintained during that trying period. I also wish to thank the Members of Parliament from Nyanza Province for maintaining peace during that time.Every Kenyan should look ahead and foster development. We all appreciate the way in which our economy is being run. But we need to advise our people to co-operate with the Government. This is because our President has a mammoth task of taking care of the 25 million people who make up the population of this country. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to appeal to the Ministers to ensure that they run their Ministries effectively to ensure that this country runs smoothly. When one is appointed is a Minister the President expects him to discharge his duties properly all over the country. There are very many things in the country which need to be improved especially through the district development committees (D.D.C.S) The Ministries should ensure that they provide facilities to the rural areas and extension officers to aid wananchi in improving the economy of this country. Keiio Valley is a high, cotton potential area and all that is needed is the exploitation of the land. Such an act would helps the farmers to increase their lot and thus improve the economy of this country. So we would like the extension officers to be deployed, there so that they can advise the farmers on how. to grow cotton. If we increased our cotton production we shall not have to import cotton into this country. We have, enough land and manpower to produce enough cotton for the industries, of this country like Rivertex. So I would like, to appeal to those concerned to ensure that they advise the farmers on how best to improve their agricultural methods. We should all try to emulate His Excellency the President in his Nyayo Philosophy of Love, Peace and Unity so that we can increase agricultural production in this country.I must congratulate my people of Kerio Valley for maintaining peace in that area. I remember sometime back we used to have chaos there. At the moment there is love and unity among the people who are like the pokot Turkana and all the others who live there.</Newspeech><Newpseech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CO-OPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT- (Mr. Ejore): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I heard my friend here say that among the people living there peacefully is God. Could he withdraw that?</Newpseech><Newpseech>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I. have withdrawn that. All I was trying to say was that people are now living peacefully in that area. This is because before this there used to be tribal wans in that area. But I am glad to say that at the moment there is total peace in that area just like it is in the whole country.So since we have the land and manpower, all we need is facilities to improve agriculture in that area.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to request the Ministry of Education to improve on education in. my area. Even during this time when the Ministry of Education is intro¬ducing cost-sharing in education, I would like the Ministry to have personnel responsible for this. We are ready as parents to pay for the cost-sharing in education, but there should be personnel responsible for advising the parents and also creating a good atmosphere in the Ministry of Education so that we are able to buy books and the books will be taken care of. If it is the question of cost-sharing, we as parents, are ready to pay 50 per cent of the expenses and the Ministry should pay the remain¬der so that the cost-sharing is fair.His Excellency the President has advised us on the 8-4-4 system of education which is very good, and every one of us here must support it. However, there must be some improvement on it, especially on the examination result part of it. For instance, in the past, we had results marked 'A', 'B', 'c', 'D' and so on, where 'A.', meant very-good and So, we need a lot of improvement on well the examination results. Our parents are not eduecated well enough to understand the techniques of the system. His Excellency the President has said that we must improve Kenya, and it is high time we did exactly that. Every one of us must be concerned here. I must thank His Excellency the President because he is seeing ahead of everybody else. He is creating a very good atmosphere for our future children and we must supporthim fully. Those who are responsible must see to it that theyhelp here. The I.C.D.C. should come forward and assist in the rural areas. Women groups should also be assisted. The Ministry of Health should come forward and offer health services in the rural areas With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newwspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr.Muturia): Aiisante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipatia nafasi hii ili nami niungane na Wabunge wengine kuiashukuru Mtukufu Rais kwa ile Ho tuba yake aliyoktolea taifa hili letu la Kenya.Yangu ni kumshulcuru Mtukufu Rais kwa kazi nyingi ambazo anaifanyia taifa hili. Killingana na historia ya binadamu, xna-A julikana wazi kwamba binadamu ni mnyama,£jnara kwa mara, kwa sababuV hatosheki. Hata akipewa kitu gani, anaona mambo mengine. Tuna-kumbuka hata wakati wa Musa, alxpowaaukisha baiiari Waisraeli nawakapata manna kutoka mbinguni, wengine walianza kunung'uni.Tra na kusema wanataka kuxudi nchi ya Misri.Katika Kenya, ni lazima tuseme maneno wazi wazi. Wananchi wa Kenya wanamwunga " rakono Mtukufu Rais kwa vyo vyote, lakini kuna watu wachache ambao hawatosheki. Hata wakati tunapopika njahi sijui kama waheshimiwa Wabunge wengine wanajua njahi ni nini lakini zinafanana na raaharagwe, ni nyeusi na zinapendwa sana na akina mama waliojifungua mimba tunajua kwamb a hata ingawa zote zilikuwa zimemea mahali pamoja, kuna nyingine zake ambazo hata hukizipika kwa kutumia pressure cooker, haziivi, na ukizila hizi, utasikia kama unakula mawe.. Watu fulani wachache wamekuwa kama njahi hizi zisizoiva na hawamshukuru Mtukufu Rais kwa kazi anayofanya.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, let us be frank to ourselves. Acha tuseme ukweli. Katika nchi hii, tupende au tusipende, hata tukichukua miaka l.OOO ijayo, hatutaweza kumpata kiongozi mwingine kama Mtukufu Rais Moi.(Applause)lie rekodi ambayo Mtukufu Rais ameweka katika nchi hii itaonekana na vizazi vitakavyozaliwa miaka 2,000 ijayo. Ni kitu kingine gani tunachotaka? Ni kitu gani ambacho wananchi hawa wachache wanataka? Kama unavyojua mshale wa kiberiti ni mdogo na, unapokuwa ndani ya kiberiti unakuwa sawa sawa, lakini ukiuchukua na kuuwasha halafu uuweke penye nyasi, unachoma nyasi katika ranch yote na mifugo inakosa chakula. Mtu nunoja akifungua mdomo wake na kueneza uvumi, uvumi huo unaenea kama moto na kumbe mtu huyu hata hana akili isipokuwa anataka tu kuziharibu bongo za watu wengine kwa kutaja maneno machafu dhidi ya Mtukufu Rais na Serikali. Kumbe hata malaika wa mbinguni wanajua kwamba Mtukufu Rais ni safi ndani ya roho yake. Acha tuseme ukweli.Itatuchukua miaka mingi, au hata maisha yetu yote, kujua mahali kote ambako Mtukufu Rais amekujua. Acha habari ya Ulaya na nchi nyingine za ng'ambo; ni vigumu sana kwetu kujua mahali kote ambako Mtukufu Rais ametembea katika nchi hii. Mtukufu Rais amemchukua yule mtu wa chini kabisa ambaye hakuwa na matumaini yo yote na kumweka juu, Mtukufu Rais ametembea kote nchini, hata kule Mkoa wa Kaskazini-Mashariki na Turkana, na kuwaweka watu wote wa Kenya katika kiwango kimoja. Kama kuna mtu ye yote ambaye. anauonea choyo mwe.nendo wa Mtukufu Rais, anafaa kusahau habari hiyo kwa sababu tuko karibu naye na tuko tayari hata kumla kwa meno.Ni nani atakayeipenda Kenya? Hakuna ye yote atakayeipenda kwa sababu Kenya imeanza kujitokeza chini ya uongozi wa Mtukufu Rais. Kwa sababu ya kuwa na amani nchini, mambo mengi yameanza kutokea. Warnerika, Waingereza, Warusi na Wajapan wana pesa za kutosha, vyombo vingi na akili nyingi, na wamesoraa kwa miaka mingi. Unafikiri kwamba watu hawa wanafurahia kushindwa kuvumbua dawa ya UKIMWI ambayo tumeivumbua hapa Kenya? Hata ikiwa hatuna vyombo vya kutosha na hata ikiwa bado tunatumia miti. shamba yetu, Kenya ndiyo imekuwa ya kwanza kuvumbua dawa ya UKIMWI. Ni nani atakayefurahi kwa jambo hili? Kama tunavyojua, ugonjwa wa zamani zaidi duniani ni ukoma, na hadi kufikia majuzi ambapo Kenya iligundua tiba ya ugonjwa huo, kulikuwa hakuna dawa yake. Je, ni akina nani watakaofurahia hatua kaata hiyo? Watu wehye choyo hawataki kusikia mambo hayo. Pia, kama vile tunavyojua, pesa nyingi sana za kigeni katika nchi hii hutumiwa kuagiza magari kutoka nchi za nje. Hapa Kenya kuna aina zote za magari kama vile Range Rover na Mercedes Be'nz. Hivi majuzi. Kenya, chini ya Mtukufu Rais na kwa sababu ya amani iliyoko, imejitahidi na kujenga gari zinazoitwa Nyayo Pioneer One, Nyayo Pioneer Two na Nyayo Pioneer Three. Je, hiyo inaweza kuwa raha kwa watu wengine ambao ni maadui wa tnaendeleb yetu?Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, bado katika Kenya kuna watu wengine ambao wana kasumba ya ukoloni na ambao hufikiria kwamba Wakenya hawawezi kutengeneza hata kiberiti. Ninakumbuka kwamba wakati tulipokuwa tunapigania Uhuru tul-ikuwa tuki- ulizwa na-Mzungu, "Je, nyinyi mnataka. Uhuru na hata hamwezi kujitengenezea kiberiti? Sasa tumetengeneza gari letu ambayo ni hatua kubwa zaidi kuliko kutengeneza kiberiti Nataka kusema kwamba tukiendelea vile, tunavyoendelea na kuwa na ambani tuliyo nayo sasa, tutaweza hata kuunda ndege. Kuna mtu mmoja wa huko Karatina arnbaye alikuwa ameanza kutengeneza ndege iliyokuwa ikiitwa Kenya One. Ingawa hivyo, lakini alianza kazi yake wakati usiofaa. Kama Gachamba angepatiwa moyo wa kuendelea na kazi yake na ashirikishwe pamoja na wanachuoni, wakati huu tungekuwa na ndege ambayo imeundiwa hapa Kenya. Hata kama ingekuwa ikitembea kilomita 20 kwa saa, ingekuwa hapa; bora tu iwe imeundwa hapa.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, nataka kukuhakikishia kwamba wafanya biashara wa magendondio wanaoumia sana. Hao ni watu ambao walikuwa wanaendesha biashara ya pembe za ndovu na kuuza sukari kimagendo na kufanya mambo mengine maovu. Kwa sababu sasa biashara zao zimepigwa marufuku na Mtukufu Rais, wameanza kubabaika na kuuliza ni kitu kingine gani watakachoanza kufanya. Nataka kuwaambia wasahau mambo hayo kabisa. Hao oido pia watu ambao wameanza kueneza uvumi. Kazi yao ni kuketi na kunywa pombe kwa sababu hawana mambo mengine ya kuifanyia nchi hii. Vitendo vyao ni viovu kabisa na wanajulikana0na wanazidi kujulikana.Nikimaliza, Bw. Naibu Spika, nataka kumwomba Waziri wa Ujenzi kitu kimoj Watu wa Ntonyiri wamejenga ofisi ya mkuu wa tarafa kwa moyo wa Harambee, wamjenga kituo cha polisi kwa aioyo wa Harambee na pia wamejenga of isi ya Kami kwa gharaaia ya KShs.2.5 milioni kwa njia ya Harambee. Wananchi hao wan a mali mengi, hasa miraa, kahawa na majani chai. Pia, kuna wahalifu huko, na  tunamwomba Waziri wa Ujenzi ahakikishe kwamba barabara ya kutoka Maili Tatu hadi Mbotuate itiwe lami.Kwa hayo machache, Bw.

It was only recently when the President ordered the price of tea be improved and has directed the same for the coffee. On behalf of coffee growers, since I come from a coffee-growing area, I would like to appeal to the relevant Ministry of Co-operative Development, to take the co-operative societies in the rural areas?- morel seriously, I am saying this because at the moment, these co-operative societies are satulafedi with corruption.

Muthetheni Dispensary - Renovations were completed in November, 1989 and it was upgraded to a health centre.8.	 	Mbiuni and Wamunyu Dispensaries Renovation work commenced on 21st February, 1990. The Government contracted MES Rhino Construction Company who are doing the job right now.9.	Miu, KLbaoni and Eatulani Dispensaries - These dispensaries have been included in the list of dispensaries to be renovated in the 1990/91. Financial Year under the International Development Agency (IDA) Programme.10.	Mwala Health Centre - Repairs on this health centre started early this month. 5. Masii Health Centre — This Health Centre has been earmarked for renovation in the 1990/91 Financial Year, after whichthe health centre will be used as a training school for Maternal Child Health and Family Planning (MCH&FP) courses. Thank you, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Assistant Minister for his reply^that the health facilities numbers one and two above have been renovated, although at the time of my submitting this Question they had not been renovated at all.However, in the case of kibaoni and those other dispensaries thesituation is really bad. I visited the area on 16th of last month and saw that the fennce was falling off and the building in Kibaoni dispensary have no doors. So, If these dispensaries will renovated during the next financial year I do not know what is going to happen to them. Could the Ministry, therefore, consider renovating Kibaoni Dispensary as a matter of urgency because the situation there is really horrible?<Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is nothing left for the Ministry to think about. The hon. Member is requesting the Ministry to think about that issue. We have already thought about it and we already started the renovation work. Our decisions have already been shown clearly by starting that renovation work started early this month which includes Kibaoni dispensary. That work is scheduled for  the financial Year l990/9l but not 1991/92 Financial Year. Thank you, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Sir, I visited Kibaoni dispensary recently, but there was not work going on there. I would request the Assistant Minister to make sure that that work is started as soon as possible.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Sir, the report that I have here with me has come from our staff in that area. That report shows, that work has started and it is still going on under the contractor whom I have named here. The hon. Member is claiming that he had visited that area recently but I do not know whow recent that was.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: The report that the Assistant Minister has received is not correct. When was that renovation work started, was it started last week or last week but one I was there yesterday.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Jibu swali hilo, Bw. Waziri Msaidizi.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Sir, I have already said that early this month the Ministry started the renovation work of that dispensary. I have also said that that work will continue to the 1990/91 Financial Year until all the doors are also renovated. When we are carrying out the renovation work, we do not exclude doors and the peeling walls because they are also included in the budget of renovation.</Newspeech>Question No. 11BW. A.K.

KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir It is out of order for anybody to make any statements in this House if he cannot substantiate them. Could the Assistant Minister therefore substantiate whether that case was sent to the Industrial Court by showing us the documents which reflect that case? If he cannot substantiate right now, he should go back and bring the documentary evidence to this House.MR. D.M. HKesi hiyo iko katika Mahakama ya Viwanda nakwa . hivyo hatuwezi kuzugumzia mambo ya kesi iliyo katikaMahakama ya Viwanda.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: The clarification that the House is seeking is absolutely essential. If the Assistant Ministerhas just registered, that matter as an industrial dispute, thatdoes not mean that the matter is before the Industrial Court,because the Ministry can still promote reconciliation. That is why the Chair would like to hear.it from the Ministry what is the precise position is.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: I will bring that answer today in the afternoon.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Very well,  Mr. Bidu.</Newspeech>Question No.19MR. BIDU asked the Minister for Labour why Mr. John Muthoka Kinga, former employee of Messrs Avirat Pamabhai Patel of Eastern Chemicals Industries Limited, Mombasa, was underpaid his terminal benefits contrary to the guidelines given by the Provincial Labour Officer, Mombasa, vide letter Ref. L.D. 64/MJP/IO7/86 dated 15th July, 1986?<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. D.M. Amin): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Mr. John Muthoka was underpaid because he opted to accept a lesser amount than what was considered to be the correct amount by the Provincial Labour Officer.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: That is a new development in the Ministry of Labour. If the Ministry sent a letter there indicating that particular terminals benefits should be paid, how come that the employer paid the employee a lesser amount than that which was indicated in that letter from the Ministry?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is true that .Mr. Kinga lodged his complaints with the Provincial Labour Officer on 10th July, 1986, and the parties were invited for joint meeting which took place on 14th July 1986, but no decision was reached. On 15th July 1986, the Provincial Labour Officer wrote to- the employer and demanded payment of Kshs.12,502/ being the employees pay, in respect of periods between March 1986 to July 1986. The employer challenged the validility of the claim and referred the letter to the Federation of the Kenya Employers who supported their member. They were convinced that the claim x was illegitimate. The Provincial Labour Officer wrote a final demand letter on 6th July 1987, but still the employe did not pay that money, after which he was prosecuted on 6th February 1988 to answer criminal case No.47387. Before the hearing of the case, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the complainant and the employer, through their advocates, reported to the Provincial Labour Officer that they had agreed to settle the matter out of court. They had done so voluntarily.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, you can see now that another development arose through the Ministry of Labour. Is the Assistant Minister happy with this situation whereby the decisions of the	Provisional labour Officer are overruled by other people?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMEN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the claimant, through his advocate, accepted to take a lesser amount then that was that That is exactly what happened</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: If the claimant and his employer reached this agreement voluntarily, then how come the claimant is now complaining? How come he is now saying that he did not request to be given this particular amount of money?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have a copy of that agreement in which the claimant agreed to take a smaller amount of money. The Ministry had done its best to. resolve that matter but before a  solution could be found the claimant accepted to take that smaller amount of money. I will get a copy of that agreement from the Provincial Labour Officer, Mombasa.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Chepkok's Question.</Newspeech>Question No.5MR. MAXHANU, on behalf of Mr. Chepkok, asked the Minister for lands and Housing how many acres of land the Ministry has acquired at Iten Town for the expansion ox Slgeyo Marakwet District Hospital.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND HOUSING (Mr. Mutiso): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.My Ministry acquired, on behalf of the Ministry of Health, 89.34 acres for the establishment of Iten Districjt Hospital in 1980.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Next Order,</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is your point of order, Mr. Kiliku?</Newspeech></Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am rising on a point of order in connexion with what appeared on the Monday issue of The Standard. The article is entitled Hospital Paces. Acute Shortage of Supplies. The s_tory is referring to Kenyatta National Hospital. . It reads as follows:?"Kenyatta National. Hospital is faced with an acute shortage of disposable ga gloves and drugs"It goes on to state that:"Professor Oliech was quoted in a section of the local Press on Saturday as saying that a racket had been uncovered in the Ministry whereby a non-existent firm had won a tender from the Hospital to supply it with medical supplies worth KShs.3 million."Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like the Minister for Health to make a Ministerial Statement in this House to tell us what happened. How did a non-existent firm win a tender worth KShs.3 million?The Minister should also tell us who owns that non-existent firs. His Excellency the President has repeatedly said that corruption must be eradicated in this country. Corruption has become a very big obstacle in the economic development of this country. We want the Ministry of Health to come up with a Statement telling us who was awarded this tender. They should also tell us who awarded that tender to that firm. This is because all these people are corrupt; they are all swindlers. We should assist His Excellency the President to eradicate corruption in this country.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we also expect the Minister to tell us why they have allowed Kenyatta National Hospital to run without drugs when people are paying them money. When people go Kenyatta National Hospital they are told to go to private hospitals where exorbiant fees are charged. The ordinary mwananchi cannot afford that. The Minister should tell us what is happening in Kenyatta National Hospital and in the other hospitals in this country</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr." Ogur) : Thank  you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to respond to the a remarks made by hon. Kiliku.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member has quoted areport in the. Monday, 19.3.90, issue of The Standard where horrible things were stated regarding our Ministry. He also wants my Ministry to respond to horrible things that were said in a newspaper. I will consult with the Ministry's officials and as demanded by the hon. Member, a Ministerial Statement will be made. But I would like to state categorically that at no time have patients who have visited Kenyatta National Hospital have been told that there are no drugs. That situation does not prevail in Kenya today. However, I would appeal to hon. Members to believe what we tell them. They should not believe everything that appears in the newspapers because newspaper reports can be misleading.</Newspeech><newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Kilikui I do not propose to have a situation where an open debate is ocassioned by your remarks. The Assistant Minister has said that he is going to do his best to investigate and I think you should be satisfied with that.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is it in relation to the same issue?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KILIKU: I just want to correct the impression that has been created by the Assistant Minister.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: What impression?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KILIKU: The hon. Assistant Minister has denied that people are being turned away when they go to Kenyatta National Hospital. This newspaper report says:"When some patients complained about they were being handled at the clinic they were asked to seek better treatment elsewhere" Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, where is "Elsewhere"? This report appeared two days ago and the Ministry has not refuted it. That is why I have taken it as the truth and nothing else but the truth. So, the report is correct.</newspeech><newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.<newspeech> MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Ogur! I do not propose to allow any debate on this issue. Mr. Ogle.</newspeech><newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Please allow me to defend my Ministry.</newspeech><newspeech> MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Ogur! I would you, hon. Ogur, make yourself conversant with the Standing Orders of the House and do precisely what the Chair has said. You should get into grips with the issues hon. Kiliku is raising so that you are able to offer better defence.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Ogle): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Yes, Mr. Ogle.</newspeech><newspeech> MR. WASIKE-NDOMBI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Your point of order is overruled, Mr. Wasike-Ndombi. I have given the Floor to Mr. Ogle. He is also on a point of order.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Ogle): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, ay point of order is in connexion with, a Press statement attributed to one Gitobu Imanyara who is the Editor of the Law Magazine, which I singled out as being anti-Government in my contribution to the Presidential Address. In his Press statement which appears on page 3 of the Sunday Nation of. l8.3.90, Mr. Imanyara challenged me to repeat outside this House the remarks I had made in Parliament. As far as I am concerned, the argument here is not whether I am able to make the same remarks outside Parliament, because I know that I am able .to do that, but whether the Magazine is anti-Government, anti-Kenya, anti-unity and therefore subversive. The answer is yes. This is because in the first instance, and very interestingly, Mr. Imanyara denied ever having abused the Government and Parliament when he continues to heap insults on Parliament in the same Press statement which reads as follows:"Mr. Imanyara said that he could not have cared to reply to Mr. Ogle had it not been for similarities that preceded the banning of Beyond Magazine and Financial Review Magazine. He said in a Press statement that the proscription of the two magazines was preceded by violent but false and highly unjustified condemnation emanating from the National Assembly. But Mr. Ogle's ambition is to see the banning of the Law Magazine or the detention of its Editor. Let him know that Kenya is a nation of 24 million people and they will not always be harassed. Mr. Imanyara said that this was not the first time that Mr. Ogle was attacking him and his Magazine. He said that the Magazine's Editorial policy will remain independent and will always stand for the rule of law not only here but all over the world. We have not, and we do not ever wish to abuse the Government.""Mr. Imanyara said that fear is an insidious disease. Fortunately it has a cure, and that is courage."Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as far as I am concerned, the only courage Mr. Gitobu Imanyara has is to steal clients' money. It is on record that his name has even be struck off from the list of practising lawyers because he stole Kshs.300,OOO/- belonging to a client, money which was entrusted to him in very good faith. In abuse of professional ethics, he stole that money.I have very good reasons to maintain that the, The Nairobi Law Monthly has very malicious aims against the Government. In support of my contention, I will quote from Issues No. 20 and 21 of the magazine. In issue No. 20, in an article by one George Matandiko Anyona, it states the following in connection with the Motion moved here by hon. Kalonzo Musyoka to have the Daily Nation reporters barred from covering Parliamentary proceedings:-"Needless and suffice it to say that the use of the expression, or words INDEFINITE PERIOD as in Musyoka"s Motion is a grammatical misnomer, nonsense and self-contradiction. Therefore, the exclusion of the Nation Newspapers from the Press gallery of Parliament for an "indefinite period" was unprocedural and in clear contravention of the letter and spirit of the Standing orders of the National Assembly and the Constitution of Kenya.	Under Standing order 40 (3) (a), (d) and (e), the Speaker was duty bound to bring these procedural contradictions to the attention of the Mover of the Motion and the whole House.The Speaker did not comply with the above requirements of the Standing order and as a result the dignity of the House was compromised and suffered from the terms in which Musyoka's Motion was framed.”My interpretation of this statement is that the Speaker and all the hon. Members of this House do not actually know what they are doing here. The most serious thing about it all is that the follow making these remarks is in my opinion, an impersonator because he proceeds to call himself a former Member of Parliament, which I do not dispute, but he goes further to call himself a former Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly, which we know he was  not.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the article goes on to say:-"These are criminal and treasonable allegations, too grave to be made lightly, and least of all in Parliament without substantiation."In conclusion, the article states:-"That was the Nation Debate that was in which the procedure, integrity and supremacy of Parliament was sacrificed at the altar of personal interest and political expediency. This tendency is well manifested in the entire body politic and does not augur well for democracy in Kenya. It is a far cry from the clarion motto of our Parliament: For the Welfare of Society and the Just Government of Men."Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, a subsequent article of the same magazine states:-"In 1966, the Senate was abolished. In 1982, the Constitution was amended to make Kenya a one-Party State. As a result, there is no freedom in Kenya to vote for a Government with policies other than those of Kanu.”"In. 1986 the security of the tenure of the Attorney—General was removed by a Constitutional amendment. In 1988 Kanu progromated (?) nomination rules which have given rise to very controversial Parliamentary and Party elections.        The non-Kanu Kenya citizens have no right to vote where a Kanu candidate has been nominated by 70 per cent of the Kanu members who are participating in the queuing.”</newspeech><newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: That is enough.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Would you, hon. Ogle, please speedup the submission.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Ogle): Yes, Sir, I will do so.In a different article, there is this statement:"Mr. Gibson Kamau Kuria, fearing that the Law Society of Kenya elections were going to be rigged Kanu style. A number of members of the Law Society of the Law Society of Kenya, of who are members of the current council of the Law Society of Kenya, distributed to selected members of the Law Society of Kenya ballot papers and required them to vote for one of the candidates and hand them back over to them."Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have the magazines here with me, and so any interested hon. Member can go through them. But I would like to state here that these statements and many more that are contained in this magazine, do not augur well for the well-being of this country. The contributors to this magazine are sworn enemies of this country and this Government. Under the circumstance, I would like to state here that I stand very firmly by ray earlier statement, and I would go even further and urge all hon. Members to treat this magazine with the seriousness it deserves.Thank you, Sir.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Omido): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I stand here, to make a comment with your permission, on what hon. Ogle has just said. This magazine is known for its stand against the established Government of this country. It is known for making inciting statements inciting the public against the lawfully constituted Government of the Republic and against the ruling Party, Kanu. It is well known that the United States of America enjoyed 40 years of a one-Party rule. It was the wish of the people of this country that they have a one-Party rule. For nearly 16 years, the people of this country have decided that they will have a one-Party rule. This was from the country's attainment of Independence. I personally belonged to what was known as an opposition Party the Kenya People's Union but the people of this country rejected it.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Omido. I am not very sure that we are treading on very safe ground here because hon. Ogle stood on a point of order, and now you are pursuing the same argument. My suggestion is that if you feel that what hon. Ogle has just said merits the bringing up a substantive Motion, then we might consider moving a substantive Motion to discuss that particular publication. But certainly, it is not in order to allow debate at this stage regarding that submission.</newspeech>	<newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Omido): In that case, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would, like to move that the House discusses this paper under Standing Order No. 20.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Omido! I would ratherhon. Members are given an opportunity to look at the publication before calling upon them hurriedly to discuss this matter. That would be the ruling of the Chair.</newspeech><newspeech>\ MR. BIDU:  On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Yesterday in this House I raised a point of order regarding the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. My point of order was in connection with the the  programme 'Today in Parliament' which was previously being aired at 10.00 p.m. and 6.30 a.m. the following morning. Unfortunately this programme is no longer being aired at 6.30 a.m. It has disappeared mysteriously. Since there is a Minister and four Assistant Ministers in that Ministry, we wanted them to tell us why this programme was scrapped without the knowledge of the people. Where are the Ministers from the Ministry?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. WASIKE—NDOMBI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. My point of order is in connection with hon. Ogur. My complaint is that he has been here for three years now; and by now he should have the book on our Standing Orders. I am saying so because when you Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, were on your feet, hon. Ogur was also on his feet until hon. Members asked him to sit down. Could he try to be more serious in following our Standing Orders? This is because since he is a Member of the Front Bench he becomes very conspicuous when he makes a mistake of that nature.</newspeech>   <newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER; I hope Mr. Ogur has heard and heard loudly!</newspeech>                    <newspeech>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.</newspeech>                    <newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is it now, Mr. Bidu?</newspeech>                     <newspeech>MR. BIDU: My point of order is that I needed clarification from the Chair about the point of order that I raised yesterday because the Ministers are not here to comment about it now.<newspeech>                 <newspeech> MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is it in relation to the Voice of Kenya?</newspeech>	                  <newspeech>MR. BIDU: Yes, Sir.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Well, is there anybody from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting? Well, you can see why nobody has responded to your point of order, Mr. Bidu.</newspeech>                      <newspeech>MR. KILIKU:  On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Although hon. Wasike-Ndombi has accused the Assistant Minister for not following our Standing Orders, he too was out of order when he	tried to raise a point of order when another hon. Member was on the floor on another point of order when hon. Ogle was raising his point of order, now Wasike-Ndombi tried to raise his own. point of order, which is also out of order. Could he </newspeech>                 <newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order, hon. Kiliku! What both hon. Kiliku and hon. Wasike-Ndombi are trying to say is that we should all take seriously the Standing Orders of this House. We should also make ourselves conversant with them so that we are not seen to be continually making a breach of the same.Next Order.</newspeech><header>PROCEDURAL MOTION</header><newspeech> THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR FINANCE (Prof. Saitoti): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move:—THAT, this House orders that the Business appearing on today's Order Paper be exempted from the provisions of Standing Order No. 33, being Wednesday morning, a day allocated for Private Members' Motions.                             Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am prompted to bring this Motion to this House essentially for two reasons. First, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that although this morning Sitting is devoted to the deliberations of Private Members1 Motions, unfortunately we do not have any Motion which has already matured and can be discussed. But much more important, and I am sure that hon. Members will agree with me on this particular score, the House has been debating the Address by His Excellency the President. Although this Motion has seven days allocated to it, we have only spent three days on this important Motion which gives a very profound exposition of social and economic affairs of this nation. It would not be right if we were to interrupt the tempo, thrust and continuity of that discussion. It is for this reason that I brought this Motion and I hope that hon. Members will agree to support the Motion so that I this morning's session could be appropriately devoted to the deliberation on the Address by His Excellency the President.I beg to move.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to second this Procedural Motion. It is important that we substitute the Private Members' Motions day to this very important business. After all in discussing the Presidential Address, hon. Members have an ample opportunity to say a lot of things that they would even have said in their Motions. They could even take that opportunity to make a few suggestions to the Government.I beg to second.</newspeech>(Question proposed)<newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in supporting this Motion I would like to say that today is a special day because I can see that nearly all Ministers and the Back-benchers are here which has not been the case in the past two years. I think this spirit should be maintained so that we can effectively tackle matters of this House.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the public policy as contained in the Presidential Address is the light that will lead us in our work there is no need of debating a lot on this Motion.

KILIKU:  On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am sorry but I was out of the country when Parliament was being opened and I do not know whether my hon. friend is wearing that eye patch because he is sick as a sign of beauty or that he is a millionaire. If he is sick I am sorry to have touched on this issue.</newspeech> <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PU3LIC WORKS (Mr. Maiyani): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I assume that he is sympathetic to my situation. Under my doctors instructions I have to cover this eye because it is 'seeing', too much.(laughter)                                Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, yesterday, I was contributing to the Presidential Address and at the time of adjournment, I was talking about the co-operative societies, particularly the coffee co-operative societies.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the area where I come from, I am very conversant with the problem of co-operative societies. I said that the management committees are corrupt. They have been undermining the very people who elected them. I have been saying this quite a number of times, and I would like to request the Minister for Co-operative Development to review their regula¬tions and by laws. For instance, there is an arrangement now whereby management committee members are elected for a term of three years, and a number of them will be rotating all: the time. I think this system poses a bit of a danger because some of the corrupt officials who have stolen a lot of money will be bribing people to be returned all the time and, therefore, perpetuating the problem of corruption within the organization. Therefore, I would request the Minister for Co-operative Development to continue with the three-year term, but not to perpetuate any Individuals' terms they should have fresh elections all the time. For instance the problem we have seen in Nyeri is appalling. The Districts Coffee Co-operative Union, Nyeri is led by some very corrupt people. I remember one of the officials was expelled from Tetu Coffee Co-operative Society because of theft. He was taken to Mukurweini Coffee Co-operative Society, but we expelled him because of theft. However, now this official is a big boss with the Nyeri District Coffee Co-operative Union. Now, what is going to happen to the primary societies of which he is the boss? The corruption is going to be perpetuated.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the farmers of Mukurweini Coffee Co-operative Society have passed a resolution demanding to be allowed to secede from Nyeri District Coffee Co-operative Union and form their own union under their own primary societies in Mukurweini Constituency. This feeling is generally so all over Nyeri, Othaya, Mathira, Tetu and so on. Those are the areas where we grow coffee. Therefore, I would like to appeal to the Minister for Co-operative Development to be sympathetic to the poor coffee farmers. He knows that the small scale coffee farmers are the majority in the coffee industry compared to the large-scale coffee farmers around Thika and elsewhere. These are the people who are bringing foreign exchange to this country through sale of their coffee, and if they are discouraged because of malpractices by these elected committee members, they are going to destroy the economy of this country because the people will be unwilling to take good care of their coffee. Some people have already uprooted their coffee to plant other saleable crops. If their example is to be followed by many, what would happen to the economy of this country?I express my appreciation because His Excellency the President has expressed, desire to have reforms in the coffee organization starting from Nairobi to the rural areas. I would like to see this proposal speeded up so that the coffee industry is safe and Kenya is going to continue to earn foreign exchange from this "black gold"Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank you very much, and with those few remarks, I beg to support.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE (Mr. Kombo): Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to contribute to this very important Address by His Excellency the President to the nation.Before I start, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to be together with all of us who are saluting Namibia today, I believe, for being independent from the South Africans. So, it is great that one more nation in Africa has become independent.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also, wish to state that it is indeed gratifying that we have a leader, our President, who loves this nation, the youth, and who is doing all that he can within his powers and also within God's guidance, to lead this nation to becoming a better country than he found it. President Moi has been in this House longer than any one of us. He has been here for 35 years as a Member of Parliament. He basically knows everything about this House. He was here during the colonial time. He knew how bad the colonialists were. He has been here as a Parliamentary Secretary. He has also been here as a Cabinet Minister, as a Vice-President and now as the President.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we cannot have a better leader than we have in President Moi let us not be cheated. All those that aspire for leadership had better forget it. We have a leader who is loved by everybody. All those people with faulty ambitions should forget it because nobody will allow them to lead this nation as long as we have our beloved President Moi leading us very well the way he is doing now.His Excellency the President is not there by accident, but it is by God's wish that he is a leader of this nation. Recently we had bad time when the late Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation, the late Dr. Ouko, passed away. If it were not for His Excellency the President's wisdom that led this united nation, things would have gone into the wrong hands. He did bring everybody, together, when people were not sure of themselves, he was sure of himself. He led us very well and because he is the symbol of unity he believes in unity we were able to come out of that crisis. Many people ran away. Some went on gossiping. The rich took the opportunity to want to spoil the nation, but because God leads our President, we were successful. We went through the tragedy that some were wishing we would not go through. We thank God that we went through the tragedy, and I am sure that we went through because God led our President on what to say and what to do at what time.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me also take this opportunity to thank the church leaders who prayed for the well-being of this nation during that terrible moment. Many church leaders took the advantage to say that there was no security. Even some took the advantage to speak bad things about the country. I remember one of them who said that there was no security in the country and only last week he was interrupted by a serpent in the church while he was preaching. He was going to preach his petty subject of State vs. Church relationship when he was interfered with by a serpent. To my surprise, another pastor or bishop from a different church rose to kill the serpent.	The bishop himself was unable to kill it, and that should be a good sign that he is on the wrong footing. Someone else had even to come from a different church to help him. That was a good warning to the bishop, and he should take it seriously. However, other church leaders prayed for this nation and God heard them.When three angels came to Abraham to inform him that they were going to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah, Abraham asked them, "Will you destroy the cities if there are any believers there?" The angels said, "Even if there are only five believers in these cities, we will not destroy them." Therefore, I am sure that God heard the few church leaders who prayed to him and the many church members who were not with the President at that time and wished us bad things were never heard. We thank God for having heard, at least, the few leaders who prayed for us all.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me now turn to lawyers. On many occasions, lawyers have been criticizing the Government during functions of the Law Society of Kenya. I remember that they even discussed the issue of the queuing, system of elections and said it was bad, but if their own elections had been done through this system, I am sure there would, not have been any problems. When these lawyers say that there was rigging in the secret ballot system that they used, this should prove to everybody that the queuing system is the best system of elections and the lawyers should accept it now. This system has been brought right to their doorstep for them to observe and accept as it was brought about by His Excellency the President. We will never have a better election system than the queuing system. If our lawyers had queued up in broad daylight, voters would have been counted physically, but they are now in problems because they pretended that their secret ballot system was the best. I am surprised to note that the lawyers go on saying that there was rigging in the secret ballot. How can they say that the secret ballot is the best and then end up saying that there was rigging? I do not understand this. There cannot be any rigging in the queuing system, which is done in broad daylight and people are counted as everybody watches the exercise.Let me take this opportunity to thank the Government of President Moi for that it has done for this nation. We have started many development projects in rural areas in the fields of health, education and other spheres of our national life. President Moi also started the 8—4-4 system of education. Let those who are cheated that this system will not do well forget it because every new thing has its own problems. We, as a Government, are learning from whatever hitches and problems that we had in the first Form IV examination that was done in this system. I am sure that the Government will come up with a policy out of any mistakes that were made in this regard. I am sure, that those who do not like our Government would like to say that the old system of education was better, but this is not so. I know that quite a number of hon. Members here went up to Standard VIII as our children are now doing. This is is a better system because when you eventually leave school, you come out a whole person because you have not been given mere theory; you have a lot of practical education from the 8-4—4 system of education.I also believe that now that the latest Form VI examination results have come out, the same qualifying score as was used in selecting university candidates last time will be upheld this time I remember that last time. His Excellency the President ordered that candidates with 10 points be admitted to the university. I hope that this year those with 10 points will be admitted to the university.With those few remarks, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MIRUKA—OWUOR: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my colleagues in offering our congratulations to His Excellency the President on his competent exposition of public policy in his usual style. This exposition will guide the actions and operations of this House during this Session. At the outset, I must also thank His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for moving a Motion suspending Private Members Motions as this has given us the opportunity to debate this very important Motion. The Address delivered by His Excellency the President contains many vital points, and it will require a very long to consider each one of them. I will only touch on a very few of them and also make an appeal to the Government.His Excellency the President's Address was very inspiring and, among other things, it has set work for the House which will achieve the interests of the public in the sense that certain legislation will be promulgated, including the Factories Act and the Workmen's Compensation Act, which are geared towards improving the lot and the welfare of the people of this country. As His Excellency the President said, the work of this House should be taken and considered very seriously. In this regard, there is one matter that I would like to mention in respect of project implementation. I would like to appeal to the Government to consider setting up a Ministry in charge of project implementation so that when the President or the Government gives directives, they are sure to be implemented. I would also urge that this Ministry considers tackling Private Members' Motions once they are passed by this House and ensure that they are implemented. I might take this opportunity to thank the Ministry of Agriculture because last year, I moved a Motion requesting for a review of the producer prices of rice and other crops, and in less than two months, the Motion was implemented. These, producer prices have been increased. We thank the Ministry and the Government very much, and call upon our people to intensify the cultivation of rice and other crops.I mentioned that I will touch on one or two points raised by His Excellency the President. One of these points concerns the peace, tranquility, stability and unity of Kenyans. In his speech. His Excellency the President said that there are improved prospects of peace -and understanding in the world. He noted that these prospects are' brought about by events taking place in Eastern Europe and the independence of Namibia which is being celebrated today. I wish to take this opportunity to join my colleagues in congratulating the people of Namibia and also His Excellency the President who has played a big role in assisting that country towards realizing ' its independence.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President also talked about the release of Mr. Nelson Mandela, which will improve the relations of the people in Southern Africa. So, there' is a general trend towards better understanding and peace in the world. We, in Kenya, have lived in Uhuru for a period of 26 years with peace and stability, and there is now more reason for us to solidify that peace and stability. During that period, Kenya has achieved much development and development due to the prevailing peace and stability, coupled with the leadership of His Excellency the President. The peace and stability that has given us progress has earned us some jealousy from some quarters. His Excellency, the President has, indeed, urged Kenyans to be vigilant and protect the prevailing peace and stability.As you will recall, Sir, recently Kenya was befallen with the tragedy of the loss of our late Minister for Foreign Affairs and. International Co—operation. Dr. Ouko, and I would like to join my colleagues in paying tribute to that great son of Kenya who, throughout his life, served the country with great devotion and total loyalty to His Excellency the President, the Government and the ruling party, Kanu. Naturally, because of the death of Dr. Ouko, there was sorrow and agony among the people of Kenya, which degenerated into some demonstrations by Kenyans. We, as the Luo elected leaders, notwithstanding the fact that this was a tragedy at our home, stood out very firmly and with one voice in support of His Excellency the President and the Government. We declared that we would continue to support the President as we have always done before. In order to preserve and maintain our stability, much support is required from the people at times of crises. That is when we should show, in stronger way that we support our Government.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is our duty to consolidate, maintain and preserve our solidarity and integrity. If I may say so, this is the obligation which all Kenyans undertook at the time of Independence. As I see it, it is the duty of all Kenyans, especially hon. Members of this House, to support the President, the Government and the ruling party at all times. I say that that is the duty of all Kenyans because when this country was fighting for Independence, Kanu did declare that Kenya wanted Uhuru na umoja for all Kenyans, a philosophy that was accepted by all Kenyans. So, Kenyans had agreed to remain united. That is why I say that it is the duty of all" of us to support, the President, the Government and the party at all times. This duty becomes more necessary at times when crises loom around.Having said that, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want, to make an appeal to the Government regarding the situation of the collapsed Miwani Sugar Mill. The collapse of the Miwani sugar Mill has brought misery and destitution to the people of Kisumu District.	This is one of the situations where we would appeal to the Government to treat the matter as an' emergency. The Government is able to act and it can act to restore the situation. Miwani Sugar Mill was the first sugar factory in the country and it is a viable project which has been working for many years. Now, the people having responded to the Government call to work hard on the land are stranded with thousands and thousands of acres of sugar-cane rotting in the field, which is not only a loss to themselves but also to the Govern¬ment. This is a situation where the Government should act and take emergency measures.The second appeal I would like to make is that the Lake Basin Develop¬ment Authority area of operation should be extended. We appeal for more funds to enable that Authority to be more effective in its operation. There is also the issue of floods which has become a menace to all the people of Kenya and which requires some action to be taken.With those few points, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion before the House.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. BULYAAR: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allow¬ing me this opportunity to contribute to the Motion on the Presidential Address.[Mr. Deputy Speaker left the Chair] [The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Wabuge) took the Chair]Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we must thank the Almighty God for giving us President Moi to lead this country- God has been very kind to us and given us a President who loves his people. His Excellency the President is mind¬ful of the welfare of all Kenyans regardless of their background. It is, therefore, only fitting for all other leaders to support His Excellency in his development activities for this country. Let me commend the President for the directive he has issued to the Provincial Administration to the effect that they should hold public barazas four times a month to educate the public about the Government policies. Since the time that directive was issued, many wananchi have known the Government policies and they know what their Government is doing for them. Those' public barazas are as important as district development committee meetings because they have educated the community on what the Government wants them to do, especially those of us from North Eastern Province. We have seen how our district commissioner and his provincial commissioner have been moving from one area to the other to tell the public what President Moi has done for them. In fact, wananchi are very happy with His Excellency the President's directive.Secondly, Sir, I would like to thank His Excellency the President for the manner in which he has convinced the world that Kenyans are united. He has also made Kenya a politically stable country and his Nyayo philosophy has earned respect all over the world. Mr. Temporally Deputy Speaker, Sir, recently, some of us was privileged to accompany His Excellency the President on his visit to the United States. Our President has proved, not only to the United States, but to the whole world, that he is a dynamic leader. Most world leaders have noted our President's love for children and as he was speaking at the breakfast-prayer-meeting during this visit to United States, he reiterated the love he has for children. At this prayer-meeting, His Excellency the President was addressing about 4,000 people and they all realized that Kenya has developed so much due to peace and stability that we have in this country. In fact, most countries in the world today, no longer regard Kenya as a third world country, and those listening to the keynote that was delivered by our President at the United States of America, must have also realized this. In fact, we from Kenya felt proud when the Americans and the Europeans told us "Oh men, you really have a President you have a great leader; a lover of children and a good father." As I said, we who accompanied His Excellency the President really felt privileged and as we left the conference hall, the Americans thought that all the Africans attending this prayer-meeting were all Kenyans. However, this was not the case "because there were also Africans from Sudan, Burundi, Somalia and from various African countries. In fact, Africans from other countries were surprised when the Americans approached them several times and asked them whether they were from Kenya, and when they said they were not, then the Americans would say, "We are looking for people from Kenya". This is because they were moved by our President's speech and really longed to have him stay longer in order to visit the various States in America and talk to the people there about love, peace and unity.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sure that the Americans were satisfied that a one-party system is the only ideal system in a young African country.  At this point, I would like to appeal to the hon. Members of this House, who are the leaders of this nation, to be dedicated and committed to this country. Our major responsibility is to support His Excellency the President in everything that he does.At the moment, it seems that there are certain leaders who do not know where they stand. Is this because they do not know what President Moi has done for this country? We have recently heard a Cabinet Minister claiming that there is corruption in the entire Government system. As leaders, we should strive to wipe out corruption instead of talking about it. We are here to assist the President in his endeavour to wipe out corruption. The leaders, who do not seem to know where they stand, should know that President Moi has the support of the people of this country. In fact, 98 per cent of the entire population in Kenya supports the President, including children of all ages and even the very elderly people.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Six, there are people in this country who seems to think that corruption is the only way in which they can enrich themselves. These people should also realize that His Excellency the President has vowed to wipe out corruption in this country and he has the support of the majority of Kenyans. I would like to appeal to them to come out and support the President for their own benefit. I am sure they would even he richer if they supported the President in his endeavour to develop this nation. Here in Kenya, everybody is free to can out his business the way he wants as long as he does not use corrupted means. It is a common feeling amongst ordinary Kenyans that the rich tycoons in Kenya may be having other homes outside this country where they intend to run away to, if there are chaoses in this country. However, the majority of Kenyans have nowhere else to go because they have no other home apart from Kenya, and therefore, they are ready to die here. Therefore, we are here to support the Government and His Excellency the President and these few rich and corrupt people should know that the President has our support, and they should come out and join us in this support for the President.Finally, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to Government Ministers to tour this country as His Excellency the President has been doing from time to time. This would help them to know what is going on in the districts regarding development projects and so on. I would particularly like to appeal to the Minister for Public Works to visit my Constituency to see the state of roads in this area.  At the moment some of these roads are impassable due to the recent rains and we would like the Minister to consider tarmacking them. With those few remarks, I beg to support.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Lijoodi): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. I feel privileged to be given this chance to contribute to the debate on Presidential Address on the occasion of the official opening of the Third Hew Session. I feel privileged particularly because today is our second anniversary of our election to Parliament and I think this is a very important day for all of us to remember. Two years ago today most of us did not know whether the electorate were going to vote us to this House and therefore, I think this is the most opportune moment for us to re-dedicate our¬selves to the service of the people who elected us to this House. We should always remember whenever we wake up every day, that it is the people's interest that ought to come first and hours later.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to express my personal appreciation to His Excellency the President for the moving Speech that he delivered during the official opening of Parliament on 13th of March. In this Speech, the President reminded all of us as leaders about our obligation to maintain peace and stability that has prevailed in this country since Independence. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, many of us in Kenya take peace and security for granted because we have not lived in other countries nor had serious security problems. We take it for granted that things will always continue to be the way they are. His Excellency the President reminded us that his philosophy of love, peace and unity must be practiced by all leaders. His reminder was so significant because there are many leaders in this country who, probably, do not appear to appreciate the actual meaning of Nyayoism. There are some leaders who have made it a habit of accusing each other whenever they get an opportunity. They make false accusations against each other in order to discredit the other party so as to be seen to be Nyayo followers.As a matter of fact, making hollow accusations against others to quote His Excellency the President is anti-Nyayo; that must be taken into account by many of our leaders, some of whom are hon. Members of this House. Personally, I feel that the President's Address is going to live in our hearts for quite a long time. He has always been of comfort to us whenever we have serious problems and we know, that this country would not have gone very far if he were not wise, tolerant and forgiving. He has actually forgiven a lot of people many of whom should not be in positions of Leadership but he has always given them a second chance to reform. We would like to thank him for the progress we have had in this country since he took over the leadership of this country. If you look at the performance of the Kenyan economy, you will see that Kenya is one of the very few countries, particularly in the African continent, whose economy has been growing at the rate of about 5 per cent per annum. Were it not for the high rate of our population the importation of oil which takes about 30 per cent of our total foreign exchange earnings and the serious decline in the value of our exports, Kenyans would be leading a much better life at the moment. The economy itself is growing at a rate that is unequalled and I think that is something that Kenyans should be proud of. With despot tot the rumours which came about following the death of our beloved colleague, the late Dr. Ouko, Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation, I would like to join those who spoke before me in denouncing them.	I also join my colleagues in paying glowing tribute to the late Dr. Ouko far his contribution, not only in the various Ministries in which he worked, but also in this House. We followed carefully the genuine demonstrations that were carried out by university students but wo regret and condemn those criminal elements who took advantage of the demonstrations, not only to throw stones at other people's property, but also abused innocent leaders in this country who were not involved in the death, of the late Minister.We have read about the interrogations that are being carried out to investigate the activities of some of the people in leadership positions. It is not clear why such interrogations are treated to major, headlines in our local newspapers. Some of us, who have had the opportunity of working elsewhere, know that the FBI, KGB and other security organizations pick up people in thousand everyday for questioning about state	security and we never read about them in the newspapers. We would like to remind all Kenyans that the security of this country and the future of our children is more important than the questioning of any one rich individual about his activities, particularly, when they concern the future of this country. I would like to remind all Kenyans, particularly those who take interest in reading about the changes in the political systems throughout the world, that when Kenya attained Independence in the 1960s and on to the 1970s, we were among very few countries that decided to design our own political system in line with the traditions and customs of this country. We agreed to have a one party system that would maintain all the contents of any democratic system, ensuring the freedom of individuals, freedom of expression and freedom of association. It was designed to maintain the democratic principles of any society and this is what we have been practicing within our one party system.We have a system that takes care of the feelings and opinions of all the leaders so much so that even those who have major policy changes can implement them. They do not have to wait until a certain political party wins an election before they propose those major changes. Our system takes care of that.In the 1970s, we were told that we were surrounded by socialist states and that our system would eventually fall because we had no friends. I think we now have more friends than any other country because we have come back to reality. Ours is a system that is specifically intended to cater for our own requirements other than copying a system that apes the principles and aspirations of other people.Finally, I would like to conclude by thanking His Excellency the President for his untiring efforts to improve the well-being of all Kenyans by not only ensuring that we have the desired institutions for maintaining law and order but also ensuring that the economy performs in the interest of the majority of Kenyans. We thank him for taking interest in touring the whole country and if I may be a bit more parochial, I would like to thank him for directing that a tea processing factory be built in Shinyalu Division near Kakamega. The people I represent are very thankful for this directive.With these few remarks, I beg to support the Motion.</newspeech><newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Kamotho): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me a chance  to join my colleagues to thank His Excellency the President for the excellent exposure of this country's public policy on various issues which, concern all of us Kenyans as contained in his Address. The Address by the President during the State Opening of Parliament was a clear indication of the continued concern which he has always demonstrated for all of us as Kenyans in the process of nation building. Since he took over the reign of this nation 11 years ago, His Excellency the President has personally done a lot in the building of this nation than what the colonial administration did for 70 good years.If, for example, we look at tile field of education, at the attained of Independence we had only 30,000 students in our secondary schools. I am sure since 1978 we have, perhaps, had more than four times that number of students in our secondary schools. Further, at that time we had no university at all in this country, but now we have four full-fledged universities which have a total of well over30,000 students. We can go on giving similar examples in the fields of health, agricultural development, and preservation of our natural resources and in many other areas where his Excellency the President has personally put his hands in.                    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we also note the President's contribution to the welfare of the people of this nation. He has initiated many mamoth Harambee fund raisings and completed projects like the Nyayo Wards and establishment of a fund to assist the disabled, and the record-breaking fund raising of last Saturday that raised money to assist bright children from poor families to continue with their education. That in itself is something that has not happened anywhere else in the world. Coming soon after his Excellency the President's major address recently in Bangok, Thailand, to the World Conference on Education for All that Harambee was a very good demonstration to the world community that when he asked the world to borrow a leaf from Kenya and try the Harambee movement as a way of developing education in their countries he meant exactly what he said.                              Therefore, this House should always be grateful to his Excellency the President for what he does and has continued to do in the process of nation building; it is our duty, as hon. Members of this august House, to support the President practically in his service to this nation. The best way of assisting the President to make Kenya a greater and better place to live in is by serving Kenyans in a dedicated and devoted way. Therefore, the point made by the President when he opened this Third Session of our Sixth Parliament that we, as leaders, must avoid personality clashes and difference is valid. It does not pay for us, leaders, to fight, or undermine each other for no reason. We should thus take his Excellency the President's caution seriously and put it into practice.                              Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this House should be extremely grateful to the President for the peace initiative he has taken in the past to try and bring peace and tranquility in nations like Sudan, Ethiopia and Mozambique, and also for the role Kenya has played in bringing about peace and freedom to the people of Namibia. We as a nation that knows what freedom and peace are should continue assisting the President so that he can help Namibians and their ruling party, SWAPO, to settle down and continue enjoying the fruits of freedom, unity and peace. The role our national army has played in bringing about independence in Namibia is absolutely creditable. We should all thank our armed personnel for what they have done in Namibia and for being asked to remain behind because of the good job they have done in bringing about independence in that country.This House cannot also forget to thank his Excellency the President for the role he has played jointly with other world leaders to bring about the release of Mr. Mandela in South Africa. We have been extremely consistent in our international and public policy towards peace and freedom in line with membership of the Non-aligned Movement. It is because of the peace and unity that enjoy here at home coupled with the wise and dynamic leadership of his Excellency the President that we have been able to assist the freedom struggle in Southern Africa. This is why we have to support the President, the Government and the ruling Party, Kanu, come what may.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as my colleague, the Kanu National Treasurer, hon. Lijoodi, said earlier, what we are reading everyday in a the newspapers is very unusual. When the police pick up somebody for questioning that is not news anywhere in the world. We know that in other world nations, including the biggest democracies like America India and so on, people are picked up every hour for questioning, but we do not read about it the New York Times, London Times and other international and local newspapers. However, when our police, do their own work to ensure that Kenyans continue living in peace we are treated to unnecessary headlines in our Press.We are all aware of the unfortunate loss of our late brother and friend, Dr. Robert Ouko. All Kenyans were dismayed and shocked by the loss of a dear friend and great son. But when people start talking carelessly the Government has to show concern because it is its responsibility to ensure that peace and unity are maintained at all costs. Thank you, Sir.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Onyancha): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chance to also join my colleagues in thanking his Excellency the President for his very wonderful and guiding Address If a house to house poll was taken today about the popularity of the President, 99.99 per cent of our people would confirm, that they love and respect our President. This would be because thePresident has devoted his total life to ensuring that Kenyans live their full lives and get what they can possibly have.                                    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the President has almost entirely given all his life, for his people. You will find that every day he is up and ready to do something to benefit the people of this country. Those who understand him cannot do or say anything except to thank him for that. There is nothing that the citizens of this country can do to the President for what he has done for this country except to be totally loyal to him, and to support him in what he is doing for the good of this country.Sir, we cannot give the President property, money or anything else. We have nothing to give him except to support him totally. We should also remember that the President is a humanbeing, he is just like us, he has got feelings. It is totally saddening when something happens and the reaction of this country to whom he is devoted is so bad. In fact he would wonder whether we do understand and see what he is doing for us. Sir, I would like to say that in hon. Ouko we have lost a leader who loved his country and his job. He was a leader who loved his President and served him and the country well, but the cruel hand of death took him away. Criminal activities are everywhere in the world. While we do appreciate the fact that we have lost a wonderful leader, we should also remember that there are about 24 million people living in this country and they have to be protected. Our reactions have to be in consideration of those 24 million people living in Kenya.Sir, we know that the Government is doing everything possible to find out the people who killed him they must be criminals. Our duty is to support the Government and give it an opportunity to get to the truth instead of doing things that would confuse that matter. Everybody wants to know the truth about the death of hon. Dr. Ouko, but we should also behave in such a manner that we help those people who have been given the duty of investigating that matter. The investigators are also human beings; they are not angels and therefore, they will only find out what is humanly possible to find out. We have to give them a chance. When the truth comes out, and we hope and pray that it comes out, we know proper action will be taken.                               Sir, His Excellency the President has repeatedly told us that when we as leaders in this country open our mouths to say something, we have to weigh and" consider the consequences of everything that we say. That is what is expected of us and it is reasonable. If we say something which we should not have said, and then some bad consequences follow, we have to stand and bear what we have already said, and therefore, we should not blame anybody. We are all taken, to be reasonable people and therefore, we have to foresee the consequences of our utterances and actions.                             Sir, if a leader can stand up aim this House and asks what we fought for before we attained Independence He asked us; Is this what we fought for?" He was asking us to tell him what we fought for although he is an old leader who also fought for Uhuru. Does he not understand what he fought for? He is an old man and yet up to now he does not understand what he fought for.What did he fight for? Indeed, any child in this country would tell him what he fought for. He would tell him that we fought for the Independence so that we can run our own country and the Government. He would tell him that we wanted Independence so that we can own and run the economy of this country. We fought for Independence so that we can get freedom to run the Government in the way we want.  What did he fight for? He fought so that he could be free and be elected to this to House and also be nominated to the Cabinet. Does he not see that? If a leader opens his mouth and speaks out something which can be misinterpreted, or which can be read in any reasonable possible human way, he should not stand up and begin blaming other people for interpreting him in the manner which was available from his own speech. Sir  that is why it is important for us to remember once again that if you are a leader, and you stand up to tell those people whom you lead and the rest of the country something, you should first of all examine it and foresee the consequences that could come out of such a speech. You should also foresee whether those consequences are for the good of this country, and for the people you are leading or whether that speech will bring our consequences which are not for the welfare of this country.                              Sir, as I have already indicated, 99.99 per cent of the people of this country are supporting the President, and we shall continue to follow and heed him. Those who have doubts should come out and say so. They should not meander before they say what they want to say. If you do not agree with the system which the 99.99 per cent of the people in this country like and support, you should come out and say so. You should also resign, if you do not like the system. In fact, we should be very thankful to the President because he is kind and tolerant.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we should be very thankful to His Excellency the President because he is so kind and tolerant, otherwise we would have been expected to be asked, all of us, to resign so that he can choose another Government from his people. But should not go round doubting the truth.I support the Motion.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KAMUYU: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chance to join my colleagues in this august House in contributing to this Motion. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for the manner in which he moved this Procedural Motion to enable us to continue with our debate on the Presidential Address. He has enabled us to continue to support His Excellency the President's most inspiring Speech. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like to join my colleagues in expressing my sentiments on the untimely and very sad demise of the late Dr. Robert Ouko. The late Dr. Robert Ouko was a great national, leader, not only among the Luo community but also in the whole country. The late Dr. Robert Ouko was a national and a lovable leader. He was loved in every location in Kenya. So, as the tears of sorrow trickled in Nyanza also tears of sorrow trickled in Coast Province.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KILIKU: And also in Changamwe Constituency.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KAMUYU: Tears of sorrow also trickled in Central Province, Eastern Province in the Rift Valley Province and so on. He loved at all levels; nationally and internationally. The death of the late Dr. Robert Ouko was a great test to our nation. The rest of the world must have been watching with interest to see how we would behave. Perhaps they must have been expecting chaos to break out in Kenya. But Kenyans have demonstrated remarkable maturity. This could not have been achieved without the great and very, very inspiring leadership of His Excellency the President.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, our Presidents is above reproach. The President of this country does not know the meaning of tribalism. He does not know the meaning of sectionalism and even clanism. That is what has united us and kept us going. This is because without unity we cannot succeed in anything. It is our peace and unities that will make us achieve a lot of things. Therefore anybody who wants to take this opportunity to compare the death of the late Dr. Robert Ouko and that of the late J.M. Kariuki, in 1975, is misleading this nation. The Nyayo Government is a clean and straightforward Government and has nothing to hide. We must wait calmly for the results of the investigations being carried out by the Scotland Yard detectives who are being assisted by our Criminal Investigation Department officers. Kenya has one of best trained intelligence service on the continent. We are confident that we shall get the truth, and nothing but the truth.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, each and every paragraph of the Presidential Speech is full of fatherly advice from His Excellency the President. We should read this Speech many, many times over. Let me draw your attention to page 8 of the Speech where the President says:"As hon. Members of this House we should uphold the truth at all times and place the interests of this nation before our own interests."Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, how do we place the interests of this nation before our own interests? We must do only one thing follow and emulate His Excellency the President. This is because if we give all our love to this nation we shall have placed the interests of this country before our own interests. We must, work for the people we represent in this House. We must not come to this House to propagate our own personal interests. Our most important duty as Members of this House is to unite Kenyans and forge ahead under the wise leadership of His Excellency the President.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to draw the attention of this House to the subject of education in this country. The greatest challenge that we have in this country is education of our children. Education is the greatest inheritance that we can leave to our children. I would like to bring out this point very emphatically that the 10 subjects that we are at the moment giving to our secondary school pupils are much too many for the children. Most of us in this House did 7 or 8 subjects in our secondary school, examinations and we did very well. I would like to request this House and the Ministry of Education to reconsider the number of subjects that are being taught to secondary school students at the moment. This is because I believe that 10 subjects are a bit of a burden to these youngsters. I think the number should be reduced to 7 or 8 subjects. I say this because everyone cannot become a scientist. We should have scientists as well as artists because both are complementary. This is because without good and brilliant scientists we could not have produced Kemron and the Nyayo Car. But also in the same token we need good artists who can become good journalists, good teachers and so on. So, at Form II, I think the students should be given a chance to make a choice at that level so that we can separate the scientists from the artists. This would enable the students to specialize in arts and sciences separately. This is very, very important because most of the students end up getting confused when they take the 10 sub-jects. It is okay to examine them on 10 subjects but I think the load is just too heavy for them to carry and I think the system must be revised.Sir. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like to take this opportunity to request all Headmasters and Headmistresses throughout the country to head His Excellency the President's directives regarding building funds. This has become a great burden to all parents. However, despite Presidential Directives the heads of these schools continue to ask for building fund money and to send students away from school. This must stop immediately. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to support the remarks made by hon. Kiliku in his speech yesterday. It is about time that we had consistency in selecting educational books. We must have the same books this year and next year. The tendency to change books every year has placed a heavy burden on parents in this country. They are being forced to buy different books every year. Some parents have four to five children in secondary school and these children should be able to pass on books to each other; from the older to the younger ones. This becomes easier and much cheaper for the parents.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to emphasize here that one of the biggest problems we have is lack of employment opportunities it is our responsibility to help the Government create employment opportunities every day. I, therefore, suggest that the Kenya youth wingers, who  are carefully selected from the ward, district and provincial levels, to be given the first priority when recruitment in the forces, such as the regular police, the administration police, the army, air force and the rest, is being done. I say this because these young men and women are disciplined and they have already been exposed to the Government and the administration machinery. This will boost their morale. With those few words, I beg to support. </newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR RECLAMATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF ARID, SEMI-ARID AND WASTELANDS (Mr. Nyakiamo): Thank you Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to support the Motion, I stand here to add my voice in airing my thanks to His Excellency the President for his exposition of public policy as contained in the Presidential Address which he delivered on 13th March, 1990. We are a sovereign country, and the symbol of that sovereignty is His Excellency the President. Wherever a Kenyan is, wherever he goes, he knows that he belongs to a sovereign country. There can be no doubt as to where our loyalty is to lie. If we are a sovereign country, we are one nation, with one President, one Constitution and one Government. There should, therefore, be no doubt as to where our loyalty lies. The loyalty lies with the Government. I support Mr. Speaker's address on the State Opening of the Third Session of the Sixth Parliament. I support everything he said on that day, on behalf of the Members of Parliament. He enumerated what our President has done for this country his selfless service to this country. The other day when there was a fund raising for the Presidential Bursary Fund, the President himself said that he has never gone contrary to the Oath of Office he took. What have we as leaders, done to support that?So much has been said about the death of the late Dr. Robert Ouko. I express my thanks, first to His Excellency the President, for bringing solidarity to the nation during that trying time, and for showing solidarity to the family of the late Dr. Ouko. Above all, he took the country first and was mindful of the nation as a whole. Those people who took that opportunity to try to bring chaos by rumourmongering, or even suggesting that the Government had something to do with the death of the late Dr. Ouko stand condemned today and always. The late Dr. Ouko served the country and he would have been the last person to be associated with anything that could discredit the Government or the country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, when you look round the East African countries, you find that Kenya stands out as a peaceful oasis; a country that does not interfere with its neighbours' affairs. Kenya stands for its own development and its people. Look, round and see what has been done in the fields of education, health, and roads. Look round and see the school children who have come to listen to us. These children want a clear peaceful future because they are the leaders of the future. Look round and you will see evidence of freedom of the Press. Look round and see those HANSARD reporters. Look round and you will see people going about their businesses peacefully. Who on earth would want to disturb that peace? As was said, whoever was behind the killing of Dr. Ouko did not have his mind with Kenya.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when I look at my notes, I find that I have put a question mark where I have made a note of Nyanza Province elected Members of Parliament from Siaya, Kisumu and South Nyanza myself included. These leaders gave a Press statement in support of the Government. They did not mix matters over what happened, but they also did not mix matters to say they were following the President and the Government and that they would not allow anybody to come between them. For those who still doubt this, I repeat that that is our stand.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the Presidential Address, our President said that there should not be any "siasa za kumalizana". He also said that we should only be fighting for service to our people, and delivers the goods to them because that is what they want. Are we helping the President, we as a whole, the Press included, or do we like to put catching phrases in order to sell our newspapers? Do we ever say the goods things the country has done? It is time we started serving the President.When I was working for the Barclays Bank Limited some years ago, and I was being entertained in London by the top level managers of that bank, somebody asked me: "What will happen when President Kenyatta goes?" And I answered him: "Whatever happens, we will be in Kenya." And we are still in Kenya. If you ask me what happens now, I will tell you that His Excellency President Moi is here and we are with him. There should be no doubting Thomases. I say this because many people forget that for any section of the Press, all that is wanted is where there is a weakness and then it plays up. I am not against you, members of the Press who are present here, but what I am saying is that you should tell the truth and remark on what is not correct.</newspeech><newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Address the Chair.<subheader><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR RECLAMATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF ARID, SEMI-ARID AND WASTELANDS (Mr. Nyakiamo): I am sorry, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, I should really be addressing you.I will now go back to the services to the people. Forgetting all has passed and what has been said, and taking into account the fact that stability is there and we are going ahead. Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers should help us render services to our people.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, since much as been said here about education, I would like to say something about roads in my area. Since I am the symbol of the Government in my constituency when I get stuck in the mud people say: mano onyale mano onyale!</newspeech><newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: What does it mean?</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR RECLAMATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF ARID, SEMI-ARID AND WASTELANDS (Mr. Nyakiamo): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it means: That will serve him right! They will even go to the extent of saying: "we will not pull you out of the mud because you have not repaired the roads." Let us render to our people the service they deserve.  Let me now say something about the Fisheries Department. Nyanza the people's coffee, tea and industries are fish. I know that you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, know that area. I would like to appeal to the Ministry of Co—operative Development, and the Co-operative Bank of Kenya to find ways and means of helping the people of this area to stand on their feet. They should also ensure that they deliver the goods to the people of this area. I am very serious about this because when our leader tells us to render service to the people and we know what this means we should pool our efforts to help our people.   The other point that I would like to touch on is about the services that this country has rendered to the other countries of Africa. An example of such a service is the sending our troops to Namibia which is now independent. I was very proud today when I saw a picture of our soldiers in the papers and I said to myself, "They look very smart." We are proud of this act and that is why I say that we should sing our praises.	I support.</newspeech>                          <newspeech> MR. KUBO: Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Mudakwa kunipatia nafasi hii ill nami niweze kirlunga mkono Hoja hii iliyoko mbele yetu. Kwanza kabisaningependa kumtolea shukrani MtukufLu Rais kwa yale yote ambayo alitueleza hapa Bungeni na yale aliyotu eleza nje ya Bungekx hili juu ya maongozi ya nchi hii. Pia ningepe nda kumtolea shukjrani kwa trio. Harambee ya juzi ambayo iliweza. kukusanya shs.141 milioni. Ingawa kulikuwa na manung uniko kuwa katika nchi hii wananchi hulazimishwa kutoa pesa, jambo hili la juzi lilionyesha wazijazi kuwa watu wa Kenya ni watu waliokokomacs. kisiasa na wanajua wanachofanya na hutoa pesa zao kwa hiari. Kwa hivyo, jambo hili lilionyesha wazi wazi kuwa yale maendeleo tune fikia tumeyafikia kutokana na moyo wetu wa Harambee na wala si kwa utumiaji wa nguvu. Vileovile ningependa kuishukuru Serikali kwa kuongeza bei ya zao la pamba. Ingawa wakulima wa pamba wamekuwa wakitia bidii sana katika kilimo hiki matatizo yao hayakuwa yaki angaliwa vizuri. Sasa kwa kuwa bei ya zao hili imeongezwa tuna hakika kuwa sasa wakulima wengi watazidisha moyo wa kukuza zao hilo. Hata hivyo ningependa kuiomba Wizara inayohusika ihakikishe kuwa ile kodi ya asilimia tano haitozwi wakulima wa  paxpba kwa sababu. hadi sasa bado hatuna pamba ya kutosha kwani wakati mwingi inatubidi kuagiza pamba kutoka nje. Kwa hivyo lingekuwa jambo la kutia moyo karna kodi hii ingeondolewa. Ingawa kamati za maendeleo wilayani (D.D.C.) zinasaidia sana maendeleo katika nchi hii, kuna tatizo moja ambalo kama halitatuliw D.D.C. zitakuwa na matatizo. Tatizo lenyewe ixamx linatokana na utoaji wa kandarasi kuhusiana na Rural Development Fund. Jambo hili limerudisha maendeleo nyuma sana huko wilayani. Kwa mfano, anaishi karibu na hedikwata ya wv wilaya h4i inradi. wenyewe  uko kilomita 200 hivi kutoka hapo. Wakati anapotakiwa kupeleka kitu kama mchanga huko huomba kama shs.2,000= kwa kazi hiyo wa hali labtfa kama kungetumiwa mtu wa karifaukungetumiwa shs.700=. Kwa hivyo pesa zote za mradi huo zitaishia katika usafirishaji. Kwa hivyo jambo hili linahitaji kuchunguzwa sana. Iiigekuwa bora kama kwa mfano kaniati inataka kuendeloza ntradi wa dispensari, ipewe pesa hizo tvxnunue vvfcu vinavyohitajika katika ujenzi huogepewe Jicisimamiwa na maofis£. wanaohusika katika tarafa hiyo. Jambo kama hilo lingeweza kuisaidia nchi hii kwa sababu pesa nyingi zinazotegwa kwa Rural Development Fund huisha kabla mradi haujaanzishwa. Kwa hivyo hili jambo linahitaji kuchunguzwa wakati wa kupanga nwwb  ya maendeleo huko wilayani.                               Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, tunahitajika lex kuwaeleza wananchi kinganaga kuhusu kuongezeka kwavitu. Hii ni kwa sababu wananchi wengi wanailaumu Serikali wakiuliza ni kwa nini bei:;ya vitu inaongezeka hali mishahara na mapat© h. Hili ni jambo ambalo ningeliita simple economics. Tunahitajika kuwaeleza wananchi kila wakati kuwa bei ya shilingi ya Kenya inazidi kwenda chini kufcakoaana kutokana na kile kinachoitwa inflation. Ikiwa dhamani' ya shilingi ya Kenya inakwenda chini ikilinganishwa na ea kigeni, basi lazimajjritu hapa nchini. iwe juu. Kwa mfano utaona kuwa dhamani ya pesa yetu ikilinganishwa na Sterling Pound haps.zamani ilikuwa sfcs S lakini sasa ni shs. 23=. Kwa hivyo kama tunanunua vitu vya kutumia katika viwanda vyetu kutoka nchi za ngambobasi tutalipa zaidi ambapo atakayelipa zaidi ni yule atakayevitumia xy. vitu vile vitakavyotengenezwa na viwanda hivi. Kwa hivyo kama tutaendelea kuwadanganya wananchi kuwa kuna mtu anayeweza kuviuza vitu kwa bei rahisi zaidiLLnakuwa ni jambo la jiwongo. Kwa hivyo tunahitajika kuwaeleza wananchi kuwa jambo hili linatokana na ununuaji wa k vitu kutdka ng'ambo tukitumia pesa za kigeni. Tusipowaeleza wananchi jambo hili vizuri wataendelea kuwa na wasi wasi.wakisema kuwa mapato yao hayawatoshi. Ni kweli kuwa sote tunajua kuwa mapato yao hayawatoshi na kuwa gharama ya roaisha.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL HERITAGE (Mr. Lalampaa): Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Naibu Spika wa J ftida Ingawa sina hakika lakini ni kama nilimsikia mwenzangu akilitumia neno kudanganya Kama alilitumia neno hilo anaweza kuliondoa kwa sababu halitumiki katika Bunge.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KUBO: Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ninakubaliana na mwenzangu na ninaliondoa neno hilo na kutumia 'jambo lisilolla kweli. Nimekubali kuwa ni vibaya kulitumia neno hilo. Ingawa mengi yamesemwa kuhusu elimu na bei ya vitabu.  ningependa kuongeza kwamba wachapishaji wa vitabu hapa nchini mara nyingi wamelalamika kuwa bei ya karatasi zitolcazo kiwanda cha karatasi kilichoko huko Webuye ni ghali kuliko ile ya karatasi zitokazo ngambo. Jambo hili. IjuneasRyaara vitabu hapa nchini kuwa vya bei ya juu sana. Kwa hivyo ingekuwa borayjxg'ia ili vitabu viwe AJa bei tab da hata tungeanza kutumia hizo karatasi za ng'ambo. kama zina bei nafuu au pia tungeweza kuondoa ushuru wote katika utengeneza ji. wa karatasi ili bei yake iweze kuja chini. Bila kufanya hivyo nina hakika kuwa tutaendelea kulalamika juu ya bei ghali ya vitabu hukukama tujuavyohatuna budi kununua vitabu. Jambo lingne linalohusiana na vitabu ni kuwa ingekuwa bora zaidi kama kitabu kikichapishwa ili kitumiwe shuleni. kitabu ambacho kitatumiwa kwa miaka mingi. Si vizuri kuwaambia wanafunzi kila mwaka wanunue kitabu kingine  Pia kitabu kama hiki kinapopitishwa na kuidhinishwa si kuwa ndicho kitakachotumiwa mwaka fulani kwa darasa fulani ilazima Wizara ihakikishe kuwa kitabu hicho kinaweza kupatikana madukani. Hii vinapitishwa na Kenya Institute of dukani havipati ni kwa sababu mara nyingi vitabu Education lakini ratu akienda                         Bw.

ITimeleta Ho ja hapa kusema kwamba barabara itokayo Mwatate mpaka Taveta jLweiEvs ya kudumuo lakini wakati tunapongojea pesa za kutengeneza barabara ni aibu kusema kwamba barabara ile anbayo ni international trunk road class A ambayo inajulikana wazi ni barabara moja kati ya zile kubwa kama ile itokayo Mombasa hadi Nairobi 1 mvua ikinyesha unawesa kufika Taveta. izara inajrohiisika ilitueleaa kwaiafca ingeleta tinga ya kuitengeneza barabara hiyo lakini ilikuja mara moja na ikarudishwa.

Ningependa kueleza wazi kwamba ingawa killj kuwa na uvumi kwamba viongozi katika wilaya ya Taita/Taveta hawana umo ja baina yao, mambo yale truliyamaliza klnyumbani.

Naibu Spika wa Muda, naunga mkono.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILDLIFE (Mr. Awori): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me a few minutes also to contribute to the Presidential Address	Before I do that, I wish to express great gratitude to His Excellency the President for the manner in which he held this country together at the time of turmoil and great concern among our people. I refer to the time when it was reported that hon. Dr. Ouko was missing to the time when it was reported that he had been killed and the manner in which he had been killed. Without His Excellency's great statesmanship, things could have gone completely out of hand. For that, all Kenyans owe him great gratitude.	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like also to express gratitude to the civil servants who also stood by him and helped him in organising and holding the country together. Here, I would like to point out person in particular who was identified during the period, and that is Hezekiah Oyugi my gratitude go also to. Mr. Kilonzo and also Mr. arap Too. These three people worked day and night to ensure that proper investigations were carried out, proper protection was given to the innocent, and everything went on well.	There were, as usual, some dishonest leaders who tried to use this terrible tragedy for their own end. They tried to cash in. They tried, in fact, to put blame or to imply that certain people were involved we would like very much to condemn that in the same way as we condemned people who were creating rumours.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in. this august House a lot of wonderful things was said about the late hon. Dr.Robert Ouko. In the newspapers, both local and international, many good things were also said about the late Dr. Ouko. If we do believe in everything that was said, how wonderful he was, both as a Minister and a Parliamentarian, then perhaps it is high time that we stopped and reflected as to such a distinguished person should meet such a fate. Is it not time to ask ourselves: "Where are we going?"This, Sir, I refer mainly to the leaders, and if you look at the leaders, they cannot be more than 10,000 leaders in a country of about 25 million people. The masses are always steadfast, and it is really the leaders who should really look at themselves, I ask: "Where are we going?" Are we supporting His Excellency the President? Many leaders try to make headlines and these headlines, in many cases, say very little. Let me be more specific now and discuss His Excellency's Address. It is always a pronouncement of policy as to where and how the country is going. His Excellency has taught us one thing; that we must always be mindful of other people's welfare. In that way, he brought the Philosophy of Nyayo.The Philosophy of Nyayo has three branches, Love, Peace arid Unity. Most of us, whenever we are in public meetings or wherever we are, shout the word 'Nyayo', meaning that we believe in love, peace and unity. But frankly, how many of us really are sincere in what we are saying? If we really did believe in those three branches, making up 'Nyayo', then we would have very little problems.I am sure, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, that there are very many people who sincerely believe and practise 'Nyayoism', but I am also correct in saying that there are very many people who shout 'Nyayo' loudest and yet they do the very opposite because they like to grab headlines. Many headlines do have, terrible consequences, and it is about time that leaders, before they make any statements, however popular they may be either with the public or with the Press, they should consider the consequences.Our newspapers are read all over the world. They are read all the over the coiners of this country, and whenever there are headlines indicating that there is instability in one area or another, this does scare off investors. It does also scare off tourists. We have stated that tourism is now second only to our agriculture in foreign exchange earnings. If we want to continue to develop tourism so that we can earn more money then we, as leaders must avoid making statements that will scare off tourists.In fact, my colleague has just reminded me that tourism has exceeded agriculture. I would like to say here and now that we should be careful as to the statements that we make so that we do- not scare away tourists who are helping this country a great deal.Headlines do slow development. Headlines or pronouncements that scare off people and make it difficult for other leaders to come together to discuss how they can help each other. Leaders are elected or appointed to serve wananchi. A Colleague has repeated, talked of service earlier. We are not elected for self-glorification. We are elected to give a service and no one has given us a better example than His Excellency the President.Kanu is a Party of the masses and all those who are elected to lead. Kanu should not turn it into an 'elitist' party. It should be a party of the masses. We must not use it to harass anyone. We must not use Kanu to instil fear in the minds of the people. If we do that, recruitment into Kanu is going to be slower. Kanu leaders must have grassroots support so as to look after the interests of wananchi.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, unity is the most important ingredient of development. We must guard our unity with everything we have, and support His Excellency the President in everything that he is doing to develop our country. We must not be complacent and simply think that because everything has been going well for us within the last 26 years, things will continue in the same way. We must close our ranks behind His Excellency the President.I want to thank the Government for the sugar factory that is about to be developed in Nasewa, Nambale Constituency, Busia. I know that with the coming up this sugar factory, there will be more employment and generation of funds which, in turn, will help to develop other services such as schools, water, medicine, and so on.I would like to thank hon. Mzee  Moi's Government for the rural electrification that has been implemented in my Samia Constituency. This has, in fact, helped the young people, there who have seriously gone into the Jua Kali industry. This helps to bring better lives to our people.  I would also like to ask Ministries and departments to implement decisions. With these few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. ANG'ELEI: Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda^ kwa kunipa nafasi ili niungane na wenzangu katika Hoja hii ya Hotuba ya Rais. Kwanza, ningetaka kumshukuru sana Mtukufu Rais kwa mambo yote ambayo ameifanyia nchi hii. Kama watu hawajui ni mambo gani ambayo Mzee Moi ameifanyia nchi hii, ingefaa watoke nje, badala ya kukaa hapa mjini tu, ili waone yale maendeleo ambayo Kenya imepata.(Applause)Watu wakikaa mjini tu, huona barabara zenye lami na mambo mengine machache, lakini hawajui ni maendeleo gani ambayo yamepatikana kule mashambani ambako ndiko wananchi wengi wetu wanakoishi. Kule Turkana, kwa mfano, tulikuwa hatujapata barabara ya lami, lakini sasa lami imewekwa mpaka kule Lokichoggio. Hata simu zimefika huko, na ukiwa kule utaweza kuongea na watu kote duniani. Ni maendeleo mengine gani ambayo watu wale ambao hawatosheki wanahitaji? Sisi, wale ambao tumeyaona maendeleo haya kwetu, hatuijui Serikali nyingine isipokuwa hii ambayo tumeonja "matunda" yake(Applause)Ikiwa kuna mtu ambaye anafikiri kuwa ninadanganya, ingefaa atoke nje na kuona vile wananchi wa Kenya watamkatakata mpaka aishe kabisa. Ninasema hivi kwa sababu watu- wachache tu ndio hawatosheki kwa kuwa wana unafiki na hali yao si ya kibinadamu bali ni ya kufikiria mambo mabaya tu. Ninashindwa kujua ni kitu kingine gani anachohitaji mtu mwenye mali, magari na kazi kubwa. Ikiwa umepewa madaraka yote, ni kitu kingine gani unachoweza kuhitaji? Kwa kweli, kama tulivyosema, taabii ikitokea katika nchi hii, wananchi wa kawaida ndio watakaoumia, na yule mwenye uwezo atakuwa ametorokea-mbali sana. Hii ndiyo sababu ninasema kwamba wananchi wa.kawaida ambao hawajiwezi wanafaa kuwa kati kati ya Serikali kwa sababu Serikali hii ni ya wananchi wala si ya mtu fulani binafsiBw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, hapo mbeleni watu fulani walikuwa wakisema kwamba kuna makabila madogo madogo ambayo yalikuwa yakinyanyaswa. Kwa sababu ya mwenendo na uongozi wa Mtukufu Rais kila mwananchi wa Kenya leo amekwishajua kwamba kweli ana Serikali yake. Hii ndiyo sababu ninataka kusema kwamba watu hawafai kudanganyika kwa kuwa wakati huu sio ule wa zamani. Sasa kila mwananchi amefungua macho na anajua.ni nani mzuri na ni nani mbaya, na waJLee wanaodanganywa hawafai kudanganywa tena.Nikigeukia jambo lingine, ningependa kusema kwamba wakati kuna mambo makubwa makubwa mazuri ya kujenga nchi, magazeti yetu hayayaandiki kabisa na kuyahimiza, lakini mtu fulani akichukuliwa na kuhojiwa na polisi, ambalo ni jambo la kawaida tu, magazeti capitalise on it, huku yakisema eti fulani wa fulani amefanyiwa hivi na vile hivi kwamba sio kama jambo la kawaida. Kila Serikali.  huwa na mipango yake kama hii yetu tu. Kila nchi ina polisi wake wa kuchunguza mambo, na kama u mbaya au unamwibia fulani, ni lazima huitwe na kuulizwa maswali. Ni wangapi wetu wamefikishwa kortini na kushtakiwa kwa kukosa kulipa madeni? Hii ni kawaida. Ni kwa nini watu fulani wanapenda to capitalise on mambo madogo kama haya, hali watu hawa ni wachache tu? Kuna kitu gani rauhimu cha kuandikwa magazetini katika personalities? Jambo hili halifahi; badala yake kungeandikwa maneno mazuri tu ya kujenga nchi. Kuna haja gani Hoja ikiwa questioned hapa ngazeti kutoa maneno makubwa juu yake asubuhi ifuatayo kama sio to capitalise juu yake? Hii ndiyo sababu ninaseraa kwamba watu wa magazeti pia wanafaa kuwa waangalifu ili wasiwe wakiandika maneno yanayoweza kuharibu mwenendo wa nchi. Kuandika au kutoa maneno mengine nje kunaweza kuonyesha kwamba watu fulani huenda wanaonewa, lakini hakuna ye yote anayeonewa na Serikali ya Kenya.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, sasa ningependa kuigeukia Wizara ya Ustawi wa Seherau Kame- Wizara hii inahitajiwa kuzihudumia sehemu zile ambazo kwa kweli ni kame, na kuna karibu Shs.200 milioni ambazo zilitolewa na European Economic Community kama mwaka mmoja uliopita, lakini mpaka sasa, hapana cho chote ambacho kimefanywa kwa pesa hizi- Ninasikia tu kwamba kuna watu watato ambao wameajiriwa kazi, na kwamba hawa ndio "wanaozikalia" pesa hizi, huku kila mmoja wao akipata Shs.100,000/= kila mwezi. Pesa hizi zitakapomalizika huenda kazi inazohitajiwa isiwe imefanywa, na ningeisihi Wizara hii, ambayo ndiyo inayohusika, ione kwamba imezigawanya pesa hizi kati ya wilaya zinazozihitaji, yaani zile kame kabisa au nusu kame ambazo zinahitaji kuwa reclaimed. Pesa hizi.zinahitaji kutumiwa katika ile miradi ambayo imependekezwa na kamati za maendeleo ya wilaya. Kwa hivyo, zinafaa kugawanywa kati ya wilaya 11 ambazo zilitazamiwa kupewa pesa hizi Jambo hilo 1ikifanyika, kamati za maendeleo wilayani zitaweza kujua jinsi ya kupanga mambo ya maendeleo katika wilaya mbali mbali. Ninasikia kwamba pesa hizi ziko katika hedikwota kule Isiolo, lakini hata Wahe. Wabunge kutoka sehemu hiyo hawajui zinafanya nini au zimewekwa wapi. Ningetaka huu mpanga wa ASAL uwe wa wialya ambazo ni kazme na utekeleze mipango inayohitajika.Pia, Bw. Naibu Spika, ningependa kuiomba Wizara inayohusika iwafunze kazi watu wanaotoka katika wilaya zilizo kavu kwa sababu hawajapata nafasi ya kufunzwa. Hali yetu ya elimu si kubwa sana na hatuwezi kushindana na Wakenya wengine, lakini yafaa mafunzo kama ya ufugaji wa ng'ombe yatolewe wa wenyeji wa wilaya ambazo zinafuga ng'ombe. Ninasema hivyo kwa ssibabu watu kama hao wakifunzwa wataweza kuwafundisha wenzao wakitumia lugha ya kinyumbani bila shida yoyote.Kuhusu barabara, nataka kutaja barabara moja itokayo Kapedo kwenda Lokori ambayo tumekuwa tukiizungicnzia kila wakati. Tumeizungumzia barabara hii katika mikutano ya kamati ya maendeleo wilayani na hakuna lolote lililofanyika. Ni kwa nini Vizara imefunga masikio kuhusu hii barabara iliyo fupi sana? Hizo kilomita kama 100 zikitengenezwa zinaweza kufungua upande ule mwengine kwa shughuli za biashara na zinginezo.Nikiendelea, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, nataka kuichukua naTasi hii kutaja jambo lingine kuhusiana na Wizara ya Afya. Kuna hospital moja katika sehemu ya Lokori ambayo ilianzishwa na wamishenari. Tangu wamisheni waondoke huko kama miaka mitano iliyopita, hiyo hospitali imebaki bila kazi. Ningependa kuiomba Wizara ya Aiya iichukue hiyo hospital na ianze kuTanya kazi ili kuwasaidia wananchi kwa sababu hakuna hospitali nyingine katika sehemu ya Lokori ambako wananchi wana weza kusaidiwa.Kwa hayo machache, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, naiunga Hoja hii mkono.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Okwara): Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipa nafasi hii ili nami pia nitoe maoni yangu juu ya Hotuba iliyotolewa hapa na Mtukufu Rais alipofungua Bunge. Kitu kikubwa ambacho sisi Wakenya tumepata ni kiongozi ambaye anayafikiria masilahi ya watu wake. Ni wapi katika dunia nzima ambapo rais wa nchi hutembea hadi vijijini kuwaaaikua watu wake? Watu katika kila pernbe ya Kenya wanamjua rais wao. Kwa hivyo, ningependa kusema kwamba kutokana na amani iliyoko nchini Kenya, ni wajibu wa kila kiongozi, iwe ni' Waziri, Waziri Msaidizi au kiongbzi wa aina yoyote, kuhakikisha kwamba amani ye'tu inalindwa kwa vyovyote.vile.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ni ajahu kumwona kiongozi fulani akisimama hap a Bungeni na kuanza kuuliza maswali ambayo wananchi wanamtarajia kuwapatia majibu. Je, ikiwa yeye ni kiongozi, anauliza aambiwe na nani? Ni kwa nini hakuweza kuuliza mbe'leni? Hayo ni mambo ya kuifanya mioyo ya watu kuharibika kwa sababu ikiwa kiongozi' atakuwa akiuliza maswali, basi sijui wananchi watafanya nini.Hapo zamani kidogo katika sehemu ya Butere tulikuwana mtu aliyekuwa akiimba "Nilienda Lancaster House, nilienda Lancaster House".. Lakini hivi majuzi nilipo enda katika Maktaba yetu kuchunguza habari hiyo, nilipata kwamba jina la.mtu huyo haliko katika orodha ya wale watu waliohudhuria mkutano wa. Lancaster House. Watu wengine kutoka Butere pia walienda na wakagundua kwamba jina.la mtu huyo haliko katika orodha ya majina ya watu waliokwenda Lancaster House. Pia, kuna watu wengine ambao hujigamba kwamba walikuwa Mau Mau, ile hali tunaposoma vitabu vya hlstoria majina yao hayako kabisa. Je, hao watu hutba wapi hayo mambo ya porojo?Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, sisi tuna bahati kuwa na kiongozi ambaye huyajali sana masilahi ya wananchi, iwe hi kwa njia ya kujenga shule, hospitali au kwa njia rayingine yoyote. Kila mwananchi wa Kenya amepata kile anachostahili. Ni juu yetu kuhakikisha kwamba tunawasaidia watu tunaowakilisha hapa Bungeni kwa vyovyote il'i nao pia waweze kupata kile wanachotafUta.Nataka kusema kwamba niria huzuni sana kwa kifo cha narehemu Dr. Ouko kwa sababu yeye alikuwa rafiki yangu sana. Hata kama vile unavyojua, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, yeye ndiye aliyenisindikisha hadi kwako nilipokuwa nikila. kiapo cha utiifu. Kuna watu wengine ambao wamekichukua kifo cha Dr. Ouko kufanya mambo maovu na kueneza uvumi. Walikuwa hawana njia ya kueneza uvumi wao, lakini wakati alipofariki wakapata nafasi ya kuueneza na kuilaumu Serikali. Watu hao wanajua vizuri kwamba mambo wanayosema ni ya urongo na ni lazima walaaniwe kwa sababu hatuwezi kuwakubalia kuiharibu jamii yetu ambayo inafuata Nyayo. Yetu ni jamii ambayo inaelewa kwamba lolote linalopatikana katika Kenya linagawiwa kila mtu. Ni ajabu kusikia watu wakiuliza maswali kuhusu watu waliokufa zamani hata kabla wengine wetu hatujachaguliwa kuja hapa Bungeni. Hata wengine wao ambao wanauliza maswali walikuwa hapa hapa katika Bunge hili.ni sijui ni kwa nini hawa kuuliza maswali wanayouliza wakati hub. Je, watajibiwa na nani na huku tunawa tarajia watwambie ukweli wa mambo yaliyotokea wakati walipokuwa Wabunge?Kama vile tunavyoona, nchi ya Kenya imeendelea sana. Tumeendelea sana hata kufikia kiwango cha kugundua dawa ya ugonjwa wa Ukimwi. Nataka kuiuliza Wizara ya Afya isitangaze uvumbuzi wa dawa hiyo sana katika magazeti ya kila siku ball waandike habari hizzo katika medical journals. Hiyo ni njia moja ya kuonyesha kwamba Kenya inaendelea mbel'e. Hata hivi majuzi tumeunda gari hapa Kenya. Je, ni kitu gani kingine tunachotaka kufanya? Sisi tunataka kuwa u& amani ktiksi nchi biiy ill tutrczo kuyaendesha mambo yetu vizurio Kila mtu katika nchi hii yuko huru kufanya anachokitaka "bila kulazimishwa kufanya hivi au vile. Hatutaki mtu yeyote ahaxibiwe rohb yake na mwxn ine na tungetaka waandishi wa magazeti watusaidie katika jambo hili. JTinatoa shukrani kwa waandishi hawa siku ya leo kwa kueleza mienendo ya mtu fulani katika nchi hii. Je, inaweze kanaje mtu yeyote awe hapa leo, halafu kesho asafiri kule ng'ambo na mwishowe kutoka kule na kuelekea up and e rawingine na kadhalika. Kwa hivyo, ni haiH katdsha kumuuliza mtu kama huyo, "Je", matembezi hayo yako yana ma-ana. gani?" tftma. Ubaya ya gani wa kumhoji mtu kama. huyo? Hii ndiyo sababu nilisema kwamba oagazeti ya leo yaoefanya jambo nzuri kwa sababu ya kuliandika jambo hili ili wananchi wajisomee na kttijtta mienendo ya mtu yule0Bw. Baibu Spika wa Muda kuna watu wachache katika nchi hii ambao hawa- tosheki na nia yao rd knjitafutia makubwa na kuihaxibu nchi hii. Mngetaka kuwaomba wananchi watukufu vsw» wajihadhali na watu kama hawa. Katika sehemu ya Butere, kulikuwa na mambo ya uvumi hapo mbeleni kuhusu mienendo ya Serikali, lakini wananchi waligundna kwamba walikuwa wakipotoshwa na watu wachache na wakaamua kuukomesha uvumi huo. Kwa hivyo, wale watu wachache ambao hawatosheki na ambao wanajaxibu kuwapotosha wananchi, ni lazima wafahamu kwamba siku zao ni arobainio ftasema hivyo kwa sababu hapo mbeleni, Kakamegar ilikuwa kama kiwanda cha uvumi, lakini kwa wakati huu, jambo hili limekwisha na hakiina mtu yeyote ambaye ana ugoarvi na mwingineo Hi ni kwa sababu kumekuwa na umoja katika hij baina na viongozi wote katika Wilaya ya Kakamega, na tungetaka umoja huu uzangatiwev Hatutaki mtu yeyote kuingilia umoja wetu kwa ajili ya kujitaiUtia mambo makuu. Bw. ITaibu Spika wa Muda, rdngetaka kutoa shukrani kwa Serikali kwa kuanzisha mipango ya maendeleo chini ya kamati za maendeleo za wilaya. Katika sehemu yangu, ninayo furaha kubwa kwa Kamati ya Maendeleo ya Kakamegay kupendekeza kwamba stima ipelekwe kule Khwisero na Butere chini ya mpango wa kueneza stima katika sehemu puu za mashambanio Uinaishukuru kamati hii; kwa kupendekeza kwamba kusre na Agricultural kule Sutere 	Research Institute  jambo ambalo litawasaidia wakuliaa sana katika sehemu hii. Kwa hayo machache, naunga mkono.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK  DEVELOPMENT(Mr. Nang'ole): ihsante sana Bw  Naibu Spika wa Muda kwa kunipatia nafasi hii ili niweza kujiunga na Wabunge wenzangu kwa.kumshukuru UtukuTu Hais kwa Hotuba yake alipolifungua Bungs hill mnamo tarehe 13 mwezi huui. Kwanza, ningetaka kumshukuru Mwenyezi Mungu kwa kutupatia kiongozi ambaye anamcha Mungu. TTii ndiyo sababu si si katika Kenya irumebarikiwa zaidi kwa sababu baraka za Mwerezi Mungu, sinam fikl a mtu yeyote anayempenda Mungu. Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, mengi yamekwishasemwa na Waheshimiwa Wabunge wenzangu kuhusu Hotuba ya Hais, na maendeleo mengi ambayo amefanya katika nchi s hiio Kwa kusema ukweli uongozi wa Mtukufu Hais ni wa kip eke e na sisi tfakenya tumeutambua Vile vile, jirani zetu wameutambua uongozi huu. Hata hivyo, kuna msemo usemayo kwamba huwezi kumfurahisha kila mtu kwa wakati mmoja na hii ndiyo ikiwa sababu, hata Itukufu fiais ametufanyia mengi, kuna. watu wachache ambao hawatoshekio Lakini ikiwa hawa watu hawatosheki, tungetaka kujua ni kitu gani wanachokitaka. Ingefaa kama wangejitokeza na kutueleza ni kitu gani wanachokitaka» Mtukufu Rais. anawapenda watoto ambao kwa kawaida siku hizi wanajulikana kama watoto wa I rayo. Watoto wote katika Kenya. waziajulikana kama watoto wa Ifcrayo. Vile vile, wananchi wot e niwananchi wa Iayo, lakini wale wachache ambao hawatosheki, tungewataka wafahanm kwamba hawana nafasi katika Kenya ya kaeneza mawazo yaoo.Bwo Naibu Spika wa Muda, sisi katika up and e wa Pokot Maghaxibi, tuliachwa nyuma na Serikali ya ukoloni, lakini tangu Mtukixfu Rais aliposhika uongozi katika nchi hii, tumeendelea sana. Sohemu hii, ili kuwa inajulikana kama sehemu ya a taabu na matata, lakini kutokana na uongozi wa busaxa ya iltukufu Rais, kumekuwa  na anani katika sehemu hii na sisi sote tunaona mbele. Ninajua kwamba kuna sehemu 	zjyingine ambazo pia ziliachwa nyuma na Serikali ya ukoloni, lakini sasa sehemu hizi zimepewa nafasi ya kwanza katika mambo ya maendeleo chini ya uongozi wa Mtukafu Rais, na zimeendelea mbele sasa kama seheoiu ryingine. Kwa hivyo, ni "lazima hawa watu wachache ambao hawatosheki, wafahamu kwamba hawana nafasi ya kueneza uvumiBw.  Naibu Spika wa Muda,  ningetaka kusema juu ya kifo cha marehemu Dirt.  Ouko.  Sisi ambao taliingiakatika Bunge hili  juzi,  tulikuwa na mengi ya kujiftnza kutoka hatkazii hzuml iliyofanywa na marehemu katika n chi hii. Vile vile, kazi yake kuhusu z mambo ya mashanxi ya lcigeni,  ilikuwa ya kupendeza sana.   KWa wakati wote aMblio amdkuwa Waziri wa Maahauri ya Kigeni na Ushirikiano   wa Kimataifa,  marehemu Dkt. Ouko alikuwa akisema ukweli kuhusu nchi yetu na uongozi  wa Mtukufu Rais pomoja na chama kinachotawala cha Kanu.   Ni ajabu kwamba, wakati tulipokuwa na huzuii kwa kifo cha marehmu,  watu wachache walichukua nafasi hii kueneza uvumi.   Fluu ni wakati ambapo sisi  sote kama viongozi tungekuja pamoja na kushau riana iii kujua Artni  ambaye alimuua rafiki wetu Mt. Ouko, Watuwengine walianza kusema mambo mengi yasiyo na msingi wowote kumhusu Mtukufu Makamu Rais ambaye yuko eamoja nazi Napa Bungeni leo.   Watu hawa vile vile, walieneza uvumi kumahuzu viongozi wengine.  Je,  nia ya watu hawa ilikuwa nixes?   Ilikuwa ya kujua waliosababisha kifo cha marehemu Dict. Ouko au nia7:yao. ilikuwa gani? Ningependa kern hi  qtakufu Rais kwa vile   yeye alijua   kwamba mambo kama hayo ni majaribia ambayo  uletwa na   mwovu shetani. Ni kwa sababuhii alikuwa mtulivu   na akaWaleta Wakenya pamoja. Pia ximgmxningeoenda kuwashukirra.viongozi kutoka Mkoa wa Nyanza   kwa kazi r1.737 ri waliyofanya kufUatia kifo cha Dkt. OUko.   Kama viongozi hawa havangekuja pamoja,  mambo mengi yangeharibika.  Wale watu machache ambao walitaka kuleta ftijo,  ingefaa wajue kwamba kama mambo yangeharibika, nao pia wangepata shida kwa sababu shida.haichagui huyu au yule. Kwa hivyo,  ni lazima tujue kwamba sisi katika Kenya tuna ms adui wachache na tunajua kwamba tone moja   la sums likivekwa baharini au ndani ya mtungi,  maji yote e Pribika.   Kwa. x hivyo hatutawaruhusu watu wachache waiharibu nchi yetis. Jambo lingine ambalo ningependa ni kusema ni kwamba Mtuictifu Thais amefanya. mengi katika nchi yetu.  Jana alienda kuungana na ndugU zetu kale Namibia katika sherehe  za Uhuru wa nchi hiyo.   Ajabu ni kwamba badala ya magazeti ya hapa nchini kuwaka habari hiyo katika  mhusu illmrasa wa mbele,  wanatangulia na habari kmmkmxm mtu mmoja tu. .:  Tunahusikaje.nashuyu mtu?   Kile tu anbacho tungependa kusema kuhusu  mtu huyo ni kwamba ukweli utajulikana kutokana na yale ambayo  polisi wamesikia   juu yake. Wakati umefika ambayo ingefaa waandishi wa magazeti waandikehabari   ambalo zitawawezesha wenanchi kujua yale maendeleo yanayoendelea   wala si habari inayomhusu mtu mmoja.   Ni aibLi kwa mtu kuwaita   waandishi wa habari wa kigeni na kuwaeleza vile alivyoshilrwa.   Kwani yeye ni nani?   Si    yeye ni kama weau wengine tu? Mimi, kama mhe. Mbenge wa Kacheliba, nikishikwa   kwa hatia fulani,  sijui trama nitakimbia na kuwaita wanrdishi wa habari na kuwaeleza hivi na vile.  Eili ni jambo la kawaida.   Kitu   cha kusha uganza ni kwamba king watu wengine haw. Kenya wanaofikiria kwamba wao   ni bora zaidi kuliko wengine.  Katiba yetu tnasema wazi wazi kwamba   Wakenya wote   wawe  ""Jazunga, Platajiri,masikiri na kad.balika   ni sawa. na wanalindwa na  sheria za nchi.

WAMBUA  asked the  Minister  for  Health why the  G.K.  vehicle  which  was  stationed  at  Katulani Dispensary  was  taken  to  Makueni  Hospital  in 1987.  <Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT  MINISTER  FOR  HEALTH  (Mr.   Ogur): Mr.   Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,  I beg to  reply. I  would  like  to  inform the  hon.  Member that there was never  a  G.K.  vehicle  stationed at  Katulani  Dispensary.  However, I  am happy  to  inform the  hon.  Member  that Katulani Dispensary normally  asks  for  transport  assistance from Masii or Mwala Health  Centres  who  have  serviceable  G.K.  vehicles,  for referral cases. Drugs  and  medical  equipment  are  normally delivered to  the dispensary  by vehicles  from Machakos  District Hospital  direct. Katulani  Dispensary health  officials may  also  request for  transport  from Machakos  District  Hospital  which is  about 40  kms  away. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  WAMBUA:  Sir;  I  would like to  inform the  Assistant Minister. that  there was a  G.K.  pick-up  vehicle which was serving  both Katulani  Dispensary and KaIawa Health Centre.  The distancebetween the  two  places Is over 25 kms. The Assistant Minister     has  said that  the  vehicle's  from Masii and Mwala  Health Centres should  serve  Katulani and Kalawa,  but  I  do  not think that  is possible  because the distance  between those  two  areas     long  and  the roads  are  in very bad conditions. Therefore,   canthe  Assistant Minister  tell us why that vehicle was removed from those two  health  stations  to Makueni  Hospital,  and yet thathospital  has    about Ebur Land Rovers? Why  can  that  vehiclenot  be retained by those  two  health  stations because  thosepeople  are  suffering?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.   OGUR: Sir,   there  has  never  been  any vehiclestationed  in any  dispensary. A  dispensary  is  the  lowest  institution  in our  set up. We  can  only have  an  ambulance  or  avehicle  in  a  health centre level  or  in a hospital. The  suppliesthat  we  give  to  the  dispensaries are direct from the district level. We  cannot  assign  a  vehicle  to  a  dispensary,  that has  never  happened. Sir,   in 1967,   there  was no  G.K.  vehicle at thatdispensary.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  WAMBUA:  That  vehicle  was  stationed  at  Kalawa Health  Centre,   and  it  was  serving both  Kalawa  Health  Centre and  Katulani  Dispensary. It  used  to  transport  sick  people from Katulani Dispensary,  Kalawa and Masii Health  Centres to the  district  hospital. Therefore,   there  was  a  vehicle at Kalawa  Health  Centre  but  it  was  withdrawn  and  taken  to   Makueni Hospital. It  was  a  G.K.  pick-up  vehicle. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  OGUR: Mr.   Deputy  Speaker,.  Sir,   the  hon.  Memberwants  the  Ministry  to  return  that  vehicle to  Katulani  Dispensary, but  the  statement  that  I  have  given  is  that  there  has  never, been  such  a  vehicle  at  Katulani Dispensary  and  we  cannot supply . a vehicle to  a dispensary. We  can  only  supply  a  G.K.  vehicle  toor an  ambulance  to  a health  centre. In  this  case,  we  have  suppliedthe  two health  centres  with  vehicles. Any  equipmentand drugs  are  supplied to  dispensaries  including Katulani direct  from Machakos  District  Hospital.</Newspeech>"<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MNIISTER FOR LANDS AND HOUSING(Mr.  Mttiso): On a point  of  order,  Deputy Speaker,  Sir. The   Question here  is very specific. In fact  it  is adefinite  statement that  there was  a GE vehicle  stationed atKatulani Dispensary. But the Assistant Minister says that it is not the policy of the Ministry to supply dispensaries with ambulances.   Maybe  the  hon. Questioner did not  check his facts properly.   Can the  hon.  Member,  therefore, withdraw his Question?</Newspeech> "<Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Hon. Mutiso,  you have been in this House  for a long time now. 	that is your point  of order?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND HOUSING (Mr. Mutiso): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I just want to know who is telling the  House the truth.   Is it the hon. Member or the  Assistant Minister?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  WAMBUA: 	Mr. Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  this	 vehicle used to  serve two places  Katulani and Kalawa. The vehicle was  specifically for Kalawa Health Centre.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  FALANA:  On a point  of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Is hon. Mutiso,  who  is  an Assistant Minister,  in order to behave As if he is  in the  Chair? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER : Rona Mutiso  is  quite  in order tostand  on a point  of  order. In fact,  every hon.  Member in thisHouse  is  in order to do that.    The  only trouble with hon. Mutiso is that he was not  on any point  of and that  is why  I am havinga problem with him.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR: BIDU: 	On a point  of  order,  Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir.Hon.  Mttiso  is  an Assistant Minister and the person who is replying to  this  Question is  also an Assistant Minister. Is  it  therefore,  in order  for  one  a Assistant Minister to  stand up  on a point  of order against  another Assistant Minister? 	Is that  in order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBER: 	 Tell us! </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I have  already clarified the matter.</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR.  KIILU:  Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir, I stand to  seek clarification from the  Assistant Minister. 	Since Kalawa is  a Health Centre  and  since  this vehicle was  stationed at Kalawa Health Centre and  it  used to  serve Katulani Dispensary,  could he tell us why the vehicle was taken away. I say this because the distance  from kalawa  to Machakos town is  just too great. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR.  OGUR: Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  if the  hon. Member wants  to put  a Question to the  Ministry to  consider  supplying TA1awa Health Centre with an ambulance he  is  free to do so.    But katulani,  being a dispensary cannot  have  a vehicle.   That  Dispensary has  never had  a vehicle.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: On a point  of  order, 	Mr. Deputy Speaker,  Sir. This  confusion has  arisen because  in the Question it  is stated as  a. matter  of fact that Katulari  Dispensary had a GX vehicle which was  stationed there.   Can the hon. Questioner give us the particulars  of that particular GK vehicle?   That may help the  House.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order!'   Hon.  Wambua has  already  conceded that  there was no  GK vehicle  stationed at Katulani  	Dispensary but  that. there was  one  stationed at kalawaHealth Centre. He  has also told us that it was the  same vehicle which used to  serve both places.   I therefore do not  see  any confusion here.	Also the  answer by the  Assistant  Minister isfairly explicit.	I wonder whether hon.  Wambua   would want  to   pursuethe  same line  or put a different Question as the Assistant Minister suggests. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  WALBUA: Thank you,  Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir. 	I will go  back and get  the particulars of that vehicle and also the relevant  information regarding where  it was stationed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER: 	But you see,  Mt.  Wambua,  the policy of the  Ministry is  that they do not  supply GE vehicles to dispensaries. 	But  they supply G.K vehicles to health. centres. In the late  of that  information could you now consider putting a different Question? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAEBUA:  Yes,  Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Si. 	However,  this vehicle was  stationed at Kalawa Health Centre. 	Katulani Dispensary and Kalawa Health Centre are  in one location. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER: But the  Question is talking  about Katulani  Dispensary. It  is  a  specific  Question and that  is wherethe  problem lies. Perhaps you would like  to take the  advice  givenby the  Assistant Minister: </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIILU:	 Would it  be possible,  Mt:  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,to  know whether this  is the  same  GK vehicle which has been taken to Makueni  Hospital? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER:	Would you like  to respond to thatquestion,  Mr.  Ogur? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  OGUR: Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  with regard to theUtilization of a vehicle stationed at  one place,  I would like tosay that  a vehicle  which is  stationed  at  one particular health centre  can be used to  serve the dispensaries  surrounding that health centre.   That  is  acceptable.   But the problem here  is  that the  hon.  Wambua wants the vehicle to be returned to Katulani Dispensary.   But  I am saying that we  cannot return what has never been there.  There  is no returning of the  vehicle  because no  such vehicle has ever been stationed  at Katulani Dispensary.   But  any GK vehicle  stationed at  any health centre  can give  service to  surrounding dispensaries. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER: I thought  you were responding tohon.  Kiilu’s  question. We have  already heard that  storybefore  and  it  is  fairly  explicit . Hon. Kiilu had asked adifferent  question. What was your Question,  Mr.  Kiiiur for thebenefit  of the  House? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  KIILU:  I had  asked the Assistant Minister to tell us  whether  this was the  same GK vehicle that was mired from Katulani Dispensary to Makueni Hospital. This  is because we knowvery well that Katulani  and Makueni are two different divisions. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Now,  Mr.  Kiilu,  you are also yourself getting it all wrong.	I think we will have  to move  on.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  OGUR:	Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  the  question ofremoval here  does  not  arise.   You can only remove what has been there;   In this  case there is no removal or returning. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY SPEAKER: We have  got to move  on now	becausethe  issues  here  are  fairly clear.   I think the  onus now is one hon. Wambua to come up with a totally different question if he chooses to. But this Question here has been dealt with by hon. Ogur. I will allow the last supplementary question from hon. Falana. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: Could the Assistant Minister tell us whether there is any vehicle stationed anywhere and which gives services to katualani people? </Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Jibu swali hilo, Bw. Oguur.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. OGUR:  Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  health officials  at Katulani  Dispensary may also request  for transport  from Machakos District  Hospital which is  only 40  kilometres  away. Since  thereare  no referral  cases</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON.  MEMBERS:   No!	No! </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, referral cases make a vehicle needed at a health centre. There are more referral cases at a health centre and that is why we have found it necessary to supply health with vehicles. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Hon. Falana asked the Assistant Minister to all tell the house whether there is any vehicle currently giving service to katulani Dispensary. Why has he not answered that question. </Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: wewe unalia? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Katulani Dispensary is well taken care of. All dispensaries are supposed to be taken care of by the existing health centres. So, katulani being a dispensary, the vehicle at the nearest health centre will give service to this dispensary. However, the drugs and equipment are supplied directly by the district hospital. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ARTE: Could the Assistant Minister name the nearest health centre he has just talked about? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Machakos District Hospital is very near to katulani Dispensary just 40 kilometres away. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  WAMBUA: The  Assistant Minister said that the  distance  fromMachakos  to  Katulani is 40 kilometres.  which  I  know  is not correct. He  has never  been tothe  area. I  know that  the  distance  is  longer than 40  kilometres. I,therefore,  request  the Ministry  to  supply  Kalawa,  which  is  a healthcentre,  with  a vehicle  to  serve that area. In  fact,  there  was  a  G.K.vehicle  there     a pick-up   which was  taken to Makueni. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  OGUR: Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,. Sir,  let me make it clear thatMasii  and  Mwala  are  health  centres  and they have  vehicles. But  Katulani,which  is  a dispensary,  cannot get a vehicle. The  supply  of drugs  andequipment  is  being  done  directly  from Machakos  District Hospital. it  isnot. possible  for us  to supply  dispensaries with vehicles.</Newspeech>	Question  No. 6 <Header> Whereabouts of GK.

ARTE,  on  behalf of Mr.  S.M.  Amin,  asked the  Minister  for  Livestock  Development whether he could amalgamate the  functions  of the  Livestock Marketing Division  and the  Kenya Meat  Commission to  form one viable organization in order to boost the livestock industry. <Newspeech>THE  MINISTER FOR  LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT 	(Mr.  Mwangale): 	Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,   I  beg  to reply. The  functions  of the  Livestock. Marketing Division and those 	of the  Kenya  Meat Commission  cannot be amalgamated because  the  Livestock Marketing Division has  now pulled out of the slaughter stock trading activities,  leaving  them  to private  traders  and the Kenya Meat Commission. The  Livestock Marketing Division now concentrates on providing extension services  and livestock marketing services  for  the  entire  livestock  industry. This means that the Livestock Marketing Division now provides  the required marketing services,  not only  for cattle,  sheep and goats,  but also for other sub-sectors  such as  camels,  pigs,  poultry,  rabbits and to  livestock by products  such as  hides  and skins,  wool,  mohair and honey. It wouldnot,  therefore, be  prudent for  the  two organizations  to amalgamate  as  thiswould eliminate the services. given by the Livestock Marketing Divisionto cattle,  sheep  and goats  only. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  ARTE: Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  while  I  appreciate  the answergiven  by the Minister,  could he tell us more about the extension serviceshe  is  talking about,  and mention a few of them that are being done  in thecountry?</Newspeech> " <Newspeech>MR.  MWANGALE:  Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  if I were to talk of the extension services  offered by the Ministry of Livestock Development,  it would take  us  the whole  afternoon. But  I  would  like  to assure  the hon. Member that the  Livestock Marketing Division has been transformed into a much more active  department. It  does,  for example,  rehabilitate the livestock  trading grounds  in the northern and southern range,  and providesmarketing  outlets  in terms of rehabilitating boreholes,  water pans, catchmentsand  so on. This  is  what we are  doing now. .  In fact,  we have a very extensiveprogramme  under both the northern and southern range,  which are under the Arid  and  Semi arid  Lands  programme and they are very successful.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  FALANA: Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  what the  Minister has  justtalked about  is  just in theory. I  say this  because this programme coverspart  of my  constituency. Could the Minister  tell us what has been donepractically,  so far?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MWANGALE:  Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I would like to visit the hon.  Member's: constituency and if there  is any problem: in terms of what. Is practical on the ground  will be able  to either demonstrate that to him or be able to explain  it to him when I see it done.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR..ANG'ELEI:  Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir, could the Minister tellus exactly what the position is because formerly,  the Livestock Marketing Division used to buy  livestock from the North Eastern Province and other  areas  but today this  does  not happen? What services  does he say theLivestock Marketing Division  is rendering  because we do not see them doinganything?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MWANGALE : Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,. Sir,  the only time the  LivestockMarketing  Division got  involved in the purchase of livestock in pastoralareas  was  during the  1984  drought period. Indeed,   in  any situation where we  have  a drought or where we require the  Livestock Marketing Divisionto purchase animals  from these pastoral area,  I will authorize that. Butfor  the  time  being,  the  cattle traders as well as the Kenya Meat Commission,are meeting all the conditions required for the marketing or buying ofcattle.  Therefore,  there  is  no need for the  Livestock Marketing Division to  be  directly  involved  in the purchase of livestock from these area. May  I  also  say  that because  of the purchase of livestock at that time by  the  Kenya Meat commission    in 1984 and 1985   we ended up losing so     much money in the Kenya Meat Commission because we were buying the animals on what we  call  arrival  basis. We  have now realised that does notwork. The  Kenya Meat  Commission now buys  the animals  directly from thetraders or the  farmers. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  ARTE: Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  the  Livestock Marketing Divisionwas  rendering the  people  of Mandera,  Garissa and other  far–off areas good service  by buying their livestock.  These  people  depend on Livestock. Could the  Minister tell  us  who  is  rendering that service because the people have the  livestock but they  have no way of transporting the animals  the  Kenya Meat  Commission factory at Athi  River  or its  plant of mombaza? </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  MWANGALE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Members from these  areas  know  very  well  the  reason why  the  Kenya  Meat Commission  (K.M.C.)  lost,  failed  and  collapsed was  because  a  lot of  those  animals  had diseases which were  not detectable when the animals  were  being sold to  the  K.M.C.  live.It  is  important</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  ARTE: On  a  point  of  order,  Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir.With  all  due  respect  the Minister  knows  that  he has  qualified veterinary officers  in each station.  He  should not  make  the loss of  the  K.M.C.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  DEPUTY  SPEAKER:  Order,   hon.  Arte!   I thought you were raising a  point of order Why  are you raising an entirely  different issue?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  ARTE: 	Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,   I am  trying to inform  the  Minister  that  it  is  not  true  to  say  that  the  K.M.C. made  losses  because  of  diseased  animals  because  he  has  qualified veterinary officers  deployed in every  station.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MWANGALE:  Mr. Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,   if the  hon. member  had  listened  to  me  carefully  he  would have realised that there are some  diseases  which  you  cannot  detect  unless  the animal has  been slaughtered  and  opened.  The  hon.  Members  from these  areas know very  well  that  we  have  a  lot  of movement  of  cattle  from    neighbouring countries, in  particular  Somalia  and m Ethiopia.  They should further  be  aware  that  because  of  the  problems  that we have had  in the  past  of  failing to  manage  our  holding grounds  in those areas the diseases  have  been  able to  spread  and reach as near  as close  areas  as  Nyeri which were  free  from  some of these  diseases. So  we  are  now trying to  fight  out  these  diseases  in  these  areas. The  reason why we  are  not  buying these  animals the  waywe were buying them before  is precisely because we  do  not  to  bringin  an  animal’s which  is infected become the  K.M.C.  willend  up losing because they have  been given a condemned animal.  Apart  from that,  Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  re organising  the  entire  meat  processing programmes  in  the  country.  We would now want  in  the near  future,  and  I hope  in  the  very  near future,  to  be  able  to  provide  slaughter houses  in  Isiolo  so  that  the  animals  can  be  slaughtered there before  they are  brought  into  the markets.  We  also  hope  to  provide  a  slaughterhouse  in  Garissa, somewhere  in  Tana  and  in  Marigat  or  Kerio  Valley  so  that  these animals  are slaughtered  at  source  rather  than  being transportedto  the  K. M. C. These  are  the  problems  we  are  trying to solve . </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  SALAT:	Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,  while  appreciatingthe  answer  given  by  the  Minister  that the  K.M.C.  as  well  as the Government has  lost  a  lot  of money  as  a  result  of the  Livestock Marketing Division 	(L.M.D.)  purchasing  animals  on behalf of the K.M.C.,   could he tell the  House why the K.M.C. has now suspended all the  orders  given to  the  cattle  farmers  to  provide the K.M.C. with cattle?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  MWANGALE: Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  thecapacity for  slaughter  is between  700  to  800 heads of cattle  here. in Nairobi  and just  about  300  per  day  In Mombasa. So  bothplants  have  a maximum  capacity, of between 1,000  and  1,200  headsof  cattle  per  day   What  has  happened now is this;  initially whenwe  opened the  K.M. C.  there was the usual  cynicism on the pal t ofmany  traders  that they were  not going to be paid on the block whenthey brought  in their animals. But  because  the  Government hadallocated  enough funds  for the purchase  of these animals,  the supply     boomed  from between 200 to 300 heads  of  cattle  per  day to  between1,200 and 1,300 heads of  cattle per day in Nairobi.  As I  have  already   said the  capacity  is between  700  and 300  heads  of  cattle per  day. As result the K.M.C. is forced to hold for a day or two until  the animals  which are  within their bomas  are  reduced because   the  K.M.C.  cannot  slaughter 1,000  or 1,200  heads  of  cattleper  day  since  they  do  not have that capacity. We  are  now in  theprocess  of  rehabilitating  the  factory  itself  and we  hope  that  within six months  it will be  able to cope with the quantities of  cattlecoming  in  from  all  the other  places.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MALEBE: 	Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,   I would like the Minister  to  elaborate  on the functions of the  L.M.D.  because  from the  Question it  seems  as  if  it  is  duplicating the functions  of the K.M.C. This  is  why  the  Questioner  is asking for the  amalgamation of  the  two.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MWANGALE: 	Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I think  the hon.  Member  was  not  listening to  me  earlier  on when  I mentioned the functions  of  the  L.M.D.   Let me very briefly repeat what  I had said. The  purpose  of the  L.M.D.  today is  twofold. One,  it  is to  provide the market  information to  the traders  as well as to the K.M.C. for them to  know the  number  of livestock  available in every area.. 	They will  be  able,  for  example,  through our  Ministry's Departments  both of Veterinary  and Livestock in the  districts, to  say  how many  cattle are  available  at  a particular given point and at what prices for the farmers to be able to  sell to the traders and make good profits. In  other  words  the main purpose  of that division is to ensure that they  provide the market  information coming from every area of every  district  so  that farmers  can know exactly at what price to sell their cattle. Secondly,   it  is  to  ensure  certain services like rehabilitating,  and  I want  to  emphasise that point,  that in the Ministry  today  we  have  all  over  the country very large tracts of   land. For example in Isiolo we have la about 300,000 hectares  ofland which  we  call  livestock ka holding grounds. Such  holding grounds  can be  found all  over  the  country  like in Mariakani,  Tana River and Garissa.   The purpose of these holding grounds is to provide the routes for the movement of cattle and the control of diseases as the cattle leave from one area to another to be inspected by a veterinary division so that these animals are clean from the diseases as they come into the market areas:,.  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the role of the L.M.D. is not only to manage livestock marketing grounds but also to ensure that the district or county councils maintain the auction yards.   We should be able through the Ministry to assist the county councils to rehabilitate them to ensure that they are functioning so that the farmers have a market for their livestock.  There are other services that we provide but we are in the process of revitalising the Ministry and the entire Livestock Division so that the farmers may benefit from the decontrol. of meat prices that the Government has done. </Newspeech>"Question No. 20   <Header> Completed Water Sanitation Projects  in Kinango  </Header> MR.

MWEU: Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  currently,  the  programmeintends  to  rehabilitate  and make new dams,  as many as eight. The  problems  that we  have  had is that we have had problems with rain and equipment. <Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MALEBE:  On a point  of  order,  Mr.. Deputy Speaker,  Sir. Does  the Assistant Minister imply that the Ministry cannot programme to  have  enough equipment,  particularly when they are  being financed by SIDA?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

I wonder whether the  hon.  Member, Mr.  Malebe,  was  in order to be on his feet while  you were talking?   Was he  in order?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER:	No.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  FALANA: Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I want to  congratulatethe  Assistant Minister for the  answer which he  gave  because  he  was very honest. When he was  asked whether he was  satisfied with thework being done,  he  said  ""no"": Could he  tell the  House what  heintends to  do  so  as  to  satisfy himself?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  MWEU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,  one,  we  have had aproblem in getting the  equipment. We  advertised for this workand  the  contractor who  was  awarded the  job did not have   enough equipment. When the  work was re advertised for the  second time,the same  contractor was  awarded the  job. Again,  he  did not have. enough  equipment.Further, this SIDA project does not have equipment of its own. Therefore,  we  have  to  rely  on equipment from other contractor. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG’OLI: Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  while we  accept  thesekind  of answers,  it  looks  as  if the Wrinis144  of Water Developmenthas  a problem. For instance,  they do  not know how long some  of these  programmes  will take. From their answers,  they do not  seemto  have  a deadline  as to when some  of these  projects  should be completed. They keep on re advertising for the work; Yet  the  people  in Kinango Division are  suffering. If the  contractor doesnot have  enough  equipment  to  do the work,  are  there no other contractors  in the  area?   If  so,  why is  the same  contractor  being  offered  the   job? This   is  corruption  in  the  Ministry. Whyis  the   same  contractor  who   is  not  moving  being  offered  the   job?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MWEU:  Mr.   Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,   I  want to rule  out  the element  of  corruption. What  happened was that  we  tendered  and the  person  who  applied was one.  We   did  not  go  in  for  him. We  retenderedso  as  to   get  more  people,   and  the  same  person  tendered  for  the  sameWhat  do  we   do? We   cannot .force  people  to  tender  for  a  job  if  theydo  not  want. So,   what  we  have  done   is   that  we  have  given  the   jobto   the  person who applied for it. This   is  now  the   contractorI  am  talking  about.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.   BIDU:  Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I am happy that the Assistant  Minister  has   just  said  that  he  is not  satisfied with the work  being  done   there I  want  to   tell the  Assistant   Minister, through  the  Chair,   that  these  two  dams  that  he  claim have  been rehabilitated, are  not  complete. I was there Fridayand  they  are  not  complete. Could  he  make   a  physical  check andcome   and  give  us  the  position? Tell  us  the  truth.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  MWEU:  Mr.   Deputy.  Speaker,   Sir,   I  could  do  that very Well.However,  what  I. know is  that  the  Bomani project is  complete  exceptfor  small,   small things  that  are  remaining. There  is a big  amountof  work  done  in the  two  dams. In. fact,   you  will  find  that  what hasbeen  done   is  something  like 90  per  cent. Therefore, 90  per  cent  ismore  than the  per  cent  that  is  remaining to  be  done.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MALEBE:  Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,   Sir, I note  that  thisproject  is  being  financed.  by  SIDA, and  recently  there  was  a problemwith  SIDA  projects  that  was  highlighted  in  the  newspapers. SIDAwas  complaining  that  there  was  corruption within  their  projects,and  that  their  projects  were  not  getting  completed  or  finishedbecause  of  problems,   either  financial  or  administrative. Now,  thisParticular  Kwale  project  is  a  SIDA financed  project. Can  the  Assistant  Minister tell us whether the bottleneck of       Financial nature, or in the Ministry?   Why do STDA financed projects Seem not to  be  taking off the ground? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MWEU: Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I have just said thatthis  project does not have its own equipment and,  therefore , itbecomes  difficult to manage. We  cannot  blame  the  Ministry becausewe  do  not have  equipment for it. So,  what we have  done  is totender for a private  contractor. However,  funds  are there. </Newspeech>"Question No. 34<Header> Title deeds  for Plot Owners in Chepalungu </Header> MR.  arap  SOI asked the Minister for Lands, andHousing   when the  plot owners In Pingwa Sub location,  Chepalungu Division andKaitet Ranch will be  issued with title deeds to facilitate  them develop their Plots.THE MINISTER FOR LANDS AND HOUSING"<Newspeech> (Mr.  Mbela): Mr.  Deputy Speaker, Sir,  I beg to reply, The Answer is  In two  parts.(a)  The  plot owners in Pingwa Sub location, Chepalungu  Division, will be  issued with title deeds  to  facilitate them to develop their plots  as  soon as the  demarcation of the forest area Is complete and the maps finally printed by the Survey of Kenya.

MBELA: Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is obvious that the hon.Member has  not  understood the nature of the problem in that area. When  anadjudication section  is  declared,  it  is presumed  that the relevant committee will only work within the  relevant trust land.  In  this  particular case,  the adjudication officers started adjudicating a part of the forest area and surveyors cannot move  in  and  start demarcating  the  area until  the area is degazetted so that  it  ceases  to  be a forest area. I  am  aware  that  the  people  there  have  been living there  for  a  long  time,  and  that  is why  it has  been accepted that,  instead of  letting continue  to  be  a part of the  forest area,  it should be degazetted so that wananchi  can have  it.

Are  they  individuals  or a group who are  not settled  in  that  land?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  MBELA:  Mr.  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  the people who have made  objections  have an interest in that  particular piece of land.    Some  of  them  claim    That they were  left out, and  this  is  why the 20 title  deeds  that were issued  earlier had  to  be  recalled so that the whole  dispute  is  resolved before  we  issue the  other 42  title  deeds.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

I heard him very well say that surveyors have not gone to the area,meaning  that  he  was  hiding  information on  degazettement.  Although he  says  that I  am  not conversant with  this  local problem,  I  heard him well say  that surveyors have  not moved  into  the area,  but his answer should have been,  ""The area has not been degazetted,  and we  are  degazetting  it  in three months. Surveyors  will  move there  the  following month."" We  now know that degazettement will be done  in three  months,  but we  do  not know when surveyors are moving into the area.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  MBELA: Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I  thought the issue here wasquite  clear. I  explained  that this  is  not a normal exercise of an adjudicationcommittee  doing its work properly. The  committee went beyond  its  boundaries,and  this  is  why we  had  to go  into  this other process  to make sure that whetherother title  deeds we  issue are not against the law.

First of all,  I would like to say  that we ashon. Members of this House have all agreed that   our. President has done everythingpossible to enable this country to be where it is today, as the stronger and mostpowerful country on the Continent of Africa.   When President Moi. Took over theleadership in this country, many people through that this leadership was not goinglast.   However,  Sir,  we can now say that. this country has succeeded becauseof the effort by His Excellency the President to mould one Kenyan society, andmost Kenyans knew this.   However, what surprises me is the attitude of certain leaders in this country who are supposed to know better than others. Some ofthese leaders have been In this Parliament much longer than I have that is, since   1963.   Some of these people mere founder members of this House, but there isA crisis in the country, they have chosen to sit quiet and say nothing. I am  sayingthis because it is important for us to know that this country started with a multi party system Which brought about a lot of problems, and that is why, through thewisdom of these founder members at Independence, there was an agreement to createone political party. Eden under that  one political party under the leadership ofthe late President Kenyatta,  there were  still certain people who were not satisfiedjust because they were power greedy.However,  the late President Kenyatta said,  ""Okay, if some people in thiscountry are greedy for power,  then let them start their own political party"",mhich later brought about  a lot of problems.   The lesson we learnt from that multi   party system in a multi-tribal society such as ours was that of tribalism Whose end product was violence. We witnessed this kind of violencebefore K.P.U ( Kenyas Peoples Party) was banned. We have been operating undera one-party  system of  Government and Kanu as a party has became the pivot of All the   tribes and all the ethnic  and religious groups in this country.   It is through that one single party that we have been able to  achieve what we have now achiev.Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir, Kanu became the only ruling party in this country and wananchi together with leaders supported it right from the beginning because they they had experienced earlier on regarding the multi-party system of GovernmentAfrican society is a multi-ethnic  society and therefore,  if we want to create one United Kenya,  a one party-system of Government is the only solution.However,  over the years,  leaders have come together, not onlyto make the party democratic, but also  to strengthen and  vitalizeand streamline its operations.   The party has now gone ahead and pertain procedure's to ensure that the ordinary mwananchi participates fully in that party.The queueing  system is indigenous   because it enables the ordinary Kenyan to be. able to elect those going to contest in a general election by use a secret-ballot to choose their leaders.   Where else can you get such a system.2 Mr. Deputy Speaker,  Sir, there is not one single society anywhere In Africa  Which is as  dynamic  and bent on a free enterprise as Kenlya. Today, we have a free enterprise system within a very powerful and open single party system  of Government..  This enables every Kenyan in both the private and public sector, to  engage   in a free enterprise system.   This party is indigenous and we must defend it.   Today, there are people who still believe that they can grab power through tribal parties.   We would like to tell these people, particularly those who have been here long enough and claim to be the founders of Kanu, to come forward and defend the party and not to sit one the fence.   When there is a crisis these people choose to keep quiet and they slowly appear as if they are synical. We want our people to know that for Africa to succeed, it must draw as away from  the idea of multi-party system of Government   Success of any country lies in    in a one party system of Government because this is the only  system  that can enable the various ethnic groups in a country to come together to form onenation.  From there, we can perhaps talk about having multi-party system of Government during the first or second century after our Independence   Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am amazed  about the senior polititions who sit on the side  silently  when there is a problem and only leave it to other Members of Parliament to fight  it as if they  were the only  ones. This  President  has enabled.  the  so-called powerful Kenyans to purpose untilthey have gone to the extent of defying the police. I myself was picked up during Mzee Kenyattats time because of the   J.M. Kariuki case but we never talked.  Once you were asked to go, you  wentand you sat there  and listened  as decisions were passed. Why does somebodybelieve today that you can defy a security officer and later the Press and tell them what transpired?  What is this boisterous behaviour of some of the so called leaders and yet they claim they                in this In fact I am, surprised that some of them were. in the Cabinet with us. Today, we have people who claim that: they want to be leader that they do not have sense  humanity they  do not know  where we are  What is  it that is making people  believe that  they can. challenge the Government any time they want to do so? Even the people with very little    brains Who do not know Where we have come from and how Independence was  fought for,        are now challenging the Government.  They do not even remember   that, the  founders of' this  nation  suffered  and that blood was  shed to get  the state  where  It as  today.. Sir, some of them believe that they can be left to go through all    kinds ff propaganda stations and that when they are picked today, the  casting Corporation. (BBC) will quote them.  To me, if the BBC can quote you, then it means that you are, in fact, a traitor to this country.(applause)There are many traitors and I want them to know that today.  I would like to warn my hon. brothers in this Souse that you are responsible for yourconstituencies in this country.  Let us now allow anybody to thin   that they  can get away with anything.  All these people who are talking out there are known by us senior politicians in this Souse.  We should tell them the truth  to the effect that. we are fortunate as a country to have a president under whom my shall continue having   a one party political system0. We in this Parliament will never sit again to amend the Constitution to allow                  the  existence  of another political party.  We amended the constitution to allow us have a one party system and I remember the     for Kikuyu,  Mr.  Chatles Njonjo who was then   Attorney-General,length as to why kanu should   be adopted as the only political party in the country,  and were satisfied. The charactersare now claiming that they want a liberal   party system„  Sir, we will not change. President Moi took over the leadership of this country in 1978 and this problems we experienced before that time should not be re surfaced. We do not want somebody to talk about the J.M. Kuskuki care.Let us all take. as a. lesson whatever  happened thatof' Mr. Waruru. Kanja coming. here to say  that. we want. a revival of that happened before will create problems and we do not want  The past is gone and we are, dealing with the  present.

Sir, just  like  my hon.  colleagues,   I avail myself this, opportunity to   express  and share with  my  dear Kenyans the       sadness  in  the  loss  of  the late hon. Dr. Robert ouko. Sir, Ifully support,  particularly on behalf' of  the  KaIoland peoplewhom  I represent  the  good  steps  taken by the  Government in resolving that very  tragic  and calamitous  episode..  Sir,  turning to  His  Excellencys note key  address, Kenyans  are  blessed  and  richly  indulged with  a  leader  in  the calibre  of  His  Excellency the  President. This has once again beenaepitomised by the words of wisdom that he  has  spelt  out  and  the guidelines  that  he  gave  us  in  his  key  note  address.I  would like  to  touch on  few issues.We  in  Kenya, under his  leadership, have  enjoyed peace love  and unity. With  peacewe  have  been  able  to  forge  ahead with  development,   and unity has  made  our  development. pace  to  be  faster than  any  of our neighbours. We are  the  envy  of  many  in  Africa  and the world. It  is  because  of  that  development  that  we  have  in  fact  created enemies  all. round us,  not  only  outside  Kenya,  but  also  a  few within  Kenya. Sir,   I  would like  to  gh  congratulate  His  Excellency  the President  for  all  the  achievements  that  this  country has experienced,   and particularly  in  the  recent  record  breaking.   bursary fund Harmbee which  collected Kshs.141.8  million: what showsthe  kind  of  country Kenya  is  and  the  support  that  His Excellency  the President has  from the  entire  Republic. Let  anyone  tell which  other  country led by  their  President has  been  able on to  collect; on  a voluntary basis the  magnitude  of  funds that we  have  been  able  to  collect under  the  Harambee  system I would therefore,  like  to  call  on  all  the  Kenyans  to  support  .          Heartectly whole  His Excellency  the  President and the  Government  in  the  efforts  of  bettering  mankind  in  our  Republic  His Excellency the  President  has  gone  right  round the world for   the  love  of  humanity.  We  have  seen his love  for all  Kenyans. Let us all follow him,  let us  be  solidilly behind him in action, not  just  in  words. We  must  support  him  day  and  night.  Mr.   Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,   I  would  like  to  emphasise. that  support  of  His  Excellency  the  President  in various  aspects. One  of  them  is  certainly  a  message  to  the  rumour  mongers. We shall  not  be  in  support  of  His  Excellency  the  President  if  we  indulge  in  rumour  mongering. I  share  my  hon.   colleaguesconcern  in  condemning the few people  who  are  after power. They  are  drowsy  with  their  money  and they want  toupset  the  modalities of  this  country  with  their  money  byspreading. rumours  and  so  on. They. should  be  condemned,  and wecondemn  them  whole heartedly. Sir,   I  would  like  to  ask  all  Kenyans  in various  walks of  life  to  support  His  Excellency  the  President. Let  me  justmention  a  few ways  in  which  we  can  do  that. We  commandthe  industrialists  have  done  in  this  country. They  haveassisted  the  economy  of  this  country  to  forge  forward. We  commend  them  highly,   but  when  there  is  a  little fall short somewhere,  we  should  not  start  crying  that  everything ha gone amiss. As  we  continue  to  perfect  our  industrial policies and operational  aspects  where we  go short, they shou1d bear with  us    We  certainly accept  criticisms,  but  a  small.hitch  should not  be taken to that  the  country has gone tothe  dogs. That  was  what  happened sometimes  back, and  that  was,.    , one  area. where rumours were:spiedd       : therefore,  call  upon   Industrialists  to  have  that  fOrebearance  of  accepting  the Governments  industrial  policies. Sir,   I  would  also  like  to  thank  the  businessmen.  They  have  done  this  country  a  lot of  good.  They  have  helped  this  country forge  forward, but once  again I  would  like  to  request  them to  shy away  completely  from hoarding  and  being involved in  illegaltransactions.  A  businessman will  not  be  supporting  President Moi  if for  example he  wants  to  get rich  quickly and therefore  exports  cashellnuts leaving  the  Kenya  Cashew  Nuts  Factory without  nuts  and then throwing hundreds  of people out of  employment. That  is  certainly  not  supporting  His  Excellency  the  President.     I  therefore  call  .  upon  all  businessmen  to  come  forward  to  be  sincere  and  fair. By  all  means,   they  should  get  rich,   but  get  rich  the  right way.  They  should  not get  rich  by  denying  other  people  their  rights.  Those  people  who  do  such  things  such as exporting   nuts  cashew    must  stop  doing  that,  and  by  so  doing that will be helping the  President. I  would  like  to  call  upon  the  banking  industryand  the  financial  world  to  consider  new  initiatives on  how to assist  the  African  entrepreneurs  in  getting, into  business. Why  do  we  always  have  to  wait  for  His  Excellency the presidentto  come  up  with  all  the  initiatives. We  do  not  want to hearthem  crying  Of  financial  squeeze.  They  know  the  rules of. the  game very well and, therefore, the  financial  institutions Should  come  up  and  assist  the  African  entrepreneurs,  and in that  way  they will  be  assisting  and  supporting  His  Excellency the  President. Sir, I would  now  like  to  turn  to  the  professionals.   These are  the  people  who  are  in  the front fore   in  this  Republic .They are supposed  tbibe  the  leaders. They  are professionalsy.tint the  recent  moves  . in  the  Law  Society  of Kenya were pathntic.The  very people  who  contribute  to  the  laws  and their  interpretation are taking the whole world by surprise.  In fact what is happening in  the  Law  Society  of  Kenya  is  making the  whole  world  wonder what  is  happening  in  Kenya.  So, Mr. Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I call upon all the professionals in this country to support His Excellency the President by making sure that they observe their professional ethics.    As professionals they should take the lead in showing the rest  of the  country what supporting His Excellency the President means.   They should not  go  out in  disarray erd  start  fighting  power  battles;  One  wonders what they are up to.  Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I would also like to call  upon every other Kenyan,  in whatever role  they are playing in running the  affairs  of this country.       All  Government  officers in particular must support  HiS  Excellency the President by making, sure that  they do their work properly I would particularly call upon all Accounting Officers to make sure that they comply strictly with budgetary Principles;   They must utilise properly the little resources that this House votes for them.   But you will find that what happens time  and  again is that these people incur expenditures that have not been provided for in the Budget When that  happenS, it  is not supporting  His Excellency the President.   I therefore call upon all the  officers  concerned to hake sure that they do follow strictly all budgetary principles;   His Excellency the President says  quite  clearly,  in his  Speech,  that we must have  initiatives. call upon all Kenyans to have these  initiatives  and make  sure that we propel  our  economy forward for the  betterment  of mankind  in Kenya.

Members  in expressing my gratitude to His  Excellency the President for the manner in which he  delivered the Presidential  Address  on the occasion of the  StateOpening of the  Third  Session of the  Sixth Parliament A  lot has been said about the disappearance and subsequentdeath of our  late brother,  Dr.  Ouko. Dr.  Ouko  disappeared and won laterfound dead,  and I  am  happy  to  say  that  I  join the  Government  in  itsefforts  in trying to  locate  the murderers of Dr.  Ouko. As  our Presidenthas  puts it now and again,  no stone will  be  left unturned to trace  the cause of the  death. That should be the end of discussion of the matterand those trying to damage our hard won Independence and our hard wonstability  are  those  disgruntled. elements who have, been looking for the leadership of this country; but they cannot get it becausethey are not.  God blessed to get it, and they are not worth to lead this nation. Therefore, I feel it is time for all of us, peace-loving Kenyans, to need His  Excellency the President's  advice    The peace  he has  been.  To all of us is not for  him alone but for all We have all benefitted from it and we shall continur to do so.      We  can  all see and witness the problems  that  our country  is in   Here, want to single our the unemployment problem. This problem  is, and will continue  to be  there,  but the Manner  is which our country  is  being led towards high strides  in development will definitely endthe unemployment problem    Destabilising peace  in this  country will notsolve  such demanding problems  in our society. It  is  not only  Kenya whichis  faced with  this  problem. Those  who,  have not travelled to other countriesto  see  for themselves  the  intensity of the  unemployment problem  in some countries,  will  continue  to  create problems  and instability  for  their own selfish ends. Last month,  I  was  lucky to travel  to  Senegal where  I  represented   Kenya  in an environment meeting and I saw what is going on in that country. The  country has economic  and unemployment problems,  yet those people are still  peaceful.    I  also  toured some parts  of Accra. What  I  saw there  is nowhere  near what we have  in this  country,  in terms of development, stability and the health of the people. Our  people  are  healthy enough. It is,  therefore,  only fair and logical that every Kenyan works hard towards  the further development of this  country. Given time,  I am sure we  shall achieve more and a lot of problems will be alleViated.    Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,  during the  last Jamhuri  Day, our President outlined many things,  but among what  I  remember is  the establishment of a fund by the  Vice President and Minister for Finance to  start ruralindustries.  This is  a big step thatwe are  looking forward to. We ars eagerly waiting to see what the Vice-President and Ministerfor Finance  is going to do about it. We  expect that as soon as enoughmoney has been  accumulated, industries will be started in the  rural areas: not necessarily in big towns  like Nakuru or Eldoret    We expect such industries  to be  started  in places  like  Olkalou, Kipipiril or  such remoteplaces.,   All  we need  is time:   and peace to our President and the  Government I appeal  to all Kenyans  to heed His Excellency the President's advice  ofmaintaining peace,  love  and unity.I  now want  to  talk about land disputes.   I  am in a terrible situationbecause my constituency  is  a settlement scheme. Three  or  four months  ago,somebody  came  up  with the  idea that the  large plots  owned by some peopleshould be  re subdivided. Those  large  plots  measure either  20 or  15 acreceach,  yet according  to  the  demarcation and planning of the OlkalouSettlement  Scheme,  plots were planned and proposed to be five acres landequivalent.  This  means  that  any marsh land was of 20 acres   would beregarded  as  equivalent  to  five  acres. The  idea  of  sub diving it  to  five  acres  is  wrong. These  are  the  sort  of  people  that  weare  saying are creating unnecessary problems  and bickening by the  people which is bad politics.  I would like to  call  upon  the Government  and the Vice President and Minister  for  Finance, who is  here to listen to my case and  ensure that this does not happen. This  is  because  in that same  scheme we  have  people withabout 50  or 100  acres  who  are  not  being touched. I think  it  willbe  unfortunate  if this  thing is going to  happen   that  poor unlucky  and helpless  people  are  going to  lose  some  of  their  land which they  Live  developed in  the  past  10  and 15 years. I hope  this  thing  will  be  looked  into.  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  ipeoplecaile  facing very  many  problems  from lawyers. This.is  a  subject that  has been  debated upon  on  many occasions. I would  suggest  that  theGovernment should  look  into  the ways  and means  of  creating a certain  body  or  committee  to  look nto  the  activities  and behaviours. of  some  of  our  advocates.  I am  saying so  because  personally  I have    about five  or  six  cases  where, althoUgh  certain family members have  been awarded  compensation by the  courts  for the loss of one of their family  members  because  of  an  accident they have not received a penny   for  the  last  five  years. Some  of  these  people were  awarded compensa tions  of upto Shs.300,000/=. When  these  people go  to  the  advocatesfor  their money,  they are given letters  where and requested to go  back  to  the  advocates!  offices  on the next  day or  several  days later.  Since  these  people    have  to  keep  on  pl ying between their   homes  and the  advocates!  offices  they end up spending thousands and  thousands  of  shillings  without  getting their money.  I have  tried   personally  as  the  representative  of  these  people  to  talk to  these  advocates but they  are  not ready to  listen to  me.  So   I  am le  ft with  no  alternative  but  to  inform the  House  about  this.  The   Government should do  something about this. The  Government  should not  allow poor  and helpless  people   suffer  at the  hands for  of  such  unscrupulous  lawyers who  have  been  educated by the  money from the tax payers who  include these  poor  people. Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  although such unfortunate cases  still  exist, I am sure  that  the  Government  is going to  addresS itself  to  them. All  the  efforts  of the Government  are  gascommendable. I hope  that  soon  we  shall  have  an  answer  to  thisproblem. With  these  few remarks,   I beg to  support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT  MINISTER TOR  AGRICULTURE  (Mr.  Gachui): Thank  you,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  for  giving me  an. Opportunity to express my tribute to  His Excellency the President for  the manner  in which  he delivered his Address  to this House. I would also like to thank  him for the  advice that he gave all of us. and the nation  during the State opening of Parliament. I would     also  like to  take this opportunity to  Join my  colleagues  in paying special  tribute  to  ourt late  friend and colleagues. Dr. Ouko,  the former Member of Parliament for Kisumu  Town. Heserved this  nation  very well, and in fact  his services to this nation from the  moment that  he  joined the Government, showed very clearly  what  a  dedicated  son  of Kenya he was. He  will  be  rememberedby  history  and the  records  will hold he served this nation well. if anything the  rumour-mongers  and the  others  who  attributed this  evil  to the  Government,   should consider the job  done  the  late  Dr. Ouko  as a  source  of inspiration that each one of, us should once  again dedicate himself everything to eliminate all  forms  of  tribalism  and evils  that  may  undermine  the well beingof  our  political  system that  is based on  democracy.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir His Excellency the President in his Address  has  advised the leaders of this  countryto  foster  unity. It  is  our responsibility  as  leaders  to  prepareand  advise  all  our  people  as  to  the  form  of  unity we  need. Howdo we  promote  unity  as  leaders?  Among many other things we can do that  by  telling the  truth to our  people. In our  public  forums  and in  our  debates  we  should tell  the  truth  and  avoid  rumour mongering   and all those  things  that we  are  not  save  of. We  should not  speakjust  for  the  sake  of being given  credit  for  having been on the plat form. Rumour-mongering  arises  out  of  the  fact  that  a  leader or wouldbe  leader  is trying to  deliver  a message  of which  he  is not aware of,or  does  not know what  it really means  or  it  could be about  something that  he  is  not  fully informed about.  For  this reason  would like to  join my  colleagues  and Indeeditthe President  in  sayIng.that we our selves  as  the  leaders  of this  country  have  a responsibility. to eliminate  rumour mongering which can undermine the  stability  and  unity of  this  country on  which our  survival  and. that of the nation depends on.  We instead need development in this country.   We  have made great strides in  development  since  theachievement  of  Independence. In  fact,  greater  strides  have  beenmade  since  1978  when  His  Excellency  the President took over  the reigns  of  power.:  Since  then  he  has  reinforced unity  and shown devotion  and  dedication  to  the  ordinary mwananchi by promoting greater  participation  of  the wananchi  in  the  affairs  of  this  country. He a has also brought about the participation of the  mwananchi in the  development  of this  country through the  district  development committee  programmes. This  has  enabled the  people  to take  part  in the  development  of  this  country  and in determining the kind of Service they need in their areas. He has also brought greater participation in the Governmental process by instituting the queueing system. There is no greater democracy than allowing a the people to participate in deciding who their leader is going to be The queueing system which has brought all of us to this House arose out of the wisdom of our leader the President.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we should be aware as leaders that any leader who is out of step in supporting His Excellency the resident does not have any followers in this country. This is a country that is fully united. The mwananchi is loyal and behind the President. The few disgrauted leaders are just trying to undermine the system out of their greed for leadership; but to be truthful they do not have any support they can enjoy in this country. It is clearly demonstrated, if that is necessary, by the manner in which wananchi in this country continue to participate in activities of Harambee like this one of the establishment of the Bursary Fund. In this Harambee wananchi .""demonstrated their willingness throughout the country by contributingfreely for this Fund. They welcomed wholeheartedly that a fund should be set up for the children whose, parents are poor so that they can continue with their education. What elses does a nation need other than a leader who is keen in helping the poor, the disabled and individuals in a. nation who otherwise would not have helped themselves?That is happening under the leadership of His Excellency the President. Those people who have misguided themselves on the basis of what kind of a party system this nation should enjoy have only forgotten the history of this country. This country had in, the past enjoyed a multi party system, and after the wisdom of the leaders and wananchi it was decided to consolidate all the other parties under one party system so that we may not create ethnic parties under the pretext of democracy.Democracy, as, it has been defined in the past, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, is Government of the people by the people, for the people. There is no better Government than that. The hon. Members have all come here through the participation of every mwananchi and it indeed gives us responsibility to lead them because they have brought, us here Therefore, we are here for the people and, indeed by them we are able to participate: in all. activities of leadership Mr. Temporary Deputy: Speaker, Sir, developments that are occurring in this nation are. occurring because of devotion and dedication of mwananchi, both in industries and other areas of economic, sectors would like to take this, opportunity to congratulate, particularly the farmers of this country who continue to work, very hard in, their fields and shambas to feud this nation They also continue to tender their coffee, tea, cotton and various other crops so that this nation, may benefit by earning foreign exchange. The farmers who toil under difficult conditions, we. owe them a special tribute. For us,, as leaders, we owe them the stability so that this nation may continue to be fed. If the farmers continue to work properly and sell the produce, the country is going to earn foreign exchange as well as feed the nation enjoy the ride when the going is good, ""but they should also enjoy when the ride is rough. If you enter a ship to cross the ocean, then you have to be ready when the sea is rough and when the going is good.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to take this opportunity to express the firm and loyal commitment of. the people that I represent to His Excellency the President.Thank you very much.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. N. MOHGAI: Sir. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir, I rise to support this Motion and to congratulate His Excellency the Preside for delivering his Address to this nation which, as usual, is full of wisdom, understanding and visions, I would also like to state that the people of Kenya are very lucky "because there is nowhere in the world that we are going to get a "better, more understanding and mature leader than His Excellency President. Moi of the Republic of Kenya. Hot. only here, "but. even in the neighbouringcountries. This is the reason, why we people of Kenya should unite together andy instead of hesitating and rumour mongering we must be together in supporting: His Excel-lency the President in his leadership because it is the kind of. leadership that the people of Kenya want. We must say that the leadership of this country is not going be produced by any one particular tribe. It is not going to be produced by a man who necessarily comes from a "big" tribe, medium tribe, "small" tribe, or a tribe that lives by the ocean, mountain, or by the lake The leadership of this country is going to come from the "best person who understands people, who is "kind and. who has the wisdom to lead the people. Right now, we have that kind of a leader. That else do we want? We are satisfied. We like him and we are going to support him fully.(applause)Mr. Temporary Deputy. Speaker, Sir, the more one is privileged the more one should give his support to President Moi. because he does the kind of thing that the right kind of man in Kenya thinks about. So, if. you are a Member of the Cabinet, you should all the more give your support, and your support must be heard landly not in a whisper. If you are an Assistant Minister, you should also be heard be known to support the President If you are also Member of. Parliament, you are still a privileged person. What we do not want are people sitting on the fence who are not here or there we want people who are going to march forward loyally and support the great leader we have in Kenya today.If we continue hesitating, if we continue not being so certain, then, where are we leading the people who are behind us? This is why I say that everybody must stand to be counted wherever you are. If one is a Minister, the should behave and support the. President as a Minister;, and do not, at that particularmoment, become a Back bencher If  you are Member of Parliament, you have a constituency Go to your constituency and talk to the people about, what the President is talking about. In view of the crisis like the one we had. recently, we must feel, that we are being counted .Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I go very far, let: me join my colleagues in this House who have expressed their sadness at the loss of our late Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation. Ha had a very difficult job of projecting Kenyas image to the world, making Kenya acceptable and interpreting everything that is being done here to the other of the world. It took 56 years to bring Dr. Ouko up, and you do not find a Dr. Ouko every day. It was a very sad day that we lost him because the contribution that he was going to make, on top of what he had already done, cannot be made now. We sent his family our condolences and say that we cannot forget his work, must show that his work is going to prosper.At the time we lost Dr. Ouko, if it was not for the wisdom of the President, we could also have, lost more than Dr. Ouko; we could have lest Kenya.Fortunately, however, the President handled this matter with a lot of wisdom statesmanship, courage and, indeed, maturity so that even those people who wanted to mislead Kenya, including our enemies within, and outside the country, did not. succeed in achieving what they wanted. This was because of the that we have. If we did not have this kind of leadership, maybe we would have fought one another, tribe against tribe and man against man, but because he was there, we are able to continue with our political stability, peace, democracy and development It is,, indeed,, only a great, mem who can do what His Excellency the President did This is why when a time like that conies, the President should not appear to be alone since we are there and we must stand by him. We must show every follower that we have that we are with the President.(Applause)If we start doubting, our followers will doubt even more and. therefore. the President might appear to be alone. We do not want any more crisis to come to Kenya, but if another one comes, instead of rumour mongering or staying aloof, let us come forward because this is the only way in which we can maintain the unity and confidence of the nation and make sure that it is going to prosper for our own benefit and that of the children to come and the children of their children.I want to commend our President very highly because he has taken the initiative of bringing peace to our neighbourhoods. It is very important that we, in Kenya, show others what our President says. He goes to their countries and asks for peace and show them how to maintain it. We, here, should be supporting him in the maintenance of peace and unity, so that when he goes to the neighbouring countries and speaks, he can point at home to show now we are keeping peace. We want him to take out the message that we are following him. We also have to remember that things in Africa are changing.I am particular in that I am speaking on a day when one of the very last countries in Africa to attain independence is getting independence. This country is Namibia, and we wish her people the best from this first" day of their independence to the number of years that they are going to exist. Namibia, has had some help from our country. It was our soldiers and officers of our Civil Service who went, there during their elections to supervise voting, and it is our people who continue to help the newly independent nation. This has been achieved through the leadership that we have, and we must be very proud as we congratulate the now President of Namibia, Mr. Sam Nujoma and his government. We wish, them peace and success as they are still going to have problems, with neighbouring white South Africa, and we should give them all the support possible.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I must talk about our politima Party. The fact that the communist, godless politial parries of European countries have failed does not mean that we must also follow their footsteps because we were not following their footsteps when we made our .one party state. We are independent, and we have our different reasons for forming a one party state. We did not follow any communism in doing this, and we are not going to follow it today when it is collapsing nor are we going to listen to people who are pointing at Europe because we are neither Europeans nor communists. We are going to go our way the way the African mind thinks without imitating the  communist in eastern Europe. We have wise leadership, and we are going to stick to it, as we let the world know that President Moi is supported by all people in Kenya. Thank you very much.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE (Mr. Ndong): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chance to contribute to this very important Motion on the Address delivered by His Excellency the President on 13th March, 1990, when he opened this Session of Parliament. His Excellency the President touched on important matters,, ranging from international to local issues. His contribution towards peace in Africa is well known to us all. Particularly, there is his contribution towards peace in Mozambique, Ethiopia, Namibia and, of coarse, South Africa. It is a pity that when Mr. Mandela was released, he did not visit Kenya although our people in general would have liked to see him here in Kenya. Mr. Mandela left Tanzania and hopstepped to Ethiopia bypassing Kenya. We would request him to visit. Kenya the next time he is here because His Excellency the President did everything within his power to make sure that Mr. Mandela was released.I would like to pay tribute to His Excellency the President on behalf of my people of Rangwe for. the work and dynamic leadership that he has given this nation. The peace and stability that we are now enjoying in the country are as a result of the Presidents untiring efforts, to see this country become a better place to live in.The political and economic progress we have so far achieved in this country is enormous and congruent to and directly proportional to the efforts made by His Excellency the President. I wonder why we, in this House, cannot be truthful. Why do people continue undermining the .Government of His Excellency the President? Why should leaders in this House keep on singing "Nyayo Juu, Kanu Juu", when they do not mean a damn thing about what they are talking about? We, the new Members of this House, are getting extremely concerned about people who just talk and they do not mean what they say. Why do some Ministers and Members of Parliament wash their dirty linen in public? Some go as far as calling the same Government they serve corrupt and yet they fly the flag. Why? I believe that they must be some fora where they can tell the Government where it is going wrong rather than coming here and calling the Government corrupt.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, why do some people resist arrest or why do they not. willingly go with the police when the police would like to. ask some questions just to help with investigations? Why do they call international Press when they are being arrested? I have asked more than 10 questions since I started speaking here. The answers to those questions are in this House but we do not. want, to say it When we come here,, we only say "Nyayo Juu, Kanu Juu" and we do not mean a damn thing. I think it is the high time that Sis Excellency this .President took his broom and swept this House clean. We aire getting fed up of people who are not patriotic. Wananchi are looking upon us as leaders and they know what we talk about here but, after a few minutes, we go outside and do the opposite. Wananchi are fed up.Sir, why are lawyers complaining all the time? My colleagvf.es have been talking about this and we know why lawyers are quarelling they want to destabilize this country. We, as Members of Parliament, cannot just sit back and see lawyers destabilise this country. All of us in this House today will be dead in the next thirty or so years. Why can we not live in peace. and not in pieces?Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, having said that, I will not turn to the delicate question of the untimely death of our brother. Dr. Robert Ouko. As we all know, the late Dr. Ouko was a patriot and. an eloquent representative of Kenya in all international meetings. Dr. Ouko carried our flag high all the time, even when he was under stress from marauding questions from the Press He was loved by all Kenyans but hated by few people who are Kenyas enemies. Whoever Killed Dr. Ouko was definitely anti Nyayo. Whoever Killed Dr. Ouko was, definitely against the Kenyan Government. Whoever killed Dr. Ouko was against this country. Whoever killed Dr. Ouko wanted to see chaos in this country. Whoever killed Dr. Ouko wanted Kenyans to go against their own popularly elected Government. Whoever killed Dr. Ouko must have been extremely selfish.Dr. Ouko is dead, and we all know it. However, the ideals he. stood for will remain in this country. Whatever good things, he did will remain forever. In fact, Dr. Oukos death, has brought Kenyans closer to the Government of Kenya than, they were before. Whatever the motive was for killing Dr. Ouko, the perpetra¬tors or thatdastardly act have failed. Some of them are now. turning to other issues like football. We know what is going on in football in this country. Dr. Oukos death was meant to destabilise this country but. it failed, because we, Luos, have been cheated a lot. We know where we have come from and where we are going, and nobody should imagine that .we will go back to 1969 or before then. It is over 20 years since 1969, and we are going where we are heading to Nobody is going to separate us from our Government.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Kenya is a democratic country with a popularly elected Government of the people and by the people. His Excellency the President has total support of all Kenyans. He is supported by 99.99 per cent of our people. Now, if you talk of .01 percent of the population being traitors, then let them be flashed out for the sake of the 99.99 per cent. Mzee Moi is liked by the ordinary mwananchi from Nyeri to Mombasa and from Garissa to Homa Bay. If you ask any small kid who President Moi is, he firstremembers the milk that he drinks in school. So, the problem is not with wana¬nchi; it is in this Parliament. We are misleading our people.

Naibu Spika wa Muda, nakushukuru kwa kunipatia nafasi hii ili niweze kusema machache kuhusu matamshi ya Mtukufu Rais wakati alipolifungua Bunge hili na pia mambo ambayo yamekuwa yakiendelea hapa nchini.Kwanza, nataka kumtolea shukranl Mtukufu.Rais kwa" kazi aliyofanya mnamo Jumamosi iliyopita, ya. kukusanya Shs.142 milioni kuwasaidia watoto kutoka jamii maskini. ambao hawangeweza kupata nafasi ya kuendelea na masomo yao. Mpango;kama huu uliingiliwa na watu kwa roho safi na wananchi walielezwa lengo lake kwa njia nzuri, hasa wakati Mtukufu Rais aliposema. kwamba kutoa Harambee si lazima. Ingawa hivyo, kama mhe. Mbunge fulani alivyosema hapa, maendeleo ni lazima. Kwa hivyo, ni lazima wananchi kote katika nchi ya Kenya walielezwa vizuri kwamba pesa zilizo tokana na Harambee hii zilikuwa ,ii»nufaa ya watoto wao. Ni kwa sababu. hiyo tulijitoa wote muhanga kutoa pesa, ambapo tulivunja rekodi ya ulimwengu mziaia. Tambo hili lilimtia Mtukufu Rais roho safina kutambua kwamba wananchi wa Kenya hawana kinyongo kuhusu uongozi wake. Jambo hilo lilimfurahisha sana na kuaipa nafasi nyingine mpya ya kuendelea kuwahudumia wananchi wa Kenya kikamilifu. Bw.

Every right thinking Kenya knows that His Excellency Daniel arap Moi has done and continued to dc a lot of good things fox this country in order to make, it a happy place for us to lire In. Sir, wananchi know very well the amount of commitment the President has put in order to ensure that Kenyans prosper and farmers get good prices for their produce. He has assisted Kenyans in every conceivable field of development and they are grateful to him. They are also grateful because they know the love the; President has for the children of this country. He has ensured that the education system is improved so that when students reach a. certain level, they will be able to earn a living from one place or another. We also know that the President loves the children from poor families whose parents are unable to meet the demand for school fees. Such children will now gain from the recent Presidential Bursary Fund which was organised by the President and a colossal amount of money raised.The President has made a great sacrifice in all spheres in order to make this country a happy place to live in. Even with all. these, it is most unfortunate that, some people take advantage of national tragedies like the passing away of Dr. Ouko to spread rumours. We know very well that President Moi is a committed Christian. 5e shows that commitment by going to churchy and it would be most inconceivable that a person of that nature can be linked up with the murder of Dr. Ouko. It is impossible for President Hoi to have been involved in any way in the. murder of Dr. Ouko. This is because he cannot serve God on the one hand and serve the devil on the other. It is just not possible. You cannot serve both God and the devil at the same time.Personally, I knew Dr. Ouko so well as a roan who had no tribalism in his system. I first met Dr. Ouko in 1964 when he had just" established the foreign service department within the Office of the Prime Minister which was headed by the late President Kenyatta. I was among quite a number of a few young men who were recruited to go into the foreign service Department Although I came all the way from Mount ELgon I do not Think he had., heard, of the Sabaat and he came from Luo land, I was among some of the first people to he recruited and sent to the United Eat ions for training in diplomatic practice: and procedure. Dr. Ouko maintained that position as a person who never practiced tribalism until his death. Dr. Ouko would not be a person that any leader would have wanted to see killed because he was a man of good attribute, a great person and a. true Kenyan.Those who have taken advantage of the death of Dr. Ouko tospread rumours and make some people believe that members of one tribemay have murdered Dr. Ouko, are only perpetrating lies. This is becausethey think that they will achieve something like, say, increasing orprotecting their wealth. It is. obvious that if.there in instabilityin this country, whether one has wealth or not, there will be no peace.In fact,those who have wealth want to protect it by unscrupulousmeans, will, be the first ones to lose.We all. know that President Moi has done everything possible to mould Kenyans into one tribe. As a matter of fact, he has: already succeeded and, perhaps, he is 90 per cent successful. This is because the young people we see in towns and up country, think and behave asKenyans. My own children,. Sir, speak very little Sabaat which, is their mother tongue. They speak mainly in Kiswahili and. English and. it is probably, my wife and I who speak real Sabaat. This is happening in cost prove of Kenya. I believe that in the next few years there will be a very different Kenya which will not know any farm of tribalism. If there are any tribalists in existence, they must be the few old timers who; probably, have too much tribalism in them that it difficult to remove. But those ones are just a passing cloud and very soon their time will fade and a beautiful Kenya will be bora.Sir, those of us who live near the border like you Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, know very well how killings can bring instability. In fact, last weekend, one game ranger was killed in Mount ELgon forest and a few others had been killed a few weeks ago.That one killing incident brought so much fear and despondency end people become very uncomfortable. Despite that, we in Mount Slgon are always assured that our Government, under the leadership of president Moi, will assist has as has been the case in the past, wo .have been getting a lot .of assistance from time to time and security brought to deal with cases of infiltrators from a neighbouring country. Therefore we the people of Mount Elgon, are totally behind President Moi because we know that he can provide peace and that with his leadership we have a lot of hope for the future. Those of us who are Ministers should try bur best can be careful in our speeches. This is because, recently one of us was quoted as saying that Kenyans did not fight far Independence so that they get killed Sir, if a Minister speaks that way then it means that the Kenya Government which; fought for Independence is now murdering, the people. If you speak in riddles and. it rhetorics, people will. not. understand you and they will, start interpreting what you have said and in. .the process, rumour mongering starts, order to assist the Government of President Moi, leadars must be careful in their speeches and be in a position to explain whatever they are saying. With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MH. WAED1E: Ahsante Bana 3w. ITaibu Spika kwa kunipatia nafasi Mi ili nam nitoe maoni yangu. Kwa kweli Hotuba ya Mtukufu Rais aliyotoa katika siku. ya kukifungua kikao cha tatu cha Eunge hili ilikuwa yenye busara sana na iliyotufunza kwamba bila ya kuwa na umoja na amani nchi yetu haiwezi kufanya jambo lolote. Katika mi aka 11 ya uongozi wa Rais Moi nchi hii imepata maendeleo mengi, iine julikana katika pande zote za ulimwengu na si si tunaridhi shwa narmaongozirya.iRaxs Moi.;Ukweli ni kwamba kabla ya Rais kuchukua uongozi wa nchi hii. Mawaziri walitoka katika kabila moja na hakukuwa na malalamiko hat a kidogo Lakini leo ixata kabila ambalo "na"! 1 kuwa na Vaziri Msaidizi n ISaoadiGj., lina tfaziri kama huyo; wakuu wa nrLkoa na .7akuu wa wilaya 5a pia wameteuliwa kutoka katikajkabila. ikiwa si si hatut at o she ka na maongozi kama hay a, ninafikiri hata Mungu akiterenka kutoka mbinguni hatut at o she ka. Ewa kweli maongozi ya Rais Moi ni dhabiti na yametambuliwa na. nchi zote ulimwenguni; Rais Moi. anaipenda nchi yake, watu wake xm na bar a lote la Afrika.:Rais Moi anajulikana ulimwengurd kote nrpenda arnani . Hii ndio sababu amezisaidia nchi za. Ethiopia, Sudan Uganda.: Hata yeye atakuwa kielelezo katika chtcru wa inalTainibia Ikiwa "asiiimia ya IFakenya milioni 24 wako nyuma ya Rais Moi, sijui waeneza ycvunii kama . 11 wanaweza kufanya katika nchi. hii. Hawa ni. watu wenye tam&.a kama fisi. Wakati iLrrA fisi aliuona mkono wa mtu uki zunguka na akafikiri utakatika na kuanguka. Kirn siku nzima fisi alimfuata huyo mtu akitarajia kupata nyama ya mkono wake lakini mkono haukuanguka." Kwa hivyo, nafikiri kwamba hawa waeneza uvuurL hapa na pale ni wenye tamaa sawa na huyo fisi. Hata nakumbuka kwamba Tom Ms Mboya alipopigwa risasi hapa HM.XHM. Nairobi nilikuwa katika Eunge hili, lakini hakuna mtu aliyesema kwajnbe. Tom aliuawa na Serikali au na S hayati Mzee Jomo Eenyatta.Ninafikiri wakati uiaefika kwa wale wanaohusika na usalama wa nchi hii w e hatua ifaaya. ITajua sheria hajikubaii Mbunge akaniatrre kutoka katika BuiigeTa.ki ni nakumbuka kwamba zaarehemu Seroney na Martin Shikuku walikamatwa kutoka katika Bunge hili na wakawekwa kizuizini. Ikiwa mtu anacheza na usalama wa Galeeny a milioni 24 inafaa afunzwe, kwa sababu mtu akigusa IILOto ni lazima achomeke.Hatuwezi kukubali amani wa nchi hii ichezewe na watu ll.Bw. s Taibu Spika wa Muda, Hais Moi anapendwa na 77atuwake, gjjgaulu .sana kwajizEarambee ya juzi iii ushahidi wa " wasi wa jambo hilo.

I rise to join my hon. colleagues. in expressing my sincere thanks far to His Excellency the President for the Address he made on 13th March, 1990 when opening this Session of Parliament.Sir, His Excellency the President was, as he has done in the past and will always do in future, speaking from a great deal, of experience. He has been an hon. Member of Parliament for the last. years and has devoted all his life to the service of Kenyans so that they may prosper and so that the children of this country might g see a bright future. Sir, His Excellency the President :spoke about unity in this country. He reminded us that the Kenyan nation is made of various parts and that the various different tribes	have to shed a certain amount of their identity in order to be part of the Kenya we want today. Sir, it me also, at this early stage join my hon colleagues who have expressed deep shock and sympathy at thetragic death of our hon. colleague the late hon. Dr. Ouko.Honourable Members will remember that the Press in theScandinavian countries, especially Sweden and some other neighbouring countries had ganged up in portraying Kenya as a country that had no respect for human rights. They were claiming that Kenya was doing ever thing possible to destroy itself. Sir, nobody would have defended Kenya more than the way the late Dr. Ouko did that time, I happen to have known Dr. Ouko. from very early times, that was in 1964 when we were appointed permanent secretaries. I know that he devoted all his time to the service of this country. He was a dedicated patriot of this country, We commend the Luo Members of Parliament for the very firm stand that they took, because we believe that there were people who wanted to take advantage of "that tragic a wedge between the various tribes in Kenya in order to create chaos  Mr. Temporary Deputy. Speaker, Sir, rumours emanate fromevil spirits ni Shetani. When you spread rumours you allow Satan to go wild and free. You give him freedom to go round and destroy the bonds that unite Kenyans. It was definite that there are ill minded people in this country who wanted to take advantage of this tragic situation to drive a wedge between Kenyan and Kenyan and drive a wedge between Kenyans and His Excellency the President Daniel arap Moi. Rumour is like cancer a and if it is allowed to go unchecked it will destroy our society.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is difficult to imagine that anyone would have served this country better than President Moi. His Excellency the Presidents Government has formulated, sound national and international policies J Our relationships with other nations are on a sound footing. While His Excellency the President has occupied the presidency we have seen his presence in practically every part of Kenya. He has made himself felt in. every district. He has made himself felt by. the children, of this country. The sick and. the s± disabled of this country have felt the presence of His Excellency the Presidents We are ALL aware, for the money he has raised for the physically disabled in this country. We are also aware of what he is done for the sick in expanding the medical facilities in this country. But far more important is the ray of hope that he has given to the	youth of this country by strongly coming out with an education policy that spreads out equally in every district. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the 844 system of education is the brainchild of His Excellency the President. We have seen the development of this education. we have also seen that university education has been, brought nearer to the people by the fact that we now have four public universities. His Excellency the President has tried to make sure that Kenyans develop in their faculties as much as possible hence the great support that he has given to research leading to what the Kenya Medical Research Institute has. discovered. Also Kenya has designed and developed its own car.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President has not been living within the Kenyan borders only. But he has projected the image of this country in world politics and situations. Kenyans, have participated in peace keeping; forces in the Middle East where people have been killing each other. They continue to slaughter each other because these cannot live in peace. Kenyans are still in Namibia helping to keep peace in that country. His Excellency the President is a peace maker. He is playing is full part to make sure that the wars in Mozambique and Ethiopia have come to an end what do Kenyans need? They heed to heed the words of His Excellency the President. All along His Excellency the President has been telling Kenyans that Kenya will hot develop as a nation unless	Kenyans think and. act as Kenyans. Then His Excellency the President speaks he addresses the people and the people get his messages. But I always ask myself whether leaders in various forms and shapes get His Excellency the Presidents message. I always ask myself whether those who are supposed to spread his messages in terms of peace and unity are actually doing it   A lot of rumours have been circulating in the country, and those c;f you who are in a position to clarify policies, are you doing it, or you doing it with a pinch of salt so that the policies of His Excellency the do not reach where they should? I think that is the message wo should all take to the people together. Unless this message is clear., we would be deceiving ourselves and the country at large.I would now like to say something regarding the lawyers of this country. We have been reading quite a lot about the election of the chairman of the Law Society of Kenya. I see that the lawyers do not know how to elect their chairman. They have been forging ballot papers to reach	would be voters. Some of these lawyers said that queue voting method of election we have adopted was not workable. I should like to. suggest to them to try the Kanu style of .election. I think they will find that it works very well.With those few words. I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Kones): Thank, you . very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chance to contribute to this Motion on the Presidential Address.First of all, I would like to congratulate His Excellency the President for the very successful Harambee funds drive he led last Saturday to help all the secondary school children whose parents are unable to pay their school fees. To raise Kshs.142 million in one day is no mean achievement. I think it is a record which was set in this country and probably in the whole world. The thought, for a start, was a brilliant one. There are thousands of students in the country who have suffered due to the inability of their parents to pay their school fees. I think this problem will be a forgotten case, and I hope this fund will be a continuous one, which, I hope will be added more money once it is found to be running down. I believe my colleagues will joinme in hoping that this kind of Harambee funds drive will be repeated nowand then. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Presidential Address carried a lot of words of wisdom. The President has asked us to join hands in developing this nation; to try and shun empty gossip which is meant to divide us and not to do anything good for the development of this nation.The Presidential Address also highligted the Bills we are expected to debate during this Session, such as the Workmens Compensation (Amendment) Bill, which is long overdue. I am sure this Bill will be highly welcome by this House and that it will be passed. I am sure a workers will benefit a lot once it is passed.I would now like to talk about our late colleague, hon. Dr. John Robert Ouko.It is a big loss to this House and the nation as a whole that the late Dr. Ouko was murdered. It is so sad that there were rumours around and implications made which somehow intimated that other tribes for the death of. Dr. Ouko. I know that you Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, might have heard as we did that some people intimating, that the Kalenjins were responsible for the death of Dr. Ouko. As a Kalenjin I would like to categorically say that Kalenjins never indulge themselves in killing other human beings deliberately. They can only kill if there is e problem like when rustlers steal their cattle; but even then they do not kill deliberately. They will never do unless they are trying.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Ogle): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker., Sir.Since the hon. Member is making a very important contribution . I think it is only fair that he is heard in absolute silence.THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Order? Order, hon. Members! Could the hon. Member be heard in silence?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Kones) : Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank hon. Oglo for that protection. I need to be listened to in total and absolute silence. What was saying; before that interruption was that Kalenjins will never indulge themselves in killing people and certainly not Dr. Ouko,. The late Dr. Ouko was loved very much by all Kenyans including the Kalenjins. We have coexisted as neighbours with the Luos for a very long time. We like an each other and we do not have any boundary problems with each other. In fact, the Luos never steal our cattle but return to us those that are not theirs. I would like to categorically state that the Kalenjins would never do such a thing. Dr. Oukos death was very sad. We are all mourning andin fact people in my constituency wept saying that we had lost such a great man. We all hope to get the truth of, what, the cause of his death was. people in my constituency are still asking me whether we are getting anywhere as to who was responsible for the death of Dr. Ouko. This shows the love that we had for the late: Dr. Ouko.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, our President, too ,could not have planned for such a thing and another the Government have so. Our President is a God fearing, man. We know him for the great deed that he has done for this country. He has even forgiven people who have been trying to kill him! He has forgiven such people. If our President has any political problems with other people he knows the best way of sorting such problems out which does not include killing other people.Dr. Ouko was a great man in the Government and there Is no reason why he should have been dealt with in such a manner, lean certain that this Government was not implicated murder. I am sure that certain disgruntled elements were germing to take advantage of this situation to divide this nation into tribal groupings. We all know that certain people do not want to get satisfied. There are people who think that President Moi. should not have been the President of this country for reasons best known to them Our President has been the President for the last 12 years in which we have realised very many achievements; but still certain people think that he is not fit to be the President of this country. What do these people want him to be? Our President has gone round the country building schools and constructing hospitals. In fact, there is no district that our President has not visited.There is no section that His Excellency the President has not touched. Many of us in the Front Bench represent almost every district. So, where is this question of tribalism coming from? Sometimes we also learn from this House. Some Members were talking of big and small tribes in Kenya. I think this is an unfortunate reference. There is nothing like a big or small tribe in this country. We are all one tribe and we are Kenyans.So, if somebody is trying to misbehave then he should not take the cover of the tribe as an excuse, for that matter. For instance, if the Son of Wairimu felt that he was getting grilled, it should not be taken as a Kikuyu issue. It should be taken as an issue of Wairimus Son and not as a Kikuyu issue. I am sure that many Kikuyus are very patriotic. I am sure that many Kikuyus love our President, and they are in total support of him. However, if an element is getting disgruntled about the whole issue, he should be plucked out and Kikuyus left as clean as they are. There are also Kalenjins sometimes .who do not like our President. Those elements should be plucked out of the community and taken out so that the rest of the Kalenjins can remain clean. We should see ourselves as Kenyans and not as tribes. Our President was born a President. Unfortunately, our. President was bora in Baringo from a Kalenjin tribe. He speaks Kalenjin. He could also have been boar in Kikuyu land for that matter and he could speak Kikuyu; or from Masai or anywhere else. Our President has a talent of being a President. He is not a tribe. So, I would like to eliminate this issue of tribalism. Where somebody is trying to be disrespectful, we should not associate it with a tribe.We want all of us, as Kenyans, to cone together and be united We should fight anybody who would like to divide the country into small sections of tribes. This is going to "kill" us.This is going to destroy our unity in this country, There is nothing that will destroy us like tribalism. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I would like to give congratulations to our President for the total support he has given to Namibia until now it is a free Namibia Our President has actually gone there, and today they are witnessing the independence of Namibia. Our President has been in total support of the unconditional release of Kelson Mandera, and indeed he has been released unconditionally. I am sure if we many Presidents in the world with the heart like that of our president this, world would be a happy place to live in.Thank you very much.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TECHNICAL TRAINING AND APPLIED TECHNOLOGY (Mr. Thuo): Thank .you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me also this chance to make my contri¬bution in praise of His Excellency Address when he officially opened Parliament on 13th of this month.The words of wisdom were heard by us all in this Parliament The words were from none other than the Head of State we love, His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi.At one stage, the President cautioned us here in Parliament. He said you hon., Members, including myself and himself, too, must be faithful to the Kenyans who number about 24 million, or thereabouts  He also said that it is our duty to be good custodians of our Independence. Therefore, the leaders of this country must emulate this august House where we have come after having been elected by the people. We have been brought here to help Kenya develop fast and to be true Nyayo followers in whatever in say and direct our minds to;Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is nothing on can be in this country to effectively pay His Excellency the President, and there is no reward of any kind we can give him for what he has done for Kenya.since he took over the reign of this country. His Excellency the President has given this nation political maturity, which is the first consideration that we all share. The development that His Excellency the President hon brought this nation and the trips he has made all over the Republic make me especially when some people speak with some kind of dissatisfaction. I would whether these people are right in their minds or not. However, we should play for them and pity them because they may be. lost, or derailed in following up the history of His Excellency the Presidents leadership. The President means well for all of us in this country. All the districts of this Republic have seen President Moi physically performing one development function or another. He has even joined us for worship in our churches back, in our constituencies Therefore, I think we owe this country a duty, that is to be totally loyal to His Excellency the President.The children of this country, whose custodian is the President. have enjoyed the expansion of schools because these have been the major beneficiaries of the Harambee spirit of this country. These children have benefited from the expansion of health facilities, everywhere from the locations level through the district level, up to the national level where we have national hospitals. This country is benefiting I say this before His Excellency the Vice President and Minister for Finance, who is here now and this is evident when you look at all corners of the Republic. Rural electrification is now on to enable us to start industrialising rural areas even by having the Jua Kali industry in areas where we could not have had it before. This Ministry, which is under the able stewardship of hon. Prof. Ongeri, is looking at all sides of the country and educating our people so that we could get good artisans from the Nyayo children. This is being done through polytechnics, middle colleges and technical institutes.This is all the work of our President to see to it that our younger generation expand their scope so that they can get employment and enjoy their future. There is a lot one can say, even in the field of agriculture. You have seen the concern of His Excellency the President. When there were problems in the tea industry, His Excellency the President personally increased the tea prices, hence making tea farmers happy. They now know that His Excellency the President and his Government are looking into other ways which could make them happier. Not only that. The coffee industry is being restructured. This is another area where Kenya reaps a lot of its foreign exchange and, therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to all coffee farmers to tend to their coffee crop to take advantage , of the increasing world prices.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, turning to the issue of roads, I want, to say that our roads have been, properly looked after. We have had roads tarmacked whenever money is available. Our Government is also looking into ways and means of ensuring that our roads are made all weather so that transportation becomes easy.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the speech by His Excellency was a reflection of what we should look back at and even give us a foresight. When ruinous like the one we have been hearing of people trying to take advantage of the demise of one of our colleagues start doing the rounds, then that is very unfortunate. It is very sad indeed. To reiterate hon. Kones statement, let me say that whenever we discuss matters in this House we should reflect a national identity. A wrongdoer can come from anywhere. We should warn those who are playing pound that the Government has eyes and a long arm. That long arm can reach those detractors who wish to slow down what the Government is doing. If we did not have the likes of our President, just tell, me where we would really be. You just look around and ask yourself what President Moi has not done that can be doneby those detractors. That is why I said earlier on that we feel sorry for them. I want to appeal to my Parliamentarian colleagues to behave like brothers and sisters. You know, whatever we say here goes outside and, at times, it may create emotions that are really not there. The 24 million people of this country I want to say here that the people of Kikuyu land are totally with the President. If there is one; or two bad fellows here and there, let us direct cur attention to those individuals and not to the whole tribe. Kenya is represented by many tribes and, therefore, we should be honest to our nation.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. TWARITH: Ahsante sana Bwo Uaibu Spika wa Muda kwa kunipatia nafasi hii ili niungane na Wabunge wenzangu katika majadiliano ;juu ya Ho tuba ya Rais am bayo ilikuwa ya muhimu sana.

The community has already been advised by the Management of MachakosDistrict Hospital to :(a) repair the cracks m staff houses walls? This has so far not been done;(b) construct a water tank, and(c) Make provision for furniture and other loose equipment like pails, "brooms and so on.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir," once these conditions have been met, the project will be ready for takeover by my Ministry and official opening will be done? With regard to Tulila Dispensary Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir, I am sorry to inform the hon. Member that this project has not yet been, approved by the Machakos District Development Committee The community has been advised to submit the project for approval to the D.D.C. and it is only after this process has "been followed that my ministry will take the necessary action?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I paid a visit to the two dispensaries last month and I was satisfied with the work that has been done at Kilala a Dispensary. The cracks have been repaired? With regard to the construction of the water tank the community has an alternative source of water which they can rely on while the water tank is under construction? This area has no dispensary and the nearest dispensary is 18 kilometres away.</Newspeech> This area is also infested with mosquitoes?.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

S0MPISHA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have already indicated; that this dispensary will only be opened after the conditions I have mentioned have been fulfilled. Immediately this is done, we shall open it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIILU: Could the Ministry consider equipping or funding it. so that the wananchi of the area be assisted? I say this because there is no dispensary nearby.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SOMPISHA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir", as I said, this is a self help project and the Ministry has not taken it over. So, the question of the Ministry providing it with funds before it has taken it over does not arise. As soon as we take over the dispensary, all the necessary facilities will be taken there.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Some of the conditions, the Assistant Minister has mentioned have, been fulfilledand it seems as if".a report was given, by an . officer from. Machakos Could the Assistant Minister accompany me now to that place so that , he can see for himself, that the people of. that area. are suffering? These people: have nowhere to go to get medical attention.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SOMPISHA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have field officers there. But if the hon. Member wants to invite me for something else, as a friend, I will accompany him. But as far as information concerning that project is concerned, we have our officers there in the district, who are supposed to inform us about the project.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPK0K: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to tell the House that there are officers there in the field while we know that they are giving him the wrong information? He told the House that as soon as the Machakos District Development Committee is informed about the project, it will give it a first priority and money will be allocated for it. Why should he mislead the House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SOMPISHA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the hon. Member should not say that I am misleading the House. He comes from very from area we are talking about and he claims that there are no field officers there. We have Ministry of Health officers all over the country, so they are also there.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the people of the area we aire talking about are the ones who elected me to this Parliament. So, when they fall sick and they do not get attended to, it becomes very serious. Those people are in danger and they should be saved.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is your question, Mr. Wambua?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: My question is: when is this dispensary going to be opened because there is a. very great need for it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SOMPISHA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have said very clearly that this is a selfhelp project which, is being undertaken by the local" community. When the project is completed and all the conditions I mentioned fulfilled, we will take it over and provide drugs. So, there will be no problem. But the hon. Member can assist us by speeding up the completion of the project and the fulfilment of the conditions I have entioned.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEILU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The hon. Questioner says that the construction of the dispensary has been completed, and that there an officer from the Ministry of Health who went there to confirm that, but the Assistant Minister says that when the dispensary is completed, the Ministry will just move in and open it. Where do we stand.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Sompisha, would just issue a quick clarification for the benefit of the hon. Member?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SOMPISHA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, when such officers write to us about such projects, they do not write to the Questioner. Up to now, they have not written to us concerning that project, confirming its completion.</Newspeech>Question No. 39 Land Rover for Tabaka Health CentreMR. A.I. MOHAMMED, on behalf of Mr. M.S. Arain, asked the Minister for Health where the Land Rover meant for use by Takaba Health Centre, Mandera District, is currently located.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that vehicle is still allocated to Takaba Health Centre. It was only in the garage undergoing repairs. It will be ready at the end of this . month and sent back to the same health centre.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is not unusual for Ministers to give promises that by a certain date, this is going to happen. Now the Assistant Minister is saying that by the end of this month the vehicle is going to be sent back to Takaba Health Centre while it has not been there for a long time. What assurance does the Assistant Minister give that he. is going to keep his promise to send the vehicle back, there then?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I. speak here, I speak on behalf of the Ministry"and the Government</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MIS0I: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the. Assistant Minister for that reply, but could he tell us how long that land rover has been in the garage?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, during the population census, which was done towards the end of last year, many vehicles were mobilised for this exercise. This vehicle was one of them. It developed mechanical problems and it was taken to the garage. So, it has only been there since that time it has not been there for a long time. It is being repaired and it will be ready at the end of March, 1990, and taken back to the same health centre.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.I. MOHAMMED: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, since Takaba Divisional Headquarters is about 200 from Mandera District Headquarters and this vehicle has been repaired and is being used at Mandera District Headquarterscan the Assistant Minister direct that the vehicle be moved to Takaba immediately so that the wananchi in Takaba do not suffer?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: We know that the vehicle was for use by Takaba Health Centre. We have undertaken the repairs and the vehicle is ready. Therefore there is not need for me to direct any thing.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ARTE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has told the House that the vehicle will be taken back to Takaba Health Centre on 30th March, 1990. But he knows that sickness can strike any time. Why does he not order that the vehicle be taken back there immediately?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: There is no need for me to do that as the vehicle will be returned in good time.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.G. GODANA: It is a gross understatement for the Assistant Minister to say that from August last year to. March this year is a short time, especially if the matter concerns the health of members of the public. What arrangements, is he. making to ensure that the health centreis well" served while the vehicle is undergoing repairs?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is no need for us to make further arrangements. The vehicle is ready and it will be taken, back to the health centre.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.I. MOHAMMED: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the vehicle is not undergoing repairs, it has already been repaired. What is it doing in . Mandera?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is nothing wrong with a vehicle being at the district headquarters. It was taken there because it was being repaired. There is no better garage in the area than the one to which it was taken. If the hon. Member saw the vehicle there, be should say so. He might have seen it then, but now it is not there.</Newspeech>Question No. 47Protection from Exorbitant Goodwill ChargesMR. P.K. KINYANJUI asked the Minister for Commerce what steps he is taking to protect indigenous "businessmen and women who are charged exorbitant goodwill and "key money" when buying business<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE (Mr.Dong): Sir Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.In commercial language, goodwill is considered to be the favour or advantage in .the way of custom that a business has acquired beyond the mere value of what it sells, whether due to the personalities conducting it, the business name, the nature of its location, its reputation for skill or or any other circumstances incidental to the business trading, to make it penman "Key money", on the other, hand, is money paid by a prospect tenant, especially of an apartment, in order to obtain housing or any other commercial premises especially where the. building in which the business premises is new. This is sometimes. paid as a warranty that once the premises are ready, the payer will occupy .the identified premises. Legally, there is very little that my Ministry can do to protect prospective business buyers from exploitation by landlords as generally goodwill and "key money" are never openly declared, and transaction is usually conducted on wil1ng buyer willing seller basis.In Kenya Constitution, there is no legal statute that could be invoked to control or bring to any amount the exchangeable tokens a goodwill However, the rationale is that the over riding factor is the supply and demand for business premises.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Assistant Minister for the effort he has made, but I thick in his reply he has completely missed the purposes of this Question. I have stated in my Question that the charges being requested for "key money" and goodwill are exorbitant, and this is hurting many indigenous African businessmen, in particular. Is there anything wrong if we can request the Assistant Minister to look, into this matter and bring in a law that would protect indigenous Africans from this harmful practice?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DONG : Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question of purcha¬sing a house or a business premises is a contract. first of all, the Questioner says that businessmen and women are charged "exorbitantly . When you are buying a house, you are not charged by anybody. It is a question of offer and acceptance. The seller Will offer something to you and you are supposed to. accept, and you have accepted, it is a contract. Now, once, you have accepted the offer, there is no way my Ministry can come in and mediate It is just a question of willing buyer willing seller basis. For example, the price of a house in Kikuyuy where hon. Kabibi Kinyanjui comes fromis not the same as that in Homa Say where I come from. There are several economic factors to be taken into consideration Once it has been offered and the buyer accepts, it is a. contract, and I do not think there is anything my Ministry can do about that. However, if there are specific issues, the hon. Member can bring to the attention of my Ministry and we shall take it up.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think it is the policy of the Government to indigences the economy. Could the Assistant Minister tell the House what specific steps his Ministry has taken to indigenise the economy? This is because since Indepe¬ndence we are told that it is the policy of theGovernment to see that the indigenous people control the economy. How long is this going to take before it is implemented?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DONG: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, with all due respect to the hon. Member, that is a different question altogether.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, following that good reply from the Assistant Minister which did not answer the Question put here satisfactorily that, the goodwill and "keymoney" is so exorbitant that the local indigenous people in other words Africans cannot afford to pay this money, "what is the Government" doing to facilitate entry into this exclusive business area? It is not enough to define what "goodwill" means. What is the Government doing about it? Is it giving loans to businessmen and women? Is it aware that indigenous people cannot penetrate into this business area because of this money?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DOUG: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I. said earlier on this is a question of willing buyer willing seller. The seller offers his premises for sale, and the purchaser accepts to buy. It is an agreement between two. parties and the Government does not come in at all.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.KAMDYU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the policy of the Government is to encourage indigenous , people to trade, and they have to be protected from unscrupulous business people. So, the question is: Is the Assistant going to sit back and watch as the indigenous people are being exploited when buying business premises?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DONG: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I said earlier and I will repeat, for the benefit of the hon. Member, that there are specific issues the hon. Member would like to bring to the attention of the Ministry, we are ready to look at them.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it lias been understood by everybody , in this country that one of the constraints of appli¬cants getting into a business is because almost all their capital which they have accumulated over long periods of time normally goes towards paying for goodwill and "keymoney". There is aire ad a problem which the Ministry should have realised by now. The question now is Having realised that problem, what is the Minister doing to make sure that the Africans are now going to get a fair deal? That is what hon. Members are asking.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.DOUG: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I appreciate what hon. Members have asked. However, the question of indigenous Africans purchasing business premises depends entirely on their capability to do so. Kenya is a growing economy. For example, if some of us in this House can buy a house, we cannot put a ceiling that for an African applicant, we should sell a house at such a price. As I said earlier on and I repeat, it is purely a question of willing buyer willing seller. If you cannot afford it somebody else will.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALE3E: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, what the Assistant Minister is saying is, very discouraging because, irrespective of indigenous businessmen and women, of course, there is the question of willing buyer willing seller. However, if there is a new building which has been constructed, it does not, re qui re any goodwill. But .you will, find that to get an office in new building or business premises, you are required to pay a goodwill of about K5h.200,000 What is this goodwill for? Can the Assistant Minister tell us how he is going to curb this type of exploitation of demanding goodwill and "keymoney" from premises that are newly constructed?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NDONG: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question of goodwill is all over the country, and it depends on the town where you are purchasing a building. If it is Nairobi, goodwill is high, and if it is Meru, goodwill is different. What I am saying is that goodwill really depends on the economic progress of the country. We have achieved a lot during the last few years and, because of this, buildings are going up all the time. So, what is happening isthat, for developers to try to generate some money .</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is trying to evade the last question that was asked by hon. Malebe. We understand that goodwill is paid for an old business. How does it come into a new business? Could the Government make some policy regarding new businesses? If there is nothing you are selling, why do you have to pay Shs.200,000 for your business?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NDONG: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we will look into this matter.</Newspeech>Question No. 21	 Promotion: Mr. Paul Ndambuki	MR. BIDU asked the Minister for Livestock Development why Mr. Paul Ndambuki, PNo. 17048,	who works with the Veterinary Department, Kinahgo. as subordinate staff has not been promoted to the .grade of technical assistant despite fulfilling all the basic requirements contained in the	 Ministrys circular letter, ref. No. MLDAPP13(148) dated 14th January, 1988.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Chesire): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Ministry has already approved Mr. Ndambukis promotion to Technical Assistant II (Job Group "E"), and we are in the process of informing of this.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Assistant Minister very much for his reply, but I would want him to tell the House whether he is satisfied with the circular issued by his Ministry in 1988 Mr. Ndambuki has been writing a lot of letters without getting any reply. Is he satisfied that what has been done is fair to Mr. Ndambuki?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHESIRE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am satisfied.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASIKE—ND0MBI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order just to say that the Ministry has approved Mr. Ndambukis promotion without telling us the date on which this promotion becomes effective? He has not told us whether this promotion has been backdated or not.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHESIRE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this matter has already gone to the Ministerial Appointments Committee, and the officer in question is going to be informed of the results immediately, for immediate implementation.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.K. KIMEMIA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I ask my Question, I would like to inform you that I have received no written answer to it.</Newspeech>Question No. 27 Reason for Sacking Unga Limited EmployeesMR. A.K. KIMEMIA asked the Minister for Labour why the management of Unga Limited, of P. 0. Box 160, Nakuru, terminated the., services of Messrs Peter Mbui, Wilson Ngunjiri, John Mwangi Gitambo, Gerishon Wanyama and Mark Wanjala in December,. 1989, after serving the company for many years.<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I am sorry I did not get your last comment. clearly,. Mr. Kimemia.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.K. KIMEMIA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I said that I did not get a written answer to this Question.</Newspeech>(The Minister for Labour did not stand up to reply)<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is anyone here from .the Ministry of Labour? THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I did not hear the Question being put. Has it been asked?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Yes, it has already been put.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I beg to reply, but before I do so, I would like to make a small point here. The hon. Questioner has put to us three different Question, one in Kiswahili and two in English, about the same subject. He asks about the number of people who have been dismissed and puts Questions on a few of them at a time. The answer I am going to give now applies to Question No. 11.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.K. KIMEMIA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I want to inform the Minister that the three Questions that I have put relate to different people, and the Questions themselves are also different.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there was a group of people who were dismissed at the same time on the same day for the same purpose, and we are handling their. cases together as a group.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Minister in order to grumble over the matter when he knows very well that he does not have a proper answer?</Newspeech>(Laughter)<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,. I am not responsible for the amplification process in the House and I think it is the engineer sitting at the back of the Chamber who is responsible for this. I just speak into the microphone before me, and it picks up whatever it can, but if it cannot amplify my voice, we had better get another engineer. The answer I. have, is as follows: There are eight people altogether who are involved in this case,! and this answer applies to them all. Their names appear in Questions No. l1,l2. and 27. The services of the person here called Mr. Mbui. in our records,, he is called Mr. Peter Mbai Muindi and Messrs Wilson Ngunjiri, John Mwangi this is the name we have in our records, although the name appearing in the Order Paper is John Mwangi Gitambo Gerishon Wanyama, Mark Wanjala and others were terminated on allegations that they wrote a damaging letter to the headquarters of the company accusing the local, management of practising tribalism and favouritism. As the union representing these people, that is the Union of Commercial, Food and Allied Workers, could not agree with the employer regarding these dismissals, the Secretary General of the Union reported a trade dispute which reached me on 20th February, 1990. As I am now, I am setting into motion the process of investigating this complaint, and I have appointed a labour officer who is now Nakuru to investigate the whole of the circumstances surrounding the dismissals of these people by the company. When this process is completed, these peoplewill be told what is to be done. Thank you.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.K. KIMEMIA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the already has said that he has already taken action in respect of these people. Could he tell this. House what the contents of the letter in question?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not have the details of the letter. It is the allegation of the employer that the affected employees wrote a letter to the management of Unga Ltd. in Nairobi, accusing the management of Unga Ltd. in Nakuru of practising tribadism and favouritsm. The relevant trade union disputed the allegation by the Nakuru management and, actually, reported a dispute to me under the Trade Disputes Act. Since that has been done, we will now take the usual action as prescribed in such a situation, and that is what we are doing now.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can these affected-employees be reinstated pending the outcome of the on-going investigations?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, once a trade dispute has been, reported, there is a procedure that must be followed. Therefore, that process must go ahead. In the meantime, we cannot order a reinstatement or a dismissal. It must remain as it is because the matter will need to acquire a legal probation, and we must proceed in accordance with the laid down regulations until the matter is resolved.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. J.N. MUNGAI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while at least thanking the Minister for that very kind approach he has given the matter through the appoint¬ment of a committee to investigate the dismissal, and taking into account the fact that the affected workers depended on this employment for their livelihood and that of their families, could the Minister assure this House that the matter will take the shortest possible period so that the affected workers are given a quick solution?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Yes, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister has agreed that there was a damaging letter written to the management of Unga Ltd. in Nairobi against a certain manager in Nakuru. Since there are investigations going on in the matter, and since the Nakuru manager is still there and is likely to interfere with the investigations, could the Minister assure this House that the man against whom allegations of practising tribalism and favouritsm will be suspended so thatthere can be an independent inquiry without bias?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: No, Sir. We cannot make judgment before we have heard evidence from both sides.<Newspeech>MR. KIILU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the Minister tell us how long it will take to complete these investigations?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Sir, it will take as long as it takes to investigate; it may be two or three weeks, depending on how quickly the witnesses come around and on how responsive they will be. It is a court process.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MIS0I: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it really in order for the Minister to give us an answer on an allegation whose contents he has not seen, that the affected workers wrote a letter accusing the management of tribalism and favouritsm?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Yes, Sir, it is quite in order. The services, of the workers were terminated, the matter reported to the relevant trade union and a dispute reported to us. We asked both sides to set off and we held a court between the employer, and. the employees, and then the trade union and the employer did not agree.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Have you really got hon. (Dr.) Misois point, Mr. Minister?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: I am only explaining what happened.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I thought you said that the matter is in court.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, when a matter is reported, we bring the two disagreeing parties together and while hearing how the employer came to dismiss his workers, both sides make allegations to defend themselves. If they cannot agree, then they declare a dispute and then we then start the industrial process going. That is the stage we have reached now since the: trade union has reported that there is a dispute between them and Unga Ltd. on the dismissal of these eight people. We have now set into motion the process of industrial adjudication.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: We must get on now. Mr. Chepkok's Question.</Newspeech>Question No. 7 Encasher of Cheque No. 7655-7806MR. CHEPKOK asked the Minister for Research, Science and Technology who cashed Cheque No. 7655-7806, dated 13th March, 1989, for U.S. Dollars. 4170,. belonging to the Kenya Trypanosomiasis Research Institute, AC No. D3-587-0661, maintained; by Swiss Bank Corporation of 1211 Geneva 27 Avenue, Appia 20, Switzerland.<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Nobody here from the Ministry of Research,. Science and Technology?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILUCU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. In view of the fact that this is a very important Question alleging that our currency is being smuggled to Switzerland, and taking into account that the Ministry of Research,. Science and Technology is not represented here at the moment, could the Front Bench use the collective, responsibility spirit and reply, to it?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Well can. I have the Question deferred to allow the Minister prepare himself adequately.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. This is the third time that this Question has appeared on the Order Paper. I put the Question last, year and the Minister refused to come and reply to it. There was a second time and, even during this third time, they are. still refusing to answer the Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Too bad!. Too bad! What is happening?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: That is why I . tend to support what hon. Kiliku has just suggested.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Can the Question be included in next week's Order Paper and the relevant Ministry please prepare to answer it?</Newspeech>Question deferred)<header>QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE</Header>Steps to Tighten Security in Kinango<Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister of State, Office of the President, the following Question by Private Notice. In view of the fact that bandits attacked the residents of Dupharo Sub location, Taru Location in Kinango Division on 5th March, 1990, and shot dead a Mr. Mujape, what urgent steps is the Minister taking to tighten security measures in this area?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Nabwera): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.After this unfortunate incident, my Ministry has intensified patrols in that area generally.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while half-way appreciating the Minister's reply, I wish to ask him whether he is aware that the intensification of security was there when my, man was killed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Your man?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: My constituent,, rather. You cannot take Administration police-men,. the regular police or the anti poaching unit, and say that you have intensified patrols.' Can the Minister tell this. House whether he can seriously deploy the security personnel trained to deal with this kind of insecurity in the country?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Deputy Speaker,. Sir, the security personnel we have in Kinango area is quite competent and qualified to handle the situation. In fact, I would like to add that when this incident took place, the matter was reported to- Mackinnon Police and then relayed to Voi before the police at Kwale were alerted. The matter was then handled by the police at Kwale who are not members of the anti poaching unit; they are trained and they are quite capable of handling the situation.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILUKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as much as I do agree with the hon. Minister that our security personnel are trained, can he tell us whether so far there have been any arrest made of suspects following the death of the victim?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MABWERA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I said that when the security personnel were alerted about this incident, they went to the scene of the action Hon. Members may not know that Kinango is a very vast area and the place where the unfortunate incident took place is very far from the police station and therefore, by the time information regarding this matter reached the police the bandits had already gone away I would like to inform the louse that so far no arrests have been made.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from the Minister's reply that Kinango is a very vast area, would he assure this Souse that they are going to put up a police post somewhere within this vast area.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MABWERA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is not possible for my Ministry to put up a police station or a police post in this area, or elsewhere in the country because we do not have the money and the personnel!at the moment, However, the Government is determined to make sure that through the normal mobile police patrols, the' situation in this, area and elsewhere in the country, is controlled. I would like to assure all Kenyans that Government is determined to offer the normal security that, they require for their day to day activities.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MS. BIDU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, would the Minister tell this Souse whether he is satisfied with the security arrangement in this area. Is' a person who comes from this area, I visited the place where this particular person was killed. However, I learned from the relatives of the deceased that although the police followed the footprints of the bandits, they abandoned them when they noticed that the bandits had entered the forest. This means that the police were afraid of following the bandits. So, could the Minister send the General' Service Unit personnel to this area to track down these bandits instead of sending these very- email people?</Newspeech>(laughter)<Newspeech>MR. MABWERA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it, is not true, and the hon. Member knows this, that the security personnel abandoned their search for these bandits when they noticed they had entered the forest. In fact, by the time the security personnel arrived at the scene of this terrible incident, these bandits had long left the area and to make the matters worse, it had rained. Therefore, it cannot be true that the police were afraid of pursuing these bandits. I would like to assure the hon. Member that the Kenya police are well trained to pursue bandits wherever they are.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are pleased to hear that the Minister is taking action to contain the situation, but could he enlighten this House whether the intensification of these patrols will involve increasing the number, of personnel and higher frequency equipment?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, wherever we have an incident like the one that took place at Kinango, we increase the security personnel and make them more mobile is I said, we cannot afford to put up enought police stations or police posts in the country and therefore, we have to rely on the mobility security personnel. I am sure that since this incident took place at Unango, the hon. Member for Unango will agree with me that our police have been on the move and that the security situation in the area has greatly improved.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, now that the Minister has assured this Souse, that there is adequate security personnel in this area, could he consider to compensate Mr. Mnjape who died for not fault of his own. Me happened to have been one of my voters.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this and many other unfortunate incidents in the country where our people get killed by bandits, have received very serious attention by the Government. However, it is very difficult for the Government to lay down a policy of compensating those who lose their lives in this unfortunate manner because we do not know who will get killed or where they will be killed. However, we do our best to provide the security personnel.Is I am speaking we have had a similar problem in another area where our people have been attacked by bandits from a different country. Therefore, it would be very difficult for the Government to undertake compensation for those killed, but the Government will make sure that enough security is provided to as many of our people in the country as possible.</Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me just add this: that this particular incident would not have taken place if the local people did not with the bandits and I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to our local people not to collaborate with these bandits. In this particular case, the bandits knew the name of this particular individual who was killed, and the information I have is that there were some local collaborators amongst the people in the area. The local people should co-operate with the police and as soon as they see strangers in their area, they should report the matter to the police immediately so that action can be taken. This -would help us to wipe out banditry in Kenya once and for all.</Newspeech><HEADER>POINT OF ORDER</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Kibaki): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I would like to seek your permission, 	to clarify a point of order that, was raised by an hon. Member in this House regarding tenders at the Kenyatta national Hospital. The point that the hon. Member raised was with regard to two issues.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the first issue was with regard to tender Sb.KHH/2/89-90 for the supply of' bottles, rubber stoppers and aluminium caps used for the production of intravenous fluids administered to patient So This was an open tender which was advertised in the Kenya Times on Friday 29th September, 1989 and on Thursday, 26th October, 1989. The procedure in adver-tising. and awarding open tenders implies that any firm, individual, or group of individuals are free and can participate. Those who participate axe called upon to supply to the Tender Board specific sets of information, including samplesMr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in all 23 firms bided for the tenders and the list is attached here and I will lay it on the Table for hon. Members to see. The samples submitted for the three items called for, were coded and then technically evaluated by a committee of five persons who did not have any infor¬mation regarding the suppliers of the various samples. The Tender Board was guided by the prices quoted as well as by the report of the Technical Evaluation.Committee in making its decisions for each of there three items the following information was made available First of all, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the first item was for the supply of medical bottle where out of the 32 samples submitted, four were technically approved from the following suppliers: (a) Kamacha Stationeries, (b) Saniphann Ltd (c) N.R. Gudka and (d) Mavasi Supplies Ltd. The award for the supply of these medical bottles was made to Messrs. N.R. Gudka, as they were the lowest in price amongst the four samples approved "by the Technical Evaluation Committee.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, regarding the rubber stoppers, out of the 29 samples submitted, 7 samples were technical all approved from the following suppliers: (a) Chema Holdings Ltd. (b) Sanipharm Ltd. (c) Krunacha Stationeries, (d) Flanomed Africa Ltd, (e) Hospital Engineering, (f) Spectropham Ltd., (g) Mavasi Supplies. The aware! was given to Sanipharm Ltd. who was the lowest in the price among the seven.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, with, regard to aluminium caps, out of .23 samples, five were technically approved from Planomed Africa Limited, Chema Holdings, Portable Hardware and electricals, Hospital Engineering and Pava Enterprises. The award was given to Portable Hardware and Electricals, as they were the lowest in. price among the five. The three suppliers have been awarded the tender to supply the three items signed and returned the letters of acceptance and orders have already been placed with them.The additional point which was raised by the hon. Member, was with regard to the article which appeared in The Standard newspaper of March 19th. The article was entitled: "Hospital facing' acute shortage of supplies". Among the items which were purported to be shorthand, missing were" disposable gloves^ and pain killers at the dental clinic The stock position as at the 19th of March, 1990 the relevant day when the report appeared in. the newspaper was as follows: We had 50,000 disposable gloves and this is adequate stock, Sir. We had 33,000 pairs of surgeon gloves of different sizes whose consumption ranges from 2,000 to 3,000 pairs per week for the entire hospital. These gloves are used both by dentists and other doctors. With regard to the dental cartridges which are injected as pain killers, the stock position was 26,000 whose consumption is only 2,000 per week. Aspirin was in a large stock of 631,000 and the stock position of panadol was 974,000.I am trying to emphasize the fact that hon. Members who choose to believe everything they read in the newspapers, will also take their own risks. Kenyatta National Hospital is also trying very hard to improve its services.I would also like to emphasize that the new Board which is managing the Kenyatta National Hospital will welcome some criticism from the Press and from members of the public on what should be done to improve the hospital. This is our hospital a± and we want the people to be involved. We have now started on cost sharing and we are going to have a board of management and that is why we want everybody to be involved and to speak about what should be done to improve the services but not to write fictitious stories in the newspapers and above all to believe them. The Hospital Director and other officers welcome questions from the public.</Newspeech><Newspeech>ME. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to respond to what the hon. Minister has said. Then this article appeared in The Standard newspaper on 19th March and the Ministry decided to keep quite, we took it to be nothing else but the truth. The Minister has now clarified the issue and we shall read from the papers which he has laid on the Table how the tender was awarded. The Minister should, also take note that if there is any article in the newspapers which the Ministry does not agree with they should react immediately at rather than keep quiet.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Kibaki): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we will only correct a report which we think may be harmful, but if somebody says that we are short of panadols, it does nobody any harm; it only exposes the reporter. There is no shortage of drugs and the patients are being attended to. ¥e do not want to keep on arguing with newspapers because we can never win. newspapers will always win.</Newspeech>(applause)<Newspeech>MR. WASKIKE-NDOMBI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker,Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: It is not the intention of the Chair to allow debate on this matter. What is it Mr. WasikeNdombi?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASIKENDOMBI: My point of order, Sir, is that His Excellency the President is coming back from Namibia and there is very short time left before his arrival.  Can the Chair allow me to move that we adjourn the House to another day so that we go to the airport to welcome the president?</Newspeech>(applause) <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: 	Do I understand from the Leader of Government Business that His Excellency the President arrives at 4.30 p.m.?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE VICEPRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR FINANCE (Prof. Saitoti): Yes.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: If that is the case, could you, Mr. WasikeNdombi, renew that application shortly before four o'clock so that  we can give the floor to one or two other people to  raise their points of order?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. When replying to Question No. 11 which was raised by hon. A. K. Kimemia regarding the dismissal of Mr. NashonOpanga, the Assistant Minister who gave a reply said that the matter was already before the Industrial Court.  I also emphasized this point   when I was replying to Question  Nos. 11,12 and 27  which are about the same group of eight people. The matter has been reported to us  asa dispute and the Industrial Court process has started. That is whatthe Assistant Minister meant.  He did not mean that the matter was already in the Industrial Court. The case has not yet been given a number in the Industrial Court.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.K. KIMEMIA:  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if that is the case, can the Minister apologise to this House because he had said that the matter was already in the Industrial Court and he is now saying the contrary?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo):  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, once a matter has  been entered into the process of adjudication, it proceeds to the Industrial Court.	There is, therefore, no need for apology at all.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: I rise a point of order on a matter that I think is very important. A motion was debated here last year about  some shortages with regard to wheat flour and sugar. I do not know about the situation in  other places but in my constituency, there is shortage of these commodities  and the people are suffering a lot. At that time, the Ministry explained that there was sabotage as the commodities were being exported to neighbouring countries. If that is still the case, then there must be something wrong somewhere because these commodities are not available in a  constituency and when they are available, they are sold at exorbitant prices. We discussed this matter at the subdistrict development committee meeting and it. is of concern  to my people. Sir, can the Ministry of Commerce give an explanation as to why the situation is continuing to be like this?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE (Mr. Karingt):  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are aware of the shortages and I would like to assure the hon. Member  that we will look into the matter and, perhaps, come up with a sound answer very shortly.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: When?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE (Mr. Karingi):I said very shortly or soon.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU:On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Sneaker, Sir. Can the Assistant Minister tell us what he means by shortly, soon and soon? Can he be specific and say, for example, next Tuesday?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE(Mr. Karingi):  Mr. Deputy Speaker; Sir, we are doing our best and as soon as we have a reasonable answer to the problem, we will Table it here.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: When?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE (Mr.  Karingi): I cannot give a specific date.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE:  On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.I think that is very vague. Could the Assistant Minister tell us whetherhe will bring an answer on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday because those are the days of the week when the Abuse meets?  Can he be specific because   members of the public want to know  what the Ministry is doing about these shortages?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE (Mr. Karingi):  Mr. Deputy  Speaker, Sir, 	this matter has just been raised this  afternoon by the hon. Member. We will give ourselves a week, during which time to come up with an answer.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.Is the Assistant Minister in order to fail to give specific reply to this point of order when the Government has all communication facilities at its disposal? If he wants he can get all thenecessary information about what is happening by tomorrow. Will he,therefore, be more specific and give us a date when the Ministry will respond to this point of order?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE (Mr. Karingi): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will do its best to give an answer early next week, perhaps on Tuesday or Wednesday.</Newspeech> 	<Header>MOTION</Header>Thanks for the Presidential Address THAT, the thanks of this House be recorded for the exposition of public policy containted in His Excellency's Presidential Address from the Chair on on 13th March, 1990. (The minutes for Energy (Mr. Biwott) on 14.3.90) (Resumption of debate interrupted on 21.3.90).<Newspeech>MR.

Hata sijui tic kwa nini watu wenginehawatosheki na hali Shs.141 million zilizokusanywa zitasaidia watoto wa Kenya nzima na si wale wa nzilaya ya Barinau sehemu fulPni. Hata watoto wa watu wasiotosheka watafaidika kutokana na pesa hizi.  Tungemenda wale ambao hawatosheki wajitokeze ili wajulikant kwa sababu hatutaki ionekanALkama sisi ni viongozitunaosaidia bila ya kuwa na shuk ranm. Tune jua Mtukufu Raishusimama katika jua kali  kwa muda mrefu wakati anapoendesha Harambee za kuwasaidia wananchi. Kwa hivyo, ningewaomba Wabunze   wenzangu tumsaidie rais kwa kila njia badala ya kueneza uvumi lemma wengine wasiotosheka wanavyofanya. Bw. Naibu Spika, ningeiomba Wizara ya Afya Ujenzi wa vituo vya afya vya Kimolingop, Nginyang, Kolol na Yatia, Hii ni kwa sababu ujenzi wa vituo hivi ulisimpms ramp miaka mitatu iliyopita na wananchi bado wanaendelea kungnjea ujenzi. huo ukPmilishwe ili waweze kupata'huduma za afya.

THAT, following recent increases in prices of most essential commodities and the decontrol of prices of others, it is evident the purchasing power of all workers has been tremendously reduced; hence this House urges the Government to effect compensatory measures in form of scrapping current wage guidelines and immediate commensurate salary and wage increases for all categories of public and private sector workers.

Kwale Police Division, among others has benefited from the current on going antipoaching operations in the country.

No.3171. 	All these officers were recruited towards the end of  last year and it is not ma customary for young officers like that to address their grievances to this  House. 	There is a proper procedure where such officers 40km would seek reddress from their respective chief personnel, officers, and not through questions or 	this House. I will take serious actions in future to such	officers who will address their small grievances to their respective Members of Parliament. It is not the right procedure and my office will not accent that kind of procedure.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It in order for the Assistant Minister to threaten the members of this nation,  and yet they have the freedom of asking any question through this House. 	The Assistant Minister has threatened that they will take some action against any person who asks such a question in future. Can he now withdraw that threat?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEEN:	Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I will not withdraw.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR  MWAMZANDI: On a point of order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir. The members of the public,  including civil servants do elect  Members of Parliament,  and therefore, they have every right to request their respective Members of Parliament for assistance. Is the Assistant Minister therefore in order to give civil servants a threat,  and then he was asked to withdraw the remark he refused. 	The supremacy of this House should be maintained, I do not think he is in order to give wee such a threat, and I think, Mr.  Speaker should help us here.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEEN: 	I will only  entertain such questions being brought to this House by staff members of our Ministry after they have exhausted all the necessary and required machinery in our office. In a case like this, involving salaries, I do not think those officers who were newly recruited had exhausted such machinery. In the event where such machinery has been 	exhausted, they will be at liberty to bring sua question		before this House. But in a case like this one, I do not think a question was warranted</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MWENJE: On a point of order, Mr.  Speaker, Sir. I think it is important to get your ruling. There is no way time that an Assistant Minister will stand here and threatenThe members of this country, that if their question are raised here, be they civil servants  otherwise,  steps willbe taken against them. They are well represented in this     House, and they have a right to ask questions here, whether ornot there is another channel.  They can decide to use this channel.  When I asked the Assistant Minister to withdraw his remark,  he refused.Sir,  I think the Assistant Minister should withdraw that threatto the members of this country,  and in particular civil servants.If he does not, I request for your ruling.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

MWAMZANDI:  On a point of order, Mr.  Speaker, Sir,With regard to your ruling, that the Assistant Minister was notthreatening. Members of Parliament, you said that he was threateningCivil servants. He is discouraging civil servants from  requesting hon. Members of Parliament to pursue their problems through this House  that wit, discourage civil servants fromconsulting their Members Of Parliament?  If the hon. Assistant  Minister has been given that go ahead do you not  think that  we are doing disservice to members of the Civil Service?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

He was only requestingcivil servants to follow  the C.O.R.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

KARATTRI: Mr. Speaker; Sir, I would like the hon. Member to produce that evidence. If he has a letter from the Directorof Education promoting the teacher let him produce it and we will adjust his Salary. The hon. Member alleges that the letter waswritten by the District Education Officer. But D.E.O.S have noauthority to promote teachers.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we know that D.E.O.S are agents of the Ministry of Education and T.S.C. How come then that the Assistant Minister says that they have no authority to promote teachers?  We know that they have written letters to interdictteachers and the T.S.C. has accepted those letters. How come that when it comes to promotions they cannot do anything?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, even in matters of employment, as the hon.  Member has Mentioned; the D.E.O.s have no authority. It is the Secretary of the Teachers Service Commission who employs teachers. In the case of promotion, when a teacher has been promoted, a letter is written directly to the teacher by the Director of Education and only a copy of that letter is given to the D.E.O.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are very conservant with these things and we know that the Director of Education is the final authority  But the Director of Education does not go out into the fieldto inspect teachers. There is a panel which goes out inspect teachers  and after the inspection they submit their reports to the Director of Education who confirms the promotion of teachers. Why does the Assistant Minister say that the Director writes letters to the teachers who	are. being promoted? promotes them but does not write letters to them.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker Sir,  it appears that the hon. Member knows the answer because. he is explaining. It. A team of inspectors goes out to inspect teachers and, then they recommend to the Director or Education which teachers should be promoted. After this the Director of Education writes letters to those individual teachers informing them that they have been promoted: This cannot be done by the D.E.O. or anybody else.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of Order; Mr. Speaker, Sir. We want clarification from the hon. Questioner as to whether Mr. Nzuki was promoted or not: If he was promoted why does the Assistant Minister deny it?</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Answer that one, Mr. Karauri</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker; Sir; this question is directed to the  hon. Questioner but not me.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>Mr. WAMBUA: Mr. Speaker; Sir, this teacher was promoted.I have a letter here from the D.E.O. to the teacher and it reads as follows:Mr. David M. Nzuki,P.O.Box. 16,MASII.PROMOTION ON MERIT  1982REF: BE/CONG./ 46/84 20.7.62REF: Circular Letter,  Inspectorate 6/1/1/11/2615.3.75 Promotion from P2 to P1Please note that you were promoted to a new grade given above on Special Merit.  Please accept my congratulations.  By copy of this letter the T.S.C. is kindly	requested to bring your records  up to date and adjust  your salary accordingly. Since the promotion on merit  is given to you on appreciation of your past work, I congratulate you on your promotion:D.E.O MACHAKOSThe Secretary, Teachers Service Commission Provincial Basic Education Officer Ministry of Basic Education.The teacher was inspected, a report on him was made, and then he was promoted on merit.	He should, therefore, be promoted on merit.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI:	Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not see why there is a conflicthere.	When a teacher has been. recommended for promotion and the Directorof Education has accepted the recommendation, he then, writes a letter to the particular teacher who has been promoted, informing him that he has been promoted.  The District Education Officer is only given a copy of that letter.	Besides that, a list of the teachers promoted each year is sent to the District Education Officers concerned.	The hon. Member, should understand that no letter from the District Education Officer telling the teacher that he has been promoted is valid.</Newspeech><Newspeech>	MR. A.I. MOHAMMED Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is an embarrassing situation.TheDistrictEducation Officer is, the agent Of the TeachersCommission as. well as the, representative of the Minister forEducation at the district level.

Taking to save the situation?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI:  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know, thatthe District Education officer is an agent of the Ministry, and so is the Minister of Education But the only person empowered to write a letter in forming a teacher that he has been promoted is the Director of Education.

MISOI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.	The Assistant Minister has told us that the District Education Officer in question wrote a letterto this teacher informing him of the promotion, and the Ministry has not even disciplined him.  Is he fit to be a District Education Officer if he can write this kind of letter?  What does the Ministry intend to do about such in efficient and misleading District Education Officers?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI:  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member has noted from the letters read that they were written to the teacher.  They were never copied to the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education or the Minister. Weare just being made aware, and in any case that District Education Officer has already retired.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI:	On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The District Education Officer was acting on behalf of the Ministry.  If that is notthe case, why do we have District Education Officers?  Also, what has theMinistry done about this case?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. KARAURI:  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have mentioned the procedure ofPromotion of teachers. This teacher  stands a chance of being promoted Buthe has to fill in forms, be inspected, and then he has to wait until the Director of Education writes to him that he has been promoted.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS.  NDETEI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, where there is smoke, there is fire. Hon Members are making noise over this teacher’s case, but there are many otherteachers With similar cases 1. will bring to the; a similar case nextweek.  There has been a lot of talk that these teachers will be inspected, given this kind of letter, but. 'chai' must  follow.  If there is no chair, the thing just dies there the teacher does not get promoted.  We hope that this is not one of those cases. Can then the Ministry of Education either honour this letter, or revoke everything that has been done of a similar nature.  This is a big exercise for the Ministry of Education.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not knowabout 'chai'.	Andin any case, even if anybody gave 'chai’ to	an officer' who is not authorizedto give promotions, he will not be promoted	just because he has given 'chai'.Promotion is done on merit and A teacher must	have served a minimum of five years in the same grade.	He then has to apply for promotion, and inspectorsare sent to assess him..	If there is any hon. Member who thinks that aDistrict Education Officer can promote a teacher, he should know from now that the only person empowered to promote teachers is the Director of Education.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

The Cheque was cashed by Dr. P.D, Sayer, of P.O. Box.362,  Kikuyu who is an employee of the Kenya Trypanosomiasis Research      Institute as per Central Bank of Kenya authority Ref.

The Cheque was cashed by  an 	Individual and the account is maintained by one person How can a Kenya Government Institution account be maintained by one person?  Can the Minister tell the House. how many people are signatory to that account?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MUHOHO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to be very clear, and may I explain this issue at length so that there is no doubt left in anybody‘s mind.In 1980, the World Health Organisation (WHO) signed. an agreement with the Kenya Trypanosomiasis Research Institute (K.T.A.I.)for a programme to screen drugs, and WHO gave us a grant initially  ""  tell us what    U.S. Dollars 106,000. The money was meant to pay an expert   and also to buy some equipment.  Since then WHO has given us aregular grant of about U.S. Dollars 100,000 give and take. Authority was sought from the Central Bank of Kenya to open an external account and, as a matter of fact the WHO Account in Geneva was designated ate authority on the Account for the transaction. The condition of the Central Bank of Kenya was that there should be regular returns to the Central Bank  of Kenya on the management of this Account.  Later on the Auditor-General  (Corporations) was established by an Act of Parliament, and he regularly audits this Account.  The signatories this particular Account are the Director of the institute and the Chief Accountant. Later on.it was pointed out that either of those two was the designated signatorthat is Director and tie Auditor-General (Corporations).			The Auditor-General (Corporations) has pointed out that we do need two signatories and so we have added the Chairman of the Institute as a third signatory, of which two signatories from now onwards will be honoured. So that has been the practice and there is nothing new. It is a common practice within parastatal bodies, and particularly in cases where we receive grants from international organisations.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the Minister confirmor deny that the Institute is not having an external account with the Kenya Commercial Bank? Why should they open another one inGeneva?  Why can they not make use of the one with the Kenya Commercial Bank?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MUHOHO Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said earlier on, thisis an Account that goes back to 1980. This is what was agreed onand it is actually what happened. As a matter of fact, this particular Account is usuallytransacted by Banker’s Order. The only  reason why Mr. Chepkoki,or whoever gave him this document would  have seen that this particularCheque was to pay the difference of salary  is that Mr. Sayer got an increase in salary which was not Covered by a Banker's So an open cheque was drawn, otherwise this practice has been going Since 1980. </Newspeech>		<Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Minister has said that there are two signatories to this Account  Why was this Cheque 	signed by one person? It is not a crossed cheque but an open one. Why?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MUHOHO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, just like my friend and colleagu hon. Karauri, I feel that hon. Chepkok might have been asleep; I explained quite clearly that there ; were two signatories: the Director and the Chief Account But</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Iwas not asleep when the Minister was replying. The cheque I have here could have been paid to the external account of the Kenya Commercial Bank. The Auditor- General (Corporation) audited this account in 1988 and not 1989 when this cheque was issued. Also, 1980 is a long time ago. Why has it taken so long to rectify?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MUHOHO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I was saying and if the hon. Member has the patience to listen to me repeating, What I saidearlier on, there were two signatories required for this Account, right from the beginning, but one signatory was enough. That isthe way this Account has operated until the Auditor - General(Corporations) pointed out that we needed two signatories at anyparticular time when the signature of the Chairman of the Institue was included. But this was long after the advice was given bythe Auditor-General(Corporations).  .. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to assure the House and the nationthat there: is nothing sinister in this Account and indeed, there is nothing underhand in it. All the permission that is required is there. We have the authority from the Central Bank of Kenya and, indeed, as I said, it is not the first time: we have done that. We do hope that the hon. Member is satisfied.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: On a point of order, Mt. Speaker, Sir.While thanking the Minister for that good reply, he has not actually told us when the Auditor-General (Corporations) advised 15 the change of the signatories?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order, Dr. Misoi! It is most unfornate that I did not know that this information came your way because of the fact that you are in the Public Investment Committee, and if that is the case1 then you are not allowed by our Standing Orders to bring anything here before it is Tabled in the House.  You cannot bring anything to do with what you heard in that Committee here until that report is Tabled. before the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK:On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It isunfortunate that the question came while we were in that Committee, but this doesnot mean that we were dislosing what we discussed in the Public InvestmentsCommittee. I was only telling the Minister that we have never had any oneMinistry in which only one person signs cheque The Director concerned madethe mistake of signing a cheque alone.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: We are now on Question No. 51.</Newspeech>Question No.	51<Header>Construction of Workshop and Science Rooms at Kirangari</Header>MR. P.K. KINYAJUI asked the Minister for Education:(a) 	Why the construction of the workshop and home science rooms has stopped at Kirangari; and (b) 	How the Harambee funds raised last year for this project were utilised.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION	(Mr. Omido): Mr. Speaker, Sir,I beg to reply.		 	(a) The construction of the workshop and home science rooms has	been.stopped because of allegations that the Chairman of the schools Committee who was invariably given the responsibility to oversee the construction process of the buildings has embezzled some  of the Harambee funds raised bor the project. The stopping was considered necessary to enable the District Auditory to audit the books of accounts and establish whether or not the money was properly utilised  	 		raised a stun of:Shs.245;000/=.	Out of this, Shs1180,000/=(b)  The Harambee funds' drive, which was July, 	1989/ has  been used for the construction of the workshops and home science rooms, leaving a balance Shs.65,000/.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, allegation touching onthe embezzlement of Harambee funds have a very negative effect on our own efforts. Would the Assistant Minister tell us when the audit report 	he mention will come out and what steps he would take in this matter? Has the Chairman who is alleged to to have embezzled these funds been suspended or.is he still in his job?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMIDO:  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the chairmen of school committees are elected by parentsteachers associations, and the Ministry has no power over them.However, as I have already told the House, this matter is still with theauditors and, as soon as a report of the auditors is available, the necessaryaction will be taken depending on the outcome of the report.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI:	Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister hasstated that Shs.180,000/= has been spent.	Could he tell us how this money hasbeen spent?	I am sure that this money was collected at a Harambee meeting on a rainy day, and even some hon. Members of this House were there.	We are very concerned that money contributed by wananchi should be ewbezzled. The Assistant Minister should take 'this matter very seriously and make sure that this Shs.180,000/= is arrested.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.	OMIDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, naturally, the Ministry and theGovernment take a very serious view of the embezzlement if public funds, because we know that parents sacrifice a lot to contribute these funds However, 	I have already stated, Shs. 180;000/= was used in the construction of the said buildings. This fact is a part of the auditors exercise going on. If an ho. Member or anybody else, has any information which could help the auditors. I would ask him to communicate with the auditors so that their work may be made easier and the truth comes out.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR KINYANJUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I know from the Assistant Minister whether the Chairman who embezzled this money singlehandedly was the only signatory or his school accounts? Who were the other signatories who might have helped to embezzle this money or who did it together with him?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

MANG'OLI: 0n a point of order, Mr. Speaker; Sir.  Is it in order for the hon. Minister to come here and claim that he cannot answer a Question because the discussions on it ""take a long time""? We have communications like telephones and other machinery like computers that can be applied to work out the consequences of the issue and we have an answer without delay. This is a simple matter of the Minister answering as to whether it was fair to scrap those allowances and what compensation he is contemplating for the civil servants.  What more time does he need for that?  We feel as if, we are not being    treated as hon. Members. These Questions are normally sent to the Ministries  in good time for them to carry out the research they need to do.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Kyalo): Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue involved is terms of service for civil Servants which requires money.

So, we will have more time.</Newspeech><Header>MINISTERIAL STATEMENT</Header> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY (Mr. Otieno):  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a Ministerial Statement on the Menengai Chipboard Factory, Nakuru. In answering Question No. 8 raised by the hon. Member for Nakuru Town on Tuesday, 20th March,  1990, I informed the House that the management of Menengai Chipboard Factory was already taking meassures to modify their machines so that the emission of obnoxious gases and sawdust are controlled. I had further said that I expected the process of modifications and corrections to be completed by the end of March 1990. I personally visited the factory last Friday, 23rd March, 1990 to assess the progress the management had made on the modifications. Besides being with the senior officers from my  Ministry, I was accompanied by His Worship the Mayor of Nakuru, the Industrial Ward councillor, the Nakuru Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Maundu and a factory inspector from the Ministry of Labour. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the present management are the fourth owners of the factory.  They took over the running of the plant in April,  1988, and immediately engaged the services of a Finnish engineer consultant for a whole year with the objective of reservicing the plant. This took one and a half years to accomplish.. Trial runs were done in August/September, 1989, and in October the firm was almost starting full production. The management reported to me that at that juncture they encountered a problem with sanding section of their production process, where some fine dust was escaping into the air and becoming a nuisance to the residential areas nearby. The municipal council, which had written several letters of complaint to the management, decided to withhold the issuing of the licence for 1990 to the Company until they rectified the problem. The company was, therefore, ordered to stop commercial production until they solved the dust problem. The company took  the measures required by the municipal council seriously and had, in fact, spent larger sums of money in the, modification of their technical processes such as replacement of the cycling system, installation of silos and wetting system.. However, to test the effectiveness of the new system, the plant had to be run and this is what the company has been doing over the last four weeks.  There is need to continue with the exercise for  some time until the dust problem is completely solved.   At the time of my visit to the factory there were no effluent, gas, noise or any other form of polution.  The only complaint was about the fine sawdust which the residents had considered to be a nuisance. This was, however,a problem of the past since the management had already carried out the measureswhich had almost totally eliminated the problem. I also had the opportunity   to meet a few residents in the neighbourhood of the factory and I did enter their houses. They informed me that they used to have a lot of problems with dustfrom the plant but the problem is now almost nonexistent. In the Circumstances,it is reasonable to allow the company to continue the test run for a further period of three months with effect from 23rd March, 1990.  The Nakuru Municipal Council, the factory inspector as well as the district industrial development officer in Nakuru will monitor the testing process and submit weekly reports on the factory. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the residents of the area should, therefore, not harass the management of the factory any more or make undue demands on them. They should channel any further complaints to the appropriate Government authorities who are  a position to take the necessary action. Thank you, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.K. KIMEMIA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 	According the the statement by the hon. Minister, he appears to agree with me that there had been problems in the past, which were highlighted by the letters of complaint from the Nakuru Municipal Council. It is quite apparent that the fact that the factory has been allowed to continue test runs for three month means they need time to rectify the existing problems  So, the Minister agrees with me that there had been problems. I do thank the Minister for that sincere statement</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR MANG'OLI:On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.	 Last week we were given a reply here by an Assistant Minister for Industry, who Categorically stated that the factory had been closed. Now, the statement by the Minister himself indicates that the factory has been operating, but not on commercial basis. Does it mean that the Assistant Minister who gave us the reply misled the House? If so, can the Minister, through the Chair, apologise to this House? We were told here that the factory had closed down one year previously, yet when the Minister visited the company it was operating, though not on commercial basis.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR 1NDUSTRY(Mr. Otieno): 	Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would be saving the time of the House if the hon. Member listened to me carefully. The factory had been closed, was under repair, was tested in September and ordered closed again until March this year when test runs were being conducted. There is no contradiction between what the Assistant Minister told the House and what I am saying now.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  When the Assistant Minister was replying to the Question, he said that the factory had been closed. That was last week and not three weeks ago.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY (Mr. Otteno): 	Mr. Speaker, Sir, the confusion may be arising. from the definition of the word "close".  Legally, the factory has not beenlicensed to operatein 1990. It was, however, authorised to conduct trial runs to test if the system was functioning properly.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MANG’OLI: On a point.of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Minister trying to give us a new definition of the word ""close?"" When we say that a factory has been closed, it means that it is not operational. That is the definition of ""close"", and we know English. Can the Minister tell us whether the factorywas really closed or now? The Assistant.Minister said that the company had closeddown threeweeks previously, and.when the Minister visited the site the factory was still operating. Which is which?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR 1NDUSTRY (Mr. Otieno): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have made myself clear, that the factory was legaily ordered closed so that the necessaryrehabilitations and repair could be conducted. When you finish such exercises,you have to test whether what you havedone is effective. Therefore, authority was given to conduct testruns  WhenAre say thatthe factory was not operating   Commerdially, we mean that the factory was only allowed to conduct test runsto see  if  the system can operate commecially.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER:	Next Order.</Newspeech><Header>MOTION</Header><Header>Thanks for the Presidential Address</Header>THAT, the thanks of this House be recorded forthe exposition of public policy contained in HisExcellency's Presidential Address from the Chairon 13th March,	1990. (The Minister for Energy on 14.3.90)(Resumption of Debate interrupted on 22.3.90)  <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT  (Mr. Mbori): Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chande to contribute to this Motion on the Presidential Address delivered On 13th March, 1990. Sir, this country should count itself very lucky to have a head of state of the stature of our President, who is incomparable to any other in the African continent.  When we lost the late Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Corporation, this country underwent a very trying.period which required theleadership qualities of His Excellency the President.  The death of Dr. Ouke was occasioned by ill-wishers or people who have never wished Kenya well.  Despite ill wishes, Kenya has made wonderful steps in the direction of development.  In fact, we cannot be compered to any of our neighbours; be they immediate or distant. Our country country is fairing very well despite the misdeeds by those evil doers who, if I may say, are satanic.  We shall continue with our development activities through the Nyayo philosophy of peace, love and unity.  Those who killed Dr. Ouko wanted to give  this country an international shame.  Those who killed Dr. Ouko wanted this country to receive international shame but I am glad that they have failed. They also hoped that unity, love and stability on which Kenya stands wbuld be broken. They are now ashamed to see us stand firmly behind the President who has ledthis country so wonderfully, faithfully and steadfastly. They wished to drive a wedge between the people who are led by the President.Mr. Speaker, Sir, our country is known for peaceful development. Ordinary people in this country are behind His Excellency the President.This august Mouse has a duty to the  nation of thanking the  Presidentfor leading us so well. He has provided an example which isnot comparableanywhere. We need a leader of all seasons. We have a President who isa leader of the country; a man for all people, a man for all seasons andan all rounder. who is leadingils very well. Come what may</Newspeech>(noise)<Newspeech>MRS. NDETEI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. There is so much noise in the Mouse and the  hon Member who is speakire is forced to shoat in order to be heard.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: I do notappear tohave heard any a noise. Hon.    Members are only consulting each other and this ie quite in order.</Newspeech>        <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Mbori):  Thank you,  Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I am grateful to the hon. gracious lady  forprotecting me but, Sir, I think the consultation was rather too loud.I hope that the volume of the consultations will be lowered so that I cancn:tribute to this wonderful Motion.As I was saying, Kenyans believe in peace, love and unity. Leaderscome and go and we, hon. Members, are like soldiers going to war.  All ofus know that  one day we will pass aws$ from this world but we do not knowhow. Despite this, our system of Government must go on because we are  building  Kenya for the future generations. The Nyayo children require this kind of solidarity, development and the excellent leadership that is provided by His Excellency the President. This is all we need.  The evil doers are looking for grounds toplant their seeds of discord  but I am glad that they will fair just like they have done. These people have always wanted to see this country divided.  Everybody is happy with the kind of leadership that the President has provided during the last 10 years. The President has led us wonderfully in the field of education,economic matters and social affairs. His leadership is not comparable anywhere in the Afican continent. We are lucky aidweshould continue thanking the President for providing us with this kind of leadership. During the State Opening of this House, the country wished him well and is continuing to do so because we require the excellent leadership which he has always provided. We need it because Kenya is a developing nation whose example is being copied everywhere. For example, Kenya was asked to help in keeping the peace during the preparation for Namibian Independence.  That is one area where I think our country has excelled due to the excellent leadership provided by President.The nation has a lot to learn from the President and the rest of the people in the world should follow his example. We have developed fast in the field of education, commercial activities and in international relations.  I know that the current Minister far Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation will follow the footsteps of the late Dr. Ouko and defend the countryin matters perpetrated by evil doers. Kenya has portrayed  an excellent  example  of leadership all over the continent. We should all stand firm and support this trind of leadership The evil doers had expected the Nyanza Province leaders to be driven away from the Head of State and the Government following the death of Dr. Ouko. Those evil doers should rest assured that the people of Nyanza are Nyayo people number one and that nothing can stop them from  following the leadership of the President. We would like to tell them that we stand firm behind the President and nothing will make us go beyond what  we stand for. What befell us eis like any other misfortune which come to any other nation inthe world. It should not be something which shouid makeus not to stand firm behind the President. With these few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF TIE PRESIDENT (Mr..Keen):  Bw.

MWENDWA:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for giving me this opportunity tojoin my hon. colleagues in supportingthis Motion, which expresses the gim gratitude of  this House to his Excellency the President for his exposition of public policy on 13th. March, 1990. Let me start by saying that this nation is, indeed, very fortunate in having most able, committed, caring, devoted and dedicated President in the personof hon. Daniel arap Moi.  whose wisdom, magnanimity and capacity for doing good is indeed, unsurpased and unknown elsewhere in Africa and many othet parts of the worlds. In his Address, he cited two recent achievements which occurred in Kenya.  He cited the invention of the wonderful drug, Kemron, which will go a long way to assist in the fight against the most deadly disease, Aids. He further cited the making of the first three Kenyan cars, which will again go a long way in assisting this country to transmort its people and goods from place to place.       ,     In doing so he informed this august House that for such achievements to be obtained by any country, there must be a state of peace and that this peace cannot be taken for granted. But that it should be strived for so that there can be development and advances.  He further said that advances would be meaningless unless they are directed towards raising the quality of life of the human. beings of that country. Of equal importance, therefore, was His Excellency's reminder to this nation that development does not take place in a turmoil situation. As we all knowithe ultimate objectives of all societies are remarkably similar. They all intend to bring the greatest good to the greatest number of people. However, diffe ences occur in the political and economicmeans which are used to get these objectives. Indeed because of their similarity, in natures there might not be much conflict. In the case of our beloved nation, the political and economic means used are adopted on:the foundation of the Nyayo philosophy of Peace, Love and Unity. It is for this reason that in his Address    His Excellency the President directed that the hon. Members of this House should and must be on .the forefront in consolidating unity. Hefurther pointed out that hollow accusations,  personality ciashed  and political Intrigues have no vlue to anybody and should be avoided like poison. In the circumstances, therefore, truth must always be upheld and must come first at all times before anything else. In such a situation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, rumour-mongering about anything becomes not only unnecessary and of very bad taste but also damaging. In the case for instanceof the cause of the   death of the late Dr. Ouko, rumourmongering becomes unnecessary and of bad taste becausethe matter is being investigated ably and the truth will be know soon. Let me therefore join those who have spoken before in condemning in the most strongest terms the rumourmongering that has been taking 3place which can have no other effect but to damage the reputation of this nation.  All of us should be totally loyal to His Excellency the President, the Government and the Party Kanu. Mr. Speaker, Sir, several hon. Members have voiced their concern about the outcome of the 1989 performance in the first Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education Examination. While agreeing that perhaps the results were not as good as might have been expected, I would like to suggest that we should not confuse ability withperformance. As this was the first time for the 8-4-4 system ofeducation to be evaluated, a certain degree of anxiety on all concerned was tobe expected. As we all knot anxiety affects performance adversely. The other factors that were mentioned in connection with this Issue were lack of preparation on the part of the students and the teachers.  But be as it may, a student who sat that examination remains as able as     the circumstances it is my view that the universities should make their selection for the vacancies that axa exist using the 1989performance results and not any pre-determined ratings, that       might mean that there will be vacancies in the Universities because  the performance was lower  I think we should appreciate the fact that ability is   tequitably distributed throughout the nation. If that be thecase performance becomes of secondary importance when selecting students into higher levels of education. If we assume and we know that that is the case out of the 1989 students who sat for this examination a great number of them are able people who are suitable to go on to the university and to work and succeed. I know that there will be differences from here to there in performance  because the examinations alwaysvary as far as the consistency is concerned. With these few words, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. TUVA:  Ahsante sana, Bw. Spika, kwa kunipatia nafasi hii iii nami pia niweze kuungana na wenzangu katika kumpongeza Mtukufu Rais kwa Hotuba yake ya busara aliyoitoa hapa tarehe 13.3.90 alipokuwa akilifungua Bunge hili. Ni mambo mengi ambayo Amefanya anastahili pongezi. Mambo hayo hayahusu nchi hiipekee bali hata nchi za mbali. Hivi juzi tuliona kilele cha yaleambayo yamefanywa na Mtukufu Rais wakati ndugu ultu wa rule Namibia malipopata Uhuru wao. Kwa kweli nchi hii imeshughulika xsana kuhakikisha kuwa amani imepatikana katika nchi hiyo hata mwisho tukahakikisha kuwa nchi hii.imopata Uhuru kutoka kwa makaburu wa.Afrika.Kusinikupitia uongozi wa Umoja wa Mataifa. Si hayo to bail hata wale wazalendo wa Afrika Kusini wamepata. Mtaada yazfadha na pia ialie tunaouitakwa Kingereza moral support kutoka kwa nchl kwa Mtukufu Rais. Kw mhi hivyo ni. isgajibu wetukumuunga Mkono Mtukufu RaIS katika kazi hiii ngumu ya kutoamsaada kwa hawa ndugu zetu wa Afrika KusiniKuna jambo moja ambalo limewatatiza Sana wazazI, wanafunzi na nchl nzima kwa jumia, nalo ni juu ya matokeo ya mfumo wa elimu wa 8-4-4. Kwa kweli matokeo ya mtihani wa kidato cha hayaridhishi hata kidogo kwa sababu ingawa wanafunzi walifanya mtihanihuugrana shahada huwa hawajui kama wamepita au wameuanguka mtihanikwani mara nyingi utawapata wakiuliza: “Je, hivi ni kuonyeshanilifaulu au sikufaulu?"" Kwa kuwa katika shahada hizi mwanafunzihuonyeshwa kuwa amepata ""C"" au ""DF"" huwa si rahisi kujua kamamwanafunzi amepita mtihani au hakupita. Kwa hivyo ingekuwa vizurikama Wizara ya Elimu ingeyarekebisha matokeo ya huu mtihani iii wanafunzi na Wakenya wote kwa jumla waweze kujua wale walioweza  kuufaulu huu mtihani. Kwa hivyo, nafikiri itabidi kkuwa ule mpango wamashindano baina ya shuie uliokuwako hapo zamani uanzishwetena kwa sababumatokeo ya mwaka jana hayaridhishf.hata kidogo. Bw.  Spika, ningependa vile vile Wizara ya Elimu itueleze ni shule gani zilizopata msaada wa maabara. Mwaka jana tuliona katika Vitabu vya Makisio kwamba,milionite zimetengwa kwa kusaidia kwa kuweka vifaa katika maabara, lakini kwa sasa watu kutokadiatika sehemu nyingi za Kenya  hakuna wanalia kwamba hakuna maabara ei shulerina zile shule zenye maabara hazina vifaa vya kutumiwa na wanafunzi. Kwa hivyo, ningependa tuelezwe vizuri pesa zile ambazo zinatengwa kila mwaka za maabara na vifaa zinaenda wapi. Jambo lingine ambalo linaletal,wasiwasi sana ni kwamba watawala katika Mkoawa Pwani Wanajaribu kusuluhisha tatizo la maskwota kwa kuwapatia ekari moja du mbili Hata wengine  hupatiwa ardhi ya fati 40x60 ili waweze kuiShi kulemjini. Jambo  litaleta matatizo siku za usoni, kwa sababu watu  kutoka ix kabila fulani wanapatiwa ardhl. kidogot sana, ambayo .Mtu hawezi kulima  na kup at a chakul a leingi cha kuli sha  jamli yaaketkwamuda wa miezitxmitatu ausita. Kwa  Hivup ningependa Serikali iwe na msimamo.  Huo msimamo ni lazima utoke kwa Serikali kuu hadi kwa wilaya zote, ili njia fwez ikutumiwa katika ktisuluhisha tatizo hilo.             Bw.  Spika, Wakuu wa Wilaya na machifu wametafuta njia zao  wenyewe za kupatia watu ardhi, lakini hizo njia haziridhishi hatakidogo. Kwa hivyor ningependa Serikali Kuu ijaribu kutafuta njia nzuri a itakayofuatwa kwa kuwaoatia maskwota mashamba iii kosa lolote likionekana, Serikali Njia ambazo hutumiwa na hawa maofisa wa utawala ni za kuridhisha. wale watu wenye mashamba lakini haziridhishi wale maskwota ambao wanastahili kusaidiwa. Katika kusaidiwa huko hao maskwota wanapata      taabu nyingi. Jambo hilo tamelizungumza mara nyingi. katikaBunge hili lakini Wizara inayohusika haijafanya Chochote. Kwa hivyo niomba Serikali ijaribu kutatua tatizo Ihilo. Bw kuna watoto wengi ambao wazazi waani wao ni    maskini, na kwa hivyahawawezif kwenda shule. Watoto wenginewalisoma kidogo lakiniwa1iAachak shule kwa sababu ya ukosefu wa karo, wengine hata, hawakwendallatadarasa la kwanza. Hivi majazi, MtukufuRais aliongozamchango uliofaulu sanat.kwa hivyo, ikiwezekana Serikali ichunguze: hao watoto walioacha,shule.kwa sababu ya ukosefu wa karo. Kuna watotoowalioacha shule wakiwa katika kidata cha pili au cha tatu kwertiartoo ningependawizara  ya Elimu ftoe amri kwa shule zote ili watoto      Kama hao wasipoteze nafasi zao, kwa sababu kipengkne hivi karibuni watapata masaada wa pesa ili waweze kuendelea na masomo.Bw. Spika, kulikuwa na watu wengi  katika civil Servants bench waliotoka katika serikali a wilaya, na kwaahivyo ningependa kuonha juu ya hili jambo la servicre charge. Kuna watu wengi ambao wanalina service charge ambao si. Lazima walipe. Kama huko mkoa wa pwani, utaona kwamba mwenye duyka analipa service charge, na hapo nje ya duka kuna washonaji wan g  wawili. frau watatu na kila mMoja analipa service charge, na hag wotexx wanatumia pipa moja la taka. Kwa.hivyoz ningependaWizara y a Serikali za Wilaya iyaangalie hayo mambo. ilkiendasokoni utamwona mama akiuza samaki, na yeye vile vile analipa service charge ya Kshs.60 kama vile Mbunge au mkuu wa wilaya anavyotozwa, lakini mapato ya mama huyu ni kidogo sana. Watu kama hawa wanajaribu kupata pesa kidogo iii waweze kuwasaidia watoto wao iti wapate elimu. Kwa wakati huu karo ya shule iko  juu sana. Hata mwanzo wa mwaka huu niliona we.irem  Wabunge kuleEmbu g wakilalamika kwamba karo za shule za upili ziko juu sana. Kwa hivyo ningependa kx hawa watu wanaofanya biashara ya reja reja na wale wanaoshona inje ya duka wasilipe service charge, kwasababu mapato yao ni kidogo sana. Wakati tulipopitisha Mswada huo wa service charge hatukutazamia kwamba mambo kama haya yatatokea, laki ni kwa vile matatizo kama hayb yametokealningeoenda Wizara ya Serikali za Wilaya ijaribu kuyatatua.  Bw.  Spika, kuna mambo mengi yanayosemwa katika nchi hii. Pia kuna mambo mengi ambayo tunayasema, na mambo mengi tunayotamka yanaleta taabu. Sisi tunawalaumu watu wengine kwamba wao ndiowalianzisha uvumi,  lakini wakati mwingine sisi viongozindio tunaanzisha huo uvumi.

Anajaribu kuwaonyeshanjia, lakini inaonekana kwamba kuna wananchi wengine katika taifa hiliambao hawana imani na Mtukufu Rais; ambao hawaonyeshi mapenzi kwake,  lakini yeye anajaribu awezavyo kuwapatanisha na kuwarudisha katika barabara ya Nyayo.

I just want to take a few minutes because I have to say some of the things that have been said here, but in a different manner. I want to strongly suppori the Motion before the House because I am healthy. I am healthy because of what I have done, what I have gone through the system of the Government we are in. I became an AssistantMinister during the rule of the late Mzee Jomo.Kenyatta. I supported the Government to the hilt and I got the fruits of my loyalty to the Government of the time. When the late Mzee Jomo KenYatta left the nation, there came the  present President. I did not find any problem in supporting the present President, either as the Vice-President. or as the President himself, and I have not found any difficulty The people I represent have no difficulty in supporting policies of the Government of our beloved President. Today, weare what we are individually. because we are in this Government and the Party which forms the Government.  Therefore, I, personally, will find it difficult to deviate from the present Government and its policies. Even if, through my own mistakes and other commitments, I am fired from the Government, I should continue supporting the policies of the Government because itis those policies, the Government and the system, that make me enjoy what I am enjoying today, and I shall continue doing so with my family and friends. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I get very worried because we have been talking about rumour-mongering and people being questioned by the police. But there is one thing we have lost sight of. ".	Who are these people being associated with rumour-mongering? 	 Who are they?  We read of the names, but do we really mow them? That is the question. Do we know these People individually? I ask a question: why did the Kenya Direct Commission collapse We want Raw to be realistic and practical. Why did K.M.C. collapse? Who was running it?  How much money was involved and lost in th. Collapse of K.M.C.?  Also, take Uplands Bacon Factory, for instance.  Who were charged with the responsibilities of management of these institutions? What action has been taken agains  those responsible for mismanagement and misapprobriationit of those funds?Some of these people have held position of Inspector Senioror Chief Inspector of Police, Assistant Commissioner over and even Deputy to the commissioner of police, and others have held position Administrative  Secretary under Secretary Deputy Secretary, Permanent Secretary and Minister. They have hekd such light offices throught the Government of our beloved president. Other have been released from detention by the same system led by outr president.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think time has come when we have to istic and tackle the issues as they should. We have also have to accept on thing. That nobody is indispensable. Nodody! I say so because during Hayati Mzee Jomo kenyatta’s day I did not see anybody saying, Now, I am going. Call the police and the newsmen plus wananchi to come and witness my being arresteed’. That is belittling our president like the former Minister did. It was very disturbing to me.	The kind of arrogance these people are displaying, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is terrible. I only hope that the rest of Kenyans do not attribute this to because the majority of these people happen to be kikuyas. I would like these people to be treated as individuals and action be taken against them as. You go to a police station as a normal exercise. Then when you are released, you are arrogant enough as if you have hot been asked anything. You call the Press and tell them	asked this and that". What is that?	Is that not belittling our system? 	If these people are working for the downfall of the Government, at least,let them tel  the nation who they have as their second President. 	Let them say that. But, unfortunately, our system and our,Constitution do not allow that.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want this House to record that whatever has  been said about them is true.	They did exactly that.  For instance, they said that the Vice-President and Minister for Finance was dead and yet they are now denying it.	One of them was the former Member of Parliament for Makwu, Mr. Gachago.	He was picked up and questioned by the police.  He denied that he had said to one of my officers "Your  Vinister, Magugu, is dead". 	When he was asked about that he denieW, However, the officer insibts that, he said it and the officer ds even reaay to be questioned even in a court of law on this matter. I	am the one who reported this matter to the police.In the same group, somebody connected with him and a friend from Githunguri were picked up by police . This person was fined. I fact, he was almost sentenced to a few months imprisonment because of the same offence.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a very, very deliberate plan by these people wiLth, money which is being spread all over the cotntry. This is money which is illegally obtained. This is money which is obtained through dubious means to destablise the Government. That is for gare. If we are asked to prove that, we are ready to do so. However, the magnanimity of our President is being taken as a weakness.  His Excellency the President says that he is conscious or mindful of the welfare, particularly of  the children of Kenya.   However,  these people do not for their children. Apparently,  they are ready to go to detention because they assume and they truly believe that the President will   . take care of their children.    Mr.  Speaker, Sir, I think without going very much into this matter,  it is not enough for these people just to be picked up byPolice. They  deny their actions and are  set free. We have seendetentions and some of the people tlho have been detained in thePast have not committed as serious crimes as the people.Mr. Speaker, I beg to suport the Motion before the House</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR MAKHANU: Thank you very much,: Mr. Speaker, sir, for   giving me  this opoortunity to join my colleagues in expressing our thanks to  His Excellency the President for the  expoition of"public Policy contained in his Presidential Address from the Chair on l3th of this	month. Mr. Speaker,  Sir, In doing so,  we kenyans must realize that we are very lucky and fortunate to have a leader of the kind of the  President.  He constantly 24 hours a day thinks about our welfare; thinks about nhow the country is going to move; thinks about the children, thinks about the disabled and about everything that is good that should come our way. His Excellency the President shows by example that he fears God and that we should all emulate him.Having said that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me add that, it is disheartening sometimes to note ourPresident stands alone without support particularly from some of us in leadership positions.  The ordinary mwananchi has no problems, unless he is led into those problems, or is involved in such problems.  However, most of those who lead the mwananchi into such problems are the leaders, particularly those who have benefitted from this system in acquiring,wealth and, consequently, misdirecting that wealth.  I would like to echo the sentiments of those who have spoken before me, that the time has come that those people with ill intentions, using the wealth they have acquired in this country, should be brought to book; they should be asked to account for their activities. It does not suffice to talk about them in circular forms; let usgo down to the points, identify them andplace them where they belong. If we alow the situation to continue, we do not know what future we will be preparing for our children. It is sad and disheartening to  note thatwhen it.comesytothe issue of collective responsibility among ourCabinet Ministers, there is a lot to be desired. This is because such Ministershave to carry their names, weight and responsibilities.  However, when national issues occasionally come up, you find the Cabinet divided and that is most unfortunate. Going by the speeches thatwere made by some Members of the Cabinet. In this House last week, there was no consonance among them in respect of the national tragedywe had, on the demise of the late Dr. Ouko. This is not good for our nation. If Members of the Cabinet would like to expose themselves, they have a forum to do so outside this House. However, they should appear,before the eyes of the public and other Parliamentarians, to be united. Iwas perplexed only last Wednesday when, in the Members Room, while in  the company of some Ministers, other hon, Members and even members of staff of National Assembly, one Assistant Minister from the Rift Valley Province. literally lectured another Assistance Minister from Nyanza Province.  The Assistant Minister from the Rift Valley Province was accusing his counterpart from Nyanza Province of incompetence in his position, his weaknesses and in an ""Uncle Sam"" pose telling the other that he should besacked. We would not like to be treatedin that manner. (applause) We do not want to be entertained to such kind of exchange from senior Ministers and Assistant Ministers. I appeal that the Front Bench should live up to omits expectations. They should uphold the honour bestowed upon them by His, Excellency the President. When such a situation arises, it is only fair for those who cannot live up to expectations to resign and give His Excellency the President the opportunity to select another Cabinet. However, we may not do so at the moment. I would only wish to see a situation where we do not act as if there are cracks and deviations in the hierarchy of the Cabinet.  Each one of us hashis constituency		 and what one Says, as a Cabinet Minister, carries weight in this country. He should always speak in support of the, president and the Government; expounding the government sposition on national issues. If such Ministers are seen to be divergent, then we are heading for a collision.  We would like that to stopand we open  a new chapter in line with what His Excellency the President told us on 13thof this month.  He advised us to avoid idle talk. Idle talk does not confine itself to members of the public, or Back benchers; it is also within the Cabinet. On the other issue of rumourmongering, I think that is an aspect that is here to stay with us. 	It is acceptable that it will stay with us. However, we must condemn it whenever it appears.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.	Is it in orderfor an hon. Member to tell us that rumourmongering is in order and acceptableand so should continue?</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER:	He said the continuation is an accepted fact.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU:	Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did not say it is going to continue,but rumour-mongering has  been there since time  immemorial and we shall  leave it continuing even when we die,  unless we want to deceive. ourselves otherwise.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT MINISTER ,  OFFICE  OF THE  VICE-PRESIDENT AND  MINISTRY OF  FINANCE  (Mr.  Kariuki):  On a point  of order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  The  hon. Member.,  in fact,  said  that rumour-mongering is not only here to stay but is acceptable.  I  only  wanted  to  know whether  it  is  in order to  claim that rumour-mongering  is  acceptable  in Kenya.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  CHEPKOK: On a point  of  information,  Mr.. Speaker,  Sir.  I thinkthe  hon.  Member  is  right. Last  week a Cabinet Minister brought  in an  elementthat was  not  included  in the President's  Address. That was  hon.  Waruru KanjaHe  stated that we did not attain our  Independence  to kill each other. J.M Kariukiwas  killed  and there were rumours,  too..  In. fact,. I think hon.. Kanja should come to  this House and explain why he brought up the  issue of J.M. Kariuki's death in this  House. Was that not tantamount to rumour-mongering?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I was saying rumour-mongering as a fact, exists. That is the fact , I am saying must be accepted. Now, how do we fight rumour-mongering?  I must be grateful to the government for the action it has taken to contain rumour-mongering. The other easier option is to establish, maintain and manage an information system that  does not allow rumour-mongering to flourish on a major national issue, be it a calamity, political or economic situations. Let us have acceptable information to the people, of course, not going beyond the limits of revealing classified matters. The information should be sufficient for people to know what is happening. Rumour-mongering flourishes where there is no available information and nobody knows what is happening.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT' AND EMPLOYMENT 	(Mr. Ngei):  Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to say a few words on this Motion.  I want to inform the Ministers here, Assistant Ministers and hon. Members of Parliament that they are all welcome to Kangundo Constituency at any given time. In my contribution to this Motion, I will speak briefly on such things as electrification and bituminisation of roads in Kangundo Constituency. I will also touch on Chiefs In that area.  We have three Independent chiefs in Kangundo Constituency.   If  I may be allowed, I would first like to mention the chief of Matungulu Location, Mr. Savano Maveke.  Secondly, I will touch on the chief of Kakuyuni Location and that of Donyo Sabuk.  These are chiefs employed by the Government and they were very good before. But now, the trend is very bad; especially with Chief' Savano Maveke, who is about 71 years.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: Shame! Shame!</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT (Mr. Ngei) : Yes. He is 71 years old and I do not know how he moves around. However, I am told that he has some people in the office of president who are defending him. There is also the chief of kakuyuni Location who, at one time, I told a deputy commissioner or police to listen to his utterances. A report was made and I was told that the chief was going to be sacked, but he is still the chief of Kakuyuni Location. I remember one time I was coming from the funeral of the late RVT. Watuma, and about 300 people gathered around me.  The chief came and told the gathering "Kwendeni, kwendeni".  The chief, accompanied by an Administration  Police sergent, declared that I was holding a meeting. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the chief of Donyo Sabuk Location is another bad fellow.  He is called David Munyae.  For instance, he and some other people want to buy a piece of land, evicting people who have lived there for over 30 years. The land belonged to a European settler who left the country some time back. The piece of land is now vacant and </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  A.I.  MOHAMED:   On a point of order,  Mr.. Speaker,  Sir. Is  the hon. Minister,  who  is fully aware of Government machinery,  to discuss the Character of chiefs  in  this House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT (Mr.  Ngei): Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  I have-been in this House-for26 years and four months. and I should know what to say.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

MEMBERS: The Minister is replying to a point of order!</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT (Mr.  Ngei): Mr. Speaker,	was  saying that I  have-been  in this House for the last 26 years and four months. In fact,  I have only  three years and eight months to complete thirty years In this Parliament. Therefore,  I should know what to Say and what not to say. I can, of Course, be Corrected  by Mr.  Speaker from time to time.  I can say anything.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. NDZAI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Minister in order to say that he has been here for 26 years and four months and, therefore, nobody should raise a point of order when he makes a mistake? Are we not allowed to raise points of order to complain just because somebody has been here for twenty-six years and four months?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT (Mr. Ngei): Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to go ahead. These chiefs collect money</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  CHEPKOK:-   On a point of order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir..   It. is a shame for a Cabinet Minister like hon.  Paul Ngei  to tarnish the name of-civil servants in this House when he knows the procedure to follow if he has any complaints to make.	Shame!</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT	(Mr.  Ngei): Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  I  would like  to continue and say that these chiefs collect money without issuing receipts. Therefore</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  A.I.  MOHAMED: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is theMinister in order to tell us the number of years he has been in this House?   Doesit matter,  anyway?   After all,  it is just a matter of how old one can be.	Thatis life and not important-to.us.	Is he in order to be proud of the period hehas been in Parliament?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT  (Mr. Ngel): I am very proud of it. As I was saying, these Chiefs collect money from mananchi without issuing them with receipts, and that is the truth. They Collect money from the people by force, and I Would like to</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR.  MISOI: 	On a point of order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir. 	I may be corrected. if what-the Minister is telling the House-is not what was raisid in another forum. If it was, is he in order to discuss it here? I thought what the Minister is telling the House was raised during the recent Kanu Parliamentary Group meeting, and I thought that the matters was dealt with there. Is he in order to discuss the same matter</Newspeech>here?  <Newspeech>	THE MINISTER FOR MANPOWER.DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT (Mr. Ngei) : Mr.speaker, sir, if the hon. Member knew the kind of chief I am talking about, he would agree with me. I would like to ask  the office of the president to go into the question of the character of these three chiefs.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. KIRWA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think the Minister has other avenues through which he can channel his information. When he tells the House about these Chiefs, he implies that the Minister himseIf is helpless and that the Government machinery is helpless in dealing with those officers. Is it in order for the Minister to tell the House the Character of these chiefs instead of communicating to the Office Of the President through other channels?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT (Mr.  Ngei): Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  I would now like to touch on the question of supply of electricity in Kangundo Constituency and bituminisation of roads in the area and in Machakos District in general. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER,  OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr.. Kamuren): On a point Of Order,  Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Minister has alleged,  quite categorically, that there is a certain Chief who has connections in the Office of the President. Can he make Clear that allegation and Say who that chief is?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT (Mr. Ngei): Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it is the chief who says that he is connected with the Office of the President and not myself. So, Sir</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Kamuren): On a point of order,  Mr. Speaker, Sir. One hon. Member said here that since hon. Ngei is a Cabinet Minister, he	has the machinery to sort out those matters with the relevant office.   Now, is the Minister in order to take the chief's allegations as true?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE.MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT	(Mr.  Ngei.):Mr..  Speaker,  Sir,  I have written to Mr. Nabwera about that. So,  if you are thinking that I am just talking any howly,  it is unfortunate.  I beg to support.Thank you,. Sir,. for affording me the opportunity to contribute to the Motion on the Presidential Address of I3th March, 1990.  I will start by quoting a section of the speech which reads as follows:“There is no room is present day Kenya for personality clashes and hollow accusations. Political intrigue is of no benefit to anyone.”Today, Kenya is at a very advanced stage of development. I think it would be unfair and unreasonable to compare the Kenya of today with the developing countries. We have developed, gone a long way and have enjoyed a peaceful political climate under the wise leadership of his excellency the president.During our recent visit to Namibia, we saw wonders because the Kenyan flag was flying very high and any Kenyan who was there must have felt very proud of this country. It is by that same taken that all Kenyans of all walks of life should come out to defend the peaceful political climate that is prevailing in this country. We need that peace and stability so that the mwananchi can have time to go about working for his livehood under peaceful conditions. (Mr.  Speaker left the  Chair) (The Temporary Deputy Speaker(Mr.  Tuva)  took the Chair) Therefore, Sir,  every Kenyan should stand firm and defend Government policies so that we can uphold the respect that we are accorded by other African and overseas countries. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, sir,  in Kenya we  sometimes we see a Situation called political wrestling where some people triumph when one is floored..	What we need in Kenya are minds which look ahead with regard to where Kenya would be tomorrow:	We have quite a sizeable number of unemployed youth. Instead of having political wrestling,  I wish politicians in this country,  civil servants and others could sit down and work out programmes that will accord employment to the young people.   That will make life better for future Kenyans.   We should not only think about what we are today and what we want to be tomorrow... That. is not what we need today; we need to keep	Kenya on a sound developmental footing. We should look into the needs of the upcoming Kenyans, Sixty per cent of the Kenyan population is composed of the youth, and we should think about what that population would be tomorrow. That should be the major occupation of the political wrestlers who are in this House.After the death of Dr. Ouko there was a lot of rumour-mongering in the country and we should ensure  that we do not give it a place in Kenya. As one hon. Member said, we need an effective information system which will not leave room for rumour-mongering. There is a saying which “Where there is smoke, there is fire.” For example, the wananchi are now rumour-mongering that they have to bribe to have services rendered to them. This comes up as a rumour but if you go in death, you will find that it is true. This is corruption and although it is coming along as a rumour, it is giving very important information to the government. People are now complaining through rumour-mongering, and we cannot dismiss rumours lightly as they are an indicator to something. When rumours start circulating about something,  sooner or later you start seeing the truth. Therefore,  an elaborate information system will, no doubt, stamp out rumour-mongering. As the Presidential Address elaborately spelt, we should think of the problems that beset our people in the employment sector, Particularly under the factories inspectorate and pension schemes for the workers. I am sure we shall not forget to look into the employment problem that is facing Kenyans. Sir, we have one employment Sector in Kenya where the workers have not yet attained Independence. Kenyans who work for Asians at home and also in the formal working places face very unfair Labour practices. After the Asian has wronged. a Kenyan, he knows how to dodge easily and beat the law. 	These are the areas which, I am sure, 	we for look into when revising the Factories Act; and the Workmen Compensation Act in this House. In this way, we shall ensure that all Kenyans working in all sectors are protected.  We should also think about what should be done about such practices. Recently I witnessed a case where a worker in a Asian shop had been alleged to have connived with shoplifters. His employer locked him in the shop and best him up. Surely there is the rule of law in this country and this workers should have been taken to court. It is the high time we politicians talked Loudly about such matters. These are unfair labour practices which should not be allowed to continue in this Independent country. We have been Independent for the last 26 years and yet many Kenyan workers employed by Asians have still not tested the fruits of Independence. Their salaries are very low. For example, If you are working for an asian in his home and dare look smartly dressed and clean. You will only have yourself to blame because you will be sacked. This is because you are not supposed to look very clean; you are supposed to look like a begger.These are not legal labour practices and we should find a way of finding a solution.   We in this louse should ask ourselves what we can do collectively to pass laws which will protect those people. I will now comment on minimum wages. 	The  cost of living has gone up and the ordinary worker is earning, so little that he cannot afford to make his family live comfortably.   School fees have also gone up considerably and the reality of the matter is that children from poor families can hardly afford. secondary school education.	The effect is that we are going to educate children of the rich whereas those from poor families will continue tobe labours of this country. We need to examine this area. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, at this stage I must thank his Excellency the  President for introducing the  Presidential Bursary Fund,  for which we raised a lot of money. My 	worry is with regard to  the  administration of this  Fund: I feel that we still have to find a realistic way of administering this Fund and ensuring that the money goes to the	children who really need  it.	I want to give the example of  Stare he Boys Centre which, originally, was meant to be for orphaned Children in this country, but which today is for the  children-:of the  big people:.   This money should really reach those children who need it. We can have the Fund administered by a central. body,  where the  administering body simply acts on names forwarded by the districts or divisions. I	know that  less advantaged divisions collect less money for this fund than more advantaged divisions. This means that the disadvantaged divisions will receive less from this fund than the advantaged divisions. However, this will be against the purpose of this fund, which is to uplift those who are not able to meet educational expenses. So, if we simply give divisions what they have collected, then we will not be solving the problem but making it worse. If therefore, hope that the ministry of education, the office of the president and whoever is involved will ensure that this money will benefit the group which deserves to be assisted. With those  few remarks, I support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  A.I. MOHAMED: Thank you,  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir, for giving me  this chance to support  this Motion. We are a very lucky country to have a President like hon. Daniel  crap Moil  who  always thinks about the welfare  of his people; who  does not rest in order to make sure that everybody in this country is comfortable president Moi’s concern even goes beyond our Kenya in that he has been striving to help countries like Uganda, Ethiopia and Namibia solve  their problems: Our President is always  traveling outside  this country to  see  that  peace  prevails in this continent and it is  our duty,  as leaders,  to  give him a hand. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  our President has travelled to  all corners  of this  country to  see for himself the problems facing. his  people:   He has identified the  problems facing the  disabled and what he has  done to  solve  those  problems is  on record: He has also  assisted old people  Whose shambas were  grabbed by rich People to  get back those  shambas:   He has also seen the  plight of many bright children  from poor families who have been missing education due to their family background, and introduced the 	presidential Bursary Fund for which a very successful fundraising Was held recently. I think our president has rare qualities of leadership.It is the duty of all us in this august House to help the president in all his endeavours. Our cabinet ministers should double their efforts in assisting the president; they should travel  from district to district to efforts in assisting the president; they should travel from district like our president. They should not see themselves as representing their own constituencies because they have to know what their ministries do in all parts of this country. This means that they have a bigger responsibility than an ordinary member of parliament. We do not expect our ministers to direct affairs from their beautiful office where they were placed in order to be the eyes of the president and our government. This is why we appeal to them to travel to all parts of this country so that they can exactly identify the particular problems facing particular districts in this country.:   This will help in the equitable distribution of resources to various  districts.Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  our President has profound faith. in the basic goodness of man and democracy in this  country. It is, therefore, a high time	we  leaders  stood firm against misguided tycoon and self-styled leaders who are out to create trouble in this country. It is unfortunate for them because the  ordinary wananchi, right from the two year olds,  know exactly the type of President we have in this country. If you go to wherever  ordinary wananchi are,  they are always talking about the wonderful leadership of our President. Who do these  few misguided elements want to lead. They are people who are  driven by satanic ambitions. They need to be corrected by all leaders and right thinking citizen of this country. I think we leaders have a collective responsibility to safeguard the well-being of this country and its people, especially the young generation, at all costs by employing the Nyayo Philosophy. I would like to touch on the Arid and semi- arid lands(ASAL) programme which was introduced recently. This programme is not benefiting the most deserving districts; instead, it is benefiting non-ASAL districts. I am appealing to the Ministry concerned to be  fair and direct this programme to the ASAL districts. All those empowered by the laws of this country to execute national affairs should be fair and nationalistic in their work in order to help our beloved president make Kenya the  Kenya we  want  to  live  in. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  the remuneration of workers in this  country,  both in the Civil Service  and the private sector needs to be reviewed, to taking into account the regular Price increseas of essential commodities in this country. Sub-ordinate staff in Government service in Nairobi are paid house allowance of shs. 240/-. Can we really have a house, especially in Nairobi, for that rent? We must look into the welfare of our workers.Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,	Sir, there  are  some Ministries  which  do  not  seem to  be represented in the districts the Ministry of Labour does not have any officers deployed some districts to offer services to the people. In fact, the officers of this  Ministry  cannot be found in districts like marsabit, Isiolo, Mandera, Wajir and many other district in the North-Eastern province. I would like to appeal to the minister concerned to deploy his officers to these districts so that can also benefit from their services. Of course, this is not only ministry whose officers are not stationed there are many other ministries which ought to send their officers there too.The other point concern the national social security fund. This Fund should be decentralized at district levels to alleviate the current congestion at their headquarters. This is because workers get a lot of problem after retirement because they have to keep on playing between their homes and the headquarters to try to get their benefits. So this problem could be overcome by decentralizing the Fund and having workers can easily collect them.   There  was  a  Motion  that was  passed  in this  House  sometime back  to  raise  the  allowances  of councilors, but, up to-date, it  has not been implemented.	The allowances  that these  councillors  are presently  getting are  too  little.	So, I would like to  appeal to the  Ministry  concerned to  ensure  that  this Motion is  implemented to help ease the suffering of these councillors.With those  few  remarks,   I support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT(Mr. Kamuren) : 	Ahsante  sana,  Bw.

The Address was fundamental factual,	far reaching, firm and had a	certain level of  flexibility because, the president loves  his nation. The	Address wasbased  on  the  tenets  of  the  three  vanguards 	of  His  Excellency to  the  Presidents  call to  the nation.

The state of	 being one for a single goal. That Address dwelt on tunity of ones. The state of being one for a single goal. It also dwelt on love, the regard for benevolence and the regard of being mindfull of other people. Those can only be words of wisdom from a great leader. Those can only be fore warnings from a leader who has been a member of parliament surpassing any single individual in this House, in as far as the record of parliamentary activity is concerned, His Excellency the president has been in this parliament longer than any single person here.Sir, from his Presidential Address, it was quite  clear  that some individuals  wanted to  take  the  opportunity of  the tragedy of our late  colleague  hon.   Dr. Ouko  to  cause  chaos. Hon. Dr. Ouko  was  a  born diplomat, he loved  his  President  and his  nation. It	is a pity almost bordering on immorality for anybody to  suggest that  this  Government which  stands  for peace,  love and unity, can be  associated with  an  act  of  that  nature.	I think  those  kind of  individuals  are  being used by their masters  to  arm twist this country.  We  can no  longer  withstand  such  individuals  who  have been bought  by  foreigners.Sir,   I  would  like  to  touch  on  a  very  simple  word, rumour.	Rumour by  definition  is  heresy, flying words.	I would  like  to  say  that  there  is  no  time  that  this  country will by  associated  with  rumour.	Rumour  is  destructive, it  brings jealousy,   land It also brings  about  violence.	Rumour is  something that  we  must  do  away with  as  a  nation  and  as  individuals. I  think people  have  taken  that opportunity to  dwell  on rumour  with  the  sole  purpose  of  forcing this  country  into difficulties. Sir,  there  are  individuals in  this  country, and I dare say  the  minority who have  adopted  a  deleterious and clandestine attitude  which  is not  conducive to harmony.	These individuals have  adopted  a state of  approach  which is not conducive to  tranquility in this nation. They  have adopted a state of being violent in the sense the by spreading rumours, they hope to cause despondency  and despair so that this Country can go into confusion. Those are just a few Kenyans, and we all must stand counted, because we cannot allow 24million Kenyans to by confused and rendered helpless just because there are some rich tycoons to distabilise this nation. Sir,   in pursuit of  this  noble  objective  of  peace, 	love and unity, it a few individuals  cannot  hold  this  country  to ransom.	Nobody  can hold  this  country to ransom. If  you  are a cabinet minister, you must stand counted, and I challenge those who are deviating from common responsibility to stand counted. We cannot pay lip service to his Excellency  the President. Time  has  come  when  this  country must prosper, and  pre-occupy itself  with  the-on-going world  events;, for  instance technology. We have the youth  who  are  unemployed and they must  also  learn  and be  given proper guidance. So that they can be able to lead this country in future.Therefore,  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, individuals who have  outlived their usefulness should politely step aside and go home. Leaders who have  outlived their usefulness If they are hitching because  of what they have in their pockets  should retire with their money. This is because that money,  instead of being used  for developmental activities, is being used to entice the  unemployed 	and to tell them rumours that there is something fishy about  the  Government: Of course there is nothing fishy about the  Government. This Government is clean;  it is forthright;  it  is  clear and its policies are clear. These policies were  properly  enunciated by His  Excellency the President  on13.3.90 in this august House. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I want  to say that we in Nyanza Province,  and the majority of Kenyans; reject in toto these misguided Individuals. We reject in toto the ideas they are trying to plant among Kenyans. We reject in toto their clandestine attitude;  we reject in	toto their designs to destabilise this nation. We shall stand to be  counted like human beings  of this land. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker; Sir'," events in Eastern Europe I think we 	should sound  a warning here that the arms that will now be liberated  or made available may be used against  Africa in the name  of democracy. They may be used to 	stir clanism tribalism, sectionnalism and so on. This is what is being thrown to us  as  a bait "you must  accept multi-party systems because they work." Who told  you that? The  person who tastes  knows  the  sweetness  of the item he has tasted. For us in Kenya we have  tasted the  one-party system:   We  feel very strongly that the  one-party democracy is able to put us together as a nation.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the one-party system is able to propel us forward;  one party system has. now focused our attention on education, industry, arid and semi-arid areas, in collective responsibility and above of it has given us	future. Why, therefore, should we discard it?  Do you want to dance to the designs of certain individuals? Do you want to dance to the winds of these individuals? I think we Kenyans are lucky to have a President who sees in the future. He has seen it very well.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the critics of the 8-4-4 system of education are misguided. This nation has to have a culture in technology. This nation has to have a culture in entrepreneurships. The subjects being taught in the  8-4-4 system  of education are geared towards creating the easiness of culture so that agriculture becomes a hobby; carpentry becomes a hobby, masonry becomes a hobby so that our children can have a future to look forward to.With those few remarks   I support the Motion?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my colleagues in contributing to the Presidential Address which was delivered on 13.3.90.  A lot has been said and a lot can still be said. But it is very difficult for us to find the words to express our thanks to His Excellency the President for the way he has continued to guide and govern this country:   I think Kenyans should count themselves lucky to have the kind of leader we have in our President. In the 1960s there was a very famous football	player in England. They used to praise him not for being the best player but also for being where he should be at the right time.  He did so in a  	totally different way from what others were used to doing.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that  our President  appears to come to the aid of the needy in Kenya. at the right time   His timing is  so precise that you wonder how he  goes about  it Let me  also  give  special attention to  His Excellency the President’s initiative in the research which led to the design and development of the Nyayo  Car? This is a great breakthrough for Kenya. It can now be  said that Kenya is about to take off, if it has not  already taken off, technologically.  I think this is something that very many countries in the Third World have not attained?   We have attained this development through the  initiatives  of His Excellency the President.Just the  other day we had that  great Harambee at uhuru Park where KShs. 151 million was raised?   There are no words to describe  the motive and the  spirit behind that Harambee. While these  great things  are happening in Kenya we  also have the rumour mongers doing the rounds. They have  captalised on the tragedy which befell this  country recently:   We all loved the late Dr. Robert ouko. He was  a born leader and a great man in his  own right. But when we were mourning all sorts  of rumours were spreading all over the place. People behind these rumours do not like Kenya.   Although these are Kenyans, and I hope they are, they can be termed as  enemies  of this country. Everything should be done to identify these people. They should be dealt with in accordance with the law. We have  enemies in this country:   These enemies are placed in very key positions  in the  Government. They have  causeda lot  of economic  setbacks  in this country?   They are corrupt:   You will find that year in year out; it has been pointed out that some people  in key positions in Government have embezzled and misappropriated Government funds. These people are real enemies of this country. 	I am afraid that this 	cancer of corruption is  spreading. It is a very dangerous cancer. Therefore my suggestion would  be that these people should be dealt with ruthlessly: If this kind of thing is  allowed to continue, I do not know what will happen to this country in future. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch on the question of workers in this country. We as Members of Parliament are workers, but  there are  those who  continue to toil very hard for the  economy of this country. There are those who are working in the  farms and shambas  in the rural areas. There are others who work in factories owned by Asians.  We all know that the cost oI living. has risen dramatically,  but these people continue  to be  paid very  lowly. I  think  time  has  come  when  this  august house  should sit down and review the  terms and condition of service of the  lowly-paid people. Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  there  is  also  the  problem of some  work which  can  be  done  by  Kenyans  being  done  by  foreigners. I  have met a tailor here in this city who does not know Kiswahili. Surely,  we  have  many  indigenous  tailors  in this  country and so we  do not need such people. I  have  also met a builder who does  not know  Kiswahili and whose English  is  poor. This. person was  brought  to this  country to  do that kind of work. I  understand that the Corporate  Insurance Company  Limited has imported  somebody, to do a job which can be done  by  a  Kenyan. This is  an area of concern and so, the relevant Ministries should do everything possible to safeguard our workers interests. Turning to my constituency, I would like to motion. here that it is difficult for me  to go  home  because  of the  condition  of the roads I have said this  time and again,  but  it has now reached a stage where, we have to tell the Minister  for  Public  Works about it. I am glad he did come to my constituency the other day,  though I had not been told to meet him, but he saw  for himself how terrible to roads are. It is only the other day that the district officer in my constituency spent the night somewhere  in the bush,  although he had a  Land Rover. This  district officer was  taking a pregnant woman to maternity. Since  the  district officer could not help the woman,  they spent the night there. She,  therefore, gave  birth,  but,  unfortunately,  the child died. So,  you can imagine  the kind of things  that are happening there  because of the  bad condition of roads. people  are even afraid of going  home. I  am,  therefore, appealing to  the Minister  for  Public  Works to rescue us, Otherwise development will  come  to  a standstill.There  is  the  bridge, which was  constructed on the road leading to Kibwezi. 	The  construction of the bridge  is  over it is only the embankments on both sides  that have not been done.  People  cannot enjoy the fruits of   the work of the Government. If this  bridge  is opened, it would open a large area.There  is  also the problem of the classification of roads. We are told that  the  Ministry of Public Works cannot work on roads  which are not classified. There are many areas  in my constituency with roads which are not classified. I am, therefore, asking the relevant authorities  to do the needful as  soon as possible.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT TENISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. M’Maitsi): Thank you, :Temporary Deputy speaker, Sir, for giving me  First  of all,  I would like  to  express my thanks and congratulations  to His Excellency the President  for the PresidentialAddress  on 13th of this month. His  Excellency the Presidenttouched  on very many issues.  For instance,  he  touched on unity, love,  industrialisation and even on the law pertaining to workers, factories  and many  other issues.: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,  with regards to unity and freedom, what we  are enjoying in Kenya today,  I would like to  state  here  ""I am born free"" and  I am happy. Those  of us who  are born free  happen to be  the majority in this nation,  and the  freedom we  have  seen since Independence  is what we would like to see continuing His  Excellency the president has worked so hard to make sure that this freedom, happiness  and unity continues, but there  are  some few elements  that have stood up in various places recently to try and discredit the efforts  of His Excellency the President. This is a very pathetic situation and I am even sad to note that there  are  some elements Who are  even seeking the opportunity to do bad things.  For instance.  When we lost our colleague, hon. Dr. Ouko, some of these elements tied to mar what His Excellency the President is trying to promote. In this country. This is trying to undermine all the work that the president, and the Kenyans, for handling the situation very well. They were calm and cool. However,  I do  not understand why we  should allow such things  to happen.  If somebody can lose the ""human being""  in him to use  the  death of a colleague  and to  stand before  this  House  and mention issues  that  do not concern this House, I  think such a person has lost  direction. This  House  should not accept  such things to happen.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the unity that we have seen in this world has continued and shall continue as far as those who are born free are concerned. However, we have come to know that there are a few elements who happen to have had their  ""nice"" time. They also happen to  have made enough money and this money seems to  be  disturbing them. I think we should request these elements  to  give us this money so, that we  can pump  it  in some  of our development projects. That way we  can create  job  opportunities for those who do not have  jobs.  I think the  love,  the  forgivenessand the  help that  His  Excellency the President has given to this country is being thrown out of the  window by a few people who are being step way. I do .not understand why we  are  giving them way.We  should not allow this to happen. We have  spoken repeatedly on this matter and I believe  it is  time now we should take action. Standing here, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to  assure this House, the Government and the people  of Kenya in general, that we in Western Province  are  standing firm behind. His Excellency the President. As the kanu Organising Secretary in kakmega, I would like to inform the whole of kenya that we shall not allow anyone who comes with anti-Nyayo activities to try and settle in western kenya. I am giving this warning, and I hope that they will adhere to it because if you come to western Kenya and you have such ideas in your mind,  I am sorry.  I do not know what will happen to you and we  shall not be  responsible  for anything. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,   the  President  has done a lot  for the  youth,  and I thank him very much for it. I noticethat  every time  he  makes  a statement,  he mentions  the  future  of this  country. However, the  future  of this nation is  the youth. The  future  of  this  nation is  the youth,  and the President is trying to safeguard the youth. Those  of  us  in  the present Kenya and  are happy with whatever they have had before  them should allow those  of who are  beginning as youth in schools, colleges  and  even Parliament, to  enjoy  this  freedom and be able  to prepare  a. future  for our children. Some  of the older people  seem to be  happy,  and  their children must also  be  happy. I  am  pleading the  nation as  a whole  to come. forward  in unity  and safeguard  the  future that the President has  been working so  hard to  safeguard. The  President has made sure that there no hunger nor wars and that health facilities have  reached everybody  as has  education. I do  not  know what else we would  want more  than this. Talking  about multi-party  systems,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker, Sir;  we  have  in Kenya today  very  many  tribes,  and  asking us  to  a multi-party system  is  the same  as  asking  to  subdivide ourselves  and go  back  to where  we  came from-   The  President is  working hard  to make us  one  united people,  but then somebody comes  and calls on us  to go back and-separate-ourselves  from one another,   and  I  do not know what he wants  us  form. After 26  of  Independence  and Kanu, I do not understand why somebody  should come up  today  and talk of many parties. Why did he  say  so 26 years ago? Why  should  this  issue be brought up  today? Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,. Sir,. as policians,  we have not told the  Church how to  subdivide  itself, and  the Church should not tell us how to divide  our policies  and  the political  party  in  this country. The  Law Society   of Kenya should  involve  itself in  telling us  to do  this,  because we do not tell it how to run  its  business. If lawyers  want to contribute to  the development of    this country they have been told that there is the Harambee Spirit and nation building they should create  jobs,  and  I  think they should play a bigger role in  this  area rather  than to try  to destablise and confuse wananchi  in this country. The development of this country has been beneficial to all Kenyans, and  it  is  not President Moi who  is  benefiting alone,  nor is I or any other particular  individual.  The  development of this  country has helped very many people.  Industries  has  come  up,  and  today we even have a Kenyan-made car. It was  only yesterday,  while, on his way back here,  said  that he would name the company  that would be manufacturing such vehicles. This  is  going  to create many job  opportunities  for young people  in  this country,  such as young engineers  and  designers. Even  those who are  coming out the 8-4-4 system of education will havean  opportunity  to participate in this kind of development. We  also have the JuaKali  industry  and  technical education. I  think  that we,  in  this House,  shouldstand  firm and defend  this  unity and  this  nation of Kenyans. If anybody  is  not -prepared  to  toe  this line,  I  think we  should not allow him wholeheartedly tooperate  here. I  hope we will  devise a system of taking care of theseinstead  of just speaking about  them.  Why  should these  people  undermine  thePresident,  who  is  the Supreme  Leader of this nation.  If somebody  undermines The President,  and we let go free;  we  not be  playing our roles,  because  we  are here to  serve His Excellency. the  President,  and we have  all  taken oath to this effect unswervingly.   If we allow such a person  to go  undermining the President, who will we be serving? So, I call upon hon. Members of this House and allKenyans to stand  together firmly in order to make sure that the  unity  and development of Kenya and happiness of Kenyans,  the majority of whom are the youth, are  maintained.I would also  like to mention that the development projects that are ongoing in my Constituency of Hamisi, of Tiriki  Division are good, but the Minister for Public  Works should,  at least,  ensure that'   his officers maintain the  roads  there. Our roads  are  not that bad;  but if they were well maintained, we would not have  to  spend a lot of money on them. With these few remarks, Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

In Nyatike  we have  just  started to build schools and, therefore,  we  cannot  support  anybody who wants to  destroy peace in this country. Nyatike  is a pew constituency without roads  and waterand so  if stability in this  country is interfered with we will not be  able  to  get clean water,  good roads  and good schools for our children.   Therefore,  we have  every reason to support President Moi, who has united us completely.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when you have peace you can walk across to the next division, district, or to a friend to ask him to come and help you conduct an Harambee. President Moi has made us believe we are on Kenya and this is already working. So we will not support anybody who wants to interfere with our unity.
