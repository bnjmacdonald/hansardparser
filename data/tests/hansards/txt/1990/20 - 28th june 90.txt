Bw.  Kassim MwaliM atajulishwa matokeo kwa njia ya barua. </Newspeech>  <Newspeech> MR.  WASIKE-NDOMBI:  Bw. Naibu  Spika wa Muda,  ni  jana  tu ambapo  Shirika la Posta na Simu  lilikuwa likisifiwa na Bunge hili kwa sababu  imekuwa ikiendesha kazi yake  vizuri  na kuajiri  wafanyakazi  zaidi. Je,  Waziri Msaidizi  anaweza kuli-chukua jambo hili kama la muhimu  ili Bw.  Mwalim aajiriwe kazi ya kudumu pamoja na  wale  walioajiriwa naye.kama vibarua?  Tunajua kwamba Shirika la Posta na Simu linafanya kazi yake  vizuri na tunalisifu sana. </Newspeech>   <Newspeech>  MR.  MUTWOL:  Bw.  Naibu  Spika wa Muda,  ninakubaliana na mhe.  Mbunge anaposema kwamba Shirika la Posta na Simu  linafanya kazi yake vizuri. Hata hivyo,  wakati mwengine tunalazimika kuajiri watu karna vibarua,  na baada ya muda mfupi  tunawaajiri kazi  ya kudumu. Kuna watu  zaidi ya 2,000  ambao wanafanya kazi ya kibarua katika Shirika  la Posta na Simu,  na baada ya miezi  mitatu  au minne  baadhi yao watachukuliwa na kuandikwa kazi ya kudumu. Hii  ni  mipango  ambayo  inaendelea kila wakati,  na nataka kumhakikishia mhe.  Mbunge kwamba  tunafikiria kumchukua Bw.  Mwalim  mara moja na kumpatia kazi ya kudumu. </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>  MR.  MWAMZANDI:  Bw.

Inawezekana kwarnba baada ya kuongea hapa,  jambo hili  litasahaulika na huyu  kijana akose kupata namba. </Newspeech>   <Newspeech>  MR.  MUTWOL:  Bw.

Contributions for Mr.  Wabuli </Header> DR. WAMEYO asked the Minister for Labour how much money Mumias Sugar Company Ltd.  contribute to  the  National  Social  Security  Fund for Mr.  Pius Wesonga Wabuli,  Membership No.270-467-629. <Newspeech>  THE TEMPORARY  DEPUTY SPEAKER  (Mr. Tuva):  It  appears the Minister for Labour is not  in.  Shall  we  then  move on to Mr.  Bidu's  Question. </Newspeech>  Question No.241 <Header> Rehabilitation of Gulanze Dam </Header>   Mr.  Bidu alimuuliza Waziri wa Ustawi wa Maji ni kwa sababu Gulanze Dam iliyoharibika mwakawa 1985 bado haijarekebishwa. <Newspeech>  THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER  DEVELOPMENT  (Mr. Kisiero):  Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda,  naomba kujibu. Kutorekebishwa kwa Bwawa la Gulanze katika Wilaya ya Kwale kumetokana na  sababu mbali mbali.   Mojawapo ni kwamba hakuna pesa zilizotengwa kwa ajili hii.   Lakini  sababu iliyo kubwa zaidi ni kwamba mchanga au ardhi iliyo chini ya bwawa hilo haiwezi kushikilia maji na hsa kwenye kingo zake. Ardhi yenyewe ni ya aina ya kipekee ambayo ikishika maji,  huyeyuka mara moja kwa vile  ilivyo nyepesi. Jambo hili  hutokea hata kama ardhi  hiyo imenondanondwa kwa mashine nzito.   Hill  ni  jambo la ajabu hapa Kenya lilipogunduliwa na wataalamu wa ardhi kutoka ng'ambo.  wakati bwawa hilo lilipomalizika kujengwa kati ya mwaka wa 1983 na 1985,  lilipojaa maji,  kuta zake  zilibomoka mara moja katika sehemu mbali mbali.  Ili kulifanya bwawa hilo lishikilie maji,  itabidi ardhi ya aina tofauti iletwe kutoka mbali  kwa gharama kubwa.  Jambo hili  linapaswa kujadiliwa na Kamati ya Maendeleo Wilayani iii kupatikane suluhisho ikiwa pesa zitapatikana. Bw.Naibu Spika wa Muda hilo ni jibu la kus tajabisha sana. Nilimsikia Waziri Msaidizi akisema kwamba hata kama ardhi hii inapondapondwa kwa mashine nzito,  haiwezi kuShikamana. Anaweza kukubaliana nami kwamba kuchimbwa kwa bwawa hili kulitokana na mpango mbaya, na wakati lilipoharibika mnamo mwaka .wa 1983,  Kamati ya Maendeleo Wilayani, ilipitisha  kwamba pesa zitafutwe  za kulirekebisha. Niliuliza Swali hili kwa sababutangu mwaka wa 1985,  kazi  hii haijafanywa   na tangu wakati huo, wananchi wamekuwa wakingojea bwawahili lirekeshwe kwa sababu walikuwa wakilitegemea kwa maji ya kurywa. Hilryo ni  kusema kwamba tangu mwaka huo wa 1985,  wananchiwamekuwa wakipata taabu kubwa sana.Tungetaka kujua ni hatua gani wizara inakusudia kuchukua iii kuhakikisha kwamba bwawa hili linareketishwa? </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>  MR. KISIERO:  Bw.  Naibu Spika wa Muday  kama nilivyosema,  ni kweli kwam wataalamu,  wameuchungua sana mchanga huo na wamegundua kwamba huwezi kushikamana na siwezi kukubaliana na mhe.  bunge kwamba kulikuwa na mpango mbaya wakati bwawa hill  lilipokuwa likichimbwa.   Tatizo  hili lilitokana na aina ya mchanga katika eneo hili na jawabu ni kuleta mchanga kutoka pahaii   pengine ill  kuweza kulirekebisha bwawa hilo lakini ramijambo hilo litagharimu pesa nyingi  sana. </Newspeech>   <Newspeech>  MR.  WAMBUA:  Bw.  Naibu Spika wa Muda,  ni  ajabu kusikia kwamba bwawa hili kil lilichimbwa kwenye machanga mbaya. Tunsetaka kujua ni kwa nini wataalamu hawashawakuitwa wakati bwawa hili  lilipokuwa likichimbwa iii kuweza kutambua kwamba mchanga huu ni mbaya.  Sasa hawa wataalamu walikuwa wapi?   Kwa wakatf huu hasara kubwa sana imetokea na Waziri Msaidizi  anakuja hapa ungeni kusema kwamba miluhisho la tatizo hili ni  kuchukua mchanga kutoka pahali  Dengina, jambo anbalo litagharimu pesa nyingi  sana. Ni kwa nini wataalamu hawakuitwa kabla ya kuchimba bwawa hill  iii kuweza kugundua kwamba aina ya mchanga katika eneo hilo ni mbaya? </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>  MR. KISIERO:  Bw.  Naibu Spika wa Muda,  Bwawa hili  lilikuwa limejengwa hapo zamani,  labda katika mwaka 1950,lakini ilipojengwa upya, wizara haikuweza kufanya uchunguzi  ill kuhakikisha kwamba xaina ya mchanga katika eneo hilo ni nzuri. Ilitokea hapo baadaye kvamba mchanga huo ni mbaya,  waliwalete wataalamu kutoka ng'ambao ill  kuufanyia uchunguzi mchanga huu. </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>  BW.  BIDU:  Jambo  la nidhamu,  Bw.  Naibu Spika wa Muda,  ni  haki kwa Waziri MsaidizI kusema kwamba bwawa hili lilijengwa mnamo mwaka wa 1950, wakati ninafahamu wazi kwamba lilijengwa mnamo mwaka wa 1983?   Ni kweli   kiasema kwamba kuna mradi wowote unaoweza kuanzishwa katika nchi hii kabla ya         kufanyiwa uchunguzi kujua kama mradi huo utasababiSha hasara au faida?Waziri Msaidizi  analieleza Bunge hill kwamba bwawa hili lili  bomoka baada ya kuchimbwa,  lakini  tungetaka kujua wataalamu hawa walikuwa.wapi wakati ule? </Newspeech>   <Newspeech>  MR. KISIERO:  Bw.Naibu Spika wa Muda, kulingana na rekodi  tulizonazo bwawa hili  lilijengwa wakati wa 1950 lakini baadaye lilibomoka na hapo mnamomwaka wa 1983, likarekebi shwa   na kubomoka tena mnamo mwaka wa 1985.   Eli ndiyo sababu tuliwaita wataalamu   iii kulichunguza.jambo hili,  na wataalamu hawa walipokuja na kufanya uchunguzi,  waligundua kwamba mchanga katika eneo hilo ni  mbaya. </Newspeech>   <Newspeech>  THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER  (Mr.  Tuva):  Next Question. /<Newspeech>  Question No.279 <Header> Rehabilitation of Harisurwa Borehole </Header> MR. FALANA,on behalf of Mr.  Bulyaar,  asked the Minister for  Water Development what plans he has  to  rehabilitate Harisurwa Borehole in Korr Location since it  broke down five years ago. <Newspeech>  THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT  (Mr.Mweu):  Mr.  Temporary= Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to reply. Instead of rehabilitating  Halisurwa Borehole, my Ministry has found it mor6conomical  to drill another borehole at  the  same  site. Drilling  of the proposed borehole  will commence during the current 1939/83  Development Plan subject to the  availability  of funds. </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>  MR.  ARTE:  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  could the  Assistant Minister tell  this House  what would be the cost  of rehabilitating this borehole and also the cost  of drilling a new one? </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>  MR. MWEU:  Mr. Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I am not in a position to how ma much it  would cost to rehabilitate  this borehole,  but I am able to say how much it would cost to drill a new one. It would cost  Shs.600,000/- to drill a new borehole. </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>  MR.  ARTE:  On a point  of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  if the hon.  Assistant Minister does not know how much it would cost to rehabilitate  this borehole,  could he  tell this House how he came to find out that it would be cheaper to  drill  a new one instead of rehabilitating the old one? </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR.  MWEU:  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I did not  say in any way that  it  would be 2 cheaper to drill a new borehole instead of rehabilitating the  old one. What  happened was that this  borehold collapsed in 1934trapping all  the draw-pipes and well-rods in the process. What  the hon.  Membershould know is that  it  is very expensive to retrieve these pipes and so on from a well  that has already sunk.   This is why the Ministry preferred to drill  a new borehole  instead of rehabilitating the old one which would be more expensive  in the long run. </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>  MR. MANG'OLI:  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  while  appreciating the reply from the Assistant Minister,  and noting that it will cost them only Shs.600,000 to drill a new borehole,  could he assure the House that the Ministry will  look for ways and means of getting this money as soon as possible so that they can drill this borehole to provide wananchi in this area with water. If the Ministry cannot get  this money,  then it has failed in its duty. I  am saying  this because water is life and they cannot just say  that  they have no money. Could he therefore  tell this House when they  are  going to  get this money in order to start drilling this borehole? </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>  MR. MWEU:  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  the hon.  Member  should  try to be clear in what  he  is  trying to  say. I am saying  this because we cannot start a borehole with only Shs.200,000/-.   You need a net  sum of Shs.600,000/-to start thinking about  drilling a borehole  and this is what we do not have. </Newspeech>   <Newspeech>  MR. MANG'OLI:  On a point of order,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir. Is the hon.  Assistant Minister in order really to  say that  I am not clear in what I am saying?   I said quite categorically that since it would cost the Ministry only Shs.600,000/-,  could the  Assistant Minister tell this House, and How and when the Ministry intends to raise that money.  If the Ministry cannot raise Shs.600,000/-,  then I am afraid that it is not worth its salt. </Newspeech>    <Newspeech>  MR.  MWEU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I havesaid that we  are unable  to raise  that  amount  of money.This requestwas  forwarded to  the  Office  of the  Vice-President and Ministry of Finance through the  1988/89  Forward Budget but  the  Treasury was not able  to  fund the  project  at  that  time. </Newspeech>   <Newspeech>  AN  HON.  MEMBER:  Only KShs.600,000/-? </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>  MR.  MWEU:  Of course yes: There  are  other priorities  ofCourse! But  the  request  is  still reflected in this year's  ForwardBudget. We  hope  that during the current Plan period,  we will beable  to  get  that  money and  sink another borehole. </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>  THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER  (Mr.  Tuva): Next  Question. </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>  MR.

Naibu Spika wa Muda,  Waziri Msaidizi,katika  jawabu lake,  amesema kwamba kulingana na sheria za manispaa magari ambayo huwa yamebeba petroli na gasi hayaruhusiwi kuegeshwa katika mtaa wa Ganjoni.  Ninafahamu wazi wazi  kwamba hiyo  sheria iko. Lakini ukwell ni kwambawenye  haya magari wameivunja hiyo  sheria. Hata ukienda pale  Ganjonisasa utayaona haya magari,  ambayo ni mengi,  yakiwa-yameegeshwa kwenye mtaa huo wa Ganjoni. Yameegeshwa karibu.na karakanp ya ile kampuniijulikanayo  kama  Italian Engineering Limited.Je,  Waziri Msaidiziatachukua hatua gani  kuona kwamba sheria hii haivunjwi tena?Hii  nikwa  sababu magari,hayo yanaweza kulipuka na kusababisha ,hasarakubwa sans. </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>  MR.

MIBEI:Mr.Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,I am not  in a position to answer that supplementary question because the  Questioner only wanted to know the number of classified roads in his  constituency. </Newspeech>    <Newspeech> MR.

I  can bring the  answer next week,Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir. </Newspeech>   <Newspeech>  THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr.  Tuva): Let  us  goback to  Question No.280. </Newspeech>   Question No.280 <Header> Dental  Staff for Taveta Hospital</Header>  MR.  WASIKE-NDOMBI,  on behalf of Mr.  Kubo,  asked the  Minister  for Health when the Ministry will post dental  staff to Taveta Hospital now that  the dental equipment  has been supplied to the hospital. <Newspeech>  THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr.  Ogur):  Mt.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to reply. A Dental  Officer,  Dr.  Naomi,  Personal No.53172, was posted on 1st March, 1990,  to Taveta Hospital. However,  she did not report to the  hospital as  she  got  a new  job  at  Kenyatta National Hospital. But  my Ministry will now post  another dental surgeon to Taveta Hospital in July, 1990,  when the  interns currently in Kenyatta National  Hospital will be  released  for posting. </Newspeech>    <Newspeech>  MR.WASIKE-NDOMBI: Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  it is now a common practice  within the Ministry of Health  that doctors  are  posted to certain areas  and they refuse to  go there. I have  a case  in point where a Clinical Officer was posted to Namakholo Health Centre and she refused to go there.  It is now six months and  she has not  turned up at the Health Centre. This particular dental  officer was posted to Taveta Hospital in Match this year but  she has refused to  go there. This  Hospital has  beenwithout  a dental surgeon for a long time. Therefore,  what urgentsteps  is the ministry taking to send another dental officer there instead  of waiting up to July,1990? <.Newspeech>  <Newspeech>  MR.OGUR:Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker ,Sir, it is quite  correct  that  some doctors refuse to go to  certain  areas when they are  posted to  those  areas.  This  particular dental  officer had  earlier  on applied for that  job  at Kenyatta National Hospital FP and  she was  interviewed and  selected. Since Kenyatta National  Hospital  is  now a parastatal, and  in view of the  fact  that  it is  offering a little better pay,  the  lady decided to take up the job. She  is  still  serving this nation. So,  there  isnothing we  can do between now and July,  this year,  when our student surgeon. doctors will be graduating. Since we  have  10 dentalsurgeons  at  the  Coast,  there  is nobody who is walking without teeth as  a result  of the delay in posting a dental  officer to Taveta Hospital. There  is therefore,  no  cause  for alarm because we  are going to  send a dental  surgeon to Taveta Hospital  at  the  end  of June,  this year. </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>  THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER  (Mt.

WASIKE-NDOMBI:  Asante  sana,  Bw.  Naibu Spika wa Muda.illmtnasimama kuungana na Wabunge Wenzagu kumshukuru Makamu-Raisna Waziri  wa Fedha kvia ile  Bajeti  ambayo  alileta hapa. Ingawainaonekana kwamba Bajeti  hii haikumtatiza sana mwananchl,kuna  jaMbo  la wakalima  ambalo  linatatitp sana.  Bw.  Naibu Spika wa Muda,  mkulima,kwa,m fano,  wa miwa kuleMuni  as,  Nzoia,  Chemelil na kadhalika, dons alyingi zapesa ambazo  zinachukuliwa na katpuni  za miwa. Wakulima wanakatwapesa nyingi  sana. Tena utapata kwamba kuna kodi ya asilimia tanoambayo  inalipwa na mkulima. Kodi  hii  inahesabiwa kutokana na mazao yote  ya mkulima,  yaani  gross  proceeds  za miwa.  Tungependa Waziri  alichungu    jambo hili  kwa makini sana kwa sababu. linatatitasana. Unapata kwamha kammuni imachukua pe. nyingi  sana na mkalima amebakill na pesailfle ego  sana.  Pia nesa nyingine  zinachukuliwa kwenda kwa kodi hii ya asilimia tano. Jambo  hili  limewafanya wakulima wengi.  sana kuwa na malalamiko na kuwavanja moyo  we kukuza miwa. Isitoshe,  Bw.  Naibu Spika wa MU a,  kunayo kodi  nyingine ambayo  mkulima analipa.  Hiini ile  kodi amacesslambayo  inaenda kwa konseli. Kwa hivyo,  namuomba Waziri  achungagthe  jambo hill na ikiwezekana yafaa ile  kodi ya asilimia tano  iregeshwe  iwe karibu na ile  kodi  ama cess  ya asilimia moja.This  is  a bit  too  hicrh.  Kwa hivyo,  naomba kwaffdaliii  kuwawezesha wakulima kuwa na roho ya kukuza mimea yafaa kodi hii  ya asilimia tano  inurc uzwe,  la sivyo,  iondolewe  kabisa. Kodi hii  haiwahusu wakalima wa miwa nekee ball  hata wakulima wa pamba,  maHindi,  kahawa,  ngano na kadhalika. Kwa hivyo,  hili  ni  jambo  ambalo  limewaumiza wakulimasana katika nchi  hii. Wakulima ndio  chanzo  cha maendeleo  yauchumi wa nchi  hii. Jambo  lingine  ambalo  naona katika Bajeti hii ni  kwamba kuna Wizara ya Ujenzi  ambayo  inahusika na mambo  ya barabara. ilaona kwamba ni nesa ndogo  sana ambalo  zimetengwa kwa mambo ya barabara na kila mahali katika nchi ya Kenya rale wanalalamika kwa sababu ya hali mbaya ya barabara,  hasa katika miji.  Kwa hivyo, wenye  magari  wanptumia pesa nyingi  sana kuyatengeneza magari yao arillayo mara kwa marasababu ya hall mbaya ya barabara.Kwa hivyo,  namuomba aziri  afikirie  kaiongeza nesa Wizara hii ill iweze  kutengeneza barabara kote  nchini. Pia,  nikiwa katika  jambo hili  la barabara,  utaona kwamba mahali  ambapo kuna toll station,ambapo tunalina nesa nyingi,  hapo ndipo  barabara huwa mbaya zaidi. Halafu sisi  ambao  tunalipa kodi    ya toll  station tunashangaa sana pesa hizi  zinakwenda wani.Hi vi juzi  ttaiarribiwa na Wazirt va ljj enzikWamb a Witara fnbpatbpesa nyingi  sana kutokana na hzi  toll  stations cote nchini. hivyo,  kwa vile  Waziri mwenyewe ni mtu wa bidii  sana,  tungetaka aongezewe  pesa hizi. Hizi KSh.68 milioni hpzitoshi hata kidogo!ni Wizara  ambayo  inastahili kunewa nafasi  ya kuanza katilwiaWizarT ote kuhusu pmrabo  ya maendeleo.Bw.  Naibu Soika wa Muda,  nasema hivyo kwa sababu ukiangalia,kwa mfano,  bei ya greda moja n mamilionya pesa na nchi  hiiinahltaji  greda nyingi. Pia,  ukiangalia bei  ya trakta moja utaonani ya eesa na hata tipa za kubebea kokoto. Kwa hivyo,ingefaa Waziri  aifikirie  Wizara hii kwa sana na kuiongezea pesa  iweze  kuzitengeneza barabara  za nchi hii  ziwe  r zuri. Nasema hivyo kwa  sababu bila mawasiliano  itakuwa ni vigumu hata kwa wakulima kuzipeleka bidhaa zao kwenye  masoko  ya kuuzia. Nikiendelea.katika Bajeti hii  sioni kri   pesa zimeongezwa za kuwaajiri  watu uenEi  zaidi. Naona kwamba katika Bajeti  hii hakuna nafasi  PrIP  provision ya kuwaongeza idadi  ya wafanyakazi na hali katika shule  zeta kuna vi jana ambao  wamehltimu kidato cha nne na sita na hata chuo  kikuu na wote  wanahitaji kuData kazi. Kwa hivyo,  naonelea ingefaa Waziri  kuweka katika Bajeti ya aina hii kiwango  cha pesa ambacho kitachukua nafasi  ya kuwaajiri vijana hawa ambao  tuko nao na ambao  wako kwa wing  zaidi. Jambo  hill  la wafanyakazi ni  la muhinu sanakwa sababu vi jana hawa wako tayari kufanya kazi  kwa bidii  iii kuinua uchuml wa nchi hii yetu zaidi.  Watu wanalalamika sana kwa sababu  indirect taxation  imekuwa kubwa.  Kwa mfano, utaona National  Hospital  Insurance Fund (NHIF)  itmeongezwa kutoka shs.20.00 hadi  shs.30.00 na shs.320.00. Hizi  ni  pesa nyingi  sana. Jambo  lingine  la kuhuzunisha ni  kuona kuwa hata baada ya watu kutozwa pesa hospitalini bado hakuna dawa huko.  Kule  kwetu kumezuka ugonjwa uitwao Highland Malaria ambako mtu huanza na kuumwa ma kichwa asubuhi  na  ifikapo saa sita huanza kuhara halafu  ifikapo saa tisa hufariki. Kwa hivyo,  haya malipo ya shs.10.00 yanawashinda watu wengime.ndigo sababu unaona kuwa watu wanafariki  kwaLkiwango t4- a kikubwa. Kwa sababu ya matatizo yanayowakumba wananchi)hasa wale  wasio na mapato ya kutoa hizi  shs.10.09ingekuwa bora kama malipo haya yangeondolewa. Inafaa kutolewe  circular  kwa hospitali  zote,   zahanati  na vituo vyote  vya afya  ikieleza kuwa wananchi  wasio na mapato yoyote  au wale  wasio  na kazi wawe  wakipatiwa matibabu ya bure. Hii  ni  kwa sababu maisha ya mwanadamu yana  dhamani  kubwa kuliko hizo  shs.10.00 au shs.50.00  zinazotozwa na Wizara ya Afya. Hili  ni  jambo  la muhimu sana kwa mfano Jumapili  iliyopita kulitokea vifo  vitano  vya watu wa  familia moja.  Nilipomwambia Medical  Officer of Health wa Kakamega Hospital  kuwa watu hao walifariki  kutogana na ugonjwa wa meningitis alilikanusha  jambo hilo. Alilikanusha jambo hilo na hali  watu wanaendeleakufariki. Jambo  la kushangaza  zaidi  ni  kuwa yeye  alikuwa analikanusha jambohilo  bila yeye  kwenda kule na kulikagua  jambo hilo. Hii  inaonyesha kuwayeye  hana moyo wa kuwatumikia wananchi  ambao  maisha yao yako katika hatari.  KWa hivyo,  Bw.  Naibu Spika wa Muda,  ningependa kuwahimiza watu vote  wanaofanya kazi  watie bidii kwa kazi  zote wanazofanya ili uchumi wa nchi  hii  uweze kuendelea. Hakuna faida yoyote kwa maofisa wetu kuingia ofisinina kutumia wakati  wao mwingi kupigia alaciki  wage simu au kuacha koti -Take kwa kiti  na kuenda kuendesha Vioski ece.  Ingawa kuna malalamiko mengi juu ya ubomoaji  wa vioski,  utaona kuwa vioski hivi ni vya watu wakubwa wakubwa. Hii  ndiyo  sababu kuna shida kubwa sana juu ya ubomoaji wa vioski. Ingekuwa  bora kama vioski  vingeachiwa wale wananchi wadogo wadogo kwani hawa watu wakubwa wakubwa wana mapato mengi  kuliko wao. Hakuna haja kwa watu wenye uwezo  kuendelea  kuwa  nyanyasa wale  wasio na uwezo. Bw.  Naibu  Spika wa Muda,  ingawa inasemekana kuwa mwananchi anaweza kupata mkopo kutoka.-kwa  Kenya  Industrial  Estate wa shs.100,000.00 hata kama  hana dhamana yoyote)lakini maofisa wanacienduza shughuli  hii  huwaletea vikwazovingi  sana wananchi  wanapoomba mikopo. Ingekuwa bora kama Wizara ya Viwandaingetoa.maelezo kamili  kuhusu  jambo hili  iii wananchi waweze kupata mikopo kwa njia rahisi. Jambo  lingine  linahusu uuzaji  wa mashamba ya watuna Agriculturit Finance Corporation (AFC)  wanaposhindwa kulipa  mikopo. Huko kwetu watu wengisana wamepoteza mashamba yao kutokana na jambo hili. Utaona hata wakatihalf  ya hewa huwa mbaya na wakulima wakakosa kupata mavuno mazuri,  AFC huenda mbele  na kuuza mashamba ya watu ambako watu hawa hukosa mahali  pa kuishi. Kwa hivyo,  ningependa kumwomba Waziri  wa Kilimo alirekebishe jambo hili  iii wakulima wetu waweze  kuuendeleza uchumi  wetu. Kwa hayo machache,  naunga mkono. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  MINISTER FOR PUBLIC  WORKS (Mr.  Mibei): Thank you  verymuch,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  for giving me  this opportunity to joinmy colleagues  in  congratulating His  Excellency  the  Vice-President  and Ministerfor Finance  for his  Budget. As  we  all  know the  centre-piece  of the  Budgetwas  the  focus  on export promotion. We  need  to  increase  our  exports  so  that we  can  earn  more foreignour  country,  tea,  coffeeus foreing  exc  hange.  I exchange  which  is badly needed  in our country. Inand horticultural crops contribute  a lot impt earningwould  like  at  this  juncture to commelete  all  tea  growers  in the way  they have managed the tea industry in this country. I  think,in the past. two months,  there was  surplus tea because of favourable weather conditions  and the  impetus  that has been given to the farmers by the prices of tea which were  ordered by His  Excellency  the President.  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  tea growing should be encouragedEspecially, in  the  rural  areas where very many  people are employed  in this  industry.  The  other  crop  that we  export  is  coffee. I  would  like  to  appeal to  the promoters  of this  crop  to have more aggressive  coffee promotion  campaigns abroad. I  remember  last year  I  boarded a Lufthansa aircraft from Jomo  Kenyatta International  Airport  and  inside  the  plane  I  was  surprised to  see  them  serving Colombian Tea  instead  of Kenyan  Tea. The  Coffee  Board  of Kenya should  do  more to see. that our  coffee  is  served as  passangers board the aircrafts.  We  need  to  increase  on  our  production of horticultural  crops  because the  climate  of our  country  is  favourable  to such crops  The  problem,   I  think, is  that we  have not  made  enough efforts  to  increase  our production of these crops. The  authority  concerned should go  deep  into  the rural areas  so that the rural  farmers  can also benefit from  the proceeds of these crops. In his  Speech,  the  Vice-President and Minister  for Finance  emphasised on rural/urban balance.  I  think it  is important because  over 80 per cent   of our people live in the rural  areas.  The  Government  introduced  the District Focus Strategy for Rural Development which has  taken   the balance of, the national cake  to  the rural  areas. I  agree with   what  the Vice-President for Finance and Minister said that the aim  of this year's Budget is development for all. It is  important for leaders to know   the operation of the district development   committee(DDCs)  because  they go up to the grass-root level. It  is necessary for all levels of DDCs from the sub-location to the district to plan for different  categories of industries. The priorities of the DDCs have been roads and health centres. Emphasis  should also be placed on all activities that are required in sub-locations.  The  introduction of the Export Processing Zone will attract investors, and I  am sure we  shall have more industries established in those zones. My hon. colleagues have talked about the Kenya Industrial Estates and I would like this body to be more sympathetic to women groups in the rural areas who   have acquired loans to buy posho mills. The position now in the rural  areas with regard to pbsho mills is that most of them   have been auctioned by the KIE. Although KIE is supposed to be a profit makingbody,  it  should also be  a service organisation. They should   also giveenough notices to the women groups because they do not have other ways of raising income other  than through Harambee efforts. All our development depends on the stability that we have in our country. For  the last one month we have been going around the country and we are satisfied that our country is stable because  the wananchi have  all agreed and  Shown that they are one.  I need not dwell  on that very much. I would like to say that some people have not understood the Kiswahili translation of the title "His Excellency" in reference to the President, and  there have been some misguided interpretations.  We  take Tanzania to be.a Kiswahili  speaking country and as I was listeninE to their radio broadcasts,  I gathered that they refer to their President as "Mtukufu Rais".  Since  they are our authority in Kiswahili, I  think we  are on the right track in referring   to our President as "Mtukufu", as   do the Tanzanians who are experts on Kiswahili. I would like  to appeal  to   all Kenyans to be committed in the development of our country. I have no doubt that  they are committed, but I would   especially appeal to public servants to show more commitment so that we  can develop this country  more. I  do not believe that we  lackresources in this country. We have material and human resources, but Ibelieve  that public  servants are not as fast as politicians. They seem tomove  slowly and we have heard of complaints in different offices about the laxity of public servants. It  is  the high time  they pulled uptheir  socksand gave more services to the People. They should also be fruitfulin all that  they do. Here,  I  single out the  ailing parastatals which I think are notcommitted to making profits. We  in the Ministry of Public Works continue  to improve on the infrastructure such as roads and bridges and I am satisfied that with the resources and fiends available to us, we   have done all we could to improve on the  infrastructure.  I wish to  thank the motorists who have been contributing toll money and I  assure  them that we  shall continue to improve the roads where the  toll money came from. Every year,  we  collect about Kshs.300 million from toll charges. With those few remarks,  I beg to support. </Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR.   KIILU: Bw.

WAMBUA: Thank  you very much,  Mr.  Temporary DeputySpeaker,  Sir,  for  allowing me  to xxm  join my colleagues in this Budget  debate.  First  of  all I wish  to  congratulate  the  Vice-President and Minister  for Finance  for  producing such a nice  Budget  for 1990/91. Before  I  continue  im  further, I would  ask him to  ensure  that  no  mini, budgets  take  place  until the  end of the  next  financial year. I  amsaying this because  yesterday  I  noticed that Ribena whichhas been costing about  Shs.80/-  had its price raised by  70  cents we  are  still  debating the  Budget  proposals.   If this  was  so yesterday,how will  it be by the end of this financial year?So,  I  request  the  Ministry  concerned not  to have  any  "mini-budgets"  because  if this  happens,  it  is  the  common  mwananchi  who will  suffer. The  prices  of baby foods,  for  example,  have  gone  up  and  I  would  like  the  Ministry concerned  to check  and  find  out  what  has  happened  in  order  to  stop  it.  Wananchi  are  very happy  with  the  Budget,  but  they  are  now much  discouraged  to  see  commodity prices going up  after  only a short  time. While  we  and  the  people  we  represent  in this House  are  very  happy with  the  current  Budget,  it  is  very  discouraging  to  see "mini-budgets"  shooting up  every  month,  if not  every  day. Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  various Ministries  and departments  have  had  a half of  their Votes  approved,  and  they  should make  use of  this  money  to  develop  the  country. However,   it  looks  very  awkward for  some Ministries  and  departments  to  return money  to  the  Treasury  at  the  end  of the financial  year  because  I  am  sure  that  when  the  Treasury  releases  money,  it wants  all  the  money  to be  used without  a single  cent  being returned  to  it. Therefore,   I  would request  the  Office  of  the  Vice-President  and Ministry  of Finance  to  compile  a  list of  the  Ministries  and  departments  that return money to  the  Treasury  and  explanation  as  to  why  the  money  was  returned. It  should be  explained  whether  the  projects  for  which money  was  voted  were  completed  or not. This  list  should  be  produced  in  this  House  along with  the  other  reportsthat  are  brought year  after  the  completion  of projects. If  projects  have  notbeen  completed,  this  money  should be  used up  to  the  last  cent. With regard to Questions put  in this House,  especially with regard to  my  constituency,  I  remember  that  the  first Question  I  asked since  I  came  to the  House  came  up  in May, 1988,  relating  to  the  health centres,  dispensaries and  roads  in  the  constituency. Up  to  the  time  I  am  speaking here  now,  some  ofthe  promises  I  have got have  not been  fulfilled. The  answer  I  always  get  isthat  such-and-such  a  thing  is  now being worked upon,  but  these  things have not been done  so  far. There  are,  for  example,  some health centres  and  dispensariesin my  constituency which have  not been renovated. When  I  ask  a Question here about  them,  I  have  always been told that either money is available or the work in  question has  already  been  completed. However,  to my  dismay,  when I  visitthe  areas  concerned,  I  find  that  nothing has been done. When  Minister  andAssistant  Ministers  stand up  here  and say that such-and-such a thing is going to be  done by.such-and-such a date,  they should follow up these things  and make sure  that  the  things  have  actually  been  done;  otherwise,  we will be talking about  them  every  now  and  then  without  anything being  done.  It  was  only  the  other  day,  as  my  colleague  has  said,  when the Assistant Minister  for  Health  stood up here  and said that  linen had been dispatched  to Machakos  General  Hospital  on  28th  February,  1990.  He  insisted that what he  was  saying was  correct although he himself had not visited the hospital  nor got  additional  facts  from  the  officer who  feeds  him with such information,  but  the  linen had not reached the  hospital. With  regard to roads,  we  are  told that roads  are going to be graded and graders  are  available,  but when we  visit the  areas  concerned,  we  find no graders  there. Therefore,  when  Ministers  and Assistant Ministers  get  answers from  their  officers,  they  should make  sure  that  these  answers  are  appropriate because  we  do  not  ask Questions here  for  fun;  we  do  so  for the benefit of wananchi  and  the  country. If  a  Minister  or  an  Assistant  Minister  says  here that  something  is  being  done,  this  thing must  actually be  in  the  process  of being  done. If he  is  not  sure  of his  facts,  when he  goes  back  to his  office he  should  check  with his  officers  as  to whether  the  answer he  gave  to  the  House is  correct  or not. Alternatively,  he  should not give  the  answer before he  is completely  sure  that  it  is  correct;  otherwise we  will  be  doing no service  to anybody. Promises  made  here  should be  fulfilled without waste  of time,  and money  that has  been voted  for  a particular project should be  completely spent on  the project rather  than to return it to the Treasury. The  roads  in  my  area are really bad.  All  the  time  I  am  told by my colleague here,  the Assistant Minister,  that the roads are  in good condition, or  that  there  are workers on the roads maintaining them. Just  the  other  day,there  was  a very  bad accident  at  Thwake. No  repairs  have  been carried out. Inspite of having got answers to  the  effect that some people  would go there to  repair  the  bridge  the  following month,  nothing has been done,  and this has been  the  case  for  a year  now. I  had  asked that some  signs  be  installed on  the road  to  show  that  this  road  is  dangerous,  and somebody promised that these signs  were  going to be  installed,  but,  although  I  asked this Question last year, not  even  a  single  sign  has  been  put  up. What are  we  doing here  if the promises given here  are  not  fulfilled? Please,  let us  be  serious  in what we  tell wananchi  for the  sake  of whom we  speak here. When  we  get  a promise  from  a high authority,  such  as  a  Minister  or  an  Assistant  Minister,  the  promise  should be fulfilled,  not  for my  individual  benefit,  but  for  the  benefit of wananchi  in general Minister  and  Assistant Ministers  are  appointed to serve wananchi,  and the  answers  we  get  from  them  should be  proper  and  adequate.  With  these  few  remarks,  Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,   I  beg to  support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  LENGEES:  Ahsante  sana,  Bw.  Naibu  Spika wa Muda,  kwa kunipatia nafasi  iii  nijiunge  na wenzangu katika  kuyasema machache  kuhusu Makadirio ya Matumizi  ya  Fedha yaliyotolewa hapa na  Makamu  wa Rais  na Waziri  wa Fedha mnamo tarehe 7  Juni, 1990. Mhe.  Makamu wa Rais  na Waziri  wa Fedha alitoa Bajetiambayo  ni  nzuri  sana kwa njia nyingi. Tuliarifiwa  katika  Bajeti  hii  kwambauchumi  wa nchi  umekuwa  ukiongezeka  tangu mwaka wa  1985  kwa  asilimia  tano,  huku ustawi  wa kilimo ukiongezeka kwa  kimo  kikubwa kuliko  ongezeko  la  idadi ya watu wetu. Uchumi  ukiongezeka kwa kimo kikubwa kuliko  ongezeko  la  idadi  ya watu nchini,  hii  ni  habari  nzuri  kwa sababu inamaanisha kwamba nchi  inaweza kuwalisha watu  wake  vizuri  bila shida. Kwa hivyo,  uchumi  wetu  umeendelea kustawi  vizuri  tangu uwekwe  chini ya Mtukufu Makamu wa Rais na Waziri wa Fedha.  Ninamshukuru Makamu wa Rais na Waziri wa Fedha kwa kujaribu sana kuona kwamba wananchi  wa kawaida hawakuumia sana kutokana na Bajeti yake. Hata  ingawa tunajua kwamba bei  za bidhaa  fulani  zitaenda juu kabla ya mwaka wa matumizi ya pesa za Serikali kuisha,  Makamu wa Rais na Waziri wa Fedha alihakikisha kwamba kwa wakati hii wananchi  hawakuguzwa sana. Nataka kumwomba kila wakati  awe  akihakikisha kwamba bei ya vyakula ambavyo hutumiwa sana katika sehemu  za mashambani haziendi  juu sana.  Nikirudi  katika sehemu ninayowakilisha hapa Bungeni,  nataka kusema kwamba National  Cereals  and Produce  Board  ina  chakula kingi  zaidi  huko.  Lakini  taabu  ni kwamba vyakula vinavyopatikana huko  huwa vimekaa kwa muda mrefu  zaidi,  na wakati vinavyouziwa wananchi huwa vimeharibiwa na wadudu.  Kwa mfano,   tunajua kwamba nafaka kama mahindi  inapokaa kwa muda mrefu  sana   uharibiwa na wadudu  na wakati  mwengine inakuwa hailiki. Pia,  nataka kusema kwamba nafaka katika  sehemu  za Maralal  huuzwakwa bei  ya  juu  sana. Wafanya biashara wa Nyahururu hutuuzia chakula kwa bei yachini;  ukinunua gunia moja  la mahindi yaliyosagwa kutoka Nyahururu  bei  ni  KShs.270/-  ile hali katika Maralal  unapata gunia moja   kwa KShs.327/-. Baadaye  unatumia kama KShs.15/-kuyasaga mahindi  hayo ambayo huwa yamekaa sana katika maghala. Kwa hivyo,  ninamuombaWaziri  anayehusika aelewe  kwamba tuna shida katika maghala ya National Cereals and Produce  Board katika sehemu  za Maralal.  Kama chakula kikiharibikia katika maghala kinafaa kuondolewa na kuchoma badala ya kuuziwa wananchi.  Pia,  bei  ya mahindi  tunayopata kutoka maghala ya National  Cereals  and Produce Board  inaleta shida kwa sababu katika maduka bei ya unga pia  inaenda juu. Kwa mfano,  katika sehemu  za Wamba na Barakwei,  ambazo ni  makao makuu ya divisheni,  bei ya posho ni KShs.6/- kwa kilo kwa sababu  bei ya mahindi katika maghala ya National Cereals and Produce Board  imeenda juu  sana. Kwa hivyo,  namwomba Waziri  anayehusika afikirie ni hatua gani atachukua   kurekebisha makosa hayo. Bw.  Naibu Spika wa Muda,  kuhusu ugawaji gharama za huduma ma matibabu, niliona katika magazeti kwamba Hospitali ya Maralal ndiyo iliyokusanya pesa kidogo zaidi  hapa nchini kutoka kwa wagonjwa.  Kiasi  cha pesa kilichokusanywa ni KSh.96,000/- Jambo  ambalo nataka kumweleza Waziri wa Afya ni kwamba huduma za afya ni  lazima zitolewe kwa njia nzuri kwa sababu wakati huu kila mtu anagharamia matibabu yake hata  ingawa kwa njia ndogo. Kwa wakati  huu,  ukienda katika Hospitali ya Maralal utapata kwamba wananchi  wanaolazwa katika hospitali wanalazimika kubeba mablanketi yao na matandiko mengine.  Kwa wakati  huu,  sehemu ya Maralal  ina baridi  sana. Sijaweka Swali  katika Bunge kuuliza ni  lini Hospitali ya Maralal  ilipopata nguo za kutumiwa na-wagonjwa,  lakini  nataka kumweleza-Waziri  kwamba wananchi  katika sehemu hiyo  wana  shida  sana. Ikiwa mgonjwa hawezi  kujibebea blanketi,  basi  akilazwa hukohospitalini  hulala bila matandiko. Kwa wakati  huu  ambapo  tunagawana gharama katikaupande wa matibabu,  yafaa Waziri wa Afya ahakikishe kwamba huduma zinazotolewa  na Wizara yake  zinakuwa za hali ya juu.  Hivyo,  wananchi watajua kwamba wakilipa pesa watapata huduma za hali ya juu na watakuwa na moyo wa kugawana gharama na Serikali. Nikiendelea kuongea juu ya Wizara ya Afya,  nataka kumjulisha Waziri pia kwamba katika sehemu ya Maralal  tuna mbwa wengi  sana wanaotembea ovyo ovyo na ambao wamewauma watu wengi na kuwapatia ugonjwa wa kichaa cha mbwa na kufa. Imesemekana kwamba katika Hospitali ya Maralal  hakuna dawa ya ugonjwa wa kichaa cha mbwa,  na watu wanapoumwa na mbwa hulazimika kusafiri hadi Nakuru kupata dawa hiyo. Kwa hivyo, kwa vile  ugonjwa wa kichaa cha mbwa ni mwingi  sana katika sehemu ninayowakilisha, angefanya juu  chini  kuhakikisha kwamba tunapata dawa ya kuutibu katika Hospitali ya Maralal. Bw.  Naibu  Spika wa Muda,  kuhusu barabara,  nataka kusema kwamba wakati huu hali ya barabara katika sehemu yangu  si  mbaya sana.  Nataka kuishukuru  Serikali kwa kurekebisha barabara ya Maralal-Rumuruti,  ambayo  ilikuwa  imeharibika sana. Nataka kumwomba Waziri anayehusika na barabara afikirie ombi  letu  la hapo awali kwamba Wilaya ya Laikipia  itupatie barabara hiyo kwa sababu hawaitumii vile  tunavyoitumia. Barabara hiyo  iko katika divisheni yao na inatutumikia katika upande waSamburu  sana. Tunataka tupatiwe hiyo barabara iii  tuwe tukiirekebisha kila mwakakwa sababu  inatufaidi sana kuliko Wilaya ya Laikipia. Kwa vile Wilaya ya Laikipiahaina haja na barabara hiyo,  hawawezi kuwa wakiirekebisha vifaavyo.  Hata  tulipeleka  mapendekezo yetu katika provincial monitoring evaluation committee ambayo  inaendelea kutusaidia,  na  tunamwomba Waziri  afikirie  pia kuona vile barabara hii  inaweza kuchukulivia na Wilaya ya Samburu. Bw.  Naibu  Spika wa Muda,  pia .ninamwomba Waziri  anayehusika na barabara ahakikishe  kwamba kuna grader  moja katika kila  tarafa  iii barabara za ndani ndani ziweze  kutengenezwa. Wizara yapaswa kuhakikisha kwamba barabara  zinafanyiwa classification kila mwaka kwa  sababu kuna barabara nyingi  zinazofunguliwa kila mwaka kulingana na maendeleo ya wananchi.Kwa mfano,   tumejenga shule  na zahanati  katika sehemu mbali  mbali  katika wilaya yetu na barabara zilizoko huwa zinatengenezwa kwa mikono  na wananchi. Ikiwa kutakuwa na grader katika kila  tarafa,  barabara hizozilizofunguliwa zingekuwa zikirekebishwa vizuri. Kwa hivyo,  namwomba Waziri  aonekwamba mipango ya kurekebisha barabara katika nchi hii  inaanzia katika tarafa.  Kwa  hayo machache,  Bw.  Naibu Spika,  naunga mkono. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr.  Kibaki): Thank you  very  much,  Mr.  TemporaryDeputy Speaker,  Sir,  for giving me  this opportunity. I  would  like first of allto congratulate the Vice-President and Minister for Finance  for his very remarkable Budget  that he produced  at a  time when  the rest of the countries  in Africa are not even bothering  to publish a budget. It  is  important  to make  this point becausemany people  in Kenya really behave as if they are spoilt. We  have an organisedand  disciplined management of finance as opposed  to other countries  in Africa.  I  am  not  saying  that we  should follow any standards set by Africa there are nonebut we have our own  standards.  In  any  case,  we are following  international standards. And since we are following those standards and we are telling Kenyans the truth, I  stand here  to speak about only one truth which hon.  Members know but are pretending not to know. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I am speaking about cost-sharing. The fact of the matter is that the level of social services which Kenya has attained, whether  in  terms of education or health,  cannot continue to be financed from the general  Exchequer revenue. Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,we are spending another 11 per cent  of the budget.  So,  all in all,  we are spending 51 per centof  the  estimated budget  on  social  services. Therefore,  Sir,  the  fact  of thematter is that  this level of social services financing   cannot be sustained from any further allocations from the budget.  If this would happen,  we would have  to cut very  severely on all the other services and this woad not   possible,  an and this is fact in life.  As we know,  economic facts do not go away,  nor do they  change  just because they  are  too ugly to  look at  or just because we  7xxiax think that  the Minister for Health can do magics to change these facts. None of these  things can change these economic  facts and therefore,  they are here  to stay. However,  Mt.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  we have two or three options. First,  we could stop the expansion of social  services so that we could, for example,  say that there will be no more expansion in education, health and so on. I would like  to say that  this option in itself is not tenable nor is it politica113 acceptable and above  all,  it cannot even be contemplated by this Nyayo Government. Therefore,  Sir,  we  have to think of another option. In Africa,  there  are countries that  announce the provision of free primary education,  but only for those who can find a classroom.  It means therefore,  those who mxxx cannot find a place. at  school,  will not get any education. However,  they may go on saying that primary education is free but only for those who can find a place in school and they go on maintaining  the  same level  of allocation to education. However, in this country,  through Harambee and other Government efforts, we haze built at least 14,300 primary schools and therefore, places are available  for primary  school education for all. We have also employed so many primary school teachers so that every month, we have to pay more than Shs.500 million for  teachers  salaries.   Therefore,  those options that are being taken   elsewhere in Africa, have been rejected in Kenya because we prefer to tell the people the truth and this  truth,  Sir is:  we must  struggle much harder.   This is because when we talk about heavier taxation,  we must think about the plight of the taxpayers.   :  For example,  we cannot tax our people heavier than we are doing at the moment but we-might  eventually kill the  goose that  lays the golden eggs  so that finally you have no  egg or the  goose,  and you will have nothing to eat. So,  there is a limit  to the  level of taxation and I am glad to note that we are not  there yet.  Therefore,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,  is for  those reasons that the  Government had to consider to tell the people the truth, namely that the level  of  social  services can only be sustained by some contribution from the beneficiaries.  Sir, we have to continue to tell our people this truth, and if we do not,  we  shall not be worthy of having been elected to this House. I am saying this because we have been elected to this Eouse to tell the people in Kenya the truth clearly,  calmly and without pretence. Therefore,  Sir,  cost-sharing for social  services is one of those things that have become a fact  of life in Kenya and it  is going to continue to be  so and the  sooner we learn  to live with it  and to  love  it,  the better.  I am saying  this because  it  is the reality  and we cannot do anything about it and therefore,  the  sooner we get used to it the better because eventually,  we shall get used to it  confortable. Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  all we are  talking about is the  money we raised from the people  in the form of taxation,  and  saying that this money should be used to benefit  the people.What  we are  doing  at  the moment is    to  set up proper committees for schools and health services to supervise and be responsible for these  services and these committees will be Questionable by the people  in the  region where they operate. This is what  I want  to  say about cost-sharing. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  the second point which I would like  to make is that I personally am very pleased with the announcement  that  in order to encourage investment in this country, we will now be giving a ten-year tax holiday to any investor in this country.  This really shows that  we are very serious when we tell  an investor,  be he a Kenyan or a foreigner, that if by investing in Kenya he creates employment  for our people  or even more important  if by investing in Kenya he manufactures goods for export thereby earning this country  some foreign exchange,we shall give him a ten-year     tax holiday.   This would allow the investor to have enough time to write off  all his capital and beginning earning a fat Trofit. Even after that ten year tax holiday,  the investor will  still have another ten years during which period he would pay tax only at  the level  of 25 per cent,  which again is very low. So,  the  investor will  altogether have 20 years during which to  realize,  not only his capital,  but all the profits that he would get.  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  this is probably one of the most  important dmt budgets that  we have had for a very long time and it  shows how committed. we are in encouraging  investors both local and foreign in order  and to creat employment  in this country, and there is no  other way of creating  employment Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  there is a fund that has been set up for the  jua kali industry  Which is  doing very well.  What we need to do more than anything  else   is to emphasize that all Government  institutions starting with the  Government itself,  should resolve  to buying the jua kali products.  This is the true economic meaning of this policy which cannot succeed unless we create a demand for the jua kali products and I am pleased to not that this demand is already there and we in the Ministry of Health have already  started buying these jua kali products.  For example,  we are buying beds and beddings and other products by the  jua kali  industry,  and we  shall continue  to buy these products wherever they are available.  I am  saying  this because if we do not buy from the jua kali industry,  then we are not  serious about the jua kali becoming the main drive towards creating new opportunities for  employment. If the  jua kalis cannot  sell  what  they manufacture, then nothing of our planning for them will materialize. Therefore, the  Government and its institutions must make up their mind to buy from the jua kali people whatever they require. Finally,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I would like  to  say that  I am very grateful  that  we have been able to sustain the deficit of expenditure at below 4 per cent of the  Gross Domestic Product. What is eating  away the whole of the African Continent   is the  situation whereby some people are tempted to-spend money that is not their.  You may spend that money before you realize that it is not yours; you may have borrowed the money or manufactured it but after two or four years,  you  so are  surprised to find your money has become so useless and that nobody takes you seriously.   Under these circumstances,  the rate of inflation goes beyond manageable level. In this nation,  we must continue with good discipline because  it has been the route of everything we have achieved. If we do not continue with this. discipline,  then we  shall not be able to sustain the incentives   on the part of Kenyans. If you ask somebody to save money so as to buy something next year, you should be able to assure him that this amount  of money will be able to buy that  item next year. I am  saying this because we do not want to have a situation whereby somebody has to get a wheelbarrow to carry money just to buy his girlfriend lunch. This is what is happening in some countries in this continent of Africa,  where one has to carry so many notes in a brief case  justa to go and buy one person a lunch. Therefore, we must continue with out discipline and we therefore ask Treasury and everybody who is zinvolved not to listen to anything that we as politicians may say on this subject. We must  sustain the necessary discipline because this is the route to everything and all other things will go right if we keep that discipline. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  this has nothing to do with the  International Monetary Fund. The Africans now are only blaming the  I.M.F.  We  have  a responsibility to the Kenyans . who  elected us,  to have  an economy which makes sense; where money has meaning.That  is the  responsibility   we have to the Kenyans who elected us. It has nothing to do with the  I.M.F. Even if thewas  abolished tomorrow,  we would  still need that discipline.I beg to  support. </Newspeech>QUORUM<Newspeech>DR.  WAMEYO: On a point  of order,  Mr.  Temporary DeputySpeaker,  Sir. I wish to point  out that after that beautiful lectureon social  services,  we  have no Quorum. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr.Wabuge):Ring the Bell. </Newspeech><Newspeech>AN EON.  MEMBER:  Where were you yesterday? </Newspeech>(The  Division Bell was  rung)<Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER  (Mr.  Wabuge): We have a Quorum now.  Mr.  Kyonda. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  KYONDA: Thank you very much,  Mr.Temporary DeputySpeaker,  Sir,  for  allowing me to  join my colleagues  in supporting this Nbtion.First  of all I would like  to  start  by thanking the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for the beautiful Budget he presented to Parliament.   The proposals spelt  outin the Budget  are  quite relevant to the development  of this  country. The main theme  of this years Budget is to enhance economic  growth through  export promotion.   We need to  ehnanreour  economic  growth through increased exports. This means that  wehave to produce goods that can be sold in the world market. I am therefore appealing to our industrialists to advantage of the   provisions made  by the  Vice,President and minister for Finance: The Vice-President  and Minister for Finance has made a beautiful thing to  encourage  investors  in this  country,  whether foreign or local. We are  particularly  encouraged to  know that  there  is  a team of investors from Japan which is  currently visiting this country. They aresurveying investment  possibilities. Maybe this  has  come  about  asa result  of the Budget  proposals. Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  there has been a tendency  amongst  our people to  feel that  goods that  areproduced locally are  not  as  good as products which come  from outside of this country.   However,  whereas we would like to discourage this kind  of feeling,  I would like to  say that  it  is  true that  someof the products produced  in this  country are  of a low quality.An example  are  the volleyballs  that  are produced locally;  some  of the burst  In  mid air when they  are  hit  during a volleyballgame. I  am therefore  appealling to  our manufacturers to makesure  that they produce  goods that can compete with othergoods  in the  mnrknt. Even our Jun Kali  entrepreneurs  should takeadvantage  of the  current  situation. They must  realize  that they haveto be  competitive.  They milst produce  goods that  can sell,  not  onlyhere  but  also  outside. We  should not rely entirely  on agriculturealthough it  is the  mainstay  of our economy. But  I do not believe  thatthings are  going to  charge  over-night  and  for many years will continue to depend  on our agricultural products  for our economic growth. In this regard,  I would like  to lament the  fact that we have to import cotton from Tanzania and probably from other countries. There is also an outcry about  our coffee  and tea. I would like  to appeal to thoseconcerned to make  sure that everything possible is done to alleviatethese problems.  I am aware  that we  cannot  control the prices  ofthese  commodities which are dictated by conditions prevailing in the world market.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir, although there  areproblems which are beyond  our control,  it is also  sad to note  that things  are  not properly  streamlined here at home. Farmers hereface  some  difficulties. Since  we  all agree  that we  cannot changeeverything  over-night,  I would  appeal to the  officers concerned to  streamline  these matters  so that  farmers who depend  on cotton, tea,  coffee  and horticultural products do not make losses. They should be  encouraged to  continue with agricultural activities. Horticulture  is  also  a foreign exchange  earner and  I think this needs to be  looked  into very,  very carefully so that  the  industry is improved. This  is  because  it  is  possible to  expand  our horticultural production in this  country. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  with regard to health, our hospital at Makueni  is  in a pathetic  situation. Transport  in that  hospital is very,  very  scarce. The hospitals has  inadequate facilities  and  a lot  of improvement  is needed. It has been said  that cost-sharing in health is there to stay. But we  know that  theGovernment  has taken certain responsibilities. We would like  toappeal to  those  concerned to make  sure that  our medicalfacilities and  other things  are  improved. There  has been a lot  oftalk about  shortages  of drugs  purl  this  is  a great  concern for the common mwananchi: I would  also like to raise  an issue regarding a vehiclethat has been purchased to  serve Matiliku Health Centre. A newLand Rover which was  supposed to be  sent to Matiliku Health Centre has not yet  been delivered to that institution. The Minister for Health should look into this matter and tell us what has happened.In Kitise  Health Centre we have no clinical officer and the  Government should help us.  Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, the  Vice-President  andMinister for Finance, in his Budget  Speech,  told us: "Our planningprocess  priority  on rural development programmms  andprovision of such basic  services  as  education" So,  these  are  someof the  things we  are  talking about which need to be looked into. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  turning again to the Ministry of Health,  I think our concern has been to uplift the health standard  of  our people.  I  am now thinking, of the National Hospital  Insurance  Fund  (N.H.I.F.)  contribution which has been sg raised.  You will find that  somebody who  is  earning .  KSh.1,000/-has  to  pay KSh.30/- instead  of old rate  of KSh.20/, per month. I think the Minister has  to look into  this matter.  I  do  not think somebody who  is  earning KSh.1,000/- per month can go  and be  hospitalised in an expensive hospital  like  Aga Khan,  Nairobi, Nairobi  Hospital  and  so  on. So,  it  seems  that  these people  end up by not benefiting at  all from the  contributions they make to the N.H.I.F. There  are  very many people working who are earning KSh.1,000/-  and making this  contribution but  are  not benefiting from the  fund. Therefore,  I would like  to  suggest that people who  do  not  earn more  than KSh.2,000/-  should not  contribute  to the  N.H.I.F.  because  they do  not  stand to  benefit  at  all. Talking about  the  ordinary mwananchi,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  again,  I would  like  to  think  of  some  of  our small  business  people  buying maize  and reselling it to  the National Cereals  and Produce  Board. I understand  that the  Board has  a standard cnarge  of KSh.l0/- per bag,  regardless of where  that maize  comes  from. I think this is unfair because  some  people collect  their maize  from,  say, 50 kilometres  away from the  nearest store  by the Board,  or even more  than that. So,  if there  is  a standard charge,  I think it is not fair because the  owner of the Vehicle  will charge vs per kilometre-or distance  covered. The person carrying out  this  business,  therefore,  will be  the  loser. So,  the  buyer passes  on this  charge to  the  farmer.  With those  few remarks,  I beg to  support. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT  (Mr.Mweu): Asante sana, Bw.Naibuu Spika wa Muda,  kwa kunipatia nafasi hii. kwa kirefu kuhusu malrisio ya mwaka huu. Laklni ninzetake  kusema mqeno mawili  au matatu kuhusu makisio haya.  La kwanza,  baada ya  kumshukuru Tgpkamu-Rais na pt Waziri wa Fedha kwa makisio mazuri, kama vile  inavyosemekana,  nataka kusema kwamba ni matumaini  yang kwamba kushusha bei  ya speed governors ilitywa na mPana kwamba yale magari makubwa kama malori  atbayo hubebia changarawe, nabas na kadhalika,  yatakuua ni lazima yawekwe  speed governors, kwa sababu bei  imekuwa ni  ya chi ni  sanaili mwendo ua magari  haya upunguzwe. Hii  ni kwa sababu nchi  hii  ya Kenya imewapoteZa watuwengi  kupitia vifo vya barabarani. ni  jatbo  ambalo  tunaweza kulizuia kua kuweka vyombo hivi  vya kuzuia mwendo wa kasi. Madereva wengine  wanayaendesha magari  kwa mwendo wa kasi  sana, na kwa sababu hii wnresababisha vifo vya watu wengi  sana. Nikwa sababu hii natal ca kuse ma kwamba kazi ichukuliwe  kwa harakaiwezekanavyo  iii mpgari  haya yawekue  speed governors  ili  tuweze kuzuia mbio  za kasi  na pia tuweze  kuzuia vifo  anbavyo  pengine havingetokea karip  magari  yangekuwa ya,riendeshwa mwendo wa kiasi.  Jambo  la pili,  ningependa kusema kuhusu barabara . shaka tunajua kwamba mvua ifinyesha sana k "na vile  ilivyofanya juzi  na  sehemu nyingine  za mteremko,  ni  lazima barabara ni  kweli  kwamba ziharibike.

The majority of these people depend on co-operative societies.   In my view, it is very important that we help our rural people by informing them of the  1;0 benefits of co-operative societies and also how best to improve the management of these societies.   At the moment in Nyeri where I come from, we have a problem of open corruptton of members of the management committee who conspire withmerchant communities who are not indigenous Kenyans to hike prices of various items needed by the society.   Sometimes they increase the normal prices two or four times.We, in this House, decided to support indigenisation of the economy, but these fellows go to non-indigenous traders and make arrangements on how to defraud the same people who elected them into the management committee.   I would like to urge the the Minister for Co-operative Development to review the Co-operative Act to put a check on such corrupt tendencies. There is also need to help self-help groups in the country, particularly those run by women because they seem to be more honest than their menfolk. They should be helped to   improve their management so that they can buy properties in towns like Nairobi, Thika, Kisumu and in other towns.   This is because properties are better assets than any other things.   Once they own such properties, they would be able to earn some income monthly from rents.   Properties are not like coffee or any other agricultural crops which are Aroneato diseases. A house in Nairobi owned by a society would bring in income every year without problems.   Such an income is very desirable because it augments the little "income derived from the agricultural crops in the rural areas.  Since the popular.  population  is  ever  increasing while land does not,  the  little land that one  has  has  to be  shared equally among his  children. This  is  the  same land,that will  have to be  shared by one's grandchildren.  In the end, this piece of land will  not be  able  to  sustain all  these people. So, it  is-for this  reason that I  have been advocating for the  formation of co-operative societies and the improvement of the  existing ones. There  is no way  we  can  compete With-superrich business  community-unless  we  organise  ourselves  in co-operative societiesboth  in  the  rural  and  urban areas. We  should have  agricultural,  industrialand  commercial  co-operative  societies. If we  did  that,  then we  dould  deliberateour people  from  poverty.  Through co-operative  societies and  fair  competition,we  will  not  be  accused  of being aggressive  to  some people. If we  do  not  encourage and help  the  co-operative  movement,  we  are going to  face  difficult  times  in the  not  so  distant  future. Through  industrial,  commercial  and  agricultural co-operative  societies,  we  can  provide  employment  to our young people  who are unemployed. Mr.  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  also  like  to  congratulate His  Excellency  the  President  for the Nyayo  Pioneer Cars,  the  drug  Kemron and' many  other  inventions  which  are  going to boost our  economy.  With  these  few words,   I  beg  to  support. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr.  Gachui): Thank you,Sir for giving me the opportunity to  contribute on the Financial Statement which was read by the Vice-President and Minister for Finance.  I would like  to congratulate him for the good Budget he presented for the year  1990/91. In the management of the finances of this country, I would like  to request the Vice-President and Minister for Finance  to  consider  the role of   interest   rate in production. In this country,  interest rates are a major factor ofproduction   as is  the  case  in most economies. It  is a major factor in thepricing   of our various products. We have  to be successful in promotingexports and raising levels of employment. In order to do this, we need to reduce interest rates   so that we can create expansion in various sectors of industry. Interest rates have hampered major growth in housing.  In our 1990/93 Development Plan,  there are  targets for housing in this country and mortgage rates are  so high that  it  is not possible for an ordinary mwananchi, particularly   a town dweller,to own a house  because  the rate of payment is much higher than the rental  income  arising therefrom. There  is,  therefore, need to consider control of interest rates so that housing can become a major item to be   afforded by the  ordinary mwananchi both in the rural as well as urban sector. It is also important,  in terms of interest rates, as a factor of production,  to consider its role in raising levels   of tail inflation. For example,  when a manufacturer in any sector has to borrow at a high rate of interest,  the prices of the products that he produces inevitably carry a  f: major portion of that interest rate.  Therefore,  the   pricing structure has a bearing   on the interest rate.  We hope  that the Vice-President and Minister for Finance will  consider areas   of controlled and selected levels of interest rattso that he  can be able to succeed in various   set targets for this economy.  We appreciate the fact that unemployment is a major problem inthis  country for  our young people. In order to be able to meet the demandon employment,  we have  to encourage  investment. What  the  Government  isdoing is encouraging, indeed, and we  thank it very much. According to  thisBudget,  it is stated that there  is going to be tax relief on industrialists who invest  in the rural areas where most  of our people live. Therefore, it will enable the unemployed within the rural sector to find employment in new industries. In order  to enable  the  industries to succeed,  infrastructure  is important,  such as,  electricity. Rural  electrification is  on-going   and we would like  to  congratulate the Minister for Energy for the efforts he has made  in this field. Even with that effort,  Sir,  there  is need to intensify rural electrification not only as a means of Promoting further growth in the rural areas but more particularly   as an essential  infrastructure for encouraging growth and development.  For example, electricity is a major factor for the promotion of jua kali sector in  the rural  areas. For instance,  pre-fabricationof steel reinforcement  of various requirements for rural development   can beobtained and developed within the rural sector.I  would also like  to mention the other infrastructure which isessential for rural growth and development. This is mainly the provision  ofproper roads. Currently, roads  in the whole country have become ahinderance in growth. I will emphasize on  the  losses incurred in themaintenance of vehicles in form of spare parts and foreign exchange. Thismoney is colossal and it  should  instead be used for the promotion of further expansion in other   sectors. By maintaining roads,  we will be able to gain foreign exchange which we will need in other areas of growth. When considering the amount of cess that is deducted from coffee and tea farmers,  I would urge the Minister for Public Works to ensure that these funds are utilized to improved and develop road structures within those areas.  I say so because during the rainy season, tea is not able  to reach thefactories due to-poor roads. I  am sure  if the cess money were used adequately,it would not be difficult to keep the roads under all-weather conditions. In this regard,  I would urge  the Minister for Local  Government to quickly authorise  the county councils which  are holding the cess,  to purchase the required equipment  so that the roads can be maintained.  A number  of times,  the county councils indidate that they have not obtained authority to purchase graders and other subsidiary eauipment for road maintenance.  I would urge  the Minister for Local Government to do so as a matter  of urgency. Recently, the Minister for Health confirmed that a healthynation is an important factor in development. I would,therefore,  urge himto open up more  outlets of cost-sharing.  For example,  there  is a health centre worth millions of shillings in my constituency that was completed more than 12 years ago buthas been lying unused. All  that we are asking is  to be provided withpersonnel  so that  it  can be utilized and become another source of Appropriation. In-Aid   for the purpose of Cost-sharing. Agriculture is also a major employer in this country. It is important that a major support be maintained within the agricultural sector so that  the products that are produced from wheat,  tea,  coffee and Pyrethrum are able to reach the market because they are our source of foreign exchange. In this regard,  I would request  the Minister ccncerned to pay mgmi special attention because by providing   proper roads for easy access for  our  crops from and to-the market, we shall provide this country with foreign exchange  as well as encouraging the  farmers  to grow more.  Horticulture  is a major area of growth for the future particularly for export. In this area,  the Pricing of horticultural produce is basicallya field where   transport and access   to the market  take a major role.We are happy to see that  this Budget provided for  duty concession on packagingfor horticulture. This goes a long way in enabling our farmers to export high quality products.  I wouldd like to take this opportunity to also appeal to the farmers to put greater effort in promoting high quality production so that our products, such as, tea, coffee, horticulture as well as livestock can be competitive. In recognition of all the work that we are doing in this country, we  should not   fail to give special thank and congratulate the 1 President because it is   his leadership which has provided the stabilitythat this-nation needs for its   development.  The peace,  stability and onenessthat  exist  in this country,  is what has enabled this country to develop invarious sectors,  such as,  agricultural,  industrial, manufacturing and othersthat  come  to bear on the whole economy.In conclusion,  I would like  to reauest the Vice-President andMinister for Finance to create a policy that will open up new  areasof revenue for the Budget. By so doing, he will promote greater investmentand there will be more taxation and revenue and reduced deficits within theBudget programmeThank you,  Sir. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>M.R.

I  say  this  with  clear  appreciation  of the  fact that  this  year's  Budget was  one  of the  earliest  in the history of the House. What was  very encouraging,  too,  was  that we had had a very good track record. A review of  the  past  five  years  indicated that we had enjoyed a steady growth, which  was  a culmination of the  play of economic  forces. I  think  it  is  very clear  to  each  one  of us  here  that without the peace  and stability that have been  ensured by His  Excellency  the President,  we would not have anything to be proud of today.The  current  Budget  is  the  boldest  in  terms  of export promotionand orientation .of this  economy,  and those of us  in the Ministry of Industrymight be  excused  if we have  seen the Budget as what our Ministry has beenwanting for some  time now. I  would say without any hesitation that the various  incentives  that  investors  have  been  asking  for have now been  included in  the  Budget. Investors have been  telling us  that such  incentives are given in  certain  countries,  and  I  think  the  Office  of the  Vice-President  and Ministry of Finance  has  at  last given  them all  that they  have  asked for. Therefore,   it is  now  the  investors  turn to  prove  their  seriousness  because,  as you know,  it is  one  thing  to  provide  incentives  and  quite  another  for  these  incentives  to be  seized  and  translated  into viable  economic ventures. This  is  what we  would like  to  appeal  to  investors  to  do now because  there  is no  other reason under the  sun  for  investors  to  wait  for  more  incentives  as  the  ones  that have been given  are  far  too  generous. With  entrepreneural  talents  and  financial resources,  we  should be  able  to  see more  factories  coming up mainly  to  feed export  markets,  thereby  utilising more  of our  agricultural  produce.  We  would not  like  to  see  our  export  business  being dominated by  a foreign  group.  Therefore,  it  is  important  for  us,  as  hon.  Members,  to  ask ourselves  whether we  are  helping wananchi  to  take  advantage  of these  generous incentives. It  would  be  very  good  if we  found  indigenous  people  carrying out business  that  earns  foreign  exchange  in  the  new  Export  Promotion  Zone  that  is being  established  in  Athi  River  and Mombasa. It would  not  be  enough  to mention  export  incentives without mentioning  the  financial  market  that  is  supposed  to  support our  industries. With  the  establishment  of the  Capital  Market  Development Authority and  the other  financial  instruments  that have been set  in motion,  we  should be  able  to mobilise  resources  to  set up  industries  and thereby  fulfil  our goal  of providing employment and export earnings which will  further  improve our balance of payments  position. There have  been one or two observations  made  after the Budget was read and approved.  Yesterday,  for  instance,  we  approved a portion of the provisions  of the  Budget  to be used straightaway by our Ministries,  come  1st July, 1990.-  The  experience  in rural areas has been  that money is  delayed for quite  long because  perhaps  the  famous Usideradswef authority to incur expenditure  does  not  seem  to  reach  districts  in  time.   As  a result,  delays  are  experienced in  implementing projects. I  would urge  that a more  efficient method be  found so  that,  instead of giving out money twice  in one  Financial year,  the money  is given  out more  regularly,  say  quarterly  or even months,  so  that development  is not  delayed. Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  there  is  also  the problem of credit  squeeze. When wananchi  go  to banks  these  days,  they are  told that thereis  no  money. Maybe  a way can be  found of making available  especially  to  theagricultural  and rural  sectors.  We  know  that  the  Treasury  is  fighting  inflation, but  we  would  urge  that  this  fight not be  at  the  expense  of viable  small-scale developments. So,  we  would  wish  the  Ministry  concerned  to  do  something about those  few problems  that  come  up  in  the  implementation  of an otherwise  good Budget. If there  is  anything else  that  should be  said,  we  will  say  it when it  comes  to  the  discussion  of  individual  Ministerial  Votes.  In  any  case,  I would  like  to  very  sincerely  thank  all  those  who  are  responsible  for giving us a  very  excellent  timely  Budget. We  had  been  used  receiving  Budget  Speeches around 15th June,  but,  as  you  can  see  that  we  are  now  almost reaching  the conclusion  of our  discussion  of the  current Budget  Speech.  With  these  few  remarks,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I  beg  to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  A.H.O.  MOMANYI:  Thank you,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir, for giving me  this  chance to contribute  to  the  Budget  that was presented by  the Vice-President and Minister  for Finance. The  Budget was  good and for  all wananchi,  and we  believe  that there will be no  "mini-budgets".  Talking  about  the  state  of our roads,  I  wouldlike  to say that between Nyamira and Kericho,  there  is one common road that  is not tarmacked, that  is,  the  Kisii-Chemosit Road. This  road was  started some 10 years  ago,and it  is very  important  in transportation. The  road was  started in 1979,  butup  to  now,  its  tarmacking has not materialised. This  road connects  threedistricts,  that  is,  Kericho,  Nyamira and Kisii. This  is  the  worst  road  I  have ever seen  in this country. The people who do  theirbusinesses  between  Kisii  and Nyamira districts  cannot use  the road and  thier. businesses  have  come  to  a standstill. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  we produce a lot of tea in Kitutu Masaba but,  unfortunately,  these days our  tea leaves cannot get to the factories due to poor roads. Another road which  leads  from Mesamaywa-Gesima to Mosoget is  impassable  and matatu operators have  taken  that advantage and are charging KShs.6/-  instead  of  the  old  fare of KShs.4/-. I  am  requesting  the Ministry of Public  Works  to do  something urgently  so  that  the farmers  in  this area can move their  tea leaves  to  the  factories. The  road  from Magombo  through Keroka is  alsoimpassable,  and  the  Ministry  concerned  should do  something  about  it. You  findthat  the  road  leading from Magombo  to Nyamira  is  so  bad  that  transport between those  two  centres  has  been very  much  inconvenienced. Mr.  Temporary  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,   the  roads  that have  been approved-by  the  local  district  development  committee  should  be  given  priority  by  the  Ministry. We  have  a road maintenance  unit  camped  at Magombo  but  the  personnel  cannot  be deployed  because  of lack  of murram  and other materials  necessary  for  road repair. All  in  all,  we  are  even  lacking  tippers  to  transport  the  murram. Therefore,  the Ministry  of Public Works  should assist us  by repairing  the  roads  so  that farm produce  can  be  transported  to  the market  easily. Sir,   I  would  also  like  to  call  upon  the Ministry  of Public  Works  to draw  a yellow  line on  the  road  from Kisii  to Sotik. The  road has  no  bumps  orroad  signs,  and  it  is dangerous  to  drive  al  ong  it. Last year  I  was promised  thatthe  road would be  taken care of but up  to now nothing has been done. Turning  to  the Ministry of Education,  I would like  to point out that the. old Kisii District was divided  into  two districts,  namely,  Kisii and Nyamira districts. At  the  time  of dividing  the  district,  all good  schools  such as Kisii School,  Mosocho,  Sameta and others were  taken to the new Kisii District,  leaving the  new  Nyamira District without any good schools.  The  students who sat for their  Kenya  Certificate primary of Education Examination were not  allowed  to  choose  the good schools  in Kisii  District  despite  the  fact  that  there  are  no Government-aided schools  in  Nyamira District. So,  we  propose  that  schools  such  as  Nyansiongo, Nyamaya,  Egekano,  Sironga and Ogasi  be  upgraded so  that  students  from Nyamira District  can be  admitted  there. This year we  have  about 9,000  candidates  who are  going  to  sit  for  their Kenya Certificate  of Primary Education Examination, and  the  parents  in Nyamira District  fear  that  the students will not get good schools  in  other districts  if  the  local  ones  are  not going  to be upgraded. Most of  the  schools we have  are young and  lack  the  essential  facilities such as  laboratories,  we  we would  like them upgraded so  that our childfen can also get better schools. Turning  to  the Ministry  of Health,  I want  to point out  to  the Minister that  there were  some vehicles which were  taken away from Keroka Health Centre to Kisii  District. It was  said  that  these vehicles  could not be maintained by Manga Health Centre because  the road was bad,  and we were also told that the vehi-cles  were  taken  to Thika for repair. Since 1988  up  to now  the vehicles have notbeen  taken back  to  their bases. Since  it  is  not possible  to  transport urgentcases  from Manga to Nyamira or to Kisii hospitals, we would like  these vehicles returned  so  that  they can assist during emergencies. And  since  the  telephone  in Manga  does  not work  at night,  we would like  the Minister for Health to assist us by returning  these vehicles so  that emergencies at night can be taken care of. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  we have sometimes been missing drugs in various health centres  in my constituency. You  find  that drugs last for only three  to  four weeks after delivery and then patients are told to go and buy drugs from  chemists. We would kindly request the Ministry to ensure adequate supply of drugs  to  these  centres so that the wananchi who live there do not encounter problems of  this nature. Talking about parastatal organisations,  I would like  to touch on Kenya Airways.  This year Kenya Airways laid off about 2,000people.  We know  that we  do not  have  many  employment opportunities  in  this  country. Maybe,  those peoplewho were  laid of by Kenya Airways had served  the  company  for periods ranging from three  to 20 years,  and we know  some  of them have children  to be  taken to school and other  family  affairs.  Other parastatal  organisations  such as Kenya Posts and 70 Telecommunications  Corporatio,  the Kenya Ports Authority,  Kenya Power and Lighting Company  Ltd.  and others have been doing very well  in  the direction of creating employment opportunities  for Kenyans  and  I  do not see why Kenya Airways cannot follow  their example. With  those  few remarks,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I  beg to support the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  CHEPKOK:  Ahsante  sana,  Bw.  Naibu Spika wa Muda,  kwa kunipatia nafasi hii  iii  nami  niungane na Waheshimiwa Wabunge wenzangu kuzungumza juu ya hotuba iliyo tolewa na Makamu wa Rais na Waziri wa Fedha wakati alipowasilisha Bajeti ya mwaka huu. Kama hakuna usalama katika nchi,  hakuna kitu kinachoweza kufanyika. Hii  ndiyo sababu ninamshukuru Mtukufu Rais kwa njia ambayo anaiongoza nchi hii.  Yeye  ni  Rais na baba wa Kenya na anastahili kuheshimiwa parnoja na Serikali yake tukufu. Bw.  Naibu  Spika wa Muda,  Bajeti ya mwaka huu  ilikuwa nzuri sana.  Kile kitu kinachohitajika kufanywa ni wenye viwanda kutoa bidhaa za maana zinazoweza kushindana, katika soko la ulimwengu  iii  tupate pesa za kigeni kwa wingi. Wenye viwanda ni  lazima watengeneze bidhaa nzuri  iii Kenya ipate pesa za kigeni ambazo tunahitaji.  Bw.  Naibu Spika wa   uda,  jambo la pili  aMbalo ningetaka kuzungumzia, linahusu bei ya-mbolea.Tungetaka Serikali yetu tukufV itusaidieTkwa kutoa msaada. wa nyongeza,  yaani  subsidy,  kwa bei ya mbolea iii wakulima waweza kupata mbolea hii kwabei ya chini. Jambo hill  litawatia moyo wakulima ili wawezekutoa mazao zaidi ya kuwalisha wananchi wa Kenya.   Nasema hivyo  sababu hakuna haja hata kidogo ya kuagiza chakulalkutoka hgambo. Kwa wakati huu  tunaagiza kiasi kikubwa zaidi cha ngano kutoka ng'ambo kuliko kile kiasi tunachotoa hapa nchini. Kama wakulima wangepata mbolea kwa bei nafuu,  wangeweza kupanda ngano kwa wingi ili kuweze kuyatosheleza mahitaji yetu hapa Kenya.Hii ndiyo sababu ninaiomba Serikali yetu tukufu itoe  siibsidy kwa bei ya mbolea ili wananchi waweze kukuza ngano kwa wingi  zaidi  iii  tusiendelee kutumia pesa zetu za kigeni kwa kununua ngano kutoka hglambo. Jambo lingine linahusu kile kiwanda cha mbolea ambacho kilijengwa kule Mombasa.  Tangu kiwanda hiki kilipojengwa,  hakijaanza kufanya kazi,  na pesa nyingi  sang zilitumiwa kwa kujenga kiwanda hiki.  Kama kiwanda hiki kinekuwa kikdtengeneza mbolea,  hatungekuwa tukitamia pesa nyingi kwa knlAgiza mbolea kutoka ngambo.   Ningetaka kuiornba Serikali  ihakikishe kwamba kiwanda hiki kinaanza m kufanya kazi.  Vile vile,  kuna viIianda vingine  amba vo   vilianzishwa  kuanzisha lakini hasijaanza kufanya kazi. Ningetaka Serikali ifikirie Viwanda hivi pia. Bw. Naibu Spika wa Lluda,  hakuna haja ya fitina katika Kenya Badala ya kuendelea na mambo ya fitina,  ingefaa kama watu wengine wangeshirikiana na. Serikali  ili lar eza kuendesha k Kenya hii.   Katika magazeti ya jana, ilisemekana kwamba kuna mtu anayeitwa Mukaru athbaye anasema kwamba anataka kuanzisha chama chake  cha kisiasa kale Sweden. Huyu mtu alitoroka hapa Kenyakwa kubebwa ndani ya boot ya gari kama mzigo. Hata wale waliomsaidia ni wajingaau wenda wazimu. Hakuna haja ya kuzungumza juu ya mtu kama huyu kwa sababuyeye  si mtu wa maana hata kidogo.  Ikiwa yeye alibebwa ndani ya, boot ya gail kama mzigo, yeye ana maana gani?   Tungetaka kujua ni s iku gani atakapoingia hapa Kenya. Huyu ni  mtoro na hakuna mtu yeyote katika Kenya ambaye ana hajaya kuzungumza juu ya mtu kama huyu. Ikiwa yeye anataka kuanzisha chama chakecha kisiasa,  achana nave afanye bivyo. Sisi tumapitiSha  kwa kauli  moja kwamba tutaendelea kukiunga mkono chama chetu cha Kanu na hatuna haja tena ya kuzurgumza juu ya vyaca viwili vya kisiasa katika Kenya.

Naibu Spika wa Muda ill nizungumze  juu ya Hoja iliyo mbele yetu. Kwanza,  ningetaka lauwpongie-a Makamu-Rais na Waziri wa Fedha kwa njia ambayo alitengeneza Bajeti ya Mwaka huu. Ingawa ninaiunga mkono Bajeti hii, ningetaka kusema cachache juu yake.   Katika nchi yetu,  kuna vitu vingi  ambavyo  tunakuza na kwa hivyo,  hatupaswi kuagizi vitu hivyo kutoka ng'ambo. Kwa mfano,  tunatumia pesa nyingi za kigeni kwakununua ngano aina nyingine ya vyakula kutoka ng'aMbo. Kwa wakati huu,  tunapanda ngano katika nchi hii,  lakini tunavuna kiasi kidogo sana.  Eli  ni kwa sababu wakati Mtukufu Rais anapoongeza bei ya nano kwa wakulima,  wale wanaotuuzia dawa za kuwaua kwekwe na waduiu wengine,  pia wanaongeza bei ya dawa hizo. Eivyo ni kusema mkulima lamxx hawezi kupata faida ya kutosha.   Kwa hivyo, ni lazima njia ya kuwasaidia wakulima wa ngano itafutwe iii waweza kukuza ngano ya kutosha. Bw.NaibuSpika wa Mudat Utaanoa  tumefanikiwa kuua na mvua ya kutosha.  Wakulima  walipanda ngano na mahindi lakes ni  utaona kuamba kuyavuna mazao hayo imekuwa ni  shida.   Niremshukuru Maenyezi MUngu kaa kutupa mvua ya kutosha lakinitulikabiliwa na shida wakati wa kuvuna mazao yetu. Utaona kuambarehindi na ngano , vilianza kuota slinmbani kutokana na mvua nyingiambayo  ilinyesha. Kwa hivyo mazao hayo hayakuweza kununuliwa maNationP1   Cereals  anti  Produce Board kwa sababu yalikuwayameharibika. Mazao hayo yelikuwa hayafai  kua werPdamu Bali yalikuwayanafaa kwa chakula cha mifugo. Hilo  i  jambo ambalo limewavunjamoyo wakulima. Pia inajulikana wazi kwamba wakinima huwa wamekopapesa kutoka kwa A.F.C.  na Kwa hivyo utaona kwambawakulima welciyapeleka mazao hayo kwa   N.C.P.B.  wao huambiwa kwamba hicho ni  chakula cha mifugo.na vile  vile  waldwapelekea wale wareotengeneza vyakula vya mifUgo huambiwa  chakUlahicho bPk-iwezi kununuliwa kwa bei irlayostahili nawakulima hao huwa wametumia kiasi kikubwa cha pesa. Mambo  hayayanawavunja moyo wakulima ni  kwa sababu wao hubpna madeni  makubwa   Mkulima hawezi kusamehewa madeni yake hata kutokan na kwa mazao na mvua. Ni lazima mkulima alipe  madeniyake. na matatizo  haya utaona kwamba wakulima wengiwameacha kukuza ngano na hasa katika eneo la Molo ambako kulikuwakunakuzwa.ngano kwa wingi.Ni watu wachache  kwa waptihuu ambao wamekuza ngano.Kwa hivyo ni lazima Serilc itafute njiaza kuwasaidia wakulima katika sehemu. kaina hizo. Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda,  hapo  awali tulikuwa na ulempango wa Guaranteed Yinimum Returns  au G.M.R. mini yamDango huo kulikawa na bima  ya mazao.

Tusipowasaidia wakulima wao watazilegeza  juhudi  zao  katika kilimo na mgishowe  tutaanza kuagi za chakula kutoka nggambo. Kwa hivyo yafaa maofisa wa kilino wajaribu kugatembelea wakulima wetu na kujua ni matatizo  gani yanayowakabili wakulima. Hilo  litakuwa  jambo la maana.Bw.

I also want to say That under His Excellency the president’s leadership Daniel Toroitich asap Moi,  we  are  assured  of  stability Which  is very important for our welfareand  development. For that reason,  no  one  else should dream ofleading us while  he   is stii1alive, leave  alone  the  other two are  disqualified by  number of other reasons  that we  know. If someone  has  over  400  plots acquired illegally I do not think anybody in Kenya  would vote  for even  if he  were  given a chance  to line WOwith His  Excellency the  President. Sir,  on the  Question of  budget,  it  is  fair that we  should discuss matters  of importance. For instance, in as  fan as  our country is  concerned,  we  should  discuss  the  question of unemployment. I think the most  important problem of this country, is unemployment,  in which case  we must  be  thinking of how to  increase investment  in  our country. It  is  only through very rapid  investment that we  can solve  the  problem of unemployment. One  veryimportant  factor in attracting investment  is the  question of labour His  Excellency  the President  has  already initiated the university project  or the  increase  of universities which has  given a lot of young trained  labour who  should attract  investors  from all overthe  world. We  have  people  and  labour attracts  investment. His:Excellency  the President  should be  congratulated  for having initiated the  question of universities  expansion.  Trained labour is  a very important factor   when it  comes to the question of investment. Mr.   Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,   now that  we have enough trained manpower,  let  the  external  investors  know that we  have many  people  who  are  well  trained,from  our  universities,  and therefore,  they  should invest heavily  in our  country.  The other  factor  that  is  important  to  investors  is  natural  resources. I  would  like  to  request  the Ministers  for  Environment  and  Natural Resources  and  the  Minister  for  Energy who  is  concerned with oil exploration to  put  more  efforts in looking  for  oil  deposits  in our  country, because  if  we  can  drill  our  own  oil,   that  alone  can  improve  our investments. In  fact,   it  would  also  help  in  the  creation of morejobs, increase  investment  and make industrial  developmenteasier,   since  we  shall  have  cheap  energy  for  our  industries.The  Department  of  Geology  should  do  a  lot  of  research  onour  natural  resources. I  do  not  think  that  we  have  exploitedall  our  natural  resources. There  is  iron  ore  in  Kakamega  area,but  I  do  not  know  why  investors  are  not  interested  in  it  although  it  is  in  very  small  quantities.  Sir,  there  are  very many  natural  resources  which  have  not  yet  been  exploited. Sir,   His  Excellency  the  President  should  also  be congratulated  for  the  new  Nyayo  Pioneer  cars. New  technologyis  veryi  important  for  investors. The  researchers,   intellectuals,and  the  academicians  should  not  stop  after  inventing the  Nyayo Pioneer  cars. They  should  improve  those   vehicles,  and  also come  up  with  bettqutechnology which  will  help in  increasing our investments. Sir the AIDS  drug  Kemron, is  also  a  very  important step  ahead.  Our  local  technicians  should  invent  radios  which are different  from  the  Sanyo  radios and radios of other makes.  Sir, Japan  does not  only  deal  with  Toyota  cars,  it  deals  with  other  vehicles  such  as  Mitsubishi  and  Nissan. Our  academicians,   researchersand  technicians  should  improve  their  technology to  create  employment  opportunities  for  our  youpg people. We  should  also  urgethose  with  money  to  invest  it. It  seems  as  if  our  rich  peoplejust  like  to  spend  their  money  on  importing luxury  cars. Itwould  be  better  if  we  reduced  our  expenditure  on  consumable commodities.  In  fact,   the  Vice-President  and  Minister  for  Finance should  reduce  the  importation  of  these  consumable  commodities  so that  we  could  instead  invest  that  money  to  create  more  employment  opportunities. Mr.   Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,   I  think,  we  should concentrate  more  on management  training because  this  art  is  very essential  to  any  developing  nation. This  is  because  even  when our  Jua  Kali  artisans  set  up  industries  they  will  require  good managers. I  think  we  also  need  to  establish  more  managementinstitutions  to  train  more  efficient  managers. Management  is  avery  essential  factor  of  investment  and,  thus,  it  should  be  given more  consideration  in  this  country.  The Government  should invest  in roads,  railways and communication in general. We need to communicate  in order to expand in our industrial development. The roads we have have been neglected   and some of them are doing more harm to our economy than good. For  example, potholes spoil shockabsorbers and break the chasis of a new car. In order to  take your vehicleback to the road, you will need spare parts from overseas and this is a loss. We  are now spending  our  foreign exchange,  which we could use to bring incapital goods,  on importing spare parts. This road must be given priorityand maintained in order  to prevent so many brealrages of vehicles. Since I travel home every week,  I change my vehicle's shock absorbers after every two weeks. The Ministry of Public Works should take note that these potholes are very harmful to the economy of this country. When vehicles break down,imported spare parts are used,  thus draining our foreign exchange. This  shouldbe  taken note of. If a road is  extended to an unopened area,  economicactivities will begin because communication would be  easier.  Therefore,in our development estimates, we Should,  as much as possible,  include infrastructure   such as roads.  Ne  should  invest in  things which will create more  investment.I  cannot think of any industry that  can operate without electricity and water. These  two items should be given priority because they are essential in the  expansion of our investment. With those few remarks,  I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS  (Archbishop Ondiek): Thank you,  Sir, for allowing me  to contribute on this important Motion.I must start by thanking the Vice-President and Minister for Finance forgiving the  country a most acceptable Budget.On school facilities,  the Vice-President and Minister for Financesaid that they will be acauired duty free. There are certain places wherethe prices of some school facilities,  like  science equipment,  have notbeen reduced. There are  other important items for the  8-4-4 system ofeducation,  such as  typewriters which are needed is if this system is tosucceed.   We would like the Ministry of Education to tell us the methodthat  is used in the provision of facilities in public schools. This isbecauseLwere made to understand that all schools will be public   as fromthe beginning of 1990,  and that parents will only be responsible for theProvision of physical facilities. Unfortunately,  facilities such aslaboratories have been put up by parents but have not been eauipped up tonow.We are trying to find out how the 8-4-4 system of educationwill succeed as far as science subjects are concerned.  This  is becausebuildings meant  to be laboratories are empty as they have not been equipped. We  are  requesting the Ministry of  Education to try during this Financial year  and see  that  all the  laboratories which have been built are  fully equipped so  that  students  can do  their work without  any problems. At  the moment  there  are  schools that have  to  share laboratories with other  schools which are  far  away. At  the  same  timeit is  very  difficult  for  a student  to do his  practicals unless  his school has  a laboratory. Mr.  Temporary Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  we  Kenyans are  quite lucky to have  President  Daniel aran Our  President has  travelledall over the  country to  ensure  that  every mwananchi  is  enjoying development,  which is  the  "matunda ya Uhuru".  Sometimes  you wonder why some  people  say that nothing has been done in this country. If you compare  development in this  country between 1960  and in 1990,  you will  see  that  a lot has  been  done  in this  country. We should thank the  President  for the  work he has  done  for us.  He has  conducted Harambees  all over the  country. Despite  the fact  some  church leaders have been trying to criticise  the  President  and his Government,  last Sunday the  President  conducted a fund raising for  a church project. Sometimes  I  personally wonder why we  do  not  appreciate  the work being for us by the  President  and Government.I  feel that  our Police  Force  is  playing a big role in   maintaining security in this  country. But  sometimes  I doubt  whetherthe  funds  allocated to  the  Force  are  enough. This  is  because  thePolice  cannot move  for  lack of fuel and other facilities. The Police  should be  given enough funds  to  enable them monitor all the security problems wananchi may face in their areas.  The Ministry of  information and Broadcasting is  also playing a big role  in informing our  people.  However,  sometimes Kenya News Agency (KNA)  officials  get  stranded:  they are  unable to  travel and collect information for broadcasting; Some  districtsdo  not  even get television coverage. For  example,  in  Siaya we  do  nothave  any television coverage. This means  that  development beingdone in that  district,cannot be  seen by other Kenyans:  it can only be    read about in newspapers  and heard over the radio. I am, therefore,  requesting the Minister for  Information and Broadcasting to  ensure  that  television services  are provided in districts whore  they have  not been extended to. The  officers  should also be  given enough funds  to  enable  to  travel and cover  all  development activities  taking place  in their  areas  of  jurisdiction.  They  should  be  given  enough  funds  to  enable  them  to move  about  and cover all the  development  projects  being  carried  on within particular areas.  The  funds that  they given  at  the  moment  are  not sufficient for  the work they are  supposed to  do. If  they  are  given enough  facilities,  they will be  able  to provide the necessary  services  that  they  are  required to render within the area in question.  Turning  to  the  Ministry of Health,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir, one wonders  whether  its  officers  are  doing  their  job  or  not. When  cost-sharingwas  introduced,  it was  meant  to bring efficiency  in the Ministry. You  will  findthat  sometimes  people  to  hospital  and pay  their part  towards  cost-sharing,  but drugs  are  not  available. I  would  urge  the  Minister  for  Health  to  try  to  lookinto  this  matter  so  that people  are  availed of the  familities  they pay  for. Howcan a health  centre  that  supports  people  in  an area 25 kilometres  in radius have no  ambulance? At  least,  one  ambulance  should be  available  to  each  district,say,  Siaya. At  the  moment,  we  only  have  two  ambulances  serving  five  constituenciesmade  up  of  six  divisions. In  my  own  constituency,  which has  two  divisions,  I  donot have  even  a single  ambulance. We  lose  many  lives  without  such  facilitiesbecause  it  is  difficult  for  a patient  to reach  the  hospital  in time. So,  withall  due  respect,  I  request  the  Ministry of Health to  try to re-organise  its system  and make  these  facilities  available. The  question  of  there  being no money  does  not  arise,  because money is  available,  and  that  is  why we  are now discussing the Budget.  Looking at  the list  of Ministries  and  departments  contained  in  the Budget,  I  find that money has  been allocated  to  this Ministry of Health. So,   it  should provide  such  a necessity  as  ambulances,  without which  the Ministry cannot work efficiently. Drugs,  too,  are  a necessity and through lack of drugs,  we can  lose a lot people. I  was  recently surprised surprised when my step-mother died here  in Nairobi.  We  took her body to  the  City Mortuary and,  after only one week,  we were  required to pay mortuary charges amounting to,  at least,  Shs.5,000/=,  that is,  shs.2,500/=  for  post  mortem,  and Shs.1,500/=  for keeping the body  just  for one week. If  this  continues  to  be  the  case,  it will  be very difficult for the  ordinary  mwananchi  to  remove  a body from our hospital mortuaries. I personally feel  that  something should be  done  about this  issue because,  even though we believe  in  cost—sharing,  the cost should not be  exorbitant.  It  should rather be  nominal  cost  so  that  the  ordinary mwananchi may be able to afford it. Some  charges  sometimes  make people disturbed in the  same way I was personally disturbed. So,  I  request  the  Minister  for Local Government to  look into the question  of mortuary  charges  and do  something about it because  City Mortuary, for  example,  is  a public  utility which was built using public  funds. I, therefore,  do  not  see why such high charges should be  introduced there. With  those  few remarks,  Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to  support. </Newspeech><Header> ADJOURNMENT </Header> <Newspeech>THE  TEMPORARY DEPUTY  SPEAKER (Mr.  Wabuge): Hon.

The  amount  of  money  paid  as  down payment  was 3,000  Swiss  francs,  and not  Kshs.3,000/- Mr.   Speaker,   Sir,   after  that correction,   I   beg  to  reply. At the  request  of  Mr.  Muema  my Ministry  contacted  the Hotel  Consult  for  the  refund of  Swiss  Francs  3,000,   which  he had paid  as  down payment  for  enrolment  of  his  son  for  a diploma  course  in  Hotel  Management,  Hotel   Consult  have  accepted having received  the  money,  but  stated that  they used that money to  pay  for  processing entry formalities  into  Switzerland including Visa  for Mr. Muemas son  Mr.   Peter  Muthui. They  further  stated  thatremisor  Muthu infjrct  subsequently  took  up  the  scholarship but  later  o y bsconded  o 21st  July, 1987,  without  notifying the  relevant  authorities. In  the  circumstances,   Sir,   Hotel Consult is in  fact, counter claiming the  sum  of  Swiss  Francs 17,500  from. Mr.  Muema  as  the  balance  of  school  fees  fx  for  the remaining part  of  the  year.  Mr.  Muema,   in  fact,   is  well  aware  of that  position,   and  therefore,   it  is  very  difficult  for us to  give  him  any  assistance  at  this  stage.</Newspeech><Newspeech>M.R.  WAMBUA:  That  answer  from  the  Assistant  Minister  is not  satisfactory,  because  the  km  Hotel  Consult  is also claiming  that they  processed  the  admission  of  that  although they  never, did. So The   HotelConsult  is also claiming  that  they  bought  a  Visa  for Mr.  Muthui  so  that  he  can  join  their Hotel  for  a  course,  but  it  has  never  reached  him. Therefore,   the father,  Mr.  Muema should be  refunded  Swiss  Francs 3,000  which  is Kshs.49,543.9. Therefore, Hotel  Consult  never  processed  any  documents  for admission of  Mr.  Muthui.  The  money was  sent  to  that   Hotel,  and  that  was the  end  of the water How  come  that  the  Hotel  Consult  is  now demanding more  money  from Mr.   Muema,   instead  of  refunding Swiss  francs 3,000 Does  that  Hotel  want  to  remain  with  that  money t and create bad relationship between their Government and our Government?   They should refund that money and stop saying that they processed any documents.   I have got some correspondence here, between the Hotel Consult, our High Commission to Switzerland and Mr. Muema, which I will lay on the Table. I would like to request that Mr. Muema said refunded that money without any further explanation from that Hotel.   What  Hotel Consult has said is x untrue, and they  are cheating our Government with the aim of getting away with Mr. Muema's money.</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR. OBURE: Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I would like to make it clear that whatever traspined was a private arrangement between Mr. Muema and Hotel Consults. In fact there was an agreement which was reached between the two parties.   The position is that the Hotel Consult insisted that they processedMr. Muthuis documents for admission to that College.   In fact, he was admitted that College.   The information that I have isthat Mr. Muthui took the sholarship for a diploma course andattended for a short time and them a sconded on his own.I am further informed that in accordance with the terms of admission  once you ha e taken up a scholarship, you should fees for the whole year. If you leave college before the completionof the year, as Mr. Muthui did, you will still be requrned to pay fees for the     rest of the year.   That position which Hotel Consult hasmaintained.   Therefore, as I had said earlier.  I do not know how else we would help Mr. Muema.   If he can give us more information, we are prepared to help him.</Newspeech> e <Newspeech>MR.  WAMBUA: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  one  thing that  I  would want  theA sistant Minister  to understand  is  that this boy never  left this country for England because  the documents  that would have enabled him  to  do that were never processed by  the  Swiss  Hotel  and Catering College,  London.  The  documents  were, in  fact,  never sent to him. these  people should produce evidence that this boy ever went  to  England,  that  is,  they should produce the visa,  passport number  and  correspondence  showing that this  boy travelled to England.   This is  because  these  people  just want to get  away with this  thing. In  fact,  the £3,000   that Mr.  Muema paid  is  a lot of money. These  people  should not say  that  the  boy  went  to England when  in actual  fact he never  did.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  OBURE:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am very  surprised by  that  information because my  information  is  that Master Muema took up the  scholarship  and reported at  the  college on  19th June</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  KIILU: On  a point  of order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir. Where  do we now  stand  if the  Questioner  is  saying something that  is  quite  different  from the  replyistg that the  Assistant Minister  is giving  to the  House? The  Assistant Minister  still  insists  that Master  Muema went  to  England while  the  hon.  Member says  something which  is  contradicting that  statement. Where  do we  stand?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  SPEAKER: Let us  give  time  to  the  Assistant  Minister  to  give us  the  proper reply.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  OBURE: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  fact,  I  was  just about  to  explain that  point. The  position  is  that Master  Muema attended  a course  at  that  college for  a  short while  and  then  left  on  21st July, 1987. The. truth  of the  matter, therefore,  is  that he  took  up  that  scholarship.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  WAMBUA: Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  think  these  people.just  want  to get  away with  this  thing because-I  think the  information that the.Assistant Minster has  must have  come  from those same people. I  would  like  to  reiterate that Master Muema never left Kenya for England. The  person who wrote  that letter  cheating that he went there for a short time and then came back  is a "very  big  liar". Could this  thing be  followed? This  is  because  this boy  is  a  Kenyan  and the money  that  is  in London belongs  to him and the  country. These people,   I  think,  just want  to avoid refunding that-money. Could this  thing be followed upso that  the truth can be known? I  would  like  to repeat again that Master Muema never  left this  country  for England.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OBURE: Well,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I think we are just going round in circles. If  in  indeed  Mr.  Muema  is  absolutely sure  that his  son did not go  to  London  for this  course,  I  am prepared to accept that for now. But  I would also  like  to  invite Mr.  Muema to my office where he can give me fuller details  on  this  issue.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.  MWAMZANDI:  On  a point of order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  If the hon.  Member says  that Master Muema never  left this  country for England and the Assistant Minister says  something to the contrary,  could the Assistant Minister undertake  to give us  the proper  information? They  should send some official  from our High  Commission there to go to this  college and find out whether there  are  any records  showing that Master Muema attended a course  in that college.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.  OBURE:  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I would  like  to say clearly here now again  that  it  is  my  business  to assist  Kenyans  who have problems abroad. In  the  case  in hand,  the  Kenyan has  a problem  with  a  foreign organisation. I  undertake  and  confirm  in  this  House that I will unidecAseke to help him  solve this  problem. But according to  the  information  I  haveiwhich  is  in writing and  is  from  Hotel  Consult is that Master Muema had attended a course  there partly. If That  is  so,  then  it means  that he  was  eligible  to  forfeit  the  money that he had paid. But  since  hon.  Wambua has  just told me  that Master  Muema never  left this  country  for-England,  I am :prepared to find out the truth of that matter.

First of all would like to take this opportunity to congratulate his Excellency the President for the type of leadership that he is providing to this nation in particular and the African Continent in general.  The President has said very clearly that the  concept of democracy is not a European invention, but is rather a human necessity:  It  develops in areas where communities are governed in large numbers.Our President has clearly shown us democracy in Africa is based on our traditions in which we have always practised democracy by consensus.  It is only when Europeans came to Africa that a foreign element called “secret ballot"  which tended to confuse most of our people, was introduced into our democratic process.  Otherwise, Africans are generally democratic socialists. This is so because we have an extended family system, which is abasis for socialism.  In this system nobody is denied what belongs  to him and issues are discussed together before a decision is reached at. 	 	So, we are asking the rest of the world to let us run our country according to our wishes, tradtions and culture.  We do not want to be told what to do by other people who do not know anything about Africa.  We have chosen to do our things in the way we knowbest.  This is what our President has repeatedly told us and advocated.However,  we  are now being asked why Africans did not come  out before with this view and why they have been following the Western system.  But  I want to  say that we do not and will Never,  understand the Western system;  we  only read  out it in books. What we understand,  which is what we want,  is what we  are  practicing. We  have  heard the  talk that the  secret ballot is  the  means  to democracy;  but  this is not  the  case. Electoral systems vary fromplace  to  place: the  Europeans want  a different  system from thatof  the  Americans; there  is no  particular  electoral system that is perfect. In fact,  the  secret ballot has  so many loopholes  thatit is very difficult  to  ensure  fair elections. In it  you havethe  presiding officers and other  officials who  can tamper with the ballot  papers.   It is  also  possible  for  somebody to register five times  and vote five  times either in one  polling station or in different  polling stations,  and we have no way of preventing this from happening.   This is why we feel that we no longer need the secret  ballot. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  since  the  queuing system has  eliminated all  these  electoral problems  I  feel that we  should use  only this system of election. We  should be  declaring winners those who  getmore  votes  than the  total votes  of  all the  other  contestants. Wherewe  have  doubts,  we  should allow the  top two  candidates  to  proceed to  second round election by queuing and the  one who gets majority votes  should be  declared the winner.  The  secret ballot is very expensive  and we  cannot  go  on pouring so much money into  a system that  does not  produce  the results we want. These  are  issues  that this  country will have  to face  squarely,  because  if we  keep on avoiding them, will never get the right  solution to  our problems: We  have to  stick to  one  solution that  enables us get the results we require. Why should we  go back to a system that we know is wrong and bad?    The  queuing is good because everybody sees what happens in broad daylight. I  do not know why somebody should be  afraid of expressing his  opinion in the open,  and instead prefers to go behind a bar and begin saying "I do not like  so and so". This means that somebody is not honest; We should be honest and provide frank leadership which this country needs. Now that  our President has clearly explained the African notion oI democracy,  we  should stick by it  and explained on it because  this is what  can help us;Mr.Speaker,  Sir,  I would  also  like  to  emphasise  that unless this  country improves productivity we will not develop quickly; Productivity has to be improved at all levels of operations: management must improve its productivity; Very often managers  go  to  their offices late; which in itself results in low productivity. Sometimes managers also  do not align their work programmes properly and that again results in a low rate  of productivity.It you look throve the whole spectrum of our operations, you will find many areas in which productivity is low; This is largely due  to  the way in which we  approach our various responsibilities. If you  are  responsible  for making sure that water flows  in the pipe,  you haveto  see  that  it  flows,  but  this  is  not  always  done. Sometimes,  you  may  beresponsible  for  an  irrigation  project. If you  do  not plan for its  implementation,you  come  out  on  the  last  day  to  say,   "Ah! The  Government  hs not  provided thenecessary  money." If  this  nation  cannot,  through  its  civil  servants  andbusinessmen,  increase  production,  we  are  all  the time bound to  lose  economically. At  present,  our  production  is  not  good enough. I  see  this  everyday  in  labour problems,  many  of which  arise  largely  because  certain  firms  do not  produce enough  to  pay  pay  higher wages,  and  this  is  productivity  at a  lower  level  than is  acceptable. I,  therefore,  appeal  to  all  people  who are  engaged  in  any  kind of production  to  make  sure  that  they  are  so  responsible  that  their  operations at  all  levels  increase  their productivity so  that they produce more  today than they  did yesterday. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,   I  beg  to  support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE  ASSISTANT  MINISTER,  OFFICE  OF  THE  VICE-PRESIDENT  AND  MINISTRY OF FINANCE  (Mr.  Keah):-   Thank you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for giving me  this opportunity  to  reply  to  hon.  Members  statements  in respect  of the  Budget  Speech. Before  I  do  that,  however,  I  would want  to  thank His  Excellency the President for his  very  wise  leadership  which has  enabled us  to have  a sustained political growth  and  development  of our  Republic. This  country  is  mature  in  itspolitical  path. Thanks  for  the  peace  and tranquility  that  abound  in  thisRepublic. Thanks  also  to  our  institutions  which are  in  working order,  such  asParliament,  the  Executive and the Judiciary. I  think  those who  tend  to  thinkthat,  as  an  independent state,  we  should have  a Judiciary over which the country and  the  Head of State have  no power are out of their minds. I  thank  all  Kenyans  for responding to  the peace,  love  and unity call  made by His  Excellency the President and for their self determination towards progress. Thanks  to  our  friends  and trading partners  overseas who continue  to support us  in the  very  difficult  economic  situations  that we go through.  Lastly  and most  importantly,  thanks  to God for  the  blessings  He has  showered  on  Kenya  and  its  people. Turning  to  the  Budget Speech,  take  this  opportunity  to  thank hon. Members  for  congratulating His  Excellency  the Vice-President and Minister for Finance  on  his  very wonderful  Budget Speech and for their constructive comments on the  Budget. They  have  called  it  a  structural  adjustment programme  Budget, an export-oriented Budget,  a rural  development  Budget,  an  employment-generation Budget,  a progressive  Budget  and a mwananchi  Budget. All  these  congratulations are  accepted,  but  I  would  like  to  emphasise  the  fact that the  Budget  is  only a policy  document  aimed  at  directing the  economy towards  sustained growth. The development  equation,  as  has  been  said,  is  not  just a good policy;  it means  not only figures that balance  but  also  the  actual  physical  infrastructure  such  as roads, electricity,  education  and health. Thus,  the  Budget  Speech  touched  on  the  world  economy  because  Kenya's economy  does  not  operate  in  isolation. It  also  touched  on  our past  performanceand  the  focus  for 1990/91. The  Budget  has  a plan  of action and a course  to befollowed which  are  based  on  assumption. However,   if  this  assumption  in  theBudget equation does  not materialise,  a review must be made and corrective measures  taken. This  is  why  hon.  Members  talked about specific matters,  suchas  "mini-budgets". These  so-called  "mini-budgets"  are  only corrective  measureswhich  are  taken  when  some  assumption has  not materialised.  For  example,  if the weather was  supposed  to  be  good and bad weather persists,  we  do not harvest adequately,  and we have  to  take  corrective measures  in our Budget. Where  the prices  of oil  in other  countries  go up  or circumstances beyond our control occur outside  this Republic,  we have  to go back to the Budget and take corrective measures. Therefore,  I  would  like  to emphasise  the  fact that  in so  far as  "mini-budgets"  are  concerned,  hon.  Members  should bear with the Treasury when we  take these  corrective  measures  towards  achieving our sustained economic growth.  With regard  to  specific  comments,  I  have  only picked on a few that were  sidely  touched on by various hon.  Members.  One  of these  comments relates  to  cost-sharing.  Several  hon.  Members  commented on  the  fact  that cost-sharing should  perhaps  be  discarded  or  reviewed,  and  I  would  like  to echo  the  sentiments expressed by  hon.  Kibaki,  hon.  Nabwera and other hon.  Members,  who came out and supported  the  exercise. Cost-sharing  is  here  to stay,  and  I  would  like  to emphasise  that,  as  a matter of economic  policy,  it will  continue  to be exercised. If we  do not  exercise  cost-sharing and yet  we want services  to continue  to  be  rendered,  the  only  other alternative  is  to  increase  taxes-in order  to  obtain  the  revenue  that will  go  towards  financing the  services,  and  I am sure  that  such  an  increase  in personal  taxes would be  lamentable. The  other alternative  is  to provide  no  services  at all,  which is surely not acceptable. We  have  a duty  to provide  services  to wananchi,  particularly  the  social  services such  as  education  and health. Therefore,  we welcome  a review of  the  cost-sharingmechanisms  and  the  rations. It  is  important  that  hon.  Members  accept  this policy,and  the  sooner  the  policy  is  discussed  and  explained  to  the people we  represent the better. That  is  what  I  wanted  to  comment  upon  on  the  cost-sharing  concept.Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  several  other hon.  Members  did  talk about  the  needto  decentralise  the  collection  of  income  tax. Well,  as you  know,   this  has  alreadytaken place  and measures  continue  to  be  taken. There is  a  continued  exercise  forcontinued  decentralisation of  the  colletion of income  tax. Sir,  many  other  points were raised  touching on various  Ministries,  and I  want  to  assure hon.  Members  that  the Treasury will pass these comments  to all the Ministries  concerned.  For  example,  hon.  Members felt that  this  country  should become  self-sufficient on wheat production,  as well as  in oil  seed crops,  cotton and  in  the  marketing  aspects  of our  commodities. Nothing  could  be  far  from  the truth,  and  these points have been noted with keen  interest and are always under constant  review. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a point was  also  touched upon on  the  presumptive  tax. It was  felt  that  consideration be given  that  the  gross  rates  be  reviewed,  particularly on  crops  like  coffee  and  tea. All  I  can  say  is  that  the  comment has  been noted and  the  review  is  a continuing exercise. When  found  appropriate,   the  necessary adjustments will be made. Sir,  a point was raised by  several  hon.  Members  to  the  effect  that state corporations which  continue  to drain the Treasury by making losses should be privatised. As  you  know,   this  is  a Government policy contained  in Sessional Paper No.  Iof 1986  on Economic Management for Renewed Economic Growth. That  is  a point  thatthe  Government has  in hand,  but  it will always effect it in the light of all other factors  in  the  country having been  taken care of.  For  example,  if  there  is  no  buyer   for  the  ailing  sugar  industry,  the Government cannot just sit back and watch. So,all  I  can  say  is  that  this  is a policy, and a policy being a guideline, appropriate. steps  will  be taken  as  considered appropriate. Sir,  another point was made relating  to  the need for an expoet insurance aspect when we  export  to  the Preferential Trade Area countries.  This  is  a good point,  and  I  an  sure  that hon.  Onyonka will  be looking  into  it as he delves on  the PTA  matters. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  another point  that has  been  made  by  hon.  Members  is on  the  taking  over  of foreign  exchange  loss  by  the Government.  This  point  touches on  areas  where  a  corporation has  borrowed  a  foreign  loan  and,  because  of  the  varying exchange  rates  relating  to  the  Kenya Shilling  vis-a-vis  the  major world  currencies, the  borrower of  the  foreign loan  finds  that he  has  to  pay  much more  in Kenya Shillings than what  he  originally  borrowed. The  point here  is  that  the  exchange  loss  occasioned by  the  fluctuation  of  the  Kenya Shilling be  absorbed  by the  Government. Thishas  been  a point of very  major  discussions  within  the  Treasury  and we  are  lookingfor  ways  and  means  of cushioning  this  exchange  loss. But  let me  say  that  thereis  no  clear-cut  answer  to  this  particular problem. Various  countries  in  the worldhave  used  different  methods  in  dealing with  this  particular problem and we will be  finding our  own  solution. Certainly, the  point  is worth  or note and  it  is  underconsideration. The  idea  is  to enable  the smaller  corporations  to  invest withouthaving  this extra burden of foreign exchange loss. The  matter  is  under  consideration,and when  a solution has  been found,  it will  certainly be made public. Sir,  another  factor "that was mentioned was  the  issue that pensions he indexed with  inflation.  I  do have  some  sympathy with  the  pensioners  in  that the value of the pension,  in  the context of inflationary tendencies,  has a less purchasing power  that it originally had. So,  the point  is worth noting  and  it has been noted. Although  I have no solution at this juncture,  the matter will  definitely go  tohe  Budget Steering Committee for discussion and,  if found appropriate,  then  an  answer will  be  communicated  to hon.  Members.  However,  I  would  like  to mentionone  thing. Hon.  Members  would  like  to  see  the  cost  increased here and there,  and no  hon.  Member has  come  up  with ways  and means of  increasing  the revenue. All  the time  there have  been  increases  in costs  and spending but the revenue generation, which  is  the other  side  of  the  equation,  has  totally been  ignored. I  would  like to  emphasize  the  fact  that when we  increase  the  cost on one  side of the Budget, we  must also  consider  the  revenue  on  the other side  in order  to finance  the extra cost. So,   I  would  like  to  alert  hon.  Members  in  so far as  this  aspect  is  concerned. Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  are many  comments  that hon.  Members  did make and  I  would  like  to  assure  them  that we  have  valued  their  comments  and we will  take them  very  seriously. I  would now  like  to  conclude  by  saying  that  indeed  the  Budget was  good. Indeed,  all  the  hon.  Members  echoed  and highly appaluded the  Budget.  The  success of  the  Budget,  however,   is  no  so  much  in  its  being balanced  but  depends  on every Kenyan. All Kenyans  must play  their role  in  the  economic aspect  in order  to make the  Budget  a success. It  is  up  to  all  individuals  and  corporate  organisations  to contribute  to  the  best  of  their  abilities  and  integrity  in  order  to make  the Budge a  success. For  example,   in  terms  of  the  revenue  aspect of  it,  the  tax payers  mustbe ready  to pay  their  taxes willingly  and  in  time. If we  take  corners  and  denythe  Treasury  a fair share of the revenue,  then we are failing  the Budget.  The  revenue collectors must also play  their part;  they must collect,  and they have a duty  to collect,  every  cent  that  is due  to be collected under the Budget and as provided for  in  the Constitution and the laws of Kenya.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in terms of expenditure,  the control of expenditure  is necessary.  Time  and again,  hon. Members in this  House  have  castigated poor spending and poor control of expenditure.  With regard  to unauthorised expenditure,  of course, the  Government  has  taken court  action where that is necessary, and will continue to  do  so. But  it  is  quite proper and appropriate  that we  should urge  all Accounting Officers who have been vested with the  responsibility  of controlling the Government  expenditure  to  ensure  that funds are  spent  accordingto  the  Budget. If  an item is not prokrided for in the Budgetand you authorise  expenditure which is not in the Budget then you Put the  Budget  out  of  gear.  This  should not be  done  and I  join hon.  Members  in castigating those  few   Accounting Officers who are  repeatedly reported by  the Public  Accounting Committee of having exceeding spending  "above"  the Budget or "outside" the Budget,  or even spending on items  that  are  not Provided for in the  Budget. The  Treasury does  release  the  funds  to  the Ministries, and  it  is  then up to  each Ministry to  release  A.I.E.  to  the district. Therefore,  it  is not  the  Treasury’s responsibility;it  is  up to the  individual 34 Ministries to ensure that the funds released to them have  been released to  the District Development Committees (D.D.C.S)  in order to  enable  the District Development  Officers(D.D.C.S) to  plan the  expenditures  in goodtime. Indeed,  we  have  had reports  that funds have  not  reachedthe D.D.C.'s, and in this particular respect,  it is up to  the D.D.C.S to  enquire  from their respective Ministry and find  out what  has happened. The  Vote  on Account,  the  estimates  of both recurrent and development expenditure are public documents, and every D.D.O. can enquire. Everybody can see what has, in fact been allocated to them. If they do not get the funds, they  should go to their respective Ministries. If for one reason or another, on the revenue aspect of the Budget because in order to release the funds to the Ministries, the Government must receive the funds from the revenue system I liter there has been some slight delays  at least, everybody should be told that there is that slight delay. We in the Treasury do take very serious concern in advising and releasing the funds timely. I would only request hon. Members to work very, very closely with their D.D.C.'s arid D.D.O.'s in so far as the Budgeted sums are concerned, and make sure that those have been received there.Time and again, funds have been sent but, unfortunately, have been used on other things By the time audit time comes, it is discovered only too late that the funds have been used for something else. I therefore, request hon. Members to continue to be watchdogs in this respect.Also, spending all funds that have been given to the various Ministries is bad. There is some degree of slovmess in performance in the D.D.C. There maybe a shortage of implement¬ing officers. Again, hon. Members should sit closely with their D.D.C.'s in order to assist and to make sure that all sums that have been voted have, in fact, been spent.As we know, KANU has a place in the tendering procedures. We, as hon. Members, should try and be involved where practicable, either personally or thing KANU, to make sure that the tendering procedures have, in fact, been adhered to.Our accounting systems and procedures are good, but, unfortunately, they are not always followed. I can only urge that the accounting systems and procedures be followed so that we can achieve financial control.Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like all Kenyans totake advantage of the enabling environment to ensure that they in¬vest or go into partnership with foreigners to invest in order to create employment and also to assist this economy and propel it forward towards sustained growth.I take this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to urge all our foreign friends to be positive and come forward and invest in Kenya. Kenya is a peaceful country. Kenya has tranquility. Hence, Kenya has peace and people are good. we have gone out of our way to make it possible to be competitive, in fact, wito¬other countries in order to attract foreign investors. All I can urge is that all should take advantage of this enabling environment in order to invest in Kenya.Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those few remarks, I beg to move.<Newspeech>(Question put and agreed to)<Header> MOTION </Header >Approval of Taxation Measures for 1990/91 Financial Year..<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER  OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move:-THAT, the proposals relating to:Customs and Excise TariffValue	Added TaxLocal Manufacturers Export Compensation  Income TaxThe Stamp Duties, andTrade Licensing, contained in the FinancialStatement for the year of Account for 1990/91 be approved.(His Excellency the President's consent has "been signified)Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Budget Speech outlined a number of measures under the various taxes. These are elaborated in the Finance Bill which is under debate. Of specific notice under the various tax measures are the following which I will attempt to amplify here. These measures have been taken in order to balance our Budget this year and it touches on various administrative aspects as well as specific rates of taxes in our tax system. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will tackle these items one by one.With, regard to the Customs and Excise Tariff, amendments to the Customs and Excise Act are intended to close loopholes whichhad allowed people to import goods into Kenya where such was not	'the intention. In the measures that have been stated, when this is implemented, the loopholes will be covered. The Customs and Excise Tariff also seeks to make amendments which will strengthen the incentives of export promotion allowing the transfer of goods from bonded warehouses to a bonded factory. Also,so as to stop people from speculating on the rate of exchange the duration of validity for holding imports in bonded warehouses has been reduced from 12 months to six months. This 	measureshould help to keep prices down to the consumer. Further, the change is intended to increase efficiency in local industry and the averagetariffs on raw materials and immediate goods has been cut by five per cent points. A variety of changes in individual tariffs have been undertaken to further particular policies, for example to lower tariffs on assembled stovesrather than unassembled ones and reducing the duty on imported wood pulp so as to protect our forecasts; reducing the duty on ceramic wares for laboratory use to support the 8-4-4 system of education and removing the duty on speed governors for motor vehicle The move is also intended to support small scale industries particu¬larly in the rural areas so that duty on items which the Jua Kali artisans might use is reduced. Also duty exemption on machinery tobe sited in rural areas has been doubled to K3hs.20 million. Further the excise duty on beer has been raised by 50 cents per litre for purrs revenue  purposes. Oil the Value Added Tax, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that since the VAT was newly introduced last year a number of minor amendments to the Act are required in order to close loopholes and to remove certain anomalies Of particular importance in this is the removal of a tie between the Customs and Excise Act, and the Value Added Tax Act, which is inappropriate since the latter covers services as well as goods. A new Schedule to the Value Added Tax Act covers this particular aspect. Also on the VAT, the Commissioner will be granted powers to issue registration certificate to persons whom he considers should have been registered. This was a power available under the Sales Tax Act and since theSales Tax Act has been superceded by the Value Added Tax Act, the power needs to be entrenched under the VAT Act.In order to support local service industry, ananomaly which favoured foreigner suppliers of services has in fact been removed. Also under the VAT the loophole whichallowed manufacturers to avoid VAT by sub-contracting is removed by making contract services Vat able. Also those administering the VAT will now be required to take an oath of secrecy and will also be liable to severe penalties if they aid or abet avoidance of the tax. Also the rationalisation of the categories will make for better administration and a more rational distinction between items. .</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. Kiliku: On a point .of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. No Minister, under our Standing Orders, is allowed to read his speech in the House He can refer to notes, however. But it appears that the Assistant Minister is reading his speech in the House. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: I think he is only referring to some of the very important points he wants the House to hear. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER OFFICE 0F THE VICE-PHESJQDENT ANDMINISTRY OP FINANCE (Mr. Keah) : Thank you, Mr.Speaker, Sir These taxation details are very intricate indeed. I am sure that hon.Kiliku will appreciate it if I explain the rationale behind the taxation measures and corrections that are being implemented.I thought that he would be more grateful rather that ButI thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for your protection.I will go on to explain the details as to why we are making these changes. A number of goods that were previouslyexempted from VAT are now zero-rated so as to enable them to claim tax and off-set on imports. This will support local professionals who were losing in competition. Because of the overall reduction in import duty a number of items will have a five per cent increase in VAT so as to maintain thedomestic prices and at the same time encouraging firmsto register.Under the Local Manufacturers and Export Compensation, there is some increase in the items eligible for export compensation but more importantly an amendment to the Export Compensation Act is being proposed and this will make payment of compensation to the exporter on presentation of evidence of export and on security of bond.On Income Tax, aspects such as the Unity Trust Act has been amended to have this Trust licensed and supervised by the Central Bank of Kenya so as to make Unity Trust a more attractivedevice for local investors. Also the corporate tax rate has been lowered from 42.5 per cent to 40 per cent. As regards the currentpayment system of income tax to be brought in over five years, we will treat businesses somewhat like the present treatment of workers who have to pay tax under the Pay-As-You-Earn system on a monthly basis. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this will mean that firms will pay 15 per cent of their current year's income tax in the 9th month of their current financial year. This will rise to 30 per cent in the following year and so on, until it reaches 75 per cent in the fifth year.On Stamp Duties, licence fees under the Banking Act are raised from 10 per cent to 15 per cent and trade licence fees are increased "by 10 per cent and export duty on scrap metal is raised so as to encourage its use domestically. On the Export processingZones, throughout all the measures that have been enumerated, the various Acts have been amended to support the Export Processing Zones requirements in order to attract foreign investors.Mr. Speaker, Sir, these amendments will ensure that the taxation Acts are easy to administer and will also assist in generating more revenue for the Treasury.with these remarks, I beg to move. </Newspeech>   <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILDLIFE (Mr. Awori)Mr. Speaker Sir, I rise t o s e c o n d the Motion which has  justbeen moved by the Assistant Minister, Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance and which deals with variuos clauses, as stipulated in the Order Paper.Sir, all those proposals, will help the Government in x implementing the Budget e very effectively. Investments of up to Kshs.20 million has been exempted from duty and that was done in recognistion of the fact that the majority of our people live in the rual areas. We would like to discourage people from moving from the rural areas to the towns. Therefore, it is important to encourage people who want to invest in the rural areas. We know the difficulties which face people who live in the rural areas. They fact problems on housing, lack of enough hospitals and so on, and therefore, it is very encouraging to see that people wishing to invest up to Kshs.20 million in the rural areas will not be required to pay duty on their imported inputs. Sir, implementing that proposal, I hope that this exemption will not only cover those inputs like cement which will be used to construct the factory in which the equipment shall be installed. Vehicles used in the factory should also be covered, so that this becomes a complete package as the Mover had explained.Sir, on the issue of exports, I was happy to note that the cotton industry was recognised so that the Bill which was passed her some two years ago could be implemented x fully. A new board of directors would be appointed and  given new rules and regulations. We can start exporting cotton after we have satisfied the local industries and cotton mills that we have in our country.Sir, we also have a fish industry which has not been fully exploited. If we follow the  various clauses of this Motion, we can succeed in earning foreign exchange from the exportation of fish for the benefit of the people.Sir, at this stage, I would like to take this opportunity to thank His Excellency the President for creating and maintaining stability in this country, which has helped not only the Minister but also the civil servants who prepared that commendable Budget and	all rules on taxation. The President has gone across thecountry presiding over Kanu rallies and  emphasizing that the old people are all behind him, and therefore, I would like to congratulate him for that At the same time, I would like to  thank our Government for recognising every part of our country, and in particular, Busia where the  sugar factory will be UP If that factory is constructed, we shall stop the importation of sugarSir, finally I would like to say that the equipment which is imported for the disabled  should be permanently exempted from   duty.With those few remarks, I beg to second. </Newspeech>(Question proposed)<Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity. First of all I would like to thank the Mover of this Motion for reading his speech so that we could all understand it.Sir, here we are talking about export compensation. The Government must check and make sure that there is no over invoicing on  exports so that the exporters can get a lot  ofmoney in term of export compensation. We cannot grow economicallyunless we have external markets for our products. We cannot	service .our debts unless we have external markets for the goods that we produce in this  country. Therefore, the Vice-President and Minister for Finance should address himself to the question of how we can have more external markets for our goods. For instance, we should have external markets for our  horticultural products; As we speak here, mangoes are rotting in Malindi because we do not have external markets for them.The indigenous people should participate in the economy so that they can also benefit. If they can export their goods, they will also benefit from the export compensation but unfortunately, only non-indigenous Kenyans are benefiting from the export compensation today. Siency they are the ones who are controlling the economy of this country. Those are the the h± only people who benefit from export compensation because they own factories which manufacture those goods.Sir, I think the Government should come up with a system whereby those factories which are owned by the non-indigenous  people could see some shares to the indigenous Kenayns like some commercial banks have done, so that if there are any benefits to ±h be accrued, the indigenous people  could also	benefit. Sir, I would also like to point out thatany money that is realized from exports should be returned to the  country immediately. The Vice-President and Minister for Finance should, therefore, make sure that any money earned from exports is returned to this country immediately.  On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.The Mover of the Motion said that it is very encouraging forthe local Kenyans to be allowed to buy  shares in theexisting factories. Hon. Kiliku is now telling us that theindigenous people should be given a chance to buy some shares inthe localrfactories. Are they talking the same language Sir? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Sir, I think that was not a point oforder, but a point of information. He should have asked mewhether I wanted that piece of information Sir, I would now like to turn to the customs and excise tariffS Sir, the jua kali sector is now catering for theemployment of the young people. The Minister for Technical Traininand Apolied Technology, who is responsible for the jua kali	sector should make sure that money is well distributed amongthe jua kali people. Sir, the Vice-President and Ministerfor Finance has done a commendable job for reducing the taxon the facilities which are used in the 8-4-4 system of education. I do not know what the Ministry does if the parents are the ones who buildthe classrooms, workshops and buy. the textbooks. I remember. we passed a Motionis this House urging the Government to supply free textbooks to schools. Iwas surprised to read in the newspapers the other day that parents are beingasked-to organise Hararabees to raise money to buy textbooks. Unless the prices  of textbooks are reduced then some parents will not afford to buy these textbooks. The textbooks are too expensive. The Government should release a price-list of textbooks that are going to be used in schools so that parents can know which books to buy and their cost.Mr. Speaker, Sir, although we are cost-sharing, it seems that the parents are cost-sharing more than the Government. This is because they are doing almost everything while the Government only provides teachers. Why can the Ministry not create another Head in their Vote which will cater for textbooks? This is because if parents are the ones who are going to be buying these textbooks then we are going to have an educational imbalance in this country. This is because the parents who have money will afford the textbooks while those who do not will not. We all know that all students in this country sit for the same examinations. If the Government provided free textbooks to schools then there will be uniformity in educational standards in this country.There are very many schools that lack educational facilities like workshops and classrooms. There are very many areas in this country where parents have not managed to construct workshops for their schools. On the other hand there are some areas where parents have managed to complete these workshops. The students from these two areas are supposed to sit for the same national examinations So in order, to bring  uniformity  in educational standards  in this country, the Government has to supply the textbooks while the parents cost-share in constructing classrooms and workshops. What is this cost- sharing if the parents are the ones who are doing everything?Kenya should not be used as a dumping place for those goods which can be manufactured locally here. The other day I read that some traders had imported sweets into the country. How can we import such things when they are being manufactured locally? we continue importing such things which can be manufactured locally, then we would be creating unemployment in the country. This is because we would be killing these local companies which employ our people. So, I would to suggest that all things imported which are manufactured locally should be taxed heavily in order to discourage further importations. This will also discourage the demand and supply of such goods. This is because, as I have already said, continued importation of such goods^ will definitely create unemployment in this country.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think, it is time that the Office of the VicePresident and Ministry of Finance addressed itself to the question of unemploymentIn this country. I thank His Excellency the President for appointinga Commission to look into the question of unemployment in this country. TheMinisters need to help the President on this issue. They must address themselves to the policies of the Government. They should implement and be seen to implement the policies of the Government. It is up to the Ministers to be very vocal on this issue of unemployment in the country. This is a very important issue.How are we going to control the economy of this country? This is the question that we need to address ourselves to. The concerned Ministry should table an Act here on how we can control our economy by allowing our indigenous people to participate in the economy. Our problem, as far as I know, is capital. So, it is up to the concerned Ministry to find ways and means of availing capital to the indigenous people so that they can participate in the economy. Unless we have such a policy, we shall all the time have problems.With those few points, I beg to support.5lr. Speaker left the ChairThe Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Wabuge) took the Chair</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MAKAU: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,sir for giving me-the time to also support the Motion and make a few commentson the various proposals as contained in the Budget When one looks at thisBudget, he will realise that its theme was well spelt out in the various policiesas contained in that Budget.I would like to make a few comments on export promotion. In thatBudget, the Vice-President and Minister for Finance stressed that export andproduction, especially industrial and non-traditional exports will be promoted.In this aspect, I would like to say something about export compensation. Whatis contained in the Budget proposals should not be something that is just onpaper rather it should be something that will be looked into by the concernedMinistry. I am saying so because export compensation has been abused by sometraders who ask for compensation through over-invoicing. This is an area thatneeds to be checked.The other crucial element which is inclusive of this is duty exemption.The introduction of duty exemption scheme which ties up with export compensationis very important. I am saying so because duty exemption on exports is veryimportant when a country is entering the international market. It was goodnews for us when we heard that horticultural products are going to benefit from  the duty exemption scheme. Traditional cash crops like tea and coffee that Kenya has depended on for a very long time are being affected by numerous factors at the world market. But the market for horticultural crops is expanding and Kenya can exploit this fully. We have been told, in fact, that presently the country has earned over shs.1.6 billion from horticultural products. It was a welcome move by the Vice-President and Minister for Finance toinclude imported inputs in-.this category that will go a long way in helpingthose engaged in agricultural businesses to compete in the world market asfar as exports are concerned. We were happy that he exempted duty on importedfarm  inputs.I am saying that because it is very important that the packagingof horticultural products should be of good quality, in order to attractbuyers. If the packaging of Kenyan products is poor, buyers will shy awayeven though the products may be of good quality. Packaging as a marketingfactor is very crucial.Another area that is very  welcome is on tax (VAT).When Vat was introduced in  this country it was a show of sophisticationin Kenya's business. VAT is used in areas where people want to be verycreative. Taxation in this country needed flexibility and that is why VAT was introduced. In the previous Budget, there was no exemption of tax export processing zones as far  their products were concerned, We are happy that such products will now be exempted from VAT. While we say thatexport processing zones are going to catapult this country into a situationwhereby we are going to compete with successful areas like I laurustinus andothers that have introduced such zones, it is also very important- that thosewho operate on those zones should not be highly taxed.Another area that I would like to comment on is the exemption ofVAT on laboratory equipment and road signs. This is a very welcome movebut the question is: For whose benefit are we reducing these tariffs?I am saying so because there is this question of 8-4-4 system of educationwhere it is stated clearly in the proposals that tax on wood pulp products andceramics  used in the construction of science laboratories is to bereduced. The question is Who is going to benefit? The concern of the8-4-4 system of education is that schools should benefit through the cheap construction of science laboratories. The Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance should make sure that parents benefit through the cheapconstruction of science laboratories  but  not the person who is sellingconstruction products, we can say that the tariff is going to be reduced when in the long run, it is the producer and not the consumer who benefits. As far as tariff on ceramics is concerned, schools should benefit and not the producer. That benefit should he passed on to the consumer if we are going to make sure that the 8-4-4  system of education succeeds by having science laboratories all over the country.There is one area that was mentioned under this proposal seeking to close the loophole used by those people who import goods on transit and who use agents in neighbouring countries and who claim that they have not been paid and hence order that such goods he auctioned and the proceeds shared among themselves. The proposal now is that those people will be made to pay the  required tariff  if they fail to do so, the goods will be	condemned. That is a little hit vague becauseit does not matter whether the goods are condemned or not. The most important thing is to set up stiff measures to deal with the culprits. The loophole was that somebody imports the goods, avoids paying duty,  gets a court order to auction and remits the proceeds to himself. How the Government is proposing that such goods should be condemned, when such goods are  condemned, the same importer can corruptly acquire that property. Something should be done about  this because anybody who is in business is after profit and he will do everything possible to make sure that he gains accord to his plans.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech>QUORUM<Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Sir. He are discussing a very important Motion "out unfortunately, we have no quorum in the House. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Ring the Division Bell.(The Division Bell was rung) We have a quorum now  Mr. P. J.Masinde<Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.J. MASINDE: Thank you very much, Mr.Temporary  Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this very important Motion. I want to take this opportunity to thank his Excellency the Vice President and Minister for Finance for the amendments he has suggested in this Motion. One of the suggested amendments is in respect of reduction of period of storage of goods bonded in warehouses from one year to six months. This will make such goods cheaper.I would like to ask the Vice-President and Minister for Finance to ensure that the price control department functions properly so that the objectives of these suggested amendments are achieved and wananchi benefit  This is because unless we have a strict and active price controller the reduction in the storage period of goods in warehouses will not benefit wananchi in any way at all because the prices will still soar without anybody taking any corrective action.With regard to compensation of manufacturers, I would like to suggest that we start by compensating farmers. The farmer should  encouraged to produce cotton, cashewnuts, rice and horticultural products of high quality Our production should not be geared to exporting first; we must first of all satisfy the local market and then export The balance to the world market at a competitive price. Cotton production has, in fact, dropped below local requirements. A good marketing policy would, thus, encourage the farmer to produce for local consumption and export to earn this country foreign exchange.Sir cashewnuts are in great demand in many parts of the world and it is a pity that a well established factory at the Coast had. to collapse due to mismanagement thereby rendering sen many workers and leaving farmers with a market for their cashewnuts.:I feel that we should use our own raw materials to manufacture goodsof such a high or superior quality so that they can effectively  compete with any other goods in the world. While we think of high quality exportswe should also consider and cater for the needs of the local consumer We should not manufacture shoddy goods for local consumption because this would make our people want to import goods some of which are inferior due to the fact that our goods are too expensive and, probably not competitive in the world market." It is, therefore, important the suggested amendments are implemented in such a way as to be beneficial to this country.Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also wish to congratulate the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for reducing Of import duty on capital goods by up to Shs.20 million; this is a very wonderful gesture. However, as I casually mentioned last time when I spoke in this House, if these capital goods are meant for rural industrialisation the Ministry of Energy should also be very liberal in its supply of electricity. If electricity is going to remain as expensive as it is now it will be useless for an investor to import capital goods because he will not get electricity for his factory."I also want to mention something about the jua kali artisans. These artisans are helping the Government in reducing and controlling unemployment. It is thus high time we started thinking of highquality products by these artisans. For this to happen we should give special attention to training of these artisans in polytechnics so that they become quality conscious and be able to produce quality goods for both local consumption and export. Instead, we are going to flood the market with low quality products and thus kill the morale of Jua Kali artisans by not properly supported and directed in the right way to help wananchi to send their children to polytechnics. These institutions are becoming as expensive, if not more expensive, as normal secondary schools.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I suggest that the Governmentshould highly subsidies polytechnics and, if possible, supply the raw materials required for education in polytechnics so that the parents of the children in polytechnics are not overtaxed by being required to buy tools and other materials, such as linen. With these serious considerations, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAINGI: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my friends in contributing to this good Motion that has been moved this afternoon. Firstly, I thank His Excellency the Vice-President for bringing up this Motion.Let me comment on the value added tax (V.A.T.), which replaced sales tax. When you visit many shops around, you find that there are many traders in business. One of the things that we have discovered in some shops is that some people fail to collect V.A.T., and I would like to request the Ministry concerned and the officers who check on this matter to look into it in a very serious matter in order to ensure that the Government gets the revenue that it is supposed to earn in the form of V.A.T.Secondly, I want to talk about export compensation for local manufacturers. Kenya is now advanced in terms of industrial infrastructure. When we compare ourselves with our neighbouring countries, we find that we are miles ahead of them. So, it is my request to our manufacturers to consider establishing a good manner of packaging. When goods are well manufactured in terms of quality and well packed, they sell themselves. If we manufacture good products and pack them well, we will be able to sell them not only in Africa, but also in Europe and elsewhere and thereby earn this country the foreign exchange that we always need.With regard to exports, you will find that some manufacturers in Kenya do not involve brokers in their export business. These brokers are people who do not manufacture anything, but who know where to find markets for the products manufactured here. So, it is my special request to manufacturers to consider involving all Kenyans in the export of their products so that we may earn the country the foreign exchange that we need. Although you may be a manufacturer, you may not know where to market your products whereas there are brokers who know where to sell these products. So, I request manufacturers and the Government to involve all Kenyan Africans in the export business.Turning to the Export Promotion Zone, it is not everybody who will have the chance of manufacturing products. So, brokers should be allowed to export goods from this Zone to neighbouring countries or wherever they find the right market. In addition, the quality of the goods we manufacture here is one vital aspect that will enable us to move much more ahead in the export business. I do not know the procedure involved in manufacturing today, but I know that long before today, we used to have exporters registered by the Central Bank of Kenya. I do not know whether this is still being followed or not, but the chance to export should be open to everybody.Travelling has become very expensive. Air tickets to Zambia, Tanzania and elsewhere are expensive and so is hotel accommodation. Therefore, I would like to request the Ministry concerned to think of exporters and increase their travelling allowances so that when they visit any country, they are able to hire taxis and sleep in hotels. When an exporter goes out, he needs to entertain his customers in order to win some business. If you purse strings are too tight, this leaves no room for you to get good business.Manufacturers and exporters should think of making their prices fair. As we consider developed countries, we should know that we, too, are developing. In developed countries, some prices are fair, but when you look at our manufacturers here. you find that the buying  cost of their good is  high whereas, although I am not criticising the quality of our products, some of these products are under standard. If our manufacturers think of matching the export prices of their goods with those of developed countries, they will get much more business in the countries of our continent.Let me take this opportunity to thank His Excellency the President for one onerous thing that he did. He called for a meeting with all Kanu delegates in Kenya which achieved very good results. I sincerely request every mwananchi to support our President. He is a President who always thinks about the welfare of Kenyans. Just the other day he cane up with an idea of a bursary fund for all poor but intelligent students, something that has never happened anywhere else. His Excellency the President has done quite a lot. He has always stricken hon. Members of Parliament by suggesting good things for Kenyans.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR CO-OPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Cheruiyot): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity. First of all, I wish to pay tribute to His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for his very good Budget Speech.Having done that, I wish to very strongly commend the ability of the personnel at the Treasury. Those are the people behind the scenes in preparing our budget. These are people who are very knowledgeable on the current inflation rates; they are the people who know the cost of living in Kenya and they are the people who know the price indices of all commodities of Kenya, the salary structure and the general trade in the country. These are the people whom we should very sincerely thank for being aware of which areas we should levy taxes on. The problem is that some of these people have been in Government service for a long time. I would suggest that we put in more staff development for the people in the Office of the Vice-Presdient and Ministry of Finance. I say so because Kenya has been applauded as one of the countries in Africa where the budgetary procedure is intact and advanced. We hear that when a country like Nigeria had a oil boom, it had a very serious problem in managing its finances. That country went completely haywire because the budgetary system and procedure was not properly organised. We have been praised in Kenya for being very organised and very thorough. If, by providence, we got petrol dollars, our people in the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance would be so thorough that the money could be budgeted to fit every sector of the economy. It is my suggestion, therefore, that the personnel in the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance be given- staff development. They are the high leveled manpower in this country; they are the people who will take care of the kind of trend that is going on.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finances comes here and tells us of external forces or market forces and the defict that we experience and envisage to experience and how he proposes to finance the gap, he has to sit for long hours in the nights to discuss with his staff on how to look at the global economy and how it affects Kenya. We need to get very highly qualified manpower; people who should relate the problems we havehere with international forces. If we Eire going to have people doing so muchIn fact, as far as I know, the people who work in the Treasury are the most punctual among all the civil servants. It is time that these people should be given some incentives because, naturally, if anybody is given a reward of some kind, he puts more effort. If these are the people we rely on to ensure that we get enough revenue, they should get proper training so that they can direct and control the inflation of this country.Sir, we have quite a number of graduates who have come from the University of Nairobi and who have done Economics with Accounts option, and these are the people who we can prepare from the very outset so that they can have an economic setting to begin with. A country as young as Kenya should train such people so that they can begin planning.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for having been able to identify one area where there have been a lot of loopholes. We have known-of very unscrupulous traders who import cars in the pretext that such cares are in transit to neighbouring countries like Uganda but, upon coming here, the importers kind of stay behind until the cars are impounded at the Coast. When the carge are offered for auction, the same unscrupulous traders go round and buy them  on auction the way they want, thereby defeating the law. I wish to thank the: Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance for being so viglant and smart as to detect and stop these evils which were failing our economy. We should now be able to boost our own motor industry.The other area which I want to comment on is on the Jua Kali sector. This is the baby of His Excellency the President, and I think the time has come when we, as leaders of this country, should support the jua kali artisans. The only thing that they do these days is to make metal boxes, karais and jikos and other few items that do not require a lot of skill. The time has come when we should very aggressively promote export in this country, and we should encourage these youngsters to make nuts and bolts. I know of some industries in Kenya where foreign¬ers are exporting these small items, and our boys require only a little moulding to be able to produce some items which are very marketable within the Preferential Trade Area countries and elsewhere. Our jua kali artisans are so knowledgeable that many leaders here will agree with me that when they attend agricultural shows they admire their skills and ability. The only way to support these young men is by buying their products because they lack marketing ability. It is only that we, as leaders, have not gone out of our way to buy their products. If we buy them, we shall ensure that their domestic market is guaranteed. As long as we have our taste based on imported goods, then our local industry will suffer a great deal.Finally, Sir, I would like to touch on what is called Export Processing Zone in our Budget. In the PTA, Mauritius is the only country that has done tremendous in making sure that all products are export-oriented. There is no reason why we should not be aggressive and deliberate in our efforts. Even if we are going to indigenize our economy, we should think seriously on how to export our products There is nothing so special because we have kind of imagined that it is only the Asian community in this country who should export. His Excellency the President has said that if anyone can bring even a pound or a dollar to our Exchequer, he will have done a great deal in the development of this country. We value foreign currency because we do not have much to export, and now that we have started an Export Processing Zone, we should produce a lot of goods. In saying so, I am mindful of the products such as handicraft that our women produce, ye know that there are some people who have started producing synthetic products to beat the products that Kenyan women produce, but I am happy that the leaders of Kanu Maendeleo ya Wanawake have gone out of their way to tell the world that the sisal basket of  unique quality.  We are very happy that apart from tourism what. we have producedby our local standards, however unskilful, has gone a long way in giving us the hard earned foreign exchange. If we continue like this, we shall be sure that we shall swell the little hard currency that is necessary to boost our economy.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Kisiero ): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me a chance to join my colleagues in supporting this Motion.It is true that the Vice-President and Minister for Finance has had a very close look at our economy. did it so close that he has been able to suggest the "medicine" to be able to strengthen those areas that may be looking "weak".Kenya, like any other country, has its problems in its economic development. It is commendable that we have a Govern¬ment under the leadership of His Excellency  President Daniel arap Moi which attends to problems in a systematic way and tries everything possible to make sure that the economy is up to date. As we all know, Kenya is  most on the take off we are not a banana Republic. we are a real Republic. If it were notthat we have once In a while crooks here and there who interfere with our economy, I am sure we would now be on the take off.Some of the "medicine" that has been recommended by the Vice-President and Minister for Finance has come about because of the realisation of the fact that we have a big population which is growing very fast and, therefore, unemployment has become one of the major problems. In order to attend to that problem of unemployment, it is necessary that industries are expanded so that they may absorb the unemployment that is creeping in on us   us. In order to encourage those industries the Minister has gone further. He has even given them all kinds of incentives to enable both  local and overseas investors to come and invest in this country so that one of our main problems  that is unemployment  maybe attended to.Sir, we know that from 1986 when we had the Sessional Paper No. 1, unemployment was mentioned as one of the most urgent areas that needed attention. This is because at the moment, the balance between rural and urban centres is tilting in such a way that all the unemployed and educated young men and women are leav¬ing the rural areas in order to get jobs in urban'areas. That trend alone has put a lot of pressure to our small towns scattered all over in this country so that service cannot adequately be given to those people living in those areas. Therefore, it is very important and urgent to see that the influx of people from the rural areas to the urban areas is, at least, reduced, if not stopped completely so that industries can be opened in rural areas So, one of the recommendations that the Minister made is that investors intending to invest in this country have been given very good incentives so that they may go rural. Por instance, incentives in the form of reduced custom duties on machinery, tax holidays and so on. I am sure that these incentives should be able to attract a number of investors and make them go to the rural areas where they would get good facilities that would enable them to carry on their businesses of manufacturing.Another area that the Minister looked at very carefully is in the encouragement for export. The Minister recognises the fact that we need foreign exchange to finance our various indust¬rial activities in this country, and since our resources cannot satisfy our local needs, it is necessary that we get investors to come here. In order to give them more encouragement, they are given export compensation as one of the things that are very attractive to these manufacturers so that they may export their goods at competitive prices.Sir, we also know that although we may be attracting these investors into this country, we should be very careful in that some of these investors may bring i n old or second hand machinery when they come here to put up their industries. This would be detrimental to our own industrial development because we know that old and outmoded machines may not allow us to compete with overseas countries who are manufacturing using modern equipment. Old and outmoded machines may produce outmoded goods, say, cloth¬ing, food and so on while our counterparts overseas are producing 20th and 21st Century goods. So, it may be a grave mistake to go on importing old machinery or outmoded machinery which may not serve us in our effort to compete with other manufacturers in other countries.Another problem that could creep in, Sir, is that some of these manufacturers here may avoid taxing their kith£ and Some one may manufacture some goods and then because he can manage to avoid paying Value Added Tax and other taxes, he would be able to sell those goods to his kith and kin who would be able to sell them at much cheaper prices to the local distri¬butors or retailers thereby making it impossible for those who buy those same goods through the legalized means. This is where we get imbalance between some of the local people, especially indigenous Africans against the Asians. This area has been looked at very carefully because it is contributing to the big imbalance between those two groups, the local indigenous Africans and the Asians who are manufacturers and at the same time are able to sell to their kith and kin.Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, another area that we have to continue to watch closely is under-invoicing of exports and over-invoicing of imports. This is done by unscrupulous people who want to get rich very fast. They literally ruin this country by exporting goods at very low prices and when those goods reach foreign markets they are sold at very high prices. These people keep the difference in those countries and they send back to Kenya only a pittance. That is one area that we must continue to watch very closely and particularly the area of horticulture fruits and vegetables where some of these exporters can tell theirfriends abroad, to declare those goods rotten or underweight and so on. In that way they are able to convince us that those goods were of no use and they were sold at very low prices and so they keep the difference in  those  foreign countries.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, while we talk about all these economic achievements and our efforts to industrialize, export and improve our economy, we should not lose sight of the fact that behind all these achievements is His Excellency the President, Hon. Daniel T. arap Moi, who continues to ensure that this country remains in capable hands and that it is run democratically. The last week's Kanu Delegates Conference at Moi International Sports  Centre, Kasarani, was such an impressive meeting that many of us shall never forget that day." As a matter of fact, thedelegates who attended that conference I accompaniedsome of the delegates from Mount Elgon back home and they were all full of praise for what has been done in this country. That Sports Complex alone is just enough to show the whole world thatKenya is doing everything possible to achieve economicsuccess.With those remarks, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS(Mr. Mibei): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my colleagues in congratulating the i Vice-President and Minister for Finance for bringing this Motion the House for discussion. This Motion is aimed at closing the loopholes that harm our economy.	As all hon. Members know, financial management is one of the key areas in public accountability. It is in that light that the Government has tried, from time to time, to amend our laws in order to let all Kenyans know that we have proper financial management in the country.with regard to the Customs and .Excise  TariffI can see that the tariff on rawmaterials has been reduced by 5 per cent points. This is meant to increase the efficiency of our local industries. If we are toindustrialize we need raw materials. I would therefore urge those who are producing raw materials in this country to increase their production and efficiency so that we do not have to import raw materials. I would particularly appeal to those charged with the production of cotton in this country to re-examine themselves and see where they have gone wrong. This is because I am sure the if we produce enough cotton in this country we would be able to produce enough textiles for this country also export the  other countries instead of importing textiles from other country 		Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir in this Motion the duty oil imported wood pulp has been reduced. I think this is meant togive protection to our forests we would import wood pulp instead of destroying our forests at this Juncture, I would like to congratulate His Excellency the President for establishing a tree nursery at his own home. This is real very good example worth emulating by leaders and organizations. I would also like to Congregated the Kenya postsand Telecommunications Corporation for establishing a tree nursery at Mbagathi. If individuals could start tree nurseries I am sure we would increase our forests and use them for our development Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, duty on ceramic ware for laboratory use in our schools ; has beenlowered. This shows that the Vice-President and Minister for finance considers the education of our children seriously we would therefore appeal to those communities and school committees who havenot	already built laboratories in their schools to up so that they can benefit from this provision theVice-President and Minister for Finance has made.I also notice that the vice president and minister forFinance has considered the question of road safety in this country lowering duty on speed governors for motorvehicles. We know that buses and matatus have been over speed in a bid to earn more money The availability of speeds governors at reasonable prices will indeed help in reducing speed. we know that over speeding drivers have caused a lot of road accidents in this country and it is necessary that something is done to make those who over speed realise that high speed kills.Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the children of thiscountry are benefiting from traffic parks which my Ministry has established in various parts of this country. I recently opened one in Kakamega and the children there are learning about road safety. It is gratifying to note that the self-employed jua kali artisans will benefit because the duty on the items that they use has been reduced This should, therefore, encourage them to produce more items.	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, rural areas have been•given favourable consideration in this Budget. This is because duty exemption on machinery destined for rural areas has been doubled  to K£1 million. I think those who are likely to benefit from this should be informed. The Ministry of Information and Broadcastingshould publicise this matter very much so that we can have many people starting industries in the rural areas.The Vice-President and Minister for Finance has alsoconsidered the question of revenue. This is because the priceor beer was increased by 50 cents per litre. Those who drink beer should drink beer and at the same time  give us some revenue.Some people think that drinking is an offence; but drinking is not offence by itself. but it becomes an offence when one is drunk and disorderly. I think when wananchi see a man staggering under the influence of beer, without being disorderly, they should assist such a man by taking him to his home because such a man has given us somerevenue.Sir, if you come across those people who drink changa you should report them to the authorities because it is an illegal brew and harmful to peoples health. Changaa can spoil somebodys kidneys completely. Sir, on stamp duty proposals I thinkelement of earning revenue was considered. The  licensing fee under the Banking Act was raised from 10 per cent to 15 per cent and the trade licensing fee was raised by 10 per cent.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, exporter duty on scrap metal was also raised. We should not allow our scrap metal to be exported to other countries, because those countries will melt that metal and them produce some commodities which theywill later sell to us at an hexhorbitanc price. We should  acquire knowledge which will help us to convertscrap metal into useful items. Sir, we should focus our		attention on the problem of unemployment  therefore, we shouldencourage people to become self employed, like the  people With those few remarks, I beg to support the Motion.<Newspeech>[<Newspeech>MR. JALANGO: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir for giving me an opportunity to support this very important MotionSir, revenue from various forms of taxation form the bulk of therevenue  which any Government earns. Revenue is accrued from various taxes such as custom duty and excise tariffs, stamp duties and so on. Revenue is very important to any Government, and therefore, we should address ourselves to  the various taxes very critically.Sir, I do. not understand why  importers in this country year in year out, try to find ways and means of avoiding to paydirect import duty Every year, the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry fax of Finance  tries to block the loopholes, but the.exporters, come up with new ways and means of avoiding to pay custom duty This year, the  Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance, introduced some tough  penalties for importers who try to avoid paying import duty, but I feel that those penalties should have been made tougher than that. If the importers do not pay  imnort duty at all, or pays half of the amount, that also affects other areas of our economy.Sir, I would also like to point out that our country has been facing the problem of re-exportation of transit goods. Sir, I am happy to say that for the first time, the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance has addressed.itself to that problem. The Ministry has tried to find out why goods bound for neighbouring countries find their way into our country from tdune to time. This happens every day. The authorities impound vehicles, gunny bags, blankets and very many items which were supposed to be taken to our neighbouring countries, but about 90 per cent of them are sold in our country. I think the measures proposed by His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance, will help a lot, but I would request him to introduce tougher penalties. Sir, those goods are known as unacustomed goods - xfc goods which are not supposed to be a imported into this country. They do not fall under any schedule, and yet everyday those goods are impounded in Mombasa. Those goods are supposed to be re-exported, but that is never done. I think something should be done, because I believe that  those penalties are not adequate. I would like to propose thatstiffer penalties be meted to importers who bring goods into thiscountry, while still claiming that they are goods on transit.This country should not accept imported goods, which come underthe cover of goods on  transit.Sir, such kind of importation is killing ourlocal industries. Sir, if from example one million suits are inroortedinto the country as goods on transit, theywill have a very bad effect on the sale of suits which aremanufactured locally. The Ministry has given a period of12 months for goods to be re-exported. I think that sectionshould be amended so that there is no compromise at all, thegoods should be re-exported straight away.Sir, I would also like to point of out that we are losing a lot of revenue importation of motor vehicles. Some motor vehicles destined for Uganda Tanzania or Rwanda are just sold locally. By so doing, we are killing the local motor industry. Why can we not lower the duty on locally assembledmotor vehicles to the minimum and at the same time raise the rate of duty on imported motor vehicles.There is no other country which  boasts of producing some of thebest  locally assembled vehicles than Kenya. Why should wenot be proud of what we assemble locally instead  of importingvehicles. Sir, the Ministry should raise the duty on importedvehicles and minimize the duty on locally assembled vehicles.Once that gap is widened most people will stop buying the importedvehicles, but those who can afford to buy the imported vehicles,can do so, but they should be made to pay very  higt takes on them. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this also goes for spare-parts. The more models of cars we have in this country, the more spare-parts we have to import. We should encourage local manufacture of spare-parts. This is because we have the facilities for doing that For example, the Kenya Railways Corporation has a workship which can be utilised to produce spare-parts. What needs to be done to encourage them is to reduce the duty on raw materials needed to produce these spare—parts. If that was done, then this country would be self sufficient as far as spare-parts are concerned. This would in-turn assist the ordinary motorists to run their vehicles in this country. But as it is now when one goes to the shops, the Asian will always ask him whether he needs a local or imported spare-part. To a layman, the two spare-parts look the same, but they are not. The Asian asks so because he knows that the imported spare-part has no price control. I am glad to see that the duty on raw materials has been lowered for two consecutive years. Although that is so, I think, a lot can still be done so that we can encourage local production of spare- parts. We should be proud of our local products. We should adhere to the slogan - Buy Kenyan to Build Kenya. This is one way of ensuring that we succeed. I think the Ministry concerned is going in the right direction by continuing to reduce the duty on such raw materials.The other thing that we could do is to raise tax on anything that is imported into the country. This is because as I believe this country has high quality products, be they motor vehicles, clothes, spare-parts or electronic equipment. This country has the potential to produce all these things and many more. We should be proud of what we produce and manufacture. We can only do that by encouraging local industrialists.Although 10 Minutes are not enough to say all that I have got, I support the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUREITHI: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving the opportunity to contribute to this Motion. One of the primary aims of the Budget on taxation under the various Heads has been to promote exports which is a very important element in the growth of our economy in the sense that if we produce more and if we have more economic activities within . the country, then we shall have a chance of giving the people of this country more employment opportunities. This is because employment opportunitis in this country are very few. I would like to take this opportunity to thank His Excellency the President for appointing a Commission to look seriously into the issue of employment in this country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in encouraging exportation in this country, I would like to urge the relevant Ministries to encourage our people to export not only to our traditional partners in trade but to also see that they expand exports to all other areas of the world. We are aware that the European countries are moving towards the creation of a common market by 1992. The idea behind this is that once this is achieved and there is a free flow of goods and services, then in the end they will come out better than they were when they were operating on a regime of tariffs and duties. On our part, we are aware that within the African region, we have the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) group of countries. I would like to urge that a mechanism of increasing trade within the African countries and the PTA group be found and encouraged. This is because we cannot rely all the time on exporting to Europe, the United States of America and Asia. Unless we grow like those countries usually referred to as the developing countries and unless we encourage inter- African trade and among ourselves, then there is no way that we are going to develop our country.Creation of the Eurpean Common Market as has been accused of likely affecting traditional exports like agricultural, horticultural and other goods from African countries. But I believe that since our countries are linked to the Eurpoean Economic Community (EEC) under the Lome IV Convention and in view of the fact that the Lome IV Convention is a treaty that runs from 1990 to the year 2000, this is the time that we should study the provisions of thistreaty seriously to ensure-that when the common market is created in Europewe shall compete favourably with other countries and be able to benefit fromthat elarged market.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, trade between Africa and Europehas over the years been imbalanced. This is because the prices that we have beenoffered for our products like coffee have declined in comparison with the goodsthat we import. This is one of the causes of the problems that we have inthe African Continent. So, unless we grow and trade between one anotherthenthis reliance on developing countries is not going even in the long run to be beneficial to us. That is why I say that we should look at the issue critically, look at our previous benefits from such a trade, study the situation and come up with proposals or agreements on how to benefit from our products. Those people who grow coffee should come together and influence the offeredprices. This is because unless we do that, we will be at the mercy of thosewho are buying as they will demand what to pay and in the long run, we shallbe the losers even if we increase production.The method of raising taxation as presented to this House by the Vice-President and Minister for Finance indicated various. ways of achieving thisgoal. For example, there were reductions in some of the goods so as to increaselocal production in jual kali, agriculture and so on. Once funds are raised bythe Treasury, they should also make sure that .they render the services they havepromised the country. For example, even if our people increase production inmilk, tea or coffee when most of our roads during the rainy season are impassable,then whatever the farmers have produced,. will not be of any benefit to thecountry.I would like to say that there are some projects, like roads, whichshould be looked into seriously, When Questions are asked in this House withregard to the state of roads in the country, explanation are give to the effect that they were destroyed by "the current heavy rains" year in year out. I believe that we have experienced engineers who are in a position to know that  they construct a certain type of road, it will be washed away during heavy rains, we should be able to put up all weather roads not necessarily tarmac roads  so that our farmers who produce coffee, milk, tea, coffee and so on have access to the local markets. This will greatly contribute to the growth of the economy.Another area I would like to comment on is with regard to livestock.For example, for the previous one year</Newspeech><Newspeech>All HON. MEMBER: Your time is up.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUREITEI: With those few remarks, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEWA:Thank you, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to airmy views on the Financial Statement, is we are all aware,  there is need.for us to do everything possible to create job. opportunities in this country forour fast growing youth. These job opportunities can be made available byensuring that the local industry is expanded and made efficient. One way ofachieving this will be to ensure that factories are able to employ more peopleand by seeing to it that the produced goods reach the market.Sere, we have to look seriously into the element of the exportmarket. Within the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) region, we in Kenya areadvantaged in the sense that we have better infrastructurethan most countries. Maybe, we could compare ourselves favourably with, otherZimbabwe and most other countries could be used as markets for our products.Therefore, I wish to comment on the element of export compensation.I would like to congratulate the Vice-President and Minister for Finance forhaving looked into this element and for making sure that such compensation isincreased for most manufacturers. Unfortunately, I am dismayed by the factthat manufacturers of pharmaceuticals under licence are subject  to anincrease of 18 per cent VAT while their export compensation is not provided.I am six not sure whether this was a misprint or an anomaly. The pharmaceuticalindustry in Kenya is very advanced in that it is manufacturing essential drugscommonly used by the people, such as, anti-malaria, pain killers and so on.Sir, you will find that it is only the antibiotics andthat are given the element of export compensation. I think this was a misprintbecause it is pain killers and anti-malarial drugs that we manufacture in hugequantities and this is where we should take advantage by giving these products export. compensation which we have the capacity to manufacture.Our pharmaceutical industry is working below capacity  inmost cases 30 to 40 per cent. They, therefore, need to be given the necessary incentive so that they can produce not only for the local market but for the export market also. You appreciate, Sir, that if we do not give the necessary incentives then  the  market that we could export  to will buy the same products from other countries, such as, China, India and so on where patents were relaxed a-long time ago and products offered at very low prices.If I any continue with the pharmaceutical industry which I know more about, you find that, as of today, duty is still levied on the  packaging of medicines. For example duty is charged on oil, packaging materials, bottles against the pharmaceutical industry. Only a small element here is duty free whereas the larger part is dutiable. Therefore, this makes our locally manufactured products to be more expensive than those manu¬factured elsewhere and imported into this country.Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir I also wish tocongratulate the Vice President and Minister for Finance for thetaxation measures he introduced which, apart from earning us somerevenue,  will streamline the anomalies that have existed in thepasti I also, of course, thank him for the reduction of corporatetax from 42.5 per cent to 40 per cent.In the past productivity has been hampered, particularly in some of the food processing factories in this country, by mismanagement I have in mind the food processing plant in Kilifi that in the a nast ha? been mismanaged and, as we talk here now,this factory is not operating appreciate that measures are being taken to rehabilitate this plant. However, I believe that as we loo for efficiency and ways and means of reducing Budget deficits, we should ensure that people employed to run very important industries like the cashewnuts plant in ELlifi, should have management know-how and not people picked for the sake of it. To say the least, someof them are very expensive watchmen rather than being managers worththeir salt.Short of privatisiation, some of these factory managements should be thoroughly scrutinized to ensure that only  professional in production, marketing and finance management run them. This isbecause closure of a factory is very painful to the people: the social welfare of an entire population in a given are completely put in disarray. Therefore, apart from ensuring that Budget deficits do not get in obviously the Government has to go out of its way to rehabilitate some of these factories  I think the human suffering also needs to be associated to these problems.with those comments I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILDLIFE (Mr.Gakunju)Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute on this very important Motion.I would like to say that generally this was a good Budget. The Vice-President and Minister for Finance has this year looked into various matters with a view to boosting the economy The lowering of customi and excise duty on specific items is a very welcome move I hope that in future this move will be progressively continuedso that we could encourage more and more people to get into industries.Reduction of duty  on raw materials imported into thiscountry for manufacture of goods is for both local export shouldbe of particular significance to us.There have been several complaints regarding theadministration of the value Added Tax (VAT). I want to stress theneed of standing the operations and calculations of VATso that unscrupulous traders do not tax take advantage of wananchiwho are not familiar with this complicated taxation. we do notwant traders and some professionals to take advantage of thelow level of literacy and understanding of our people. For thatreason more and. more simplified forms for calculation of theVAT should be devised.The requirement that exporters be paid compensation onpresentation of their claims is a very welcome move. This is becausein the past, there have been several complaints in this area. There will be reduction of delay due to prompt payment on presentation of claims. I was just wondering whether the  Vice-President and Minister for Finance and his officers would look into the possibility of paying compensation to exporters, of agricultural products. This is because a lot also goes into growing preparationand exporting of agricultural commodities, like horticultural products. In fact those who export agricultural products spehd a lot of time, money and also  run a very big risk. This is because sometimes there is shortage of storage and air spaces at the airport and many other shortcomings on this side. When goes arrive on the other side there are also risks of your goods being condemned as perishables .unfit for human consumption. For that many exporters lose whole consignments; this is a business that has to be done with speed and efficiency. So, while I agree that these are not manufactured products, I appeal to the Ministry to look into the possibilities of paying compensation to exporters of agriculturalcommodities so that we can boost our exports.  On the question of income tax,Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir,the reduction that was made is a very welcome move and we congratulate the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance. Last year, income tax was reduced from 45 per cent to 42.5 per cent, and this year it was reduced to 40 per cent. This will encourage not only companies to expand, but also foreign investors to invest more because when you talk to investors, the first thing they ask you is the level of taxation. If this taxation is higher than that obtainable in other comparable areas, one is bound to consider this element in deciding on the level of his investment. So, it is very welcome indeed that corporation tax has been reduced from 42.5 per cent to 40 per cent. We hope that next year there will be a further reduction in this tax. If this goes on progressively, we will be competitive in attracting foreign investments and encouraging local investors.With regard to trade licences, this is a very cumbersome system because traders complain  and this is true  that some of them obtain six, seven, eight or even 10 licences for one type of business. It is my hope that we will progressively look into this matter with a view to reducing the number of licences obtainable for one business so that traders may cut down on the number of visits they make to various places to get licences.With these few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to contribute to this Motion, as presented by the Vice-President and Minister for Finance. Before I make my relevant remarks on the Motion, I wish to take this opportunity to thank His Excellency the President for the manner in which he has brought peace and stability to this country. As all hon. Members know, peace is vital for equitable distribution in any situation, and where there is no peace, there is no development. We cannot achieve much where there is wrangling, misunderstanding and political intrigue. So, on this line, I wish to congratulate His Excellency the President on the manner in which he has steered this nation, particularly in  the last few-months , culminating in the very successful meeting of the Annual Delegates at Kasarani. All Kenyans are very grateful to His Excellency the President for this achievement.Turning to the Motion itself, this is a very good Motion to the nation because projects in the country cannot be implemented without funds, and what is beingproposed here is quite obvious. The Government must have funds in order to render services to its people. So, it is upon us, as the Legislature, to scrutinise., these issues and approve them in order to give authority to the officers charged with the responsibility of collecting taxes to carry out their duties. In doing this, however, some of us have a lot of misgivings on the part of the officers who are charged with this responsibility. We have had very discouraging cases to the tax-payer because the activities of tax collectors have tended to negate the responsibility they are charged with. If a mwananchi parts with Shs.5/= or Shs.l0/= and does not see anything beingdone with that money, he will naturally not be happy. Instead, he will be very unco—operative in future Harambee collections. So, it is incumbent upon the officers charged with tax collection to be a little bit more patriotic to this country in order to win the ordinary mwananchi's trust If there is any misuse of these funds, it will very difficult for the Government to collect taxes as required.We have read about such cases in the newspapers. Take an example of water bills, which are collected by local authorities. A consumer pays for water regularly, but sometimes he pays not for water, but for air which goes through the water meter, trusting that he is helping the Government to get more funds in order to render services. In the end, this money does not go into improving services to the mwananchi. Such cases are becoming very common. In addition, there are a lot of uncollected arrears in the form of these bills. As I am speaking now, Bungoma Municipal Council has uncollected water bills amounting to almost Shs.3.6 million, and yet wananchi have been paying for water all this time. The truth is that it is the municipal council, which collected the money, that has not paid the Ministry of Water Development. Naturally, this is a little disheartening to wananchi. We can go through a whole litany of examles relating to various Ministries and departments but the situation is the same all the way through.Take another example of trade licences. Those of us who have been field officers know that some officers charged with the collection of iirade licence money collude with traders for their own benefit. I can quote examples in this line. Sometime in March, 1990, some officers from the Weights and Mwasures Department visited my local shopping centre checking on weighing machines and measures. You are not supposed to pay more than Shs.l00/= to get a weighing machine stamped, but I was there and observed that one of these officers was called aside and treated to food and drinks. When you calculate how much the trader concerned paid for these things, you find that it is more than what he would have otherwise paid for the mere stamping of his weighing machine. </Newspeech>  In the end the machines were not stamped and the officer went away carrying chickens and whatever else he was given. That kind of collusion is very bad because such an officer is clearly not patriotic. He is clearly not working the way he should, that is, collecting revenue for use by various Ministries. So long as such an officer goes out there and gets whatever he thinks is good for himself, he forgets about collection of Government taxes.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, what I am doing is to impress upon those corrupt Government officers the need to be patriotic to this country. Govern¬ment officers should be able to collect the necessary taxes. People are willing to pay taxes, but with the kind of attitude Government officers are showing, we are not going to move very far.Lastly, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch on the money that is collected in form of tax and put in the national kitty. When it comesto the distribution of that money We are very grateful that we have the districtfocus for rural development strategy which is a brainchild of His Excellency the President, and that ensures that each district gets a bit of the national cake. When money is collected in form of tax, it should be properly utilised. While districts are striving to utilise these funds properly, there are tendencies where accounting officers and their representatives in the districts tend to misuse the funds. This has been clearly shown and tabled in this House by the Public Accounts Committee and it is clear that funds collected in form of tax do not necessarily go to carry out services to the people. So, once again, I am calling upon accounting officers and their representatives in the districts to be a little bit more careful and more serious in the use of public funds once we have collected taxes. We are witnessing the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance working very hard to find ways and means of raising revenue for the Government, and it would be very disheartening to find that funds so collected and voted by this Parliament get misused by officers who are not patriotic.With those few remarks, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAGWIMA: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to join my colleagues in saying a few things regarding this Motion.First of all, I wish to congratulate His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for taking keen interest and for presenting to this House this very important Motion that proposes to introduce measures thatwill improve our economy. The first measure is on Customs and Excise Tariff. It is important to note that this Motion among other things, intends to seal loopholes that have been existing and that hawe deprived the Kenya Government of income that would have gone a long way in supporting projects that wananchi in the rural areas need very much. I have in mind projects such as access roads to those areas that produce food crops and other crops for export. It is important that people in this country should feel that they are being fairly served, so that we do not go taxing a small section of people whereas others use the loopholes that exist and run away with the money should would have otherwise used to serve the community. I, therefore, commend the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance because, instead of dealing the question of preparing a budget and leaving it as it were, we now have a chance to go into details of those areas that affect our economy.The other aspect that I wish to touch on is the Value Added Tax. We note from the Budget Speech that administration of this fax has also been improved to such an extent that we do not overtax people on commodities that the ordinary wananchi use. As you know, there is sales tax and the there is the Value Added Tax, and at times there has been a big confusion between the two. At times, some of our shrewd businessmen have used the existing loopholes to tax people twice, and some of the money is not submitted to the Treasury. It is important, therefore, that we clarify these two issues and, if need be, use the Kenya Broadcasting corporation to educate wananchi on their rights regarding the two issues. We can use that medium to tell wananchi the difference between sales tax and value added  otherwise the two are causing a big confusion. We could even use the local newspapers to educate the masses regarding these two items. It is not enough to debate these items in this House and be satisfied that they will be implemented accordingly. The Kenya Broadcasting Corporation would be doing wananchi a great service if it came up with programmes to educate wananchi on the newly introduced things. Otherwise, when you introduce an item and you do not have proper communication to those who are affected there is likely to be confusion and the Government could easily be blamed for over¬taxing the people. If people are properly educated on those items and the stand of the Government, they easily know when businessmen are overtaxing them. So, we should try as much as possible to ensure that we communicate effectively to those people who are affected by our proposals.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, further to the charges on imported items, it is important that we treat people equally. Otherwise, the Customs and Excise Duty will go on pressing on the ordinary people who do not have the influence to go bargaining for exemption. There are very few ordinary people who have the access to those who approve exemptions. So, what we continue to do is to press the ordinary mwananchi on Customs and Excise Duty and leave those who are able to pay such duties go scot-free. This amounts to overtaxing our people and it even goes further to discouraging our people from supporting our Government. We should be fair. When we declare how much should be paid in terms of taxes, everybody should be covered uniformly. If anything, we should look for the very poor mwananchi and exempt him from paying those taxes where necessary. Sir, with regard to locally manufactured goods, it ismost important to note that for us to improve the situationof unemployment, we should invest in industries. we shouldencourage foreign investors to come to this country and startbuilding industries. Therefore, the fact that we areassisting export compensation on locally manufactured goodsis very important and this will encourage industries to manufacture items that will be exported.One industry can employ about 2,000 people and this is more important than to encourage people to import Mercedes Benz Cars and so on. I know, as an engineer, what it means to encourage those in the manufacturing industries. Manufacturing industries do not only  spare parts of motor vehicles, but also proce¬ssed foods like meat, French beans; and so on. If there is a wayin which we can tax them and not only in towns, the better wewould be inviting more people in these towns which are already congested and, therefore, we would be causing problems in terms of services to wananchi. So, when we are talking of industries, vie should entourage setting up of industries in rural areas. For instance, let us set up industries in areas where we have, say, cotton or set up fruit canning industries in those areas that are producing oranges, pineapples, and so on. I support the Bill because it encourages those that invest outside towns, and that is why they are being exempted from Income Tax. There¬fore, I would still insist that we have information reaching those that will be affected and those that will be of service to others.with those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr.Muturia):Asante sana, Bw Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipatia nafasi hliili nami nijiunge na wabunge wenzangu katika kumshuiaixu Makamu waRais nawaziri wa Fedha mara nyingine tena kwa kazi Mi nsuri anayo liendelea ku fanyia taifa hili letu la Kenya.Mambo haya unayoyaona yote katika Hoja hii ni jsa nmJri_mu namanufaa kwa nchi hii yetu.

Since  our reports net show any contributions with regard to Mr.Wabuli and subsequently chains made or hits, than the Minister will not take action. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Dr.WAMEYO: Sir. the employee has not attained the mandatoryage for climbing the N.S.S.F. benefits  he wants to know how much money is in his since he has the N.S.S.F number .

AMIN: I said that I do not know any thing about the N.S.S.F contribution from liumias Sugar Company Limited as far as Mr. Wabuli is concerned. The hon. Member's Question is a different thing all together. I have said there is no money or. this particular employee. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. falana: On a point of order, Sir. The Assistant Minister is either confused or is trying to confuse the House. This is very clear. We agree that this money has, perhaps, not reached his Ministry, as he says. He has also said that the employee has not complained to his Ministry. The employee does not have to complain to him but he has complained to his Member of Parliament, Br. Wameyo, to take up the matter on his behalf. Dr. Wameyo has also said that the of !Mr. Wabuli shows that deductions have been made in respect of N.S.S.F. contribution and that such money has not been remitted to the Fund. This amounts to theft. Since the Assistant Minister has now known that the  money has been deducted and has not been remitted to the Fund, what action is he going to take to ensure that this money is remitted? </Newspeech>  	<Newspeech>Mr.D.M.Amin: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have no records for this particular employee. Therefore we do not know, whether he has contributed any money to the fund. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. P.G. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for the Assistant Minister to wait until this employee attains the age of 50 years so that he can take action is opting for a cure when a prevention is available.

Questioner The Assistant Minister does not seem to be serious, but he should know that the hon. Member is receiving the reply on behalf of a mwananchi. The Assistant Minister seems to imply that the man in question is not a an employee of this company But before he  prepared this answer he should have contacted from pa Sugar Company Ltd to confirm whether Mr.Wabuli is their employee.<Newspeech>Mr.D.M.Amin: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, obviously he is an employee of that company</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.Wabuge: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, will the Assistant Minister agree with me that since 1965, when the N.S.S.F. was started, up to 1972 it used to send statements to its contributors and that since 1972 it has not been sending out such statements? This means that there is so such confusion in the Fund that nobody knows what account belongs to whom. How, due to the sane confusion, the Assistant Minister Trill not be able to answer this Question effectively. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr.D.M.Amin: Mr.; Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is a differentquestion.The Ministry Knows what it is doing and it has all therecords. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG1OLI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the Ministry has the records, why is the Assistant Minister saying that the  Ministry does not have records of Mr. Wabuli's contributions? The law requires that all N. S.S.F. deductions be remitted to the Fund. If the company is deducting Mr. Wabuli's N. S.S.F. dues without remitting them to the Fund it is contravening the law. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. D.M.

D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is only in respect of this particular employee that we do not have records.

But the second national game reserve is notcalled Eachole but is-called "Rahole". Could the Assistant Ministertell us when these game reserves were gazetted and what developments have taken place since that gazettement? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AWORI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Arawale was gazette  on 1st Nonember, 1974; Rahcle was gazetted on 9th January, 1976 and 3oni was gazetted also on 9th January, 1976. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SALAT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has not answered the second part of ±ne my question, namely what developments have taken in these game reserves since they were gazetted. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

But Ithink the Assistant Minister is misleading the	House. Since thesegame reserves were gazetted some 16 years ago,	no single developmentbeen done in them. half of my constituency is taken up byArawale Gase Reserve. Since these game reserves have never beendeveloped, would the Assistant Minister consider degazetting, atleast, some of them so that wananchi could  move freely with  their livestock He should consider that people in that area are nomads  who move with their livestock from place to place in search of pastured</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AWORI: No, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will not consider degazetting these areas because to date I frankly do not know what other developments would like us to have made. If it is the question of building lodges there, what an opportunity for hon. Sal at to make money by putting up some lodges in any one of the game reserves. </Newspeech><Newspeech>KR. SALAT: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to tell us that these game reserves have been set aside for the purpose of maintaining all the animals there whereas they have no economic significance to the people there? Is he in order to mislead us when we know that the game reserves are there to serve the people nearby and the animals there? There are no animals there for tourists to watch. Are they going to watch camels, cows and goats? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AWORI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are animals in those game reserves. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.G. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as the hon. Questioner puts it, these game reserves encompass an area that is normally for cattle grazing by the nomads there ar.d, through the gazettement of the reserves, herdsmen have lost access to the areas. So, these herdsmen should be seen to be compensated in one-way or another, teat benefits have the nomads of Garissa derived from these gaae reserves so far? </Newspeech><Newspeech>mR. AWORI: Kr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if these game reserves were gazetted 16 years back, how is it that the hon. Member says that they have not assisted the nomads in the area? . </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.G. GODARA: Is the hon. Assistant Minister in order to allege that I actually said that the game reserves are not benefiting the people there? I asked him to tell the House how these game reserves have benefited the people. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AWORI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, benefits from the game reserves are derived from the fees that are paid by the tourists visiting the reserves. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SALAT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are not heading anywhere, and the Assistant Minister is misleading the House and the whole country. In tears of revenue, there is not even that the Government has earned from any of these reserves because no tourist visits them. Could he tell the House what benefit the people of that area and the Government have gained from gazetting these areas? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AWORI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I can only repeat what I havesaid. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I think this issue needs clarification. Are you, Mr. Salat, saying that no tourists at all visit these game reserves? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SALAT: Yes, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, no tourists at all visit these game reserves. I challenge the Assistant Minister to produce evidence to show that any revenuehas been earned from the reserves. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AWORI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if a tourist visits these game reserves and stays some 100 miles away from the reserves, he will have paid for the petrol he has used to go there and used a Kenyan self-drive car, in which case, the country has benefited. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.G. GODANA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the hon. Assistant Minister is deliberately misleading the House by saying that these game reserves are benefiting our people. Could he give us in figures how much revenue was earned from these reserves, say, last financial year, and. what development projects have been assisted with this revenue? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AWORI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, not all game reserves have gates at which you get entry receipts. The country, as a whole, is benefiting when a tourist travels from one place to another. We benefit because the tourist goes there driving in a Kenyan car and petrol. Sometimes, you cannot quantify thisbenefit. </Newspeech>Question Ho. 289 Payment of Outstanding Balance for Ex-Diani Complex ResortMR.

Assistant Minister, I am left in a lot of doubt as to how the answer was obtained because part (a) of his answer says that the local district development committee did not approve this project, whereas I know that last year, Meru District Development Committee approved the project and requested that the area under review be irrigated so-that we may support a similar programme that was started in 1986. Could the Assistant Minister tell us how he obtained his answer? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MOKKU:. Mr. Deputy Speaker. Sir. the hon. Member says that the local district development committee has approved the site for irrigation, but in part (c) of ay answer I said that the Ministry is aware that the soils within the site are not fit for irrigation purposes. That is the advice we got from the technical officers. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAGWIMA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, whereas we are grateful to His Excellency the President for introducing the Ministry of Reclamation and Development of Arid, Semi-Arid and Wastelands, the Assistant Minister in the Ministry is condemn¬ing this area in question instead of reclaiming and developing it. That way, the Ministry cannot be useful. We should be told whether the Ministry is there to condemn rather than reclaiming and developing the area.MR. MOKKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I did not condemn the area as a whole. As far as my Ministry is concerned, the area has a purpose but not irrigation. Indeed, I have some additional information for the hon. Member to the effect that the Kathwana Soil Conservation Site was initiated by His Excellency the President on 16th April, 1983. The size of the site is about 10 hectares. The soils are shallow and much of the terrain is rugged. After a long time of uncontrolled exploitation by-man and livestock—</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Is the Assistant Minister not contradicting himself and misleading this House in his answer? He has said that the technical Ministries have not recommended the area for irrigation, and yet in his conclusion he says that the area is not suitable, according to the feelings of the Ministry. Is that not contradictory? In his earlier reply, he said that the technical people, that is, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Water Development, have not recommended the area for irrigation. Now he is giving us another answer which defeats the earlier one that the technical people have not advised his Ministry. Is he not misleading this House? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MOKKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I said that the technical officers did not advise the Ministry to the effect that the area can be considered for irrigat¬ion purposes. However, I said that; the area has another purpose, about which I was going to inform the House. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Do you have the facts with you? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MOKKU: Sir, the answer is here and I can give it. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEbE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is still misleading the House because he has said that the technical advice has not been received, and again he says that irrigation will be based on firm professional advice from the relevant Ministries. Is he in order to continue mis¬leading the House by answering the Question while he does not have sufficient technical information from the Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Water Develop¬ment? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MOKKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wanted the hon. Member to get me right. I said that the area is not suitable for the purposes of irrigation, and I went ahead to say that it has another purpose for which it can be used. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: on a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I still insist that either fee Assistant Minister withdraws his earlier reply and gives us what he is trying to give us or we erase the whole Question so that he can come and give us a factual answer since he has the information from the technical people. He initially said that he had not received technical advice, and he continued to say that according to the advice he got the Kathwana Soil Conservation Site is not suitable for irrigation. If both statements run concurrently, then the answer he is giving is wrong and he is misleading the House. I would like him to withdraw his initial reply. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MOKKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker. Sir, I think the hon. Member should take time and list to  I stated that the area is not suitable for irrigation and that there is a better purpose for the area</Newspeech>E.3.<Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: The Assistant Minister is on a point of order. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Yes, what is it, hon. Malebe? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I still insist that the hon. Assistant Minister is misleading this House because he has no basis of saying that the area is not suitable for irrigation. He has no technical report indicating that the area is unfit for irrigation. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. M0KKU: Mr. Depouty Speaker, Sir, I wanted to give the basis upon which I as basing ay statement that the area is not suitable for irrigation. I hope the hon. Member could give at the to give the House the relevant facts.Sir, Kathwana Soil Conservation Site was initiated by His Excellency on  16th April, 1983. The size of the area is 10 hectares. The soils are shallow and the terrain is auch rugged. After a long the of uncontrolled exploitation by man and livestock, the site was abandoned as it became bare and degraded. The purpose of setting aside the site was to demonstrate rehabilitation techniques to the local community. In our effort to rehabilitate the site, the following measures were  taken by. the community at large.	-Building gabions for gulley controlTerracing and planting grasses to stop soil erosionPlanting of trees to improve the general environment.In addition to this, Sir; the whole site has been fenced for preservation purposes. At the moment, natural growth has established again.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, an estimated cost of bringing water to the site from the nearest water point is in the region of KShs.2 million. It will involve placing a powerful water push at the nearest water point, laying pipes to the site and constructing a water reserve for distribution. Considering the size of the size, which is only 10 hectares, irrigating it will not even prove effective and, therefore, the project of irrigation on the site is not viable. In any case, the area where the site.is situated is not an agricultural area as such. All along,the area has been livestock-keeping region with goats being preferred to all others. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALLANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from the hon. AssistantMinister's answer, I think there are about three or four contradictions. In thefirst place, the written answer says, "My Ministry cannot consider irrigating"and the grounds the Assistant Minister gives are three. One, that the local districtdevelopment committee has not approved the project; two, that they know that thesoil is not good and, three, that the technical Ministries have not given theirprofessional advice. Now, which is which? Even if the local district committee approves the project, and the Ministry finds that the soils in the area are shallow, then there will be no point of the local district development committee having to approve the irrigation. Could the Assistant Minister tell us which of the three issues he has raised is legitimate? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MOKKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is no confusion in my reply.I stated that my Ministry cannot consider irrigating the area in question for the reasons I have given. If the hon. Member wants me to repeat, the reason is that  this area is considered fit for keeping livestock and not for agricultural purposes. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Is the Assistant Minister in order to continue misleading this House? Of course, it has been put to him that the irrigation requested is not for making the area agriculturally viable but for making the grass and a forestation there good for the reclamation of the land. I do not think the Assistant Minister understands the Question at all. The irrigation requested is purely to make the trees and grass in the area grow so that the area can be reclaimed. Can he elaborate as to whether he understands the Question? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MOKKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think hon. Kagwina and hon. Malebe asked two different questions things. Hon. Kagwina wanted that are3 to be considered for irrigation purposes and hon. Malebe wanted that area to be considered for afforestation. My Ministry is currently carrying out £ks a forestation on that . area by building gabions planting trees and improving the general vegetation. That is what we are doing right now. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On  a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir. Hon. Kagwinas Question is very clear, and it reads like this could the Ministry consider  irrigating Kathwana National Soil Conservation Site in Meru District?" The hon. Questioner wants that area to be made viable for irrigation, but now the Assistant Minister is telling us of things which have not even being Question. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MOKKU: Sir, hon. Kagwima wants that area to be used. for irrigation,, but according, to. the technical advice received from my Ministry, that area is not suitable for  irrigation, but it is suitable for afforestation, and that is what we are doing right now. My Ministry is trying to reclaim such areas. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAGWTMA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.the Question that I had put forward was requesting theMinistry to consider irrigating only the  Kathwana NationalSoil Conservation site but not the entire area, for the purposes of having green grass and trees. Is the  Assistant Minister therefore, in order to say that I asked for irrigation of theentire area? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MOKKU: If the hon. Mer.ber has been listening carefully, I said that the site is only 10 acres For that area to be irrigated, we need Kshs.2 million, therefore, I do not think that is available project. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.KAGWIMA: On a  ooint of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker,Sir, </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Certificate</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Deputy 5oeaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Education the following Question by Private Notice. When will the Kenya National Examinations Council release the 1936 K.C.S.E. Certificate of Mr. Wanyonyi W. Wafula Index No.62050027, and other  former students of NdengelwaSecondary School, Bungona. </Newspeech>»<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Amayo) :Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Mr. Wanyonvi W. Wafula Index No.62050027 sat for hisKenya Certificate of Secondary Education (K.C.S.E.) in 1986 atNdengelwa Secondary School in Bungoma District. He wasamong the 26 candidates from that school whose certificateshad not been printed. The Kenya National Examination Council isprinting those certificates, and as soon as they are ready,they will be dispersed to that school. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANT: Can the Assistant Minister tell the Housewhat caused the delay of printing those certificates since 1986to todav? Those students depend on their certificates in order toms obtain jobs in fact most or the are still  tarmacking.  Some of the certificates were printed, and only 27 of them were left out, couldhe  therefore, tell us what caused that  delay? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AMAYO: I think it is necessary to give a brief back¬ground of this particular case. There were 47 candidates in that particular school, out of that  five of then failed in their examinationstherefore, 42 certificates were supposed to be used  for thosecandidates who had passed However, inadvertently, only 16 certificates were printed, and accordingly collected by the headmaster.. That information was not available to the Ministry until the headmaster drew.the attention of the Kenya National Examination Council	and  it was only after that when instructions were given for the remaining certificates to be printed and dispatched. Therefore, it wasit an intentional error in the part of the Kenya National ExaminationsCouncil. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.G. GODANA: sir, I hoTe char the Assistant Minister has realised that that was a very serious error. The Kenya National Examination Council is supposed to know how many candidates sat for  examinations for. every school  the country, and whether they have also received their certificates. Those certificates took four years to be printed, and therefore, it means that those candidates cannot get jobs. Could the Assistant Minister now tell us whether he has found out the person who was responsible for that error, and the action he has taken against his? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AMAYO: We understand the. inconvenience that wascaused to those students, but I would like to state here thatwe have already admitted that error. We accept that responsibility. I would also like to  add that appropriate instructions have been given for a timely action by the Kenya National Examinations Council. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: I appreciate that answer from the Assistant Minister, but could he now tell us whether those certificateshave abreact been printed, whether they are being oriented, and when they will be handed over to those students. They have been deniedthe  chance to acquire jobs while some of them by now could have beenchief inspectors or deputy headmasters in certain schools.Could he tell us whether those certificates have already beenoriented and are waiting to be dispatched? How can the printingof certificates take four years? Are they ready now, or they take another four years? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AMAYO: I have taken this issue very seriously, and  already indicated that the certificates ka are being printed, and as soon as their verification is done, they will be disoatched to their owners. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Next Order! </Newspeech><Header> POINTS OF ORDER </Header ><Newspeech>MR. KAGWIMA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.last year I raised a Question in this House regarding atin dispensary in my area known as Kamanyaki Dispensary, andthe then Assistant Minister for Health promised me that duringthis Financial Year, the Kenyan Government would use approximatelyKshs.1.5 million to construct a dispensary in that area. unfortunately, Sir, during the month of May this year, some officers from the Ministry went to that dispensary and discontinued its services. That area does not have proper communication  andtherefore, the people in that area are suffering due to lack of medical services.  Last year, I was also promised that the government would use some money to develop that dispensary, of developing it, it was closed down. At that time  somebody was employed, and sent to that dispensary, but before he could reach there and start discharging his duties, he dispensary was closed down. Sir, can the Ministry consider re-opening  that  dispensary, because, repairs of toilets and house have already been carried out of by the people on Harambee basis. If that is done, the people will take hon. Ministers h£ seriously. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is there anybody from the Ministry of health? Yes, Dr. B. A. Godana. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH(Dr. B.A. Godana): Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, the House will appreciate the fact that I	definitely need to refresh ny mind about the hon. Member's point of order. But I would like to assure the House that I willtake up the matter with the Ministry's officials and I would be gladif the hon.' Member could supply me with the  details	of the problem he highlighted. I would also like to assure the  House that the Ministry will make a Ministerial Statement regarding  this issue soon. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER  FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): On a point of order, Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir.	!I rise on a point of order to clarify an issue regardingthe National Social Security Fund Membership. The position of the N.S.S.F. .members whose accounts do not show any contributions is .usually as follows:When an employer engages an employee, he is required to report immediately to the N.S.S.F. After receiving that report fromthe employer, the N.S.S.F. issues a number to the employer Normally, the employer should then remit funds to the N.S.S.F. to the account of that particular number. But rrhat happens quite frequently is that once a number has been allocated very often the employer does not remit the funds to the N.S.S.F. According the law, theN.S.S.F. should proceed against the employer legally and ensure thatthat the money is resifted to the Fund. Sometimes it is not	possible to do all this because there so many cases to be handledand very often one or two cases gets overlooked. In the. case of "the Mumias Sugar Company, for instance, we got the numbersallotted to these employees but we never got the funds coming to us from Mumias Sugar Company. 1e have not received contributions from Mumias Sugar Company. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, when we got this	Questionwe had a look at and we found that Muni as Sugar Conroariy has a few cases sinilar to this one So, we have sent a request over to Mumias Sugar Company asking then to forward all these contributions to us as soon as possible. We usually have a schedule indicating thenane of the person, the years we have not received his contributions the fira is supposed to complete this form and send it to us. Now, this is what we have done regarding Question No.273 as soon we get this information we will be in a position to inform the contributor what his position is.Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question say then arise as to why we have not lone it before. This is because there so many of these cases that it is not easy for the Fund to look into t he a all' at once. rut we are in the process of weeding them out by way of our inspectors visiting the  and seeing to it that thesecontributions cone to us. The re a firm fails to contribute we take the firm to court. However, they are afraid of going to court and they usually pay up and so will be Humias Sugar Company as well.

DEPUTY Speaker: I understand that hon. Muturia was on the Floor when the House adjourned. Is hon. Muturia not here? sir. Kyalo. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER 0F STATE, OFFICE 0F THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Kyalo):Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me thisopportunity to speak on the various items appearing in this Motion.These proposals are meant to streamline the measures announced inthe Financial Statement that was delivered by the Vice-President andMinister for Finance. The Financial Statement given by the Vice-President and Minister for Finance is aimed at streamlining various aspects of our economy. The Financial Statement has ushered us into an age industrialization in thiscountry. When you look at the proposals contained in the Financial Statement, you will find that they aim at giving . teeth to what the  Vice-President and Ministerfor Finance had outlined in this House. These proposals willalso streamline our system of taxation and also create conditions that Trill enable this country to achieve success in various aspects of economic development.-	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, one thing is clear, that once weimplement the  various measures that have beenoutlined in the Financial Statement and once we implement. the othermeasures that Vice-President and Minister for Finance had outlined,this country will have to gird itself and prepare itself for manyother things. We need to intensify other measures that willstrengthen our economy. When we look at our marketing, we find thatthere is need to re-examine our marketing system. In particular thereare areas where we have not taken adequate measures to ensure thatthe system is strengthened. With  regard to the marketing ofour coffee, you will find that we have tended to dwell on smallareas in Europe that have been our traditional markets. It is a good thing that we have now started selling our coffee to Japan but we have the whole of Eastern Europe where we have not done very much to -strengthen the marketing of our coffee. I would therefore urge the Ministers for  Agriculture and Commerce to look intothe possibility of opening up new markets in East European countries because the potential there is quite tremendous. The Soviet Union and other East European countries have been buying coffee through agents. We need to ensure that we sell our coffee directly to these countries. I would even go further and suggest that we should. open trade offices in those countries because the potential is tremendous. Mr. Temporary deputy Speaker, Sir, today, Kenyans have becomevery good agriculturalists and they are able to ,jrov the best quality agricultural : ^ i crops. for this reason, there is need for the Ministry 01 Agriculture to	establish a department which will, more or less rival any other departmentin that Ministry so as to encourage ;horticultural production in Kenya. AsI said, the potential for horticultural production in this country is enormous !in that there are areas were we have constructed darts and there are still other areas where we could do so. Therefore, there is no reason why we should not	he in a position to irrigate more land for this project to be viable.The problem we are facing in so far as horticulrural production is concerned,	is  lack of transportation, we know that we are not getting adequate cargo	space and the any only solution to this problem is to enccurage privateentrepreneurs to enter into the business of buying planes for transportingour horticultural products. At  the moment, we still need a lot of spare partsar.d the Kenya Airways cannot do much in the area of transportation tut these	private entrepreneurs could no a lot of encourage farmers by buying planes to export our horticultural products.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, know that the markets in the Preferential Trade Area receive a lot of goods from us hut I think the tine .	has cone for us to improve on the quality of our goods row going to these markets. I as saying this because we are facing competition from other	countries and there is no reason why our industrial sector is not in a position		to produce better quality goods which can compete with goods from other countriesin the world, we know that the potential for opening up industries in thiscounty is still there and I therefore think that industrial promotion centresshould be established in areas where we can produce more goods. I am sayingso because the chances are there and the scope is tremendous.	with those few remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwina): There being no other hon. Member wishing to speak, I will now call upon the Mover to reply. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I would like to take this opportunityto thank hon. Members who have so ably contributed to debate on this Motion..As may hon. Members have said, this is a very important  Motion becauseit states quite clearly some of the changes that we in Treasury intend to make cakingregarding making the collection of Government Revenue much more efficient. This doesnot sear, that collection of Govern nest Revenue has not been efficient, butwhat it means is that we do need to strengthen some of the departments relatedto the collection of revenue. Hon. members will remember that during-thepresentation of the Budget Speech, The Vice-President and Minister for Financestated that physical policy can play an important role in supplementing andstimulating expert growth. A restrictive physical policy is therefore necessaryfor us tc maintain stability in cur domestic economy and for the release ofresources food to  the relevant private sectors. - This policy is  also vital forexport production and for supporting the can policies that are be imposed to facilitate these changes.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do  intend to say more when we move into the next stage, that is the Secord Reading of the Bill. Therefore, all I  would like to do at the thank hon. Memberamo’s sincerely for "their able contribution to debate on this Motor.. I would like to say that whatever they have said in support to this Motion will be taken into consideration.With those few remarks, I beg to move. (Question put and agreed to) </Newspeech>	Second Reading<Header> The Finance Bill </Header> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Kariuki): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move that The Finance Bill be now read a Second Time.As we are all aware, hon. Members have already discussed the Motion that was a prelude to this Bill and, therefore, I do not intend to tire the hon. Members by saying too much on this Bill. All I would like to emphasise is that this Bill, like I said before in response to hon. Members contributions in the Motion, is meant to strengthen some of the departments that are concerned with the collection of revenue within the Ministries. Like I said, we remember very  well that during the Budget Speech the Vice-President and Minister for Finance stated that fiscal policies can play and will continue to play a very important role in supplementing and stimulating export growth.Sir, hon Members might have noted that- in the Budget  Speech the Minister did state that there has been an increase in revenue which was partly due to the introduction of the Value Added Tax (V.A.I.) and  we expect increasing gains from tax over the next few years. In this year's Budget, we have continued - our efforts to shift the tax structure towards indirect taxa¬tion. At the same time, we have continued and expanded the taxmodernization programme in the Treasury with the aim Of restrict- Taxing our tax system by also increasing the efficiency of the tax administration.In this regard, Sir, I would like this to be a warning to the tax defaulters who have in the previous years sat very comfortably thinking that the Government was not going to catch up with then. I must warn then now that the Government is going to be particularly strict with the tax defaulter you may find a number of them going to court on either criminal or civil suits.So, I would like to appeal to all Kenyans to be very carefulabout that because our "hand" is going to be very long and also	our "net" is going to be very wide.	Sir, developing countries seldom manage to mobilize more	 than 20 per cent of their domestic product in tax buy as theyprogress they replace borrowed resources with revenue arising	from their increased prosperity. I am pleased, therefore, to	inform hon. Members that we have raised our tax revenue efforts and are now approaching the target of 24 per cent of cross domestic 	Product (G.D.P.). This is stated in the Sessional Paper No.l of 1936, but unfortunately, I must report that our endeavours' to control the growth of expenditure have not been as successful, and we are still well above the Sessional Paper goal of 25 per cent of G.D.P. In fact, this has beer, a consequence of the need to provide recurrent expenditure so as to apportionalise past development projects. This must continue to be a key area of concentration, if we are to regain fiscal balances and release productive resources for export expansion.Sir, I would now like to turn to specific -Protocols which will be affected by this Sill. First of all I will is with 	the Customs and Excise Tariff. Over the past years, we have gradually been changing our import policy, relying less on qualitative restriction and more on tariff In early 1989, we liberalized the import licence policy dramatically, and if we continue with this reform and, at the same time, rationalise and modify the tariff structure of imports, we are shifting a number of items from Schedule 1.1.1.c. to 1.1.1.b. At the same time, we propose to lower the average ; tariff on all the items that were previously pat on Schedule other than  by an average of about 5 per cent.First, a major amendment proposed in the Bill is in section 3. This is section 3 of the amendment to section 16. Under the existing law if an importer fail^to re-export transit  goods within the stipulated time, such goods are deemed to be restricted or prohibited. The objective of this law was intended .rto ensure that people do not abuse transit facilities and enter. I goods for home use. Unfortunately, some people have circumvented  the transit provisions, especially with vehicles for home use De¬filing High Court cases seeding to attach goods in transit for unpaid debts, purpotedly owed by the neighbouring country's importer who does not file defence and; thereby having the goods attached, and through collusion, appoint auctioneers who are in collusion with the local agencies to obtain letters of release from the High Court..	Section 43 allows for transfer of goods between bonded warehouses, but does not allow for transfer of goods from a bonded warehouse to unbonded factory. The proposed amendment to section 4-3 will make it possible for goods to be transferred from a bonded warehouse to a bonded factory which Till facilitate the operations of the manufacturing under bond. Insertion of section 5.8.j. section 6 will make it possible for goods to be transferred from-one bonded factory to another under conditions specified by the Commissioner to ensure that there is no abuse.We will also notice, sir, that there is an amendment to section 40 which will reduce the period of warehousing from 12 months with a further extension of 12 months to six months with an extension of six months. The set up period will discourage speculation from importing the goods for storage in order to gain on price or currency fluctuations-Sir, I would like to inform the House that in the last Budget, we introduced the Value Added Tax (V.A.T.) which was going to replace the Sales Tax, and despite some initial problems, the V.A.T. is. now being administered fairly well. In this process, is have discovered some loopholes and we intend to change them.for example section 13 which is the amendment to section 12 is by deleting the specified definition and inserting a new one. In order to bring officers to a high degree of commitment to confidentiality we shall have to amend Section 14.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, amendments to Section 8, sub¬section 2 are intended to introduce a new Eighth Schedule. The proposed amendment will now streamline the law and allow for the difference in tax structure between the new VAT and the old Sales Tax amendment to Section 9 (1). This  specifies the value on which tax on imported professional services will apply.on  Export Processing Zones. he establishment of the Export processing Zones (EPZ) implies that enterprises operating within such a zone will have to be free of most taxes. We have, therefore, introduced provisions in the VAT Act in order to treat trade between the EPZ and the rest of Kenya as export and import circuits. Consequently, those enterprises will be zero-rated services by amendment to the Fifth Schedule. We are also amending Section 40 of the Act to provide severe penalties against revenue officers who aid and abet in avoidance of VAT.On Income Tax As can be seen from the Bill, we are proposing somemajor changes aimed at influencing the development of capital markets, attractinginvestment, inducing additional exports and enhancing revenue. One of theimportant investment intermediaries is the development of the capital marketthrough their expansion and deepening of the securities market which will mobilisesavings for investment in stocks where the securities in the unity trust willbe used. A unit trust is an investment. It is an investment fund from which indivi¬duals can purchase units or shares. We are proposing amendments to both the unit Trust and the Income Tax Acts. We are introducing changes in the regular trade framework for the unit trust that will help ensure the security of the fund invested in them and will make the unit Trust financially attractive.Amendment to Section 2 of the Income tax Act. cap. 4 are intended to insert new definitions to cover the changes proposed in the Finance Bill.That is, the Unit Trust (Amendment) Bill of 1990 and the Export ProcessingZone. All the amendments contained in the Finance Bill in respect of unittrusts will serve a useful function as investment intermediaries for domesticinvestment and domestic investors who do not have sufficient knowledge ofindividual companies. The Export Processing Zone will attract foregin investment and stimulate industrial growth and exports.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir the amendment to the Income Tax Act will brine in measures which will enhance equity and increase our total revenue collections. We are also raising the tax three limits on pensions from its current level of £5.000 per year to £7,500 per year. We also propose changes to improve the existing system of export compensation in the Finance Bill. In this Bill we have extended the list of eligible items for export compensation. I am sure that hon. Members will find no difficulty whatsoever in passing this Bill inco-orporating all the amendments which I have briefly  enumerated. This is because, as I said earlier on^and like it was said by the Vice-President and Minister for Finance when presenting the Budget, all these items are. meant to increase the efficiency in collection of revenue. It is important that we increase efficiency in the collection of "revenue rather than increasing taxes.With those few words, I beg to move. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Kisiero): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me an opportunity to second this .Bill. As has already been pointed out by the Mover, the House is must being asked to legalize what the Vice-President and Minister for Finance proposed when presenting the Budget. We are now converting those proposals into a Bill  a document with which the country will go about collecting taxes and pending funds.We are doing so because Parliament is supreme in this country. It is also the highest organ that legalises and makes laws in this country. This shows that this country is truly democratic. We are all aware that in some countries, maybe, the head of state just decides what laws are to be enacted, taxes may be collected without any legal procedures being laid down and money may be kept by a few individuals who might dish it out to a few Ministrieshow and when they feel like it. We are lucky- indeed in that this House has the powers to legislate and control things so that our finances are put to good use.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir, the taxation measures proposed in this Bill include many areas as has been pointed out. These are areas as the EPZ. manufacture under bond, income tax, VAT which is replacing the sales tax and tariffs. As had been pointed out in the Budget, what has been done is that basically the taxation base has been broadened in such a way that those people who are capable of paying taxes have been brought in while at the sametime a said all mwananchi who was in capable of paying tax has been released of that burden. So this is a good approach because much of the taxation is indirect as opposed to the old days when we went for direct taxation. It is of Paramountimportance that those of our accounting officers in the various Ministries who will be looking after the funds, when they have been collected put. themto good use. They  ensure that money that have been earmarked for certain projects is used on those projects. Everything possible should be done to ensure that no money is returned to the Exchequer at the end of the year. This is because wananchi want development, good roads, health centres, good educational facilities and so on. - So those charged with the responsibility of looking after the funds should be extremely careful and understand that it takes us a long time to collect those funds. So, we should ensure that the tax-payer's money is put into proper use.With those few remark. I beg to second. </Newspeech>(Question proposed)<Newspeech>MR. JALANG'O: I thank you, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute on this Finance Bill. As the Seconded of the Motion rightly put it, our responsibility is to approve various taxes and amendments to various sections which outlined . the Budget Speech. I must say that this 3ill is one  thing but implementing it may be another. The Government relies heavily on revenue from various forms of duties, such "as, custom, excise, income and stamp duty.There are times when the taxman does not collect what is due to the Government and you begin to wonder whether the right hand is known what the left hand	Time and again, we have heard of custom officerswho do not give the Government its due in terms of duty collection. The Vice-President and Minister for Finance had a big gap to bridge of over 4 million during his Budget Speech. one way  of doing so, was through forms of taxation, we would like to see improvement  the collection of taxes.Take the case of the port of Mombasa where all goods which come into the country land. This is where a lot of activities take place day in day out. There is a schedule that is giver, to  customs officers indicating what has to be done. All that they have to do is to look at tariff number schedules and the right duty that is to be imposed. This has  not been the case more often than not. I think it is the high time these customs officers realized that it is this earned. tax which makes Ministries to run, Provides finance to  various projects under the D.D.C.s, .finances education and medical services. A Clause should be included in this Bill to deal with those customs officers who do not collect the right taxes on behalf of the Government. They should be given punishment commensurate with the uncollected tax. unless this is done, the Government will continue to lose Time has come when actions should be taken.There is also the other aspect of how to follow up these transactionswhich go on in the Customs Department. Thousands of transactions take placedaily and it is time we modernized our tax collection procedures I wouldlike to suggest that the centres where there is concentration of tax collectionembark on using modern technology which will enable  the staff to with case dealwith all the transactions that take place daily.we are in a world where high technology is being used and Kenya hasnot been left behind. I believe it is the high time we started using hightechnology equipment in this area. Computerization is one aspect which canbe used to block some of these loopholes. This is because there are too manytransactions which are handled on a manual basis and sometimes customsofficers forget to capture some important transactions. These officers cannotcope with a voluminous book on schedules and  procedures. If computerizationwas effected in some of  these areas, taxes would he collected on a timelybasis, accuracy would also be improved and this ensure thatduty is collected as required.I know that the Customs and excise Department has started on a massive computerization project which is in the right direction. This programmed can also be extended to other areas, say, in the collection of Value Added Tax .(VAT). VAT is a complicated form of taxation which is new to this country. Those countries which introduced this form of tax several years ago. are still  continuing to improve and effect it. This is an area  which I feel the use of high technology equipment could be an added advantage. VAT means that duty is charged on an item which has added value  it is not just a basic commodity. There are various services which have been. introduced under VAT. Those services form part of what used to be the same tax and services have also been added to then There are thousands of taxable persons in this country who fail under the VAT Same form  control is required so that each and every as taxable service can be collected. The Commissioner the charge of VAT will also be in a position to know the number of taxable persons under him The implementation of VAT differs from one category to another. Mr. Temporary Deputy ..Speaker, Sir, I noticed one element in the Finance Bill concerning the removal of certain duties on certain goods. I particularly want to congratulate the Vice President luinister for Finance on the removal of duty on speed governors. A speed governor is a gadget fitted onto commercial vehicles to restrict their speed to a certain level. I would have liked to see a second of this story because loss of lives caused particularly commercial vehicles, especially buses, is alarming. -However, speed governors should not be limited to buses: it is high time they were fitted in all matatus and all other commercial vehicles in this country.Now removing duty governors is not enough; we have to know how we will ensure that each and every commercial vehicle in this country is fitted with a speed governor. The loss of lives has reached such level that unless something else is done, removal of duty from speed governors alone will not produce the desired. It should be mandatory for each commercial vehicles to be fitted with a speed governor.  last year duty on speed governors was reduced but still comnercialivenicies owners  still refused to fit their vehicles with speed governors. This year the duty has been removed altogether, but what are doing to ensure that every commercial vehicle is fitted with a speed governor? One wondersxa± what at the current rate the level of roads accidents would be in this country in 10 years time.I also welcome the .export compensation scheme. The themeof-this years Budget was encouragement of exports so that thecountry can earn the revenue it requires. Export compensation couldbe one very good aspect of encouraging exporters in this country. Butthere other aspect to it is that you may encourage exports and remove all obstacles to imports but without blocking loopholes on imports.This is one area where the Office of the Vice President and Ministry of Finance must come out clearly. we are going export-oriented; we are manufacturing under bonds; we are employing all ax± available resources in improvement of exports so that we can earn the foreign exchange we need. However, if on the other hand we continue to import even conflakes, sausages, oranges ana sweets all our hard earned foreign exchange will continue  to go into importation of unnecessary luxuries into this country. we would like to see a shift in this area.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think export compensation for local manufacturers will go a long way in encouraging these manufacturers. we shpuld therefore not kill their spirit by importing those same good3 into this country at a much lower rate. This country can manufacture a lot of goods; we have the necessary infrstucture, the goodwill, the political stability, the technical know-how and most of the raw materials. However, manufacturing here can.only succeed if. we do.not kill the goose that lays the golden egg. It is high time more duty was levied on imported goods.we already have a ready market; the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) market is open for Kenyan exports; virtually every manufactured item in this country can get a ready both within the PTA and overseas. We already know of Kenyans goods which year in year out have won gold awards. The Kenyan beer has won gold awards for last 10 successive years; the Kenyan horticultural items like the flowers and carnations and so on are some of the very best in the world today. However, until we stop insisting on imported materials, driving imported cars as opposed to locally assembled ones and until we learn to be proud of our own I rememberwhen our President was launching the Nyayo Pioneer cars he saidthat what was important was not the beauty or speed of that car, but that it sea was kenyan made. This is something out of our own invention, and we should be proud of it. There is one herbalist who discovered a very rare type of medicine, which even scientists have not managed to match. As the herbalist went into a so-called conference, he shook the medicine in the bottle and told a very attentive audience, "This is the child of my brain, an invention of my genius", and everybody turned round to look at this herbalist from a corner of Africa, and he was proud of this. This was not anything scientific, but it could cure disease. It was just like when my constituent discovered a herb to cured the Acquired Inraune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). According to this latter herbalist, his was an invention and he was proud of it. So, it is high time for us, too, to be proud of what we produce.I think this country will go a long way towards being self-sufficient if we remove from our mentality the preference of anything imported. When we do that, we will achieve the theme of these Finance Bill of 1990, that is to be export—oriented. We are not going to become export—oriented just in one area; we are going export-oriented on all fronts, including agriculture, industry and everything else. Sooner or later, the famous Kemron is going to be available in the-local market-. Once again, we should go out and say, "This is a child of our brain and the materialisation of our inventive genius." We should be proud of this because every nation and scientist are talking about Kemron today. Despite the fact that some people are still talking about other types of medicine, here is Kemron from our own laboratories, produced by our own chemists and our own research fellows. This is something that this country is proud of.To conclude, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to rehiterate my original statement to the effect that unless we have officers whoare committed to the collection of tax in this country, collecting up to thelast cent and handing it over to the Government, those services which have to be rendered using tax will not be rendered. Our officers should be committed and have the motto "Whatever I do is for the best of my country alone."Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUREITHI: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to support the Finance Bill, We are all aware that the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance has raised enough revenue so that our Government may have the necessary funds both for Recurrent and Development expenditure. Therefore," we strongly support this Bill and hope that once the Office "of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance get the money, it will use it in accordance with the Printed Estimates which represent the requests of various Ministries.Taxation is one of the ways of raising funds, but now and then, we have come across situations where the Treasury has invested the same funds in a number of business enterprises, that is, the so-called parastatal bodies. We are aware that some of the parastatal bodies we have in this country do not make profit. If we raise money from wananchi to continue to support such bodies which do not make profit, this does not make any sense. I would say that it is high time the Treasury, as a matter of policy, if it cannot control these bodies sold whatever shares it holds in all of them. It is not necessarily those parastatal bodies that are not making profit that should be affected, but also those that are making profit.	It. is commendable that the Kenya. Commercial Bank is reducingGovernment shareholding from 80 to 70 per cent. In the long man, I do not see what reason there would be for stopping the Government if it were to sell wholly its shareholding in the Kenya Commercial Bank to wananchi and then use that money to develop other institutions within the country. It is apparent that the control of parastatal bodies has not been good. We have several examples to this end. The Public Accounts Committee has, on various occasions, has consented on this particular issue, and I would urge very strongly that the Treasury gets away from these parastastal bodies and concentrates on some other development aspects in the country, such as setting up industries where private investors are not doing much, leaving those institutions which are succeeding to Kenyans or any other persons who are ready to invest in them.One other way of raising revenue is to encourage the growth of domestic production. This Budget has some exemption which goes towards the improvement of local production, and this is a move in the right direction because, unless we increase the level of economic activities and domestic production in the country, the country will not develop. However, if we increase this level, even the Government all be able to raise more revenue.When we are considering things like housing, we tend to concentrate on people who live in urban areas, which encourages the people in rural areas to come to towns because, apparently, there is better life in towns. I do not see any reason why we should not encourage the development of housing in rural areas. I do not also see the reason why we should not provide such facilities like clean water and good roads in our rural areas. Once we do that, there will then come a time when nobody will want to live in big times; everybody will want to live in an area where you have more space and snore fresh air where you can enjoy yourself. In the field of housing, therefore, I want to urge that we should do everything possible to improve our rural housing in order to provide the same kind of facilties that we provide in urban areas to the people who live rural areas.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, those marketing bodies such as the Coffee Board of Kenya, the Tea Board of Kenya and the Kenya creameries Co-operative Society should visit and hold meetings with farmers and tell them the exact truth with regard to whatever economic activities they are engaged in. I say so because in the course of the current Kanu recruitment drive in my constituency, I had the opportunity to have a joint meeting with all board members of the Pyre thrum Board of Kenya. I take this opportunity to congratulate the chairman of the Pyre thrum Board of Kenya and his directors for going direct to the wananchi and addressing them as partners in. development and telling them, for instance, that here we have orders for supply of pyrethrua, but you people are not growing enoug pyrethrua. If you grow enough, we have been promised that it will fetch so much this year. I was immpressed because the Pyrethrua Board of Kenya was ready to admit that some years previously the market for pyrethrua was not good. This is the kind of thing that can encourage farmers because when they see the people who market their products they have confidence.Secondly, the people concerned with the marketing of crops should tell the producers where the markets are and what the total demand for a given year is. I am, therefore, urging other marketing boards to tell the farmers, for instance, how such milk is being bought for.Mr. Temporary Deputy speaker, Sir, sometimes you find that farmers are ignorant of the prices offered by the Kenya Creameries Co-operative Society for milk. The only prices they know of are the ones offered by the local co-operativesocieties, and you find a variance in prices. For example, you may find that one litre of milk in some co-operative societies goes for KShs.2.00 whereas others pay KShs.4.00. Since farmers who are paid KShs.2.00 per litre have no information of the marketing body prices, you find that they cannot question why they are being paid such a low amount. Therefore, I would strongly urge that the time has come when our people should know the whole truth. The marketing bodies should go to the grassroots and find out whether, if they are paying KShs.4.00 per litre of milk, for instance, how much of that money goes to the farmer. If the farmer is not making money, then in a few years we shall have problems in that industry. Knowing the truth about prices encourages farmers.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in this Budget, I have noticed one section concerning exemption of stamp duty for marketable security. I hope I am correct in my-interpretation. I would urge that stamp duty, in some instances, is very high. I will quote a specific example. A few years ago, we had in this country a tax called Capital Gains Tax. A lot of people complaiend that that tax, which was being paid by those who were selling property, was not fair. Finally, the stamp duty on transfer of property, which used to be three percent for themunicipalities and two per cent for agricultural land in rural areas, was doubled to become six per cent in municipalities and four per cent in rural areas. The Capital Gains Tax was then withdrawn by the Treasury. In effect, what happened is that the tax being paid by the people who were buying property was doubled. Those who were selling property no longer paid any tax. If you buy property worth KShs.100,000/- in Nairobi today, you pay a tax of KShs.50,000/-. We know that there are very few properties in Nairobi that are worth KShs. 100,000/- If you look in the newspapers, what you see is property going for. millions of shillings. If you buy property worth KShs.1 million, the tax will be about KShs.60,000/-, and that is not a big property by any standards in Nairobi. So, in my view, shifting taxation from Capital Gains Tax to the person who is buying property for the first time and double the taxation, is not fair. In future, I wouldMtukufu Rais amefanyji kazi nyingi KAMAVILE kuanzisha mpenge wa fjua kali.	India na jua kali, lakini sip kama hii yetu. Huko Indiaviwanda vingi viko katika sehernu wanazoishi.

Kwa hivyo yafaa vzatu wa Jua Kali watiwe moyo ili waweze kutengeneza vitu vizuri ambayo vitauzr. ngambo na has a katika soko la Preferential Trade Area ili tuweze kupata pesa sa kigeni. Vile vile nchi Mi inahitaji wasalendo ili kazi yetu iendelee bila matatizo. Kenya hut e gene a kilimo na kuna vitu aaiiajta ambavyo vinapatikana hapa Kenya na ambavyo havipatikani katika nchi nyingine za ulimwengu.Mfano mzuri ni zao la macadamia nuts Zao hili lahitajika sana kote ul 1 mwenguni. Hata hivyo utaona kwamba ni nchi tatu pekee katika ulim^engu ambazo hukusa zao hili la macadamia nuts. Hchi ambayo aaka hutoa zao ili kwa rringx ni Hawaii. Watu vra Hawaii wamefanya utafiti na kugundua kwamba rati mmoja wa macadam a unaweza kutoa zao lenye uzani wa 150 kilogrammes. Pia nchi ya ilalawi hutoa TcaKaiisua mac ad ami a nuts kwa sababu hakuna zao lingine ambalo linawesa iaiib: kusitawi visuri katika ardhi yao. Hata hivyo utakuta kwamba HZ nchi za Malawi na Hawaii haziwezi kupanua ukuzaji wa zao hilo kwa zaa sababu mchanga wao hauwaruhusu kutoa zao hilo kwa wingi kuliko ilivyo wakati ; huu. Lakini utaona kwamba sisi hapa Kenya tunaweza kupanua kilimo cha zao hilo. Hii ni kwa sababu eneo lote la lukoa wa TfakigtyKray ffHrict MH jl Kati linaweza kutumiwa kwa kilimo cha mac ad ami a nuts. Pia wilaya kaina vile Meru, Machakos na Kericho zinafaa kwa kilimo cha . mroea wa macadamia Kwa hivyo yafaa utafiti wa kutosha ufanywe  jtm. ya mmea huo Hii ni kwa sababu nrti mmojawa  macadmia kule  inn Meru unaweza kutoka zao la uzani wa 100 kilogrammes. Kule Muranga s±at nrti mmoja unaweza kutoa 60 kilogrammes za mac ad ami a nuts; kule ajisi a g Kirinyaga mti mmoja unaweza kutoaazza zao la uzani wa 90 kilogrammes au 100 kilogrammes.Vile vile Bw. Naibu Spika wa liiia, utaona kwamba bei yakilo moja ya aacadarri a nuts ni Shs.8.40. ukrazaji wa zao iaili haunagharaina yo yote. Eazi ya mkulima ni kupanda, kuweka mbolea nakufyeka magugu.	Pia uvunaji wa zao hilo hauna gharama yo yote j hizo nuts zikianguka kazi yako ni kuziokota nakuzipeleka sokoni. Zao hili linahitajika sana kule Japan na nila si ma tujaribu kulitoa kwa wingi. Ni lasima lei la mmoja wetuafikirie ni jambo gani ambalo linaweza kuiletea nchi hii y;etu pcsaza kigeni.

Passion fruit yetu inashindana na ile ya kutoka Ceylon ambayo si ya hali yajuu sana. Lakini ukiangalia utaona kwamba tuna kiwanda klmoja	tu hapa Thika.cha-kutengenezea passion fruit mtu juicennoja huko Switzerland kama "crude" passion fruit ambay o huwekwakatika matangi. Xkishaiika Switzerland, crude passion fruit juiceinaenda katika kiwanda kingine ambacho kinaitengeneza na kniweka ndani yra mikelje na kuandika juu yaks "llace in-Switzerland". Jambo hili linatushangaza. Bei ya glasi moja yp. maji ya matunda haya inauzwa kwa gun sana; bei sice ni mara nne ya bei ya gjlasi moja ya pombe kali, yaani whisky. Kwa hivyo, ingefaa tuangalie jambo hili na tuyatengeneze maji ya matunda haya hapa ili tuweze kuyauza nje tup ate faida kubwa na pesa nyingi za kigeni.Llwishowe, ningependa kuishukura Serikali yetu truly.fu kwa mambo ambayo walifanya hapa juzi.

Nabwera aliwaambia kwamba miraa baistahili kuwa ndani ya agenda ya mkutano huo kwa sababu miraa si sawa na dawa hatari. Kwa hivyo, miraa ilitolewa katika agenda ya mkutano huo.Pia, juzi kulikuwalzc na iakutano wa Tforli Health Organi-sation (W.H.0.) na liraa iliwekwa katika agenda ya mkutano huo.Halafuu jumbe wa Mhe.

Kwa hivyo, ffaarabu waliamua kuinunua giraa badala ya kahawa. Pia, Waarabu waligundua kwamba piraa kutoka Kenya ilikuwa mitann zaidi, kuliko.mingine.  Sasa hapo ndipo Mzungu alianza vita namiraa na ndipo katika mwaka wa 1943 waliweka sheria. kusema kwamba upandaji,ulaji na pia uuzaji waijaa unekataliwa na Serikali.

WAMEYO: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,Sir. I gather from the speaker on the Floor that miraa is not harmful andthat scientists should do research on it. From what we know, miraa is a stimulantand people who chew it spend hours without sleep. I remember during the colonialdays, a lot of ladles from the North-Eastern Province ganged together and wentto see the Pronvincial. Commissioner complaining that their husbands were not being seen at home. They asked the then Provincial Commissioner to ban the chewing of miraa. Eventually, the Provincial Commissioner banned the chewing of miraa in the North-Eastern Province fair a while. So since these ladies complained it means that miraa is harmful.</Newspeech>(laughter)<Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): I hope that Dr. Vameyo is not trying to challenge the Chair.

Ningependa kuisahihisha taarifa hii kwa kusema kuwa hakuna wakati wowote katika historia ya nchi hii ambako akina mama fulani waliwahi kumwendea mkuu wa mkoa kuwasilisha malalamiko kama hayo.

As of now we have not had any documentary proof showing that miraa is not harmful or should not be consumed by people. What is there is just a general argument as to whether it is or not harmful to people. There is also a lot of litera ture around saying that miraa is harmful. That being so, I would like to inform hon. Muturia that it has n6t been proved scientifically that it is good for human consumption. Is he in order to continue marketing miraa in this House?

I, like the hon. Member who has just finished speaking, join my colleagues in congratulating the hon. Vice President and minister for finance, particularly for making the theme of this year's Budget “EnhancedEconomic Growth through. Export Promotion. I think that was a	very well thought out them particularly In View of the fact that ourPresident is now the Chairman of the Preferential Trade Area (PTA).It therefore behooves all of us to think together and find outwhat we need to export. We are a bit ashamed because for along time we have not been able to export all that we should export.We should also thank his Excellency the President for creating avery good atmosphere where our economic growth rate continue to be five per cent. In Africa this is unique, and I think we should maintain this peace and fight to ensure that we have no problems of multi-parties  and unemployment and we will be sure that our rate of economic growth will be maintained.	With regard to the taxation proposals outlined in the Financial Statement I would like to comment on the lowering of duty  on unassembled cooking appliances. We are very mindful of the unemployment situation in Kenya. But for a long time we have known very many people who have imported assembles, which deny our  people, particularly the jua kali artisans, the opportunity to utilise their knowledge. If we import semi-knockeddown kits we shall ensure that our young people from youth polytechnics, technical training institutes and other institutions are able to do the assembling and thereby reduce unemployment in the country. I therefore commend the Vice President and Minister for Finance for lowering duty on unassembled cooking appliannces. In fact, we can ensure that we import for re-exports If we import unassembled kit, we can assemble it and  sell, particularly to the PTA market and be able toearn a lot of foreign exchange, or our own currency, and thereby create a bigger market within the region.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, another taxationproposal which was very well thought out  this is why we are callingit the Nyayo Budget concerns the removal of duty on imported pulp.Our  President continued to tell us to conserve forests. Thismeasure will thus mean that our people will not continue fellingtrees because ire can import pulp from Tanzania, Uganda and manyother countries. I think we can farther that and tell our topeople to amplify our President's motto that When you fell one tree, plant two. This motto fits in well with this taxation on wood pulp timber in general. We know that timber is now very expensive because we have reduced cutting down trees in our forests. Thisresulted in timber traders now experiencing a lot of problems in obtaining timber.	The reduction of duty of ceramic wares for laboratories was in line with the requirements of the 8-4-4 system of education. I must also congratulate the Ministry of Education for transforming the Schools Equipment Production Unit into a parastatal body. since the 8-4-4 system of—education aims at producing school leavers who are self-sufficient, schools should be fully equipped in order to implement the curriculum effectively. This reduction of duty on ceramic ware will enable us to produce a lot of equipment for ourlaboratories. At the moment many Harambee schools are still teaching general science because they do not have laboratory equipment. equipment these days is so expensive that the only way out  this is shy I highly commend the Vice President and Minister for Finance was to reduce tax on ceramic ware.Another good thing was the reduction of duty on speed governors. This was good because everybody has witnessed the problemof fatal accidents on our roads. We should now ensure commercial passenger vehicle owners fit speed governors in their vehicles. There will now be no excuse for a matatu operator not fit his vehicle with a speed governor, which will reduce chances of careless accidents by young drivers.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have said that now our jua kali artisnas should be able to produce nuts and boltsapart from boxes and other smal1 things. So, another taxation proposal that was very commendable was the reduction of duty on fusion materials. This will enable our artisans who are now so smart, fast adatable to the situation obtaining in the country to produce very many things. As long as we put a lot of duty on these fusion materials, then we are denying them the chances of exploring further on the technical ability of producing a lot of nuts, spare parts and other technical products. Further to this,  this is a way of protecting our local industry.We have never levied duty on brake liners and shock absorbers. And now brake liners are getting a lot of market x here and overseas because they are being produced locally. We thus have to be very deliberate in protecting our industries. We should never allow people to import things like brake linings, shock absorbers or anything else which is produced locally because if we do this we will deny our youngsters employment, kill our industries and will never be able to expand, particularly now when the climate is suitable for a lot of exploration and expansion.The taxation proposal that was applauded most was theincrease in export duty on scrap metal. In the recent past therehave been a lot of 1 complaints against tab the export of scrap metal.We are aware of highly industrialized nations like japan thathave been able to recycle metal and have excelled in the manufacture of cars. Now that we are importing Steel billets from Zimbabwe, andwe have no iron ore or coal, whatever scrap metal should not be exported at all. I therefore commend the Vice President and Minister for finance for raising duty on scrap metal from 10 to 20 per cent, thereby denying unscrupulous traders the chance of exporting scrap metal. It is this scrap metal that is giving a lot of business to our artisans in Zamunji, Zibera, starehe and in many urban areas. There is no cheaper way of occupying our artisans than having them recycle scrap metal, make " jikos", boxes and many other items. These days they are making metallic things like padlocks, chairs and so on. If we are to succeed in using our jua kali artisans to produce  spare parts If or the Nyayo pioneer cars along the lines our President hinted, we have to ensure that nothing useful is exported from this country.Finally, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member who has just finished making his contribution has talked a lot about fish. We know that the fish we have in this country is very marketable, and it is very sad to note that, although we have shrimps, catfish and other types of fish which are very marketable and which could earn us a lot of foreign exchange, we have never taken the trouble to carry out fish fanning, this is the kind of thing that has brought a lot of foreign exchange to countries such as Bangladesh. Time has come, if we are really going to be mindful of our; economic growth through export promotion, when we have to think widely.I say so because even things like pepper have a very wide market in Ethiopia, India and many other countries in the world. This is something that we can encourage our people to grow because it cultivation is very cheap and economical. There is no reason why we cannot draw much foreign exchange from the cultivation of this horticultural crop. This matter is very serious.It is sad that up to now, we are still importing cotton seed cake from neighbouring Tanzania, whereas we can grow cotton here. East Africa Industries has even put aside money to encourage farmers to grow sunflower, and there is-no reason why we should not be serious in this area because these products can earn us a lot of foreign exchange, to the extent that our animal feed factories will rely, as one of the ingredients they need, on cotton seed cake. Our people are very good farmers, and all they require is encouragement. We, in the Ministry of Co—operative Development, are carrying out intensive campaigns in cotton—growing areas to ensure that we no longer import cotton seed cake for our animal feed factories. Since we have high potential to produce some of these things here, we should remember that there is nothing with a better market than horticultural crops.	.With these few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I begto support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT (Mr. Ngei): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to support the Finance (No.2)Bill (Bill No.10) as moved by the Vice-President and Minister for Finance. Before I do so, however, I would like to support the hon. Member for Ntonyiri on miraa. This is not a drug, as such. There was once a conference held in London where it was said that miraa should be banned as it was like the drugs in South America. However, miraa only causes you either to go to sleep or to stay awake. If you chew too much of it, you go to sleep whereas if you chew only a little, you stay awake for long. Miraa is one of the most important cash crops in Meru District, and it has really earned the people of Meru a lot of money.	Therefore, I support chang'aa</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: Chang'aa? You support chang'aa?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT (Mr. Ngei): Oh, no.	I am talking about miraa. Let people continue but be careful.	Now, as far as the other proposals which His Excellency the President has I signified that he would assent to, it is true that the Vice-President and Minister	for Finance should look into the matter of Customs and Excise Tariff, Value Added	Tax and local manufacturing export compensation together with income tax and stamp duty. When you lode at trade licences and look at the trade itself, it is reallya bad affair because people do trade in rather difficult They steal from thetrading they do. They steal about KShs.50 million and so on. We know this. Please,you cannot clear debts when stealing; not in this hon. House. If the Vice-Presidentand Minister for Finance would like to look into the trading business, let us beas we are in Kenya; good and respected people throughout the world. If we tradewell, we are going to be known by the world that we are very good traders. If wedo it badly, then we are going to be seen as people who do not know what to do.	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, about a month ago, somebody said something very bad to the effect that tea will fetch little money. When you are a chairman or a managing director, it is bad to say that tea prices will go down. We have the best tea in the world. Why should we say that we are going to see to it that theprice of tea goes down? Who are the chairmen? Some of these things are said,	but without thinking. If you are the chairman of the tea organisation in Kenya, you know it too well that our tea is the best in the world and, therefore, you should speak in terms of raising the prices up.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: The Chairman is there.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT (Mr. Ngei): Mr.	Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I know that the chairman is here. He said it. You mean you do not know?</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: Address the Chair! Address the Chair!</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): I would like to advise hon. Ngei, as much as I respect him, to address the Chair.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT (Mr.Ngei): Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I apologise for not addressing you. I was talkingabout tea, and I was saying that our tea is the best in the world. Ours is very good tea. Therefore, when you say that the price of tea is going to go down, then you are discouraging Kenyan farmers who grow that crop.If I may say something else, I would like to touch on income tax. I do not want to touch it much, but rather slowly because I do not want to belong to the group saying that the price of tea should go down. Income tax should be carefully handled by the Vice-President and Minister for Finance because we get a lot of money that way. We have a lot of money assessed to us, without knowing that I have presented Form IP 13 from 1980, to December, 1989, and I had paid and yet somebody is saying,. "You go and see the Official Receiver".</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is a real ifdisgrace, but if he wants to have my I.T. 13 documents, I have them, starting from 1980 to 1989. I can present those documents to him.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. With due respect to my hon. friend, I think that the issue that he is discussing is sub-judice , and I do not think it is fair to discuss it in the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): I thinkthat is an important point of order and therefore, I would request.	the Minister not to discuss that issue since it is sub-judice.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT(Mr. Ngei): Sir, I am contributing just like any other hon. Memberin this House. They are also facing the same problems. Sir,I will tell the court of law  all that I have done. Mosthon. Members might be faced with the same problem and therefore,I was not referring to my own case. If anybody thought that I 	was referring to my case, then he is wrong I was only talkingin general terms.	Sir, with those few remarks, I beg to support theFinance Bill which was Tabled by the Vice-President and theMinister for Finance.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KTRWA: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary DeputySir, for giving me this opportunity to support the Finance (No.2) Bill.First of all I would like to thank His Excellency thePresident for the action that he has taken to pay the small-scalecoffee farmers in our country. I would also like to thank himfor the keen interest that he has taken in the jua kali sector.That is a major sector of our economy and it is employing thebulk of our people.Sir, if you look at the Bill, you will realise thatthere is some kind of taxation which will involve ourpeople. Sir, a lot has been said about taxation, and I thinkit is important for us to bear a few points in mind so thatwhen that taxation is effected, the revenue received isentrusted to honest people, so that the money that our country	shall collect will Be used effectively.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there should "be good co-ordination when it comes to taxations Everything should be done to ensure that no money gets lost; A lot has been said about corruption in the Customs and Excise Department and I will not repeat.Turning to agro-based products, I would like to say that there is a measure of a problem in the sense that agriculture, as ithas been said before, does not generate as much profit as many people tend to think, Therefore, it is very important that the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance looks into the issue of taxing farm products with a view to ensuring that the farmer gets something at the end of the day, As we continue todiscuss this Bill, I would like to state that we must ensure that the revenue that is collected by the Government is properly spent by various Ministries, But there is one major problem that we have witnessed in various Ministries and this is lack of financial control or supervision, You will find civil servants on site, entrusted with the duty of completing a project but instead of doing just that they end up selling some of the materials they are supposed to use. This is a serious problem in our country and it needs to be rectified; Civil servants must portray to the public the image they are supposed to portray, This is because it is important that we portray a good image so that our. Government can get full support from the people,When we talk of discipline in the Civil Service	Forquite some time now there have been dismissals from variousparastatals. The cases of some of the dismissed peoplehave been taken to court. But these people have not been foundguilty. However, the same parastatals take a long time to reinstate these people.So, I would urge the parent Ministries of these parastatals to look into these issues because they are the ones who supervise these parastatals. The Ministries must ensure that innocent Kenyans do not suffer unnecessarily.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,in the pastWe have had a problem regarding exportation and importation offood. Some time back we had a problem in the sugar industry andKenya had to import a lot of sugar.I therefore urge the Ministriesconcerned to treat the issue of exportation and importation, withthe seriousness it deserves. The Ministry concernedshould look for ways and means of preserving 	perishable foodproducts. Exportation and importation should be looked into because we may end up exporting more than we are importing and thereby incurring a deficit in some of the products we consume locally. We must address ourselves to this situation so that we do not	endup exporting more than the country needs to export.Hon.Members have touched on the Jua Kali industry and I feel that it is not enough to just exempt Jua Kali products from duty. We must look for Trays of assisting Jua Kali artisans so that they may benefit from the exemption of duty. We must know who will supply the materials that are going to go into the Jua Kali industry. This is because many middle men are likely to capitalise on that situation to an extent that instead of the Jua Kali people benefiting, the middlemen are going to benefit a lot. With those remarks, I beg to support the Bill.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT (Mr. Lugonzo):Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, far giving me thisopportunity to contribute to this very important Bill. I would like toconcentrate my debate to the problems facing wananchi in the rural areas.The Finance Bill was very well analysed and, in fact, it has been very muchpraised. However, let us look at our rural areas and see what the Budget hasdone to help the rural people. The majority of our people live in therural areas and some of these people axe small-scale fanners. Our questionshould be; "What are we doing as a Government to assist the small-scale farmer?"It is true that some of these small-scale farmers are very good tea and coffee producersand the Government is very happy about them. However, every small-scale	farmer able to do what he is supposed to be doing? Is he getting the necessaryassistance from the Government? For Those who are not able to grow tea or coffee, what is the Government doing to assist them in doing something which can help them better, their standard of living? Government should deliberate take the necessary action to help the small-scale farmer «ho does not have any other form of employment. I think it is the duty of the Government extension officers to initiate some arrangement to assist the common man out there to be able to live on. The Ministry of Agriculture should ensure that the extension officers assist these small-scale farmers to better their production methods; They should advise them on how to grow hybrid crops, keep grade cattle, on how to grow some tea or coffee. The Government should have farms where these people are shown the modem methods of farming. Sometimes, it is difficult for our people to start any cash generating projects due to lack of cash.For this reason, "Government should look for ways and means of giving an all loans to these people to enable them better their fanning methods and produce more for this country. If they are given loans, they could beable to buy grade cattle. Sometimes the district development committees recommend certain projects that would enable these people to better their standard of living. However, when these projects are recommended to the Ministers concerned, they refuse to approve them.Other times, they Say that their Budget cannot accommodate these projects and that there is nothing they can do about it. This kind of thing should be discouraged.. Ministries should approve the projects recommended to then	by the district development committees so as to help the ordinary man out	In the rural areas.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, we have the case of the jua kali .	artisans.Sir, we have been told that KSh.150 million will soonbe distributed all over the country to help the jua kali artisansWe want to see this money going to every part of thecountry. For instance, I want to see some of it in my own constituency. Already, some jua kali sheds have been constructed hereand there, but I have not seen any funds come to my area. I have notseen many of them in Kakamega and Ikolomani either. We want tosee such a project where the Government is giving or investingsuch a big sum of money like ESh.150 million. The fruits of suchmoney should be seen in every part of the Republic, particularlyin Ikolomani. I want to see this money there because we have alot of young people who need this money in order to develop themselves. They want to get something that can help them generatesome money for themselves. Sir, we also feel that the training for these  jua kaliartisans or school-leavers is not sufficient. We do have few youth polytechnics in the country. Maybe these polytechnicsare sufficient in some areas, but they are not enough in a place like Kakamega. Government did take over some of these polytechnics recently, but none was taken from my area. We have very few of them in Kakamega We need the Government to take over most, if not all, the polytechnics, and the admission should be increased, say, to even 1,000 students per polytechnic so that all these school-leavers who cannot go anywhere else can get some training and then get a loan to enable them to  start some jua Kali business or industry in order to make , some living. Some of these people have absolutely nothing. They are relying on their parents who also get very little from the sale of their maize and so on. They do not have any cash crops.  The whole situation now is absurd orpathetic. Even the small—scale businessmen in the rural areas are not taken care of properly.In the rural areas, we have the Joint Loans Boards. If I may refer to the one in Kakamega, you will find that it is ever "broke”. When people go for money to develop theirsmall businesses, they are told that the Joint Loan Board has no money.In it is claimed that the Board in waiting for the money it loaned some time ago which is also very little. Also, when they give loans to these business people, it is in the region of KSh.10,000/- and ESh.15,000/- and yet inflation has increased so much that the KSh.15,000/- to a businessman today means very little, or nothing. The Joint Loans Boards should be given enough money to be able to grant loans to the small-scale businessmen so that theycan do some worthwhile businesses. I am sure if some of our 8-4-4 Schoolleavers were given some of these loans, they would have somethingto do as businessmen, but when they are given only Sh.5,000/- or KSh. 10,000/- that is valueless. Sometimes even that KSh.10,000/- isnot there! The Joint Loans Board official will say that they haveno money. I think it is high time something was done to make theJoint Loans Boards more viable and useful to the small-scalebusinessmen. Our nation does not have enough industries to beable to absorb all these school-leavers. So, those who initiatesmall businesses even if it is selling things like cigarettes orexercise books and so on should be encouraged by being granted loans.</Newspeech><Header>ADJOURNMENT</Header><Newspeech>THE TEMPORAEY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Hon. Members, it is now time for the interruption of business. The House is, therefore, adjourned until tomorrow, Thursday, 28th June, at 2.30 pm. The House rose-at thirty minutes past Six o'clock.</Newspeech>HA N S A R D Thursday 23th June, 1990The House met at thirty minutes past Two o'clock [Mr. Deputy Speaker in the Chair]PRAYERS<Header>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</Header>Question No. 283<Header>Identity Card Forms for Machakos District</Header>MR. WAHBUA asked the Minister of State, Office of the President since it has "become increasingly difficult for school leavers to get registration forms to apply for Identity Cards in Machakos Registration Office, he could instruct his officers to send these forms to the chiefs' offices in order to expedite the registration exercise.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Keen): Mr.Deputy Speaker, Six, I beg to reply.I am not aware of any difficulties regarding availability ofRegistration Forms for Identity Cards registration at Machakos RegistrationOffice. On the contrary,there has been sufficient numbers of registrationforms and registration has been taking place fairly and very smoothly inMachakos District. In view of the above observations, the application formsare accountable to the registration offices. It would not be prudent to sendthese cards to chiefs.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.WAMBUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, at the time I left that office the forms were not available. The fact is that these school leavers travel from all over the district to come to Machakos District, some covering distances of up to 60 kilometres. You will find that because of the normal delays they are forced to sleep at Machakos and, you have to bear in mind that these are boys and girls who do not have money for accommodation, and they are compelled to stay in Machakos for about two days. Can the Assist¬ant Minister tell us what. we will do next? We are all parents here and we know the consequences that can result from the gatherings of such young people of different; sexes when they stay in such circumstances for two nights.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEEN: Mr. Deputy Speaker. Sir, from the information I have here, it appears there is an average of 2,000 forms and, maybe, 4,000 other cases, which have been sent to the various locational centres. From the registration figures I have here it appears, also, that the average registration of persons has not exceeded 1,000, as you see figures like, 900, 937, 120 and so on. So, really, there must have been quite a number of registration forms available.For the interest of the hon. Member, however, I will carry out investigationsto establish those few areas that may have fallen short of stock of these forms and we will ask the Director of the Registration Bureau to ensure that sufficient forms are availed to all those areas.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the registration of persons is anational issue; one that does not only affect Machakos District. Actually,I think it is a bit unfair for those school-leavers to go and ^o queue forso long for those registration forms. Can the assistant Minister arrange, as from now, to send the registration officers to schools to carry out the registration, exercise? We should not have school-leavers having unnecessary problems of queuing for those forms but a system should be worked out so that they are given those identity cards while in school, so that when they leave school they just start on the burden of looking for jobs.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEEN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the students can always be registered during school holidays.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The question was Now</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is your point of order, Mr. Malebe?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. MALEBE: It is a supplementary question, Sir. Could theAssistant Minister tell the House if the registration of persons is a compulsory issue in the country and whether. each adult of over 18 years of age must have an identity card? The Hon. Member who raised the Question sought the Office of the President's assistance in sending the registration forms to the chief’s offices, as they are accountable documents. However, even if they are accountable documents, the registration officers in thedivision can still send these forms to the chiefs and account for the numbers that have been despatched, and thereby reduce the burden on the part of those students who have to travel long distances for those farms, could the Assistant Minister, therefore, give an affirmative reply to this question of sending the forms to the chiefs' offices? Even the chiefs' offices are accountable for Government documents and their handling of those forms can make it easier for the school-leavers to get served.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEEN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, registration of persons is a	sensitive and a security exercise. There have been cases inthe past Where identity cards were issued to non-Kenyans. I am not, therefore, prepared to risk State security in such a manner.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMBUA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker,Sir. The people involved are innocent kids, who should not bemade to travel 60 kilometers to the district headquarters. Thesekids are not a security risk because they are well known by theirheadmasters and chiefs. Could the Assistant Minister, therefore,arrange for these forms to be send to either the headmasters or chiefs?</Newspeech>/<Newspeech>MR. KEEN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not prepared to do that. However,  in order to accommodate the hon. Members wish, if he has about 700 people who require to be registered it is uneconomical to send a Vehicle and a team of registration officers to register only four or five persons  I am prepared on request and when it is convenient to ask the registration officers to move cut and register them.</Newspeech>Question No. 309<Header>AFC Office for -Garissa District</Header>MR. SALAT asked the Minister for Agriculture why. the Agricultural Finance Corporation has not opened an office in Garissa District to serve farmers in this area.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOE AGRICULTURE (Mr. Ngaruro):Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.	The volume of business in Garissa District is low and does not justify the establishment of an AFC! branch office. However, with the current move to develop arid and semi-arid lands the Ministry does recognise the, importance of Garissa District because of its high potential in food and animal production. To this end the AFC has finalised plans to open an office in Garissa in the next financial year, 1990/91.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SALAT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, sir, I asked the same Question in 1938 and I was given a similar reply, namely that the volume of business, in Garissa does not justify the opening of an AFC office there. Could the Assistant Minister tell us what volume of business is actually required for the AFC to  open an office there</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the hon. Member heard me clearly I said that because we are trying to develop aridand semi-arid lands, the AFC will open an office in Garissa duringthe next financial year, 1990/91.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ARITE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Assistant Minister is talking of the required volume of business for the AFC to open an office in Garissa. Now, could he tell us how that volume of work will be achieved when there is no office to serve the people?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KGARURO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, sir, in fact, I have just said that we are going to open an officer in Garissa in the next financial year.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Mr.Deputy Sneaker, Sir, while thanking theAssistant Minister for his reply, the hon. Member has said that when he asked a similar Question last year, he was given the same answer. The Assistant Minister, has said that the volume of business is very low, but because of the development of arid and semi-arid areas that would justify the opening of an A.F.C. office, Gould he tell us why they are finding the year 1991 to be the suitable year to do so?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said that the currentborrowing requirements for loans in that area, are low. However,if we are trying to encourage more businesses in the arid and semi-arid areas, we will definitely go ahead and open an. office, despitethe fact that the current situation does not justify the opening of an AFC office there.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SA1AT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister hassaid that the possibilities are being looked into, particularlywith the creation of the Ministry of Reclamation and Developmentof Arid and Semi-Arid and wastelands. I think that is entirely adifferent Ministry altogether. What is the establishment of thatMinistry got to do with the opening of an Agricultural Finance Corporation's office in Garissa? The AFC falls under the Ministryof Agriculture.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, I did not talk about the creation of the new Ministry. I said there would be developments in the arid and semi-arid lands. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ARTE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the next financial year will span over 12 months. Can he tell us in which of those months they are going to open the required office? Can he tell us which month?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I said that the plans have been finalised and we shall open the office in the coming financial year. However, I would appeal to the hon. Member from that area to try and assist</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ARTE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker The normal financial years, as we know them, take exactly twelve months and I am asking in which of those twelve months they are going to open an office in Garissa. As simple as that.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Obviously, Sir, the office will be opened as and when the premises for the office will have been established. However, as to the actual date, or month, for so doing, I do not have such statistics. I have however stated that the exercise will, be carried out in the next financial year. I am also requesting the hon. Member to talk to the farmers' in his area because they owe the A.F.C. some Ksh.8 million which they were granted between1979 and last year. He could help, in making the farmers pay those loans</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ARTE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I simply asked the Assistant Minister in which of the twelve months of the following financial year they are going to open the office, as simple as that.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGAHURO: I said the office will be opened before the end of the next financial year.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Did you say before the end of thisfinancial year, Mr. Ngaruro?</Newspeech>/<Newspeech>MR. NGARURO: No, Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir. I said before the end of the next financial year.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SALAT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has claimed that farmers in Garissa District owe the AFC some Ksh.8 million. Does he not think that the creation of that AFC office in Garissa will assist in the remittance of those outstanding debts?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NGARURO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I agree with the hon. Member. In fact, it would even be better if the hon. Member went further to request the farmers to go ahead and still pay the outstanding loans they owe so that we can lend it to other farmers.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Bidu's Question.</Newspeech>Question No. 296<Header>Payment of N. S.S.F. Dues for Messrs. Mwatela and Omar.</Header>MR. BIDU asked the Minister for Labour. when Messrs ELlalo Mwatela. NSSF No 040-146-022_and Bakari Omar, HSSF No 380-394-219 will be paid their benefits.<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo):Mr. Deputy Speaker,Sir	Sir, I beg to reply.Mr. Mwatela has not applied for his HSSF benefits and sowe cannot pay him; but when he applies for them, we will processhis application. Mr.Omar applied in February, 1930 and we found that he worked with the Ministry of Health 1966 to 1989. However,	our records show that his contributions cover the years between 1966 to and l975 and 1977. We are in the process of preparing a check for him which he should receive within the next two years. As for the other years for which we have no records, we have asked his former employer to give us his particulars and as soon we receive those particulars we will arrange to pay Mr.Omar the remaining amount of money.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Minister for his reply, but I am surprised when he says that they have not received Mr. Mwatela's forms. I have a copy of Mr. Mwatela's application form and have even copied down the form number from that copy form.How soon will the Minister be able to get all the details from the Ministry where Mr. Bakari Omar was working?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as soon as we get the relevant forms, we will arrange for Mr. Mwatela to be paid. Since my friend, Hon. Bidu, has a copy of the form, perhaps, he will be serving Mr. Mwatela's course if he arranges to submit that form to the relevant officers or to me. If he does that, I will convey it to the N.S.S.F., so that we may begin to process Mr. Mwatela's application. However, our records show that we have not received this application.As for Mr. Bakari Omar's pay claim, it will depend on how quickly we get this response". All I can say at the moment is that we have sent a request to the Ministry of Health for information and, as soon as it gives us this information, we will do what is required. Without this information, I am completely powerless to pay Mr. Omar anything.</Newspeech>Question No. 305 <Header>Boarding Primary Schools from Tana River</Header>MR. WAKOLE asked the Minister for Edicatopm whether the Ministry could consider building boarding primary schools in Tana River District to specifically cater for the nomadic community of this area.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Amayo): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.My Ministry has no immediate plans to build more boarding primary schools in Tana River District due to financial sonstraints.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAKOLE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the Assistant Minister is misleading the House because my Question is whether the Ministry could consider building boarding primary schools that have been approve by the World Bank in this nomadic area.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Question posed by the hon. Member is whether the Ministry would consider building boarding primary schools for the nomadic communities in the area. We are talking about a boarding primary school, and I do not know the difference between this school and a nomadicboarding primary school. What I am saying is that there are six boarding primary schools in Tana River District which the communities there can utilise. As per the enrolment figures available, these six boarding primary schools have a low enrolment. However, if there are any special circumstances that would require the construction of an additional board in primary school, we would expect the hon. Member to submit this suggestion, through the District Education Board and the District Development Committee there, as a development priority to the Ministry.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.I. MOHAMED: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think what the hon. Member is saying is that there are some specific nomadic primary schools which have been aided by the World Bank, and wants to know whether the Ministry could consider increasing such schools in the district.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not know whether the distinction between aid from the World Bank and that from the Kenya Government makes any difference here. There are six boarding primary schools in Tana Tiver District that are maintained by the Government. We have Arap Moi Boarding School, Hola Primary School, Garsen Primary School, Wenje Primary School, Kipini Primary School and Mororo Primary School. If the hon. Member had a specific request relating to the World Bank money, perhaps it would have been bccter if that was indicated in the Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.I. MOHAMED: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The primary boarding school that the hon. Member is referring to is not ordinary. The latter had its own board-of-governors, unlike the other schools that are manned by school committees. Most North—Eastern districts were given one such school each, and the hon. Member is asking why Tana River District should be exceptional from the other districts there.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AMAYO : Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the information being given to me by the hon. Member requires clarification. So, I would not commit myself here unless I am given time to submit this information next week.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GALGALLO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, to elaborate on what thehon. Member is saying, I would like to inform the Assistant Minister that most of the boarding primary schools he has mentioned are all along the river, whereas the nomadic communities that the hon. Member is refer in to are in the interland of Tana River District, about 60 miles away from the security boundary there. Could the Assistant Minister consider this fact and build more boarding schools there?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have noted the sentimentsexpressed by the hon. Member, but that is a separate question. If the interlandof Tana River District is not adequately covered, this could have come under thedevelopment plans from the district.</Newspeech>			Question No. 310<Header>Title Deeds for "MTAANI" Residents</Header>MR.

MAKHANU asked the Minister for Culture and Social Services how many motor cycles the Department of Adult Education has in Bungoma District vis-a—vis the established complement and how many are serviceable.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mr. Lomada):There are six motorcycles in Bungoma District for Adult Education against sevendivisions, and these six motorcycles are not serviceable and need repairs.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from the AssistantMinister's reply, Bungoma District is not receiving the necessary services required from the Department of Adult Education, which is an innovation of His Excellency the President to reduce illiteracy in this country, here is a Ministry that does not care at all as to how to implement or supervise this programme. Could the Assistant Minister be kind enough to tell us when these motorcycles are going to be serviceable? When are they going to be repaired and utilised by the officers concerned?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Arising from the reply from the Assistant Minister, I would like to say that the hon. Member asked how many motorcycles are serviceable. Is the Assistant Minister in order to say that there are six motorcycles that are not serviceable? Is that not as good as saying that there rae no serviceable motorcycles there?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LOMADA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member should know that even if the motor-cycles are not serviceable or near to be repaired, they are there and they do exist.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I come from the district in question and I know that there are these six motor-cycles which have not been serviceable for the last two years. Could the Assistant Minister tell us how much is needed to repair each and every of the six motor-cycles? We want to know the amount.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LOMADA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the problem that is there is that there are no spare parts for these particular motor-cycles in our country. The motor-cycles are BSA model, manufactured in Britain. Therefore, we do not have their spare parts in the county.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.  The hon. Assistant Minister's reply to my supplementary question is irrelevant because I wanted to know how much money would be needed to repair each of the six motor-cycles. I did not want to know whether there are spare parts in Kenya or not.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LOMADA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we need a total of KShs.39,500/- to repair five motor-cycles out of the six, and they will be repaired in the next financial year. One of the motor-cycles, GK 971, cannot be repaired as it was involved in a "fatal" accident.</Newspeech>(Laughter)<Newspeech>DR. MISOI: Now that the Assistant Minister has now answered the question, could he assure this House that immediately the next financial year begins, and not the end of it, funds will be made available to repair the motor-cycles?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LOMADA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not think I am in a position to cheat my hon. colleague that we can repair these motor-cycles next week.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is high time that the Ministry told the House exactly the truth. It is not difficult to order for spare parts from Britain. The Ministry only needs to tender and then an importer can bring the spare parts into this country. Therefore, the Assistant Minister cannot juststand up and tell MS the they cannot get spore parte. They must have negotiatedfor the spare parts, However, can the Assistant Minister tell us when they are going to import the necessary spare parts and repair the motor-cycles?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LOMADA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think I stated very clearly that five of the six motor-cycles are going to be repaired in the next budget. We cannot do anything else apart from sticking to that assurance.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I heard the Assistant Minister earlier on say that the motor-cycles will be repaired next week, and now he says that the repairs will be carried out next financial year, which will be 1990/91. Does he know the language of financial years?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LOMADA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if I can remember very well, I did not say that we are going to repair these motor-cycles next week. When I responded to a point of order, I said that the hon. Member could not expect us to repair the motor-cycles next week.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASIKE—NDOMBI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister said very clearly here that the motor-cycles "will be repaired in the next budget" Now that we have already had the current budget, does he mean to tell us that the motor-cycles will be repaired in the 1991/92 Financial Year?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LOMADA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I said it very clearly that the motor-cycles will be repaired within the next financial year.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon. Members. Mr. Lomada, with due respect that you said "after the next budget", there is a difference between next financial year, which starts on 1st July, 1990, and the next budget because the current budget has already been presented. So, I think you need to clarify that point.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LOMADA: I am sorry, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, but I meant to say the next financial year.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALLANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, six motor-cycles is quite a big fleet. Certainly; there was a service that those motor-cycles were rendering unless they were taken there for fun. Now th2t the motor-cycles have been out of use for two years, some service must have been seriously jeopardised. What has the Ministry been doing for these two years that the motor-cycles have been out of service to ensure continuity of services in the area?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LOMADA: Mr. Deputy Speaker,Sir the hon. Member should also know that the Ministry of Culture and Social Services is very much concerned about its work in every part of this country. Therefore the Ministry has not been sleeping; we have been working tirelessly looking for these spare parts.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALLANA: On a point of orders-Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister has said nothing with regard to my question. asked what the Ministry has been doing to ensure that the services rendered by the six motor-vehicles does not suffer. What does the Ministry intend to do while awaiting these spire parts from Britain? He has not said anything to that effect.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: He does not-know what he is talking about!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LOMADA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. once the spare parts are not there, there is nothing one can do.</Newspeech>		<Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are mature enough here and we do not want the Assistant Minister to joke with us in this House. We need these motor-cycles repaired so that adult education officers can move within the district. KShs.39,500/- is nothing to the: Ministry because, after all, we vote money for the Ministry. The Assistant Minister should not tell us that there are not spare parts. It is very wrong for him to tell us that because.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is your question, hon. Chepkok?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: Can the Assistant Minister, tell the House when they are going to import the spare parts and repair these, motors-cycles? Is it going to be during this financial year?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I wonder whether Mr. Chepkok realises that next financial year begins next week. Just for the benefit hon. Members, hon. Lomada, when you talk of next financial year it covers a lot of distance. Can you clarify that?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LOMADA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have said severally that we are going to repair these motor-cycles during the next financial year which starts next week.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.DEPUTY SPEAKER: Well, we must now get on. Mr. A.I. Mohamed, can you ask the last supplementary question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.I. MOHAMED: Mr. Deputv Speaker, Sir, if the Ministry	Has not been able to acquire those spare parts for two years,where will it got them from during the next one week?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LOMANDA: It is up to the Ministry to know where it will get those spare parts from. The Ministry has already said that it will repair those Motor-cycles during the nextFinancial Year, and that is all.</Newspeech>Question No.307<Header>Repair of Roads in mikindani and Chaani</Header> MR. MWAMZANDI_ o n behalf of Mr. Kiliku asked the Minister for Local Government that since the roads in Mikindani and Chaani Site and Service Schemes are in a poor condition, could he instruct Mombasa Municipal Council to repair them forthwith.<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is there anybody from the Ministry of Local Government?Can we go back to Mr. Lewa’s Question</Newspeech>Question No. 310 Title Deeds for "MTAANI" ResidentsMR. LEWA asked the Minister for Lands and Housing what plans he has to issue title deeds to those people of Kilifi "MTAANI" whose names have been recommended by the Kilifi Urban Council.<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LAND HOUSING (Mr. Mbela): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to apologise for coming in late. I had to get some detailed information which I needed in order to reply this Question satisfactorily, and that is why I was late.I now beg to reply. So far no a names have been forwarded to my Ministry. Since Kilifi "Mtaani" was erected without a plan, a physical plan will have to be drawn and the names forwarded to the Commissioner of Lands before my Ministry can ratify the recommendations of the Kilifi District plots Allocation Committee. The Council has otherwise. No authority over that land and	their deliberations are, therefore, invalid.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEWA: Sir, the questions of the houses having beenerected without a plan maybe irrelevant. Those houses were put. before 1968, when the Government acquired that land from the private owners. Therefore, when the Government took over that land, it was aware that those houses were there. What will the Ministry do d in order to make sure that those houses are given to^ the people who live in them? I am sure that the Minister is aware of a list of the people who own those houses which was handed, over to his Ministry in 1985.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MBELA: Mr. $ Deputy Speaker, Sir, Kilifi has to conform to the modern standards of Constructing houses.Before we can talk of title deeds being issued, a physical plan will have to be prepared. The list that was submitted to my Ministry in 1985 was invalid because the, Kilifi Urban. Council had no authority at all to go ahead to effect these allocations. According to the current Government policy, it is the District Plots Allocation Committee chaired by the district commissioner where Kanu is represented with a number of other officials which	draw up plans. The council should notdraw up a plan showing which people, should be given that land.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEWA: I think that the urban council has a role toplay, because they are the people who know, from their records,who has been living in that area since 1968. I am	surprised to hear that the Minister does not want to work togetherwith the Urban Council. Who else can verify on behalf the Kilifi District Plots Allocation Committee of the authenticity of that list if the Minister does not want to work with the urban council?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MBELA: Sir. I local authority allocated  that land Improperly Inthe present Government of allocating land, the local authority  is represented as a member, but they do not do it on their own and communicate to my Ministry without the knowledge of the other vital members of the district plots allocation committee, like the chairman, who is the district commissioner, and Kanu which must be represented.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MISOI: What is the Ministry doing to normalise that  situation which the Minister is saying is abnormal. What is theMinistry doing to make sure that these plots are allocated to those people in the right way?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MBELA: I have already answered the question which has been raised by Dr. Misoi; Currently, the plan is being prepared, not only in paper, but in a manner that will ensure thatthe paper Work marries with the ground work. That plant will also include some modern facilities that are required like roads. The physical plans are being prepared, and after their approval, the district plots allocations committee plus a member from the local authority shall meet and then give us a list of the number of people who plots and we shall implement it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEWA: Sir, since the question of drawing up plans and issuing of title deeds will take quite a bit of time, could the Minister, consider giving those people some temporaryoccupation licenses . I am saying so because we want to avoid a situation whereby other people might encroach on that land before it is officially allocated to the original people.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MBELA: The answer to that question is no. It will not take a long time, to have that plan implemented. That area very small, and there is no reason why that exercise cannot becompleted before the end of this calendar year.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.Since that problem is affecting most towns in Kenya, what plans does the Ministry have so that people can acquire title deeds for their plots throughout the country?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MBELA: Sir, I need to be given some more time so that I can carry out some research on that question in order toanswer it to the satisfaction of hon. Members.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Can we go back to Mr. KilikutsQuestion for the second time?</Newspeech>Question No. 307<Header>Repair of Roads in Mikindani and Chaani</Header>MR. MWAMZANDI on behalf of Mr. Kiliku asked the Minister for Local Government since the roads in Midindani and Chaani Site and		Service Schemes are in a poor condition, he could instruct Mombasa Municipal Council to repair them forthwith.	<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Keen): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Minister for LocalGovernment. I beg to reply.The Ministry and the Council are already aware, of the poor conditions of the Mikindani and Chaani Site and Service Schemes roads, and are currently consulting with a view toidentifying sources of finances so that those roads can berepaired. The roads will therdfore, be repaired as soon as	funds become available.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Sir, it was reported in the newspapersthat the Mombasa Municipal Council had been given Kshs.20 million torepair roads at Mombasa. Is Mikindani and Chaani Site andService Scheme roads excluded from that programme?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEEN: Since I am a regular visitor to Mombasa townI know that the reads in Mombasa are in extremely poor conditions. And that kshs.20 million is a drop in the sea. That money can hardly be enough to repair all the roads in Mombasa, but as soon as funds are made available, the roads in  Mikindan ana Chaani Site and Service Schemes will certainly be repaired. I would only ask the hon. Member from that area to urge his constituents and the other Mombasa residents to pay the service charges to the council so that it can be in a position to repair some of those affected roads.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWANZANDI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if that money is just like a	"drop in the sea" why can it hot be madeto fall on Mikindani and Chaani?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEEN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, things are done according to priorities. Some roads have been given high priority and they are going to be repaired. As I have already stated, the Mombasa Municipal Council is not going to over look this particular road. This road will be repaired as soon as funds become available. The hon. Member should be patient and wait until the money becomes available. This is because we have financial constraints at the moment.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: We will now move on to Questions by Private Notice.</Newspeech><Header>QUESTIONS BY PRIVATE NOTICE Grading of Chebole - labotiet Road</Header><Newspeech>MR. arap SOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Public Works the following Question by Private Notice.When will the road from Chebole to labotiet be graded as per the Ministry's undertaking made in 1989.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Maiyani) : Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Ministry has already started work on Chebole-Labotiet Road. The formation commenced on 26th June, 1990, using a dozer.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is talking about "Chebore" but that name does not appear in this Question. The name is "Chebole" and not "Chebore".</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI:Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I pronounced that name correctly.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap SOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has said that the road formation commenced on 26th June 1990. But you Will find that last year the same Assistant Minister told me that work on that road was to be started in two weeks' time. That was in November, 1989.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!  it is appropriate that if a matter is before the House there should be no private communication between the Assistant Minister and you, Mr. arap Soi. I thought I heard you say that he told you something; he must have told the House.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. arap SOI: I am sorry, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister gave that reply to the House. he told the House in November, last year, that work on that road would beStarted in two weeks' time. He has told the House that they are using a dozer on that road. But this road has been neglected for a long time and the rain has ruined it. It is now full of deep gullies. Would the Assistant Minister instruct the Engineer in charge to use a tipper to fill these gullies with murram?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the informationI have before me is that work on this road commenced on 26.6.90. Weare using a dozer to fill these gullies with soil. After fillingthese gullies we are going to use a grader to grade theroad. We are currently using the dozer to fill thesegullies with murram and so on. The grading of this road  D234 will follow immediately after the dozer work is completed. RoadD234 runs through cotton soils and has deep gullies which couldnot facilitate normal grading. So, a dozer Was required to form theroad and cut out metre drain's. The dozer in the District was engagedin back-filling a bridge on road D235, which was completed on20th June, 1990. The dozer could, therefore, not be available for use earlier on road D234, as explained above.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.KAGWIMA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as such as I appreciate that answer from the Assistant Minister, I find it very difficult to believe that a dozer, can be used, to grade a road and also be used to carry murrain. I do not know why the Ministry is using a dozer to carry murrain instead of using a tipper as requested by the hon. Member.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have stated very clearly that we are using the dozer to fill the gullies with murram We are also using the dozer to cut the areas which have been damage by rain water. The grader is going to repeat that work levelling the road. As for murram I have no information that there is need for a tipper or a lorry to be used to ferry murram fron elsewhere. So, honestly speaking there is no Information . about murram here. But we are going to do this workusing two different machines a dozer to cover all thedamaged areas and a grader to level the road.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. KAGWIMA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for the informationof the hon. Assistant Minister, continuous grading actuallyspoils the road. This is because you are	continuouslyreducing the level of the road and eventually the road becomes a"river". So, if the road is below the ground level rain water fromThe higher ground will collect on the road. So, the roadshould be raised so that the water drains away from the road afterthe rains. Continuous grading of roads all over the country willcreate rivers instead of roads.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr.maiyani: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, our engineers are erecting culverts where they are required. They are also makingcut-offs to take the water away from the road.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. arap SOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, would theAssistant Minister tell the House how much money has been setaside for maintaining that road from last year to The end of this year?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the fact that the Ministry is already working on the roads proves that sass money has been set aside for the maintenance, of this road. But the hon. Member has raised a totally different question for which I was not prepared. I do not have the figures with me now.Delay in Filling Sports directors Posts</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister of Culture and Social Services, the following Question by Private Notices Why has the Ministry delayed the full implementation of the Public Service commission decision with regard to the filling of the 12 posts of Sports Directors.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICE(Mrs.Ogot):Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.My Ministry has not received any decisions from the Public Service Commission to fill any vacancies regarding the 12 post of  Sports Directors However, the position is that the post of Sports Directors  were advertised sometimes early this year and the interested candidates applied for then, and were interviewed by the Public service commissioner. Unfortunately the Public Service Commission did not find any  qualified candidate to lake up the job, and these posts will be re-advertised  again in due course.Therefore, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the issue of my Ministry having delayed the implementation of the public service  commission decision with regard to the filling up these 12 posts does not arise.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am in a real difficultposition here because I would re out of order to describe the hon. Gracious lady as a liar. Unfortunately. I find it very difficult to believe what she has said in her answer because I think what she has told the House is lies.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order Mr. MAKHANU! Are you really sure that the words you are using are Parliamentary:</Newspeech>	 Page no 260 last paragraph unreadable….this letter, which I will lay on the Table in due course. This letter proves that the Public Service Commission did convey their decision to the Ministry to have the 12 officers employed. This is the letter says:-"I am directed to convey the decision of the Public Service Commission that subject compliance with the Permanent Secretary Office of the president Circular letter No. CP/3/78/IV/l32 of 20th September, 1980,"Mr. Sebastian Cay ango Ckect and Mrs. Kargaret Kanini Otolo, both lecturers at the Kenya Science Teachers College, and employees of the Teachers Service Commission, (3) Mr. Josiah Grende - Social Development Officer I - Sports - (2) Mr. Kahashen piti Titothy Akaranga- Senior Lecturer - Laikipia -Teachers College, (5) Mr. Andrew Njake Eingori - Lecturer - Kaguno Teachers College, (6) Mr. Symok Kjugana Kgugi, (7) Mr. Kichael Moiyai Kosgey- Social Development Officer II, (8), Mr. Wilberforce Cheber- Social Development Officer I, (9), Miss Florence Wanjiru Ndungu- Assistant Lecturer Kericho Teachers-College,(10) Mr. Diseus Milimu Bulinda- Lecturer - Kenya Science Teachers College (11) Mr. Gerishon Ebole Wayodd, Lecturer, Kei Teachers College, and (12), Miss Grace Ada Anyango Cwala - Lecturer Kaguma Teachers College,be appointed to fill up the 12 advertised posts in the grade Sports director - Job Grout K.This letter was signed by the permanent Secretary Mr. Kinalat and it is fully quoted in the standard. I would like the Assistant Minister to refuse this or go and check her facts so that he can come back to the House and give us the proper reply. They should be able to tell us Why the posts have not been, filled.</newspeech>                     <newspeech>MRS. OGOT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Kakhanu, who used to be a district commissioner, is very well versed with the Standing Orders of this House agreed to withdraw the remark he made namely that I told this House lies, with regard to the newspaper report that the hon. Member referred to, I would like to say that the Ministry is also aware of the report appearing in the standard of Thursday, 5th April, 1990, quoting some sources from the Ministry as having given that information. I would like to say that according to the Ministry's records this is not true. I am prepared to go and investigate this natter, but I would not be surprised if the information now being given by hon. Makhanu and quoted in the standard, was not true. I have already told this House that the Public Service Commission will re-advertise the jobs. If the public service Commission had already filled up the posts, on what basis could they again communicate to us and tell us to re-advertise the jobs? Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I as I stand here, I am speaking on behalf of the Ministry and not the newspapers, and saying that the jobs, will be re-advertised, No appointments were made for these posts but I am quite willing to look at the document which hon. Makhanu is referring to when he lays it on the Table. However, the answer I have given here is the true position.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I think I should draw the attention of the hon. Members to the provision of Standing Order No.37 (13) so that they do not have to lay emphasis on newspapers reports and perhaps^ use them as points of reference. This is what it says:-"A Question shall not ask whether any statement in the Press or of a private individual or unofficial body, other than a report of something written or said by a Minister or Assistant Minister or civil servant, is accurate."</newspeech><newspeech>DR.

DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Makhanu it is appropriate for you to lay that document on the Table before we proceed.</newspeech><newspeech>MR.

DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Chepkok hon. Makhanu has just said that everything he has said is contained in the newspaper cutting because the same newspaper gives the reference of the letter he referred to. So, he cannot lay on the Table what he does not have.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. If I heard hon. Makhanu correctly, he said that he is prepared to bring or to give more information and we need it.</newspeech>    <newspeech>MR.

MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was just saying that the appointment of a Sports Director is very important to the sporting Kenyans, and if that is the case, when is the Ministry, through the Public Service Commission (P.S.C.), going to re-advertise these posts and fill them?</newspeech>     <newspeech>MRS.

DEPUTY SPEAKER: Re-advertisement!</newspeech>       <newspeech>MR. KIRWA: Okay. What is the anomaly between the appointment of the 12 officials and the re-advertisement of the same in the newspapers in due course? We went to clear this confusion because when somebody reads between the lines, something must have gone wrong somewhere and somebody is trying to re-advertise the posts then substitute the original team with another team of new candidates, and the former beneficiaries of the same are going to lose. Any clarification?</newspeech>          <newspeech> MR. OGOT: First and foremost. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not sit on the Board of interviews for P.S.C., I am not aware of the ladies and gentlemen who were appointed previously. But since the jobs are going to be re-advertised any time from now, what would be the loss to the former beneficiaries? If they had been interviewed, they could also re-apply, and if they are qualified, why should they lose? After all, the P.S.C. is very independent from the Ministry!</newspeech><newspeech>MR.

Box 1834, Nairobi, since he was forced to resign verbally on 7th September, 1984, after serving the company for over 17 years?</newspeech>   <newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Since Mr. Kadenge chose not to report the matter to any labour officer in the country, in the interest of fair labour practice, the Ministry of Labour cannot intervene in the matter.</newspeech>      <newspeech>MR. WASIKE-NDOMBI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, is the. Minister aware that the Managing Director of Coca Cola Bottling Company Limited, Mr. Rital Singh, besides forcing Mr. Kadenge to resign has forced another 24 officers to resign? The names of those officers are as follows:-Fred Mureithi Mamba Donald MainaCharles MugoJoel BataruJames NjeruRobinson Mutisya Nelson KathembaB. WereJ. Ndung'uJason NjengaHussein Abaallafathee Francis Muteru Jeremiah Aimba Collins MurageJohn IwuliJacob MambaDan KariukiJohn GitikiGerald Otiongo Julius KimeuSamuel OdhiamboThis particular Managing Director started as a mere truck helper and has never, never been to school. He was employed there in 1958. As a result he does not want Black Africans to work in that company. Is the Minister aware that as a result of his actions this Managing Director is not working for the interests of Kenyans employed in that company? If he is aware of that, what steps is he talking to ensure that Mr. Kadenge is reinstated and those who are still working in that company are fairly treated?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I said earlier on, Mr. Kadenge chose not to report the matter to any labour office and as such we cannot come in in affairs we consider private between him and that company. When he reports the matter to us, certainly we shall look into it. As for the other people that the hon. Member is talking about, that is a different matter altogether.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, is the Minister really convinced that apart from Mr. Kadenge the other officers never complained to any of his officers? Is there some communication breakdown somewhere?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. OKONBO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is why I said that all those other officers form part of a different Question because they were not referred to us which is why we did not look into the matter. That is a total different Question.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MWERU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, this Question is very interesting because this company has the habit of forcing senior indigenous Africans to resign without following the proper procedures. I have some experience in this since I am a former employee of that company. I reported such a matter to the former Senior Management Workers' Union and it was reported the Ministry of Labour.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Are you saying that you are a former employee of that company, Mr. Mweru?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MWERU: Yes, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, and I am using myself as a practical example. I was terminated in the same manner too. Fortunately,later on the union was able to handle my case and I was compensated. SinceMr. Kadenge has not reported this matter to any labour officer, is it fair that this Managing Director continues frustrating other employees there?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, frustration of any kind under any circumstances on anybody is wrong and cannot be tolerated. This is because such a thing is not correct and right. So, if such practices are reported to the Ministry, we shall certainly deal with such situations, the officer and company according to the law. I would like to bear about such a situation.</newspeech><newspeech>DR. MISOI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it really in order for the Minister to fail to tell this House what action he is going to take when he has been told of frustrations and sacking of 21 officers by that company?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the affected officers report the matter to us, we will take it up. This is because a labour officer sits as a court of first incidence. So, if, the employees report the matter to the labour officer, he will certainly sit, take evidence and pursue the matter to its fair conclusion. This is what I am asking to be done.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. WASIKE-NDOMBI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the officers whose names I have just mentioned were in high positions like those of general sales manager, accounts manager, administrative manager and so on. These are all high managerial positions. Now that the Minister is aware that this thing is going on there and in the interest of fair labour practices, what steps is going to take from now on to protect these officers from working under fear from a Kalasinga?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the interest of fair labour practice, the employee has to lodge a complaint. This is because if he does not do that, then we are forced to assume that he is satisfied with the state of affairs. This is because if he is unhappy, he should come and complain and say: "Look, Mr. Labour Officer/Minister, this company has mistreated me." If he is an educated man who held a senior job in the company and has left, but he does not want to talk about it, then I cannot interfere in his private affairs.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KYONDA: On a point of information, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. From what we have heard these are high ranking officers with intelligence and would know what to do if there are malpractices as has happened here. I would like to inform the Minister that he should go back and look into this matter because I have experience of people who have lost their jobs, have gone to report to the Ministry, but never got any help at all. I would not be surprised if the same case applies to the people whose names were mentioned here.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will repeat that a labour officer operates like a court. A court does not go to the complainant to ask him to bring his case to court. We, too, do not do that where a person of a high integrity, like an assistant manager, has been wronged, he should come and complain to us. But if he does not do that we cannot start and open a case. Who will defend him? There will be no defence. Who will be complaining? There would be no complainant. So, how will the case proceed? If the hon. Members want us in the Ministry to take up the case, they should advise those officers concerned to lodge a complaint and we will handle it immediately.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Next Order.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Next Order.</newspeech><header>POINT OF ORDER</header>  <newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Mibei): On a point of order,Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. On 26th of June, this year, I made my contribution to the Budget Speech and I was surprised to find that the Kenya Times newspaper of the following day. I do not know whether it was mischief or irresponsible journalism entirely misquoted me. On the sixth column of the Kenya Times newspaper of 27th June, they wrote the following:-"The Minister for Public Works, Mr. Timothy Mibei, asked Kenyans to export scrap metal to foreign countries as they were utilised for making various items which we later buy at exorbitant prices."     Sir I never made such a statement. I have a copy of the HANSARD here which has a verbatim report of what I said on page R...1 of 26th June. What I said is as follows:-"we should not allow our scrap metal to be exported to other countries because those countries will melt that metal and then produce some commodities which they will later sell to us at exorbitant price."    I would like to appeal to the Kenya Times newspaper to make that correction. The Standard newspaper also misquoted me by writing the following:"The Minister urged the Government to increase tax on imported raw materials."I never said this. What I said, according to the HANSARD, was:-"I would therefore urge all those who are producing raw materials in this country to increase their production and efficiency so that we do not have to import raw materials."I suggest that the standard of journalism in this country should be accurate so that errors like these onesdo not occur.       Thank you.</newspeech>                                                        Second Reading                                         The Finance (No.2) Bill (The Assistant Minister, Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance (Mr. Kariuki) on 27690)(Resumption of Debate interrupted on 27690)                                                             <newspeech>MR MADHUBUTI: As ante sana, Bv Eaibu Spika, "kva nmipaiia nafasi hii ili raj niungare na Wabunge venzangu kva knseza nachacha juu 7a IIsvada huu iivanza kabisa ningependa kxuoskukuru Kakacu va ca Kaziri va Fedha kva kazi rrri aiiycfanya kuhusiana na Bajeti va 3ka huu anbayo haikuongeza "Dei za bidhaa  isipokuva "bia Sisi Waislanu va nchi hii, tuna furaha kwa sababu Serikali ilituongezea kiasi cha pesa za natunizi lva "rale vataiiaokuenda irna ssonbi kule Mecca Tile vile, rna shulotrard kubva kva Shirika la ldege la kenya kva uvapunguzia nauii yss wale vatakaosafiri Mecca 17ikisesa sachache ;usu leseni za oiasLara, uiacna ksazba katika maduka ra zahoteli kuna leseni sa biashara saba, nane au haja ya ::uva ra leseni nyinei kiasi hiki na hali pesa hize rote zinakvenda kva Serikali Ingefaa kuve na leseni no ja tu iii venye :iasnara vasi sumbulive na kuooteza vakati vao Utaona kvasba leseni hizi ni za zvaka nzoiE tu na huu ni suda cdogo sana Ninaonelea kwambai leseni hizi zineduru kva nroda vra rziaka zzitatu Kva nfano, kuna uhuru kva na njia hii iraraokoa  vateja nuda wa lmjaza fozra kiia nara na aliiza Pia tunacpongeza Makanu waARais na Vaziri va ?edha kva kup:r;guza ushuru juu ya iende tujuavyo, tfaislam, hutunia tende nyingsana vakati va Ranadhaai na nvaka huu tulipokea tende nyingi sana oat oka Saudi I Arabia na rchi nrinsine za Kiarabu ITingependa kuseia irvadba Waislaau abac nilioni taro katika nchi hii vasekasitirishva na kufadhaishva sana kutokana ra habariiliyochazish" na gaseti la ardard la arsis 13 na naneno hayc yalice ra ra nle Ilanrhr Eabari hii ilitokana na ukataji va vidoie vivili vya vale vatu valisemekana kvamba vznavi irua kuonyesioa kvamba vamaunga mkoro vyar? vivili vya kisiasa   Bk  Kamctho alisema hivi:                         "Kerya is not an Islamic State where such behaviour can be encouraged"      Kama oaneno hayo yalisemva na mwananchi wa ka kawaida,  atimgekaairi ahva Kva vile mareno haya yalisemva na SeeretaryGeneral wa ICacu, tumeudiika saca Je, ni kva rini Uislamu unaingizva katika mambo yanayohusiana na ukataji va vidoie?

MISOI: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir for allowing me to contribute to this finance Bill. This is a very important Bill because it relates to the finances and revenue for running Government business. If one looks at the Government revenue summary, he will realise that 86 per cent of that revenue is made up of customs and excise duty 22 per cent; income tax 29 per cent and sales tax/VAT 35 per cent. This means that the officers charged with, the task of ensuring that this revenue goes into Government coffers must be of very high integrity; responsible, incorruptible and people who will ensure that this revenue is collected.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am saying because going by previous Public Accounts Be ports there were reports that instead of officers collecting taxes from warehouses, handed warehouse and so on sometimes goods were removed from these warehouses without payment of taxes; or after part payment of the taxes. These practices lead to loss of finances which are needed to provide to the people we represent.It is necessary for the Ministry concerned to pay closer attention to revenue collection. There are many loopholes through, which customs officers and other officers lose money either through carelessness or because they are interested parties. However, thank the Government for taking action against those corrupt officers who may have misused their positions or who may have been responsible for loss of Government revenue. It is important for those caught in shady deals to be taken to court and prosecuted. In areas where we have goods which have seized because the importers have not complied with the necessary regulations, those goods should be disposed of in auctions so that everybody gets an equal chance to buy them. Instead of selling such goods being in a closed circuit, their sale should be advertised. The Bill also contains exemption of duty on speed governors. This issue was raised here before, and it was said that Public Service Vehicles (P.S.V.) are supposed to have these governors fitted, but somehow the vigour and interest expressed in implanting this particular programme did not move fast enough. We still hear of accidents throughout Kenya in which many people and many more others are maimed. This is a big loss to this country. If we were serious enough in implementing such a programme, as we were in allowing speed governors to be brought to this country, this would save a lot of our people's productive lives.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we should not rely on economic reasons in not dispensing a public service like this. It is important that we reduce the danger caused by speeding motor vehicles about which we read in the newspapers so frequently. I almost became a victim of a mad speeding driver on Sunday when, speeding in the opposite direction, he simply ran into my car. The car became a write off, and thank God I came out alive. This is why I say that we should be careful in seeing that drivers drive carefully, observing the safety aspects of the road. Cars do not take care of people; it is people who take care of these machines.With regard to the Value Added Tax (V.A.T.), which has contributed quite a lot to the revenue earning capacity of the country, I would like to say that this tax is the highest revenue earner of its kind. It earns 45 per cent of our revenue. Last year, we complained on behalf of farmers and said that the five per cent that they were required to pay was a bit too high. The latest figures available show that farmers are paying interest on loans from the Agricultural Finance Corporation, the Kenya Grain Growers Co-operative Union and the Kenya Co-operative Creameries, and they make no profits in the end Farmers have to get loans to be able to pay these taxes. The V.A.T. is an easy way of making people pay taxes, but it makes farmers' co-operative societies very costly where members lose a lot of money, it would have been better, if there was another way of paying this tax besides taking away all the gross income that farmers are expected to get. Let me now move on to the taxation of exports. I would like to thank the Government for having ensured that this type of enterprises do not pay taxes in the first 10 years. This is a good move which will enable us to manufacturer’s goods for foreign markets. In fact, this ought to have been started a long time ago. We do not know why this measure has taken such a period of time to take off. Perhaps, there are too many bureaucratic provisions or laxity on the part of the officers involved. However, it is important that when we have a project like this, which has succeeded in many other places, we implement it quickly enough. Such a project has succeeded in the Far East, Mauritius and other places. If we implement such a project speedily, we will ensure that we go into these markets where we expect to earn foreign exchange.Our exports which are based on agricultural produce.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Dr. Misoi, we are discussing the Finance Bill, and I would advise that you do not jump to the Export Promotion Zone, on which we have not opened discussion right now.</newspeech><newspeech>DR. MISOI: Thank you very, much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The way I look at the issue is that we have a big document here representing the Finance Bill, and this may be the reason that has misled me. However, I was only saying that that programme should have been started a long time ago. I would now like to move on to the political environment which relates to investment in this country and express my thanks and appreciation for the manner in which this country has managed to handle various issues which have arisen recently. The political situation in the country is under control, and the steps that the Government has undertaken have assured this country that the security it deserves is available. I would simply say that those who want to chaos by wanting to be leaders of this country disregard the security of the nation, and they are enemies of the country. The people of Kenya have made their decision on the way and manner in which this country should be managed and led. They have decided that this country should be led by His Excellency the President under the ruling Kanu Party. Every mwananchi is behind the present leadership of this country.People talk about freedoms of all kinds, but they forget that majority freedom is more important than that of the individual or a group of individuals. We would rather forgo the freedom of two people and save that of the majority. It does not matter who the individual, concerned are nor whether they are politicians, religious, lawyers or not. It is the majority who matter, and when they make a decision, it should be respected by the minority. The minority cannot expect the majority to bend to what the former want. To this end, I would like to support the steps that the Government has taken to ensure that we continue on the same direction which this country selected immediately after attaining. Independence which was followed by our late Father of the Nation and which is now being followed in the present Nyayo Era, so, it is absolutely wrong for people to tell us to depart from what we know to be functional and practical, and is providing the services and the goods that the country seeks. It is out of order for anybody to imagine that Kenya, which is respected the world over, is wrong. This why Kenyans condemn such people.All the people who are behind those who participated in charting and mapping our direction in which we should develop came out in their millions and demonstrated what they want. Those who have eyes and ears should have seen and heard them. They mandated the Head of State to continue leading them without any precondition. Anybody else who talks otherwise should either pack up and leave or else shut up. This applies to all politicians, the religious, who are giving out press tickets of corruption, and the rest. They should not argue as if they were outside the system, be they religious or not. We have religious people among Government Ministers, senior public officers and in the private sector, who go to church every Sunday. If clergymen cannot change these people's hearts, what else can we say about them? They should rather preach to the people whom they think are corrupt to change their ways and habits so that this country may not have corruption, tribalism and so on.The same thing applies to the lawyers who cry up and down our roads, saying that this or that is wrong. What do they themselves offer instead? Do they offer free services to the clients who go to them if they are really interested in human rights? Do they not charge them exorbitant fees for the services?It is ridiculous for people to come around and try to deceive a nation that what we are doing is not correct. If they think they are cleverer than others, then they are wrong. In this House we have people who are tough; we have people who are clever and we have engineers, doctors, economists and so on. We even have lawyers in this House. So, it is ridiculous for people to say "That Parliament". Which Parliament do they expect to go? If they fail to come to this Parliament, do they expect to go into any other Parliament? No. People will decide, and they have decided. The people who are elected to come here will do their job as Parliamentarians, and they should know that. If they want to talk outside, let them, realise that we are here. We can kick them and we can eat them up because we can reason. We can talk to them if they want to. But we cannot talk to the minority. They should keep quiet.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have another question. A lot of information comes through the newspapers, and I would have expected that the news¬papers, managed by patriotic people, should know what to write for the people. The people are not interested to hear all the things which have been talked all over the place Exaggeration Excessive issues. Our people are clever. The other day the Government, though the Police Force, had to vet these Press conferences where people want to express certain things. We do not want to hear what these people are saying. Journalists, at least, should know what this country is supposed to be doing. Journalists should know that in order to survive and even to write news items in their newspapers we need peace and security. They should not be the ones to go into all this rubbish about which you cannot even make order. When the Government takes action, people come up and say that there is interference in the freedom of Press and what have you. It cannot be correct. You cannot expect one man to have freedom to say anything and the rest have nothing. This Government is responsible for our life and for our existence as it has been. So, we cannot allow that, and the sooner they know about it the better because we have rejected all the leaders of darkness.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when we got our Europeans said that Kenyatta was a leader unto darkness. We said no, Kenyatta was a leader unto light and he led us to light. How can somebody come up today and say that we have a leader unto darkness? We have Moi, who can lead us to light and we have seen the light he has given to this country. His Excellency the President has paid a lot of money in so many Harambees and initiated projects that many people never thought of. He has initiated the Nyayo Tea Zones, Nyayo Bus Service and all these others. What type of a leader do we want?Sir, these fellows who are talking around have been here. What have they done themselves? What new things did they bring to this country when they were Mini¬sters? Some of these people were politicians in this House and they were talking. What changes did they institute in this country? If the religious people think that there are problems in this country, let them feed and clothe the poor. Let them establish schools and throw poverty out of this country instead of coming to the newspapers and saying that they know Kenya. What Kenya do they knew? Some of these people were called to be lawyers; others were called to be bishops and all sorts of things, but now they are lost. They have lost their vocation and their professional line and they now want to come to politics. Although they tell us that anybody can be a politician, this is not their game. The game of politician as elected people should be left to them. The other people should do their business we do not want pseudo politicians who have no time to read politics. Let them leave us alone and they will be able to do a good job. Let them leave things to Kanu where there are elected people.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, to that extent, I do not believe that after the head of state has said that enough is enough, people should start talking behind the scenes as if they want to come from the back door. Who are they loyal to? Where is their loyalty? If they cannot be loyal to the head of state and they want to be listened to and be followed and be respected, what type of leaders are those? Even when a bishop wants his people to respect him, he goes to them in prayer and kneels down with them. And then they expect that when the President says that we do not do this and that we should sit back and watch those going round writing things! These people should be condemned; they are absurd and, somehow, they are good for nothing.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have a country to take care of. The fact that we can talk about our budget is a great measure of maturity. How many countries have budgets like this where they discuss and criticise things? You cannot tell us that we are afraid to talk and criticise. Who tells us not to talk in this House? Can they say who? Members of Parliament are not afraid. That is why they were elected, and they told the people, "We will represent you". So, when we come here we represent the people. The one important thing is that we are sensible; we are not irrational as they seem to be. A country like this cannot be led by irrational people with irrational policies or irrational ideologies we have no ideologies. We have our policy papers which have drawn our course of direction and we will follow those ones.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Finance Bill.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILDLIFE (Mr. Awori): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to also make a few remarks on the Finance Bill. Sir, reading in today’s newspapers, on the business side, there was a statement about the depreciation of the Kenya Shilling against the Pound. This is a great deal of worry. This country still depends a great deal on imports of machinery and certain raw materials, and when we have to convert a depreciated shilling into the Sterling Pound or the German Detacher mark, we find that we cannot make money in our local industry. What is required now is for us to strengthen the infrastructure of our county. Our backbone in this country is agriculture, which has commodities which are very much required in the world market. These commodities are such as tea, coffee, pyre thru and other crops.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is now incur bent on us to ensure that we improve the production of these three major exportable commodities so that we can then strengthen our economy and make sure that the Kenya Shilling recovers. Sir, there are many other commodities that we have not fully exploited. For instance, there is no reason why we should continue to import sugar in this country. We have the potential to produce enough sugar for domestic consumption and surplus for export. At this juncture, I would like to thank the Government very much for the proposal to build a sugar factory in Busia District. I would like to call upon all those concerned with the building of this factory to expedite it so that the people of Busia District can produce a lot of sugar-cane which will be processed into sugar for export. That way we will be strengthening our Kenya Shilling.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in Busia District we have a crop that was neglected during the colonial era. The colonialists, realising that if an African was allowed to grow a profitable crop he would exert himself and his position, they neglected cotton. Regrettably, we have not done better. Only recently, through the wise leadership of His Excellency the President, a Bill wasbrought in this House to improve the administration of cotton. I would like to call upon the Ministry concerned to formulate the rules and regulations governing cotton so that the crop can rank equally with coffee and tea. We know the reason why cotton is not being produced in great quantities, and that is because of the late payments, low prices and the general administration of the crop itself. I want to thank the Government for having increased the price of cotton from KShs.6.00 a kilo to KShs. 10.00 a kilogramme. This is going to help cotton producers a great deal.            Sir, the most important thing is to ensure that cotton is paid for on delivery. Even if we raise the price of cotton to Kshs.l6/- a kilo and the farmer has to wait until the end of the year that will not help in raising the cotton production at all. The cotton seed has got oil inside it, but yet we spend lot money in important raw material for process edible oils and soaps. Cotton seed can help in reducing the importation of oils and therefore, high products of cotton will not only feed the textile factories, but it will also reduce the importation of other oil material.Sir, we also have the potential of producing oil seed. We have great potential for the production of sunflower. Half of our country is semi-arid and sunflower grows; very well in such areas. The Ministry of Agriculture should encourage our farmers so that they can produce enough sunflowers, and therefore reduce the importation of oils. Similarly we have simsim. I remember that many years ago in Busia, a lot simsim used to be produced. Today, it is no longer being produced. We need to encourage our farmers to produce a lot simsim because it also contains oil.Sir, in order to strengthen our Kenya shilling, we would like to strengthen the jua kali industry, At this juncture I would like to thank His Excellency the President for having recognized that informal sector.</newspeech><header>QUORUM</header><newspeech>MR. ANASWA: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. We are discussing a very important Bill, but the House has no quorum.</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Yes, we do not have a quorum. Ring the Division Bell.</newspeech>(The Division Bell was rung)<newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): We have a quorum now. You may continue, Mr. Awori.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILDLIFE (Mr. Awori): Thank you, Sir. Just before I was interrupted, I was talking about the importance of the jua kali informal sector. Sir, in order to facilitate the jua kali industry, we need rural electrification. I would like to congratulate the Government for the efforts it has put on the rural electrification. There are very few developing countries which have done rural electrification as Kenya is currently doing. About 85 per cent of our populations live in the rural areas and therefore by carrying out rural electrification programmes,the jua kali industry will be greatly boosted. There are very many items which the rural people have been purchasing from the towns. We are constructing very many modern schools in the rural areas, and they require casement windows and doors, floor tiles, and all those items can be manufactured in the rural areas if there is electricity. Sir, the Kenya Power and Lighting Company Limited should not only extend its services to the market centres, but also right into people’s homes in the rural areas.Sir, while still expressing my concern about the current weakness of our Kenya shillings, I would like draw the attention of my hon. colleagues to the performances of parastatals. Parastatal were initiated immediately after Independence with one particular objective, namely, to try and bring in the indigenous people into business. Sir the Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is very depressing when every year annual reports and financial statements from various parastatals are Tabled here they indicate that year after year these parastatals are losing money. The money that is being lost is taxpayers' money; it comes from taxes paid by cur people. This money could be used to raise the quality of life of our people. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to call upon the members of the boards of parastatals and the executive managers of these parastatals, to be true to this country. They have to exercise honesty; they have got to work hard. This is because, if they work hard, in their respective ways, they are helping to strengthen our economy and therefore our Shilling will be improved.  I would like to thank His Excellency the President for leading this country wisely. He has maintained stability in this country, guided by the Nyayo Philosophy. As a result of this, investment opportunities are immense. It is therefore up to us as leaders of this country to speak well of our country; whether we are here or whether we are travelling abroad. We should let other people know what stability we have in this country so that we may attract more investors to this country. For those of us who have been lucky to travel abroad whenever we mention the name of Kenya we are looked upon with respect. It is because of the leadership that we have in this country that we get respect. Because of the stability that we have, we would like to develop an industry that has helped this country considerably. This industry, tourism, has not been fully exploited. His Excellency the President should be congratulated for having taken the initiate to destroy every worth KShs. 60 million. This gave an indication to the world at large that Kenya was very serious in trying to stem the tide of proceeding. I know that reports show that since then, the numbers of our wildlife have been increasing very steadily. I think we have now broken even because of the steps that His Excellency the President took.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, tourism, unlike other industries, has got very few imported inputs, when you build a lodge, most of the materials that you use are locally available; almost exclusively local and the income is always net. Because of this, it is very imperative that we should take tourism seriously. In this respect, I would like to call upon my colleagues in the Ministry of Public Works to improve the standard of roads in this country. The poor conditions of our roads can make the development of tourism difficult. This is because it is very expensive to run vehicles that take tourists around the country if the roads are poor. This is because those vehicles break down frequently and these breakdowns mean that we have to use a lot of spares which have to be imported from outside. Also because of the depreciating value of our Shilling against other currencies, it means that we are actually losing. I know that the Ministry is doing its level best and it can only do so within the resources that are made available. But if road maintenance is taken seriously so that before a road deteriorates Considerably it is given attention then we would spend less on roads.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</newspeech>   <newspeech>MR. TERE: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this important Bill. It is encouraging to hear that our debt service ratio has dropped from 34 per cent in 1987 to nearly 27.5 per cent this year. This actually indicates that our economy has been performing well.          While touching on the issue of bonded warehouses, it is good that goods can be moved from a bonded warehouse to a bonded factory. This is because that actually speeds up the manufacturing process and creates employment. However, when goods are being moved from a bonded warehouse to a bonded factory, care should be taken so that these goods do not find their way into the hands of unauthorized or find their way to other countries. There should be a lot of security for these goods. If the period within which goods must be exported expires, those goods must be condemned. This is suite in order because in the past some crooks had formed the habit of keeping goods for some time before exporting them or putting them into their own use.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think importation of raw materials that can be produced in this country should be heavily taxed. These imported raw materials which can be available locally should be taxed out of the market. If we can produce certain raw materials locally there is no reason we should imported the same type of raw materials into this country. That is a waste of our meager foreign exchange.      Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, duty on transformers has been waived. I think this makes the transformers cheaper. The Government should subsidize the cost of these transformers so that that transformer can be installed all over the country. This will speed up our Rural Electrification Programme. This is because unless we take electricity to the rural areas, we will not be able to produce enough goods for export. The successful implementation of our 8-4-4 system of education will require electricity in the rural areas. It is therefore important that everything is done to ensure that our rural areas are electrified.The removal of duty on speed governors for motor vehicles is a welcome move. However, the Government must make it mandatory for every motor vehicle to be fitted with a speed governor. I say this because public service vehicles and also the heavy commercial vehicles are driven at frightening speeds along our roads highways. These vehicles move faster than cars and this is the reason we have serious read carnage in this country.The abolition of duty on hides and skins is also a welcome move and we should now encourage pastoralists to produce more hides and skins so that we can export then and get more money for this country. The Vice-President and Minister for Finance managed to corner greedy traders who have the habit of hoarding goods before tire Budget Day. We can new avoid mini-budgets. The hoarders will not find it profitable to hoard goods because there is no way of knowing whether the prices of those goods will be increased or not.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the Kenya Railways Corporation should try to improve its services. I think the corporation should rehabilitate the railway lines that have been abandoned. It should also think about expanding its services to the rich agricultural areas of this country.   Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation because it has done a good job. However, with regard to telephone service and maintenance, I would like to appeal to the Corporation to make sure that once telephone facilities have been, installed, the repairs should be done immediately effectively, Having said that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say something about the exploration of oil. I think Kenya should give more attention to the exploration of oil because the moment we find oil in Kenya most of our economic problems will be minimized. There is also another point which I would like to raise regarding the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation I think the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation should go to the countryside to cover the various development activities that goes on there. We would like to be seeing films regarding these activities in the rural areas.  At the moment, most of the films that we see are imported and they could be very old films. For example, there are films on wrestling which I understand are  very old films. Some of these films, I understand were shot in 1984 and I think we should be shown films on current sporting activities. Similarly, we would like to see cur sports activities here in Kenya being covered by the Kenya Broadcastings Corporation, so that we do not continue to see foreign sportsmen and women on our screens all the time. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would now like to talk about the Kenya Power and Lighting Company. This is a very efficient organization because the moment you do not pay your electricity bills, the reddy kilowatt will get your lights disconnected and I think other Government parastatal bodies should follow the good example of this organization. However, we would like the Kenya Power and Lighting Company to Maize with the relevant Government Minister to supply electricity in the various areas of this country.Having said that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would now liketo touch a little on the decentralization of services. I think with the district focus for rural development, most of our services have now been decentralized and are being properly rendered. However, I think these services should be further decentralized to the divisional level. I am saying this because when you have to make payment, say, for water tills, in certain areas, wananchi have to go to the district headquarters, which may be very far away from their homes to pay these bills. Therefore, I think it is high time that we had revenue office at the division so that the payment of water bills, local land rates and rents, and also telephone bills, could be paid at the division.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to come to the question of export promotion. I think the senior officers in parastatals such as the Kenya Tea Development Authority or the Coffee Board of Kenya, should not talk ill of our tea or coffee. I am saying this because whatever they say is seriously considered by international community who buy these commodities. If there is something wrong with our tea or coffee, these officers should first talk with the farmers and tell them what is wrong with their tea or coffee. They should not go to the international press to say that Kenya tea or coffee has deteriorated because this would drastically affect the price of these commodities outside the country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we should also promote international trading. With the establishment of the Preferential Trade Area, we should explore the possibilities of expanding our exports to countries in this area. At the same time, we should try and correct the balance of payments between Kenya and Japan. At the moment, Japan is exporting a lot of cars to this country but when you consider our exports to Japan you would find that we have gone very low. We should therefore try to look for ways and means of correcting this trade imbalance. At the moment, if you looked at the cars being driver, on our roads, you would find that they are Japanese cars.                                    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, turning to education, I would like to congratulate the Ministry of Education for preparing a scheme of service for the graduate teachers. However, up to this moment, the Ministry has not released the scheme of service for the non-graduate teachers and this is causing a lot of concern to these teachers. Sometime back in January or February this year, there was a document signed between the Teachers Service; Commission and the Ministry of Education. I understand that this document was presented to the Minister but he has not acted on it. Therefore, I would like to call upon the Minister for Education to act on this document because we do not want our teachers to down their tools just because of a simple problem. Now that we are just about to pass the Finance Bill, the Ministry should have enough money to meet this commitment which is really vital.                                  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, coming to the question of training diploma teachers, I think we have a problem here. Those students who finished their Form VI last year and were pursuing arts subjects have nowhere to go to. Some of them would like to be teachers but unfortunately, diploma courses for arts teachers have been scrapped. I think the Ministry should re-introduce diploma courses for art teachers. I know we are not self-sufficient in teachers for music and arts and if these teachers are not required in our secondary schools, they could as well be posted to our primary schools. I think it is high time that we thought of having graduate teachers teaching in our primary schools. At the moment, our teachers are never taken for restraining, and you find teachers retire without being re-trained. How with the introduction of the 8-4-4 system of education, some of our teachers require to be re-trained and I am sure that the Ministry of Education in conjunction with the Kenya National Union of Teachers, should try all they can to see that our teachers are re-trained to cope with the present system of education.     Similarly, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the Ministry of Education should be planning for refresher courses. Those of us, who were trained as teachers during the colonial time, will remember that during those days, we used to have refresher courses almost every year. However, these days, these courses are non-existence. Teachers need to attend refresher courses so that they can cope with their work.	                                    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, with regard to our roads, I would like to say that our roads at the moment, are in very bad shape something ought to be done about them. We have often said in this House that perhaps it would be good to decentralize road services to the divisional level because this would be easier for the officers and wananchi to meet and find out the solution to these very bad roads. We have now introduced cost-sharing and wananchi need the advice of these officers regarding the management of our roads. Perhaps, it would be advisable to employ the local people to take care of our roads.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think extension officers should be asked to buy their own vehicles and then be paid transport allowance.For example, if it comes to a motorcycle, the owner is likely to repair it when it breaks down because it is his own property. But if it belongs to the Ministry, nobody would repair it. We have heard this afternoon that there were six unserviceable motorcycles that have been lying idle for two years in Bungoma simply because they belonged to the Ministry. But if they belonged to individuals, they would not have been lying idle. So, I think the Ministry or the Government should encourage extension officers to have their own transport and then pay them travelling allowances.Sir, I know we have done a lot to preserve wildlife. But I think as time goes by it will be necessary for the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife to crop some of these animals because some of the species are already too many and unnecessary. Even if they are good for tourists, I am sure they do not want a lot of them. They just want to see just a few of them. So, we do not want them to break and cross the boundaries. As we are aware, if they come to our farms, there is no compensation. We do not want that to happen.with those few remarks, Sir, I beg to support.</newspeech>    <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILDLIFE (Mr. Garkunju): Thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill.       In support of the Bill, I would like to thank His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for this very balanced Budget as we all know, the purpose of rising taxes is to finance development and other Government expenditure. However at the same time, we must also make sure that wananchi the taxpayers get their money's worth because we have to deliver the goods.           Therefore, the officers have to the efficient in every field so that justification for taxes can be there. I am speaking this afternoon, Sir, with a very heavy heart because of reading this morning of what happened in Gatundu two days ago where a man and two children lost their lives through a man who is mentally sick and who was also killed by the nob. I remember we passed a Bill in this Mouse concerning mentally sick people and during the contribution at that time, several matters came up one of which was to take care or have a follow up service out those people who get out of Mathare Mental Hospital. We still see many of these people after they have left Mathare Mental Hospital and other institutions. Many of the people just go and mix with ordinary people at home, and I thought that the new law was to improve the service so that these people are taken better care of. In fact, as it is now in respect of the many people who go to Mathare Mental Hospital or even those who get out of the Hospital, their relatives want to conceal this matter. They do not want to tell the people that these people are there. So, they are not known by the ordinary people and they are dangerous. The man we are referring to walked nearly three kilometres while holding on are which he used to take the lives of these innocent people. I saw this family last night and they were in a very depressed state, and there is nothing we can do about that. But I think in future, something should be done to make sure that those people who are unfortunate in being mentally sick are given proper after hospitals care. It may be difficult for their relative, but I think the Ministry of Health has a duty to have them follower up so that innocent wananchi are protected from dangers that may be caused by such people being unconsciously sick and endangering the lives of other people.                  Sir, I am only speaking for my constituency now, but I think it generally, applies to all areas. Even in the streets of Nairobi. You will find people behaving "funny" and nothing is being done about them. I think something should be done to protect the ordinary wananchi. This is part of our taxation.         Sir, on this Finance Bill, there are also matters of export of scrap metals. I note that tax was raised on export of scrap metal. We know that there has been a running battle in the Press between the Chamber of Commerce and the scrap metal dealers as to whether the scrap metal should or should not be exported.        I think it is important that this matter is gone thoroughly into because if we are encouraging jua kali industries and if we can make use of some of that scrap metal, we should ban the export of scrap metal because the metal is not going to rot, even if we leave it hereafter some time we will make use of it somehow later one. Our jua can make use of it and earn some foreign exchange. But how much more do we spend in foreign exchange in importing metal from overseas? If we are increasing the production of our manufactured items, say, tools, utensils and so on, why do we not find a way of even  investing in scrap metal conversion plants so that the metal is made use of to the local industry? I think this is a matter that should be looked into and remedial action taken through the Finance Bill. So that exportation of scrap metal is stopped for with.             Generally, in the increase of production, I think, in every field the Bill has provided for this, and I think the way taxation is being done, the reduction of tariffs on importation of raw materials and so on will increase production as a consequence of which employment opportunities will be increased. The man who ends up paying is the mwananchi who, in most cases, is unemployed and needs these things in his daily life.         Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are many areas where we can increase our production, like poultry production where we can produce, chicken meat for proteins and eggs. In the process of doing this we can produce manure to be used in our farms. The problem in this area has been the marketing of such products. Sometimes, these are there in abundance while at other times they miss completely. When there is overproduction, farmers have problems in getting feeds, and even when they get these feeds they are not of good quality. As a result most farmers who venture into this enterprise as large-scale farmers end up losing miserably. The small-scale farmers on the other hand pull quietly out of it. Since we are running short of beef mutton and pork, we should increase the production of poultry and fish. If we could improve the marketing of products from these two areas, then we will definitely succeed. We could improve on feeds and, perhaps, research on finding out portable or prototype feeds' facilities for rural areas. That way we shall also create very many employment opportunities for our people. This type of production does not even need a lot of land. With increased poultry production, employment opportunities will be created and farmers will also earn a lot of money. We can even expect some of these products abroad. We can only succeed in this area, if proper marketing strategies were devised and payment to the farmers was speeded up.The same applies to dairy products. We have also to look for better ways of marketing our dairy products, especially milk. This is because you will find that some dairies pay better than others because their collection systems and volume of milk collected. Since there are markets all over the world for dairy products we need to expand our milk production. But when farmers are not paid properly for their milk and when production goes down just because of poor quality feeds, then we get into problems. So, there is need for proper marketing strategies and management. There should also be better feeds and other distribution to the farmers.     Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other point that I would like to touch on concerns housing. In this country if one walked around the villages, he would find about 50 different houses. But for those of us who have been fortunate to travel overseas, we find that the houses are standardized. For example, in Britain the houses are standardized. But in this country, this is not the case for you eight find a village with 50 different houses. You might even see some that are not complete because the owners have been unable to complete them. This is because they are expensively built. Although there are departments in the Government charged with the responsibility of researching on low-cost houses, the information that they gather should be made public so that we can have standardized houses. Such cheap houses would be affordable to the ordinary mwananchi. For those who might still find such houses too expensive, then a proper financing system should be found where such people can pay for those houses over a period of years. This would ensure that people are not exploited by house owners whose sole aim is to make money. People should also be informed on the best materials to use at certain areas. If we did this then the country would save a lot of money. We should have cheap and standardized methods which wananchi can use to construct good and habitable houses which would be cheaper than conventional houses.          Let me now go to my pet subject coffee production. I am a coffee farmer. I thank His Excellency the President for appointing a Commission to look into the affairs of the coffee industry in this country. The work of this Commission should be speeded up so that the results can be shown to the coffee farmers so and corrective action be taken. This would also remove the anxiety in the coffee community. The information that the farmers have been reading in the newspapers about coffee, the Kenya Coffee Board of Kenya, the Kenya Planters' Co-operative Union and coffee payments to farmers have made farmers very anxious. I would like to appeal to the relevant authorities to do something to stabilize the situation before it is too late. It is important that something is done to streamline and restore the farmers' confidence. Such a thing would ensure that farmers are assured of their future. This would also make them take more interest in coffee production and also stop them from planting other crops inside coffee farms I feel there is a great need to improve on    our coffee management so that people employed in coffee production can be assured of their future.                                Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir I would like to touch on the mass media in the country, especially the radio. The radio should be used to educate our people on various things including taxation. For example in the  mornings, when I tune to the national service of the Voice of Kenya radio after the news at 6.15 a.m., there is a daily a music programme running for over half an hour. This time should be used to educate our people on various aspects of development. The radio has a lot of clientele and if information were disseminated through it, many people would gather information which they would pass on to the others. That is why we advertise meetings through the radio.Therefore, it is important that people are informed about various aspects, of development and life throughout the country. In this way, they will become more enlightened on aspects of taxation and so on. I have found that many people are ignorant on very simple matters with regard to succession. For example, when the head of the family dies, the immediate family does not know how to administer his property or what to do with his Bill. Such things should be made known to people through the radio. Many people, such as, lawyer’s cash in on these ignorant people by even charging them a fee when filling certain forms which can be filled at the chief's office free of charge. If people were educated on certain aspects of life, they could go to the right place at the right time. For example, many ordinary wananchi shuffles from one office to another simply because they do not know where to go for this that. I feel that the radio should be used.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Kariuki): On a point of order. Sir The hon. Assistant Minister is making very good contribution but he is implying that the Voice of Kenya radio does not have programmes which educate the people on matters pertaining to the law, development and economics. I am sure all hon. Members know that the Voice of Kenya has these programmes unless the hon.  Assistant Minister is suggesting that, the station should have no entertainment at all but educational programmes which it already, has in ample quantity.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILDLIFE (Mr. Gakumju): Sir,  with respect to my hon. Member colleague I will not allow him to put words into my mouth. I said that more and more time should be spent in educating our people. I do not think that he-has heard anything through his radio about taxation.</newspeech>	                   <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE(Mr. Kariuki): On a point of information, Sir. I am sure I have heard the subject of taxation being discussed in great detail over the radio. There is also a special programme on legal matters that is aired over the radio and which discusses this matter.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILDLIFE (Mr. Gakunju): Sir, I do not want to get into an argument with my hon. colleague but I just want to say that he was fortunate to hear this programme but I have not heard it and if it was aired, it should he repeated.	(laughter)       When I was a young boy we used to see many free films in the evenings brought by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on what happened during the war and in schools. They also used to show us various development projects. I am generally talking about educating our people. I remember during the war when. I was a young boy, there used to be a lot of propaganda. We were even being shown films about bombings in Burma and in other places. Why can we not show people films on soil conservation through mobile cinemas in the remote, areas of the country? Why can we not take the services to to people? Even if these services are there I hope hon. Kariuki is not going to tell me that mobile cinemas exist. I think they should be expanded.                  I would now like to turn to the tourism industry where I work. A lot is happening in this country as far as tourism is concerned. We are earning a lot of money from this sector but how much of it goes to the ordinary mwananchi? How does the common mwananchi benefit from tourism? Can we not do anything as leaders in this country to make our people earn more money? We know how much money has been, earned by Kamba curios and ciondo dealers. What else would a tourist buy? Why can we not encourage our people to make more handicrafts which can be bought by tourists'? What can we do to attract tourists to other areas instead of	concentrating only in game reserves? Why should we not enable our people to meet tourists, say, by welcoming them to worship in the countryside churches those who are christians when they come here? Why can we not have tea drinking and eating places in the countryside where tourists can stop by to take pictures, eat the local irio, umali and fish in a clean surrounding and this provide market to local products? What is happening now is that tourists drive from one point to another on a tourist' circuit as if there was nobody in the countryside. This is an area which I would like to appeal to the hon. Members of this House to look into and try to encourage the flow of tourists into their constituencies. In this way they will buy local products and we will earn foreign exchange. On domestic tourism, I think we just talk about it. For example, when we had a fair the other day on domestic tourism, people talked about reduced charges and how one stays cheaply at the Auspan Hotel or in a game lodge and so on. Why do we not encourage local people to visit other areas in the country they have not been? For instance, people from Meru can visit Kisii where many of them have not been, I am told that hon. Malebe has not been to Kisii and,a perhaps, he could go there to see what is happening and exchange ideas. So we really want domestic tourism to be taken seriously by hon. Members so that they, as leaders, can act as examples to our people regarding the importance of visiting other places in one's own country in this way we will promote domestic tourism. However, we should think of domestic tourism where one stays in a hotel; we should go and stay with friends in a village in a different district. In this way you will share your experiences with them; you can see how they take take care of their tea and coffee, how they cook their fish, ugali and bananas. I am serious in saying this because we miss a lot by not visiting each other and staying together.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, finally I would like to say that efficiency in Government offices, which reflects either positively or negatively on our Government, should be taken seriously. There are Government officers who keep on telling people to come the following day for something they would here done on the same day. Such officers do not consider how much people spend oh transport and yet these days it is very expensive to travel from place to place. We would also like to see services taken to the people. Services like paying for licences, which can be administered from a division or location, should not continue to be provided from the district headquarters. These matters should be looked into so that payment and use of taxes can be meaningful.With those few remarks I support.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Kariuki): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Whereas I would not like to appear to be suggesting that hon. Members be restricted in their contributions and, indeed, whereas hon. Members are saying very useful things, most of which could be elaborated on during debate on ministerial Votes, I would like to draw the attention of hon. Members to the fact that now we are discussing the Finance Bill? This Bill has very useful aspects about which the Treasury would like to hear the viewshon. Members, we have certain changes proposed in the Bill like those on the customs and excise tariffs; we have the Value Added Tax about which we would like to hear the hon. Members' views; we have the local manufacturers export compensation; the income tax changes that have been enumerated in the Bill; the changes we envisage on stamp duties and so on. I would therefore request that while hon. Members are free to diversify into matters concerning ugali, fish and so on they pay a little more attention to the Bill, and its purposes."Thank you Sir.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. ANASWA: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir for giving me this chance to contribute to this Bill. I think individuals will look at this Bill differently just as much as there are differences between individuals in this House.First of all this Bill gives us details on how the Government will acquire funds from various sources like licences, duty on various commodities and so on. Our Ministries will then use the money collected to improve lives of our people in different ways. There are shortcomings in the way some of these resources are used, which we want to point out so that this money can be used in a better way in order to benefit wananchi as much as possible.We have seen that central Government taxes, a local authority fee and a services charge are supposed to be paid at the same time in a particular place. So you find one businessman paying three different taxes. This is very expensive especially for businessmen with small profits and those in the agricultural sector where commodity prices are usually very low.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, much has been said about education. Under the 8-4-4 system of education students are supposed to do 10 or more subjects. This tends to became a bit of a burden in terms of student-carrying capacity and as a result work is done hap hardly. I would suggest to the Ministry of Education that it looks into this matter immediately with a view to reducing the number of subjects done. I think 10 subjects for a child of about 15 years is a bit too heavy a load and there, is a tendency to scratch through the subject without going into details. I think the depth in learning should be emphasized instead of treating subjects shallow's and quantitatively.	When it comes to staffing, you will find in many schools we have very few teachers for certain subjects. In some schools, there are many teachers for arts subjects while science subjects are overlooked. These results in what we call staff imbalance. I request the Ministry of Education to ensure that there is a balance between arts and science teachers. In this way the money we will get from this taxation system will be used well to benefit wananchi equally.          A lot has also been said about the kind of teachers we have in our schools: we have Pt teachers in primary schools and diploma and graduate teachers in secondary schools? But when you look at the scheme of service for diploma teachers you will see that they have been given a raw deal. Imagine a diploma teacher starting service with a salary of about Shs72,700/- while a graduate teacher starts with Shs.3,700/-. This is a very big difference because both went up to from six. The only difference is that one of them went for a three year degree course and the other went for a two-year diploma. I think the big disparity in the salary of these two teacher cadres is discouraging the diploma teachers.              I think this is discouraging our teachers. We make them man only secondary and primary schools, and this discourages them. In countries like Britain, when somebody as trained as a diploma teacher he can go for further studies for one year and becomes a graduate. In Kenya here, once somebody has a diploma, he goes overseas for three years and returns a graduate. This kind of person has a lot of chances as he can go for post-graduate education and get a masters, or Ph.d, while the poor diploma fellow is just left there. Something urgent ust be done to the diploma holders. The scheme which has been hinted at, of offering better remunerations should be expedited so that these people are encouraged to teach and given incentives to advance.There is the aspect of fees, which are a source of income for schools. You will find that there are big fees differences in the different schools in the country. One school charges up to Ksh.7,000/- while another, one charges Ksh.5,000/-. Most of our rural folk do not have high incomes and they are in great difficulties over the payment of school fees. It is high time the Ministry of Education came up with a workable policy, as a guideline, so that some people do not end up paying more in terms of school fees than others. You will also find that the boards of governors are left to do everything they want to do, independently. This is making many parents suffer a lot and, as a result, there are very many school drop-outs. When we have students who are dropping out of school at Form I, or Form II level, such students become a burden to the community.There are very bad roads the country. You find that hurrahing of roads is becoming a very rare contribution from the Ministry of Public Works. They just grade roads and leave them. There is, for example, the road that was being talked about this morning, from Kericho. It passes through deep black cotton soil. When such a road is just graded and left like that, after heavy rains, it becomes impossible to drive through. Using the grant the Ministry has been given, something must be done about murmuring roads. The improvement of roads will enable farmers to transport their goods as well as facilitating their movements from one place to another without problems.We also have the rural access roads to consider using the available human resources and some machinery, people are making roads. However, when you look at most of the rural access roads they are very narrow. It is normally taken that the rural folk do not have vehicles and so the roads are made narrow. However, there is an economic boost and people are buying vehicles. This is as a result of the good economic and political conditions which are prevailing as a result of such a good Budget and other aspects. You find that those who now own cars cannot move easily along such rural access roads. If you have a vehicle, like a bus, you have to move onto the side every time you are passing another vehicle, or when one is coming from the opposite direction. I would like to request the Ministry of Public Works to look into such matters seriously, so that when the roads are being planned by engineers, they are widened a bit so that people can have sufficient space when driving along the roads. The current position, as I see it is a hindrance to the rural develop¬ment strategy.Sir, there is also a tendency to delay the commencement of these rural , access roads programmes in that bridges take so long to be constructed. You will find that it will take one or two years before a bridge is constructed. A road is completed and it takes another year, or so, to complete the bridge. If you look at some of those places where it is taking so long to complete the bridges, you will realise that they have a great agricultural potential. This is interfering very much with the District Focus for Rural Development strategy. I believe we should speed up the construction of the roads and the bridges to accelerate progress in such areas of Kenya, like in the Cherangani Hills, where the soil is very fertile.The other area I would like to touch on is the veterinary services. Livestock industry in the country is respected and valued. You will find that we used to have a lot of livestock in the so called with Highlands. However, at the moment, you find that the people in the rural areas are now keeping exotic breeds. There are very many problems affecting the livestock industry. One of the problems is the question of dipping. You find that the dips in the rural areas are badly maintained. A dip may go for two or three months without water, during which time many farmers have difficulties because they cannot dip their livestock. The repairs to the dips take too long and the officers respon¬sible should look into that so that this industry does not suffer unduly.Sir, we spend a lot of money on acaricides. However, you will find that in some areas the ticks have become resistant to the acaricide. When you take your cow and dip it using the acaricide chemical, after five minutes you still find the ticks clinging to the cow unaffected. The acaricide should be looked into to establish its effectiveness. The supply of the same drug should be supervised so that it does not disappear before reaching the farce and, hence, leaving him with tick problems. I think the officers concerned should also emphasize on samples of the acaricide dips being taken to the Kabete Veterinary Laboratory for checking. This is because many farmers are complaining about the deaths of their livestock; the death risk of the livestock is becoming very high so that it is becoming a risk to keep livestock. Without sufficient meat in the country, there will come a time when food will become very expensive. We normally read in the newspapers of cases where meat is very expensive in some countries, because they do not have enough livestock. So, let us improve our livestock industry here.There was a suggestion here that the maintenance of the local dips should be left to the farmers themselves, and not the veterinary officers. If this is done, there will be big problems because the local people will not be able to marshal the necessary manpower and finances. That is very dangerous, indeed.When you come to electricity, you find that this commodity is very essential in Kenya. We have two ways of getting electricity in the country; namely, through the hydro-power and the geo-thermal power generators: Here I would like to emphasize that when we get the necessary funding for the Budget we should emphasize more on the provision of geo-thermal power. At the moment we are concentrating on the only geo-thermal station at Naivasha. However, if you look at many places in the Rift Valley Province, you will find many suitable sites for the generation of geo-thermal power. For example, there is Lake Bogoria, where there are very many hot water springs, with enough power to turn turbines. The same applies to Lake Baringo, among other places. Geo—thermal power should be exploited fully to supplement hydro-electric power. Because of climatic changes, you find that some rivers are having less volumes of water. Therefore, the geo-thermal power generation would really supplement the electricity we are currently getting from the hydro power stations. Everywhere in Kenya people are crying for the provision of electricity, including my people. Rural electrification is very much needed. With this Budget, which we have approved of here, we need most of these areas to have rural electrification because as a result we can start very many industries.Talking of Malava, or Kabras Division, where I come from, you will find that the place has no electricity in the whole Kakamega District. That being so, electricity lines pass through my constituency and my neigh¬bours have the supply. I am appealing to those who are concerned that the rural electrification is speeded up in my area. I appreciate what our Govern¬ment is doing and know that it is paying full attention to the problems of the wananchi in the whole country. Otherwise, we have problems in most of our areas. If we get electricity in our area, we have very many progrgammes to initiate. We intend to start a jua kali industry, a system whereby many school leavers will be employed. We will be able to export some of the jua kali products to some of our neighbouring countries. With electricity, we can use raw materials from sheep to make woolen clothes in what we call the Manyoya Industries. We have such a project in our place and it is doing very well, and we would like to encourage it. This rural or cottage industry will enable many people to get employment, and we know that unemployment is Kenya's enemy No. 1. If we do not encourage' these employment generating projects, this country will have a lot of problems in future. So, we need rural electrification schemes enhanced so that we can do the many things that people want done.	                Turning to the question of health, I can see that the Ministry of Health has been give a large sum of money. Even though, cost-sharing still remains one way of getting income for the Government. The policy of cost-sharing has become the song of the day, with many people complaining and saying that there is no point of people paying for medical treatment when the Government says that there will be free medical treatment for all. But because the cost of living is rising, I think cost-sharing is not a problem; in fact, it is a welcome policy although it has to have its limits because few people can afford these things. However, the way I am looking at it is that people are complaining about it because drugs are not readily available in hospitals. If you go to a hospital and find that there are do drugs, then you are bound to complain. Although we would like to cost-share health services with the Government, we would insist on the improvement of the supply of drugs to hospitals. The various health centers in the rural areas must have their share of drugs.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in some health centre’s, it is very difficult to get means to attend to emergency measures. There are no vehicles to transport emergency cases to the nearest hospitals. I have in mind Malava Health Centre in ay constituency, where we have a vehicle, GK 994T, which has been grounded for a very long time. This vehicle has been out of that place for do re than two years, and we are having a lot of difficulties. It is not only Malava Health Centre that does not have a vehicle; we have heard many complaints from hon. Members in this House about the same issue. It is the duty of the various officers in charge of hospitals and health institutions in the Ministry of Health to ensure that these vehicles are repaired now that the money is available. It is very unfair to have a vehicle rotting and spare parts being taken away from from the field vehicles have been boarded when people are dying in health centre’s due to lack of transport. Therefore, I would like to impress upon the Ministry of Health and all other Ministries that all boarded vehicles are repaired in time to serve wananchi because the money has already been given by them.Looking at the National Youth Service, I see that we have also allocated money to this project. When our children complete their secondary education, they are given a chance to go and train in the National Youth Service before joining the university. In that institution, our children acquire skills and discipline so that they can become good citizens. This is a very good system, and I would like to appeal to the government so that instead of taking the people going to the university to the National Youth Service, we look for more funds to expand the National Youth Service camp at Gilgil so that every child leaving Form IV, whether he is admitted to the university or not, goes for training to acquire the same skills and knowledge which he can use to his own advantage.Sir, for example, we have secretaries and mechanics from that place. I think all the people who complete from IV should join the National Youth Service, and after that some of them can join the polytechnics. Sir, I would also like to point out that the district development committees (D.D.C.s.) are playing a very vital role in the country. The D.D.C.s are initiating development in the rural areas, and encouraging our people to do various things. Unfortunately there is one shortcoming in the D.D.C.s, namely, the tendering system. Today, the issuing of tenders is very tricky. Sir, after tenders have been awarded by the D.D.C.s, some of the district development officers are very lazy and therefore, they never go to inspect the ground work and know what is being done. Due to lack of supervision, some projects end up being half way done and then abandoned, due to lack of funds. I would like the D.D.C,S to be inviting one or two Members of Parliament from every district so that they can assist the district tender board. Some of the people who win those tenders are not very honest in its deliberations after being awarded the tenders they do not bother to complete the projects. Therefore, we should be very care full when awarding those tenders. Many people are experiencing problems after awarding tenders to the wrong contractors. Sir, I would now like to turn to the problems brought about by wildlife. In some parts of our country, wildlife do a lot of destruction to our people's crops. I would like to request the Minister for Tourism and Wildlife to try and confine those animals in the national parks. The national parks should be fenced so that	people are not killed by wild animals and their crops destroyed. There are some animals in the rural areas which cannot be controlled such as birds and guinea fowls. When people plant some crops, they all go there and clear those crops. It is very difficult for the people to control them and yet the Ministry concerned has not taken serious steps against such animals. The Ministry is only concentrating on game areas and the gazetted areas, but people being in areas which are not gazetted are facing very many problems. I would like to request the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife to address itself to that problem so that the people’s crops are not destroyed by monkeys, guineas fowls and squirrels. Those people would like to see their crops maturing, so that they can also help in the national budget by selling the produce and earning some revenue for the Government.Last but not least, I would like to say that Kenya is an agricultural country. Some hon. Members were talking about the production of miraa in their areas, but in my area we produce sugar-canes then sugar-cane farmers are facing a lot problem, and therefore, need some assistance from the Government. We need some more sugar, factories, so that sugar-cane does not go to waste in the farms, and especially in Kakamega District.With those few remarks, Sir, I beg to support.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Mwenje): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,  I Sir, for giving me this opportunity to air my views on the Finance Bill. I would like to start by touching on the Value Added Tax. This may appear to be a new tax to Kenyans but this is not a new tax to the rest of the world. This is because those of us who have travelled outside this country are aware that the VAT is a very common tax in European countries. They are used to it and I am sure that our people will also get used to it. The revenue from this tax will enable the Government to render services to wananchi.	The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kagwima) left the Chair.The Temporary Deputy Speaker(Mr. Mahihu) took the Chair.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance must do everything possible to seal all the loopholes that may exist in this system of taxation. If you look at the receipt which is given to a customer who is buying spare parts you will find that there is a carbon copy of the receipt which is supposed to to reflect the VAT paid and which the Government officials come to checks. This copy is supposed to bear the amount of tax collected. But there are loopholes and I want to bring this to the attention of the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance; this is because it is very easy for the unscrupulous traders to remove the carbon copy and put something else and the tax will be reflected on the original receipt but it will not be shown on the carbon copy of the receipt. This means that the trader will have collected that tax but the tax will not be reflected in the carbon copy which will be the accountable document as far as the tax collector is concerned. This can be a loophole. So, unless the Vice-President and Minister for Finance sends inspectors to go and visit the shops. If they visit the shops, they will be able to root out unscrupulous traders who will collecting the VAT and not remitting the same to the tax collector.I am not trying to show the traders that there is a loophole which they can exploit. But these people are very clever. They have been in business for many years and they know how to do these things. I have every reason to believe that this can happen. The Vice-President and Minister for Finance should send out his officers to inspect shops at random. They should go there and pose as customers in order to find out whether there are any unscrupulous traders trying to cheat the Government.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Bill also allows for the transfer of goods from a bonded warehouse to a bonded factory. But the Bill also says that an amount of security must be offered by the intending transferor. The discretion to determine the amount of security to be offered has been left to the officer but it would have been wiser to state clearly in what that security will be. If these loopholes are sealed we will be able to maximize the collection of this tax.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, all in all, this is to the benefit of our businessmen. The collection of this tax involves several goods and therefore, it is not possible to categorize each single item. Therefore, what we should emphasize is the efficiency and honesty on part of our officers in classifying these goods for the purpose of collection of this tax. It is only in this way that Government will be able to collect what is due to then; so that the trader or the businessman is not forced to pay what he is not entitled to pay. Training of our custom officers must be emphasized because these officers have been given a lot of room as far as using discretion is concerned. Some we need to have these officers thoroughly trained so that they are able to cope in this work. Their experience in this field is of paramount importance so that when they classify the imported commodities, they are able to categorize them properly and assess them in accordance with the published tariff. Therefore, unless they are sure of how to go about this exercise, we are likely to lose a lot of money or even over-charge the traders. We would like to far in each and every respect and therefore, it is up to the Ministry of Finance to realise which I believe they do -that this is one of the areas where Government relies wholly on the revenue collectors and their good judgment or discretion. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the customs tariff which operates all over the world, is not just done in Kenya. Therefore, we need to have honesty and efficient officers. I am saying this because it is easy to deliberate mis-classify commodities as they come into the country. We hope and believe that the Ministry will carefully check this. The purpose of publishing this Bill is clearly to direct the collection of several taxes regarding several commodities. This, we have continued to do because of various reasons. One of the main areas which I still believe has not been properly exploited to make sure that we maximize our foreign earnings is the area of export promotion. This wills certain require a lot of foreign exchange and this cannot be achieved by Kenya Trade Authority to move even further afield to make sure that they find markets for our commodities outside this country. We must be aggressive in this task in order to get new markets for cur commodities and the Ministry should come up with some crash programmes in order to streamline; the present system of marketing our exports. It is necessary for us to be aggressive when it cases to exporting of our commodities and we are not going to manage this unless we go out and look for new markets.The Kenya External Trade Authority, the Ministry of Commerce and, also the Ministry of Finance, have to get together and go out to look for markets for our commodities, including even baskets which are weaved here by our women. They do export them outside the country, but of late, the market has not been very good. So, somebody has to be aggressive and look for markets for these commodities which are made by our jua kali artisans. We must encourage industries here. We are lucky that the country has the necessary infrastructure for industries, factories, and so on. That is why we have so many people coming here to do business. This peace is of paramount importance and it must be maintained at all costs. The must also warn those who want to spoil the infrastructure for our businesses purposes peace that we cannot tolerate them because we want to see our people flourish in business and industrialists to come in and set up their industries here. So, peace is an infrastructure for business in this country and also for industries, If we have to collect this revenue or look for areas where we have to collect this revenue we must have.  We have peace create people employment for our people because we need it. It is in this area that I must take the opportunity to warn those who want to Mendel about with our peace and, in particular, in Nairobi here.Sir, somebody somewhere, or one or two people somewhere, are saying that they would like to have a meeting on 7th July, here in Nairobi at Kamukunji. I must warn here and remind the residents of Nairobi that we are peaceful people and we want to remain that way and nobody should attend that meeting. There is no meeting of that nature; it is illegal. Those who are trying to advertise the meeting of 7th July will have themselves to blame for any consequences that may happen between now and that time, and even after that time. So, I must warn the residents of Nairobi whom we represent here that nobody should attend, that meeting or even try to go near that area. Let them know that Kenyans are peace-loving people and nobody will attend that kind of meeting which is illegal and purposely arranged to create confusion in this country. It is also a meeting purposely called by somebody to show that he is still serving his foreign masters.Sir, we want peace in Nairobi and I must take the </newspeech><newspeech>MR.

The hon. Member who happens to come from Nairobi, if he wants to be given details confidentially, and then we can tell him what we have heard so far. But I would not like to go into details of how they are trying to call it or how they are trying to do it, because they are doing it illegally here in the City.But all I am saying is that we, the residents of Nairobi, do not want to be antagonized by anybody however rich he is or whatever position he holds.</newspeech><newspeech>MR.

I will do it over my dead body. This is because what I have just said is clear. We, the residents of Nairobi, want peace. I have said that it is rumoured and known that there are two people and a few of their agents who are going round telling people that there will be a meeting here in Nairobi on 7th July, 1990, at Kamukunji. This is common knowledge for it is known by those who </newspeech><newspeech> MR. KIRWA: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.

Members to act on rumours.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Mwenje): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for those who read newspaper, they must have read about the two gentlemen who have been antagonizing this country. These two gentlemen made an application to the Nairobi Provincial Commissioner for a permit to hold a meeting at Kamukunji. These two fellows are Messrs. Rubia and Matiba. They are seeking a permit, which I know will not be given, to hold a meeting on 7th July, 1990. I would like to tell all Nairobi residents that there will be no meeting on that day and at that place. We, the Nairobi residents, do not want to be antagonised by anybody. We want to be left in peace.(applause)The peace that exists in Nairobi and in the country as a whole is a clear indication that we can do our businesses peacefully. It is up to us to ensure that we do not waste the resources that we have. I would like the Kenyans to realise that it is not bread alone that can sustain our lives. We should also eat and encourage our people to eat sweet potatoes so that we do not depend on imported foods. We can eat the natural food that we Africans grow. We must not be so westernized and feel that we have to eat bread and cakes. A sweet potatoe, commonly known as ngwashi is better than bread. I would like our people to be encouraged to eat sweet potatoes, cassava and all kinds of African foods.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.
