    <NEWSPEECH>MR. KAGWIMA: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my colleagues in saying a few words regarding the recent Budget Speech.    First of all, Sir, let me take this opportunity to thank the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for the very detailed Budget Speech which he presented to the House on 7th June, 1990. I am very much encouraged by the details that were given in the Budget Speech. This year's Budget statement was longer than last year's and also the previous year's becuase it was very detailed. As I said last week, I hope that we will be able to avoid mini-budgets so that wananchi can rest assured that when we talk of a budget we mean a budget to cover a whole year. If we can stick to the details as presented by the Vice-President and Minister for Finance and avoid mini-budgets in between now and the next financial year, our future budgets will be taken very seriously by wananchi.    Secondly, Sir, it is encouraging to note that the Vice-President and Minister for Finance has given the creation of export zones a big prominence. Of course, we know that without adequate exportation of goods from this country the balance of trade will continue to be against us and in favour of the developed countries such as Britain, America and Japan, from where we import our requirements. This is one area which we should support and hope that will improve our balance of payments and the balance of trade.    Thirdly, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also want to thank the Vice-President and Minister for finance for the fact that he has also looked into the issue of some of the products that we import, such as cotton. Cotton is required in big quantities in this country. At the moment we are importing cotton from our-neighbouring countries because some of our cotton industries are operating at half or even quarter capacities due to lack of adequate raw materials in terms of cotton. We have enough land and enough human resources and everything else that we need for production of enough cotton in this country and even for export purposes, but the problems we have had in the past concerning the production of the crop, especially with respect to the mode of payments, we have not been able to produceenough cotton for our industries; leave alone for export purposes.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I note that in the Budget Speech, His Excellency the Vice President and Minister for Finance, in liaison with the Ministry of Agriculture, have revised the price of cotton from KShs.6.00 to KShs.10.00 per kilogramme, which is an increase of 40 per cent. That way, cotton farmers have now been given a big incentive. However, most important is the mode of payment. In the past, cotton farmers have had to wait for as long a period as eight months before they are paid for their cotton. That mode of payment has discouraged farmers so much so that the production of cotton in this country is lowest compared to past years. The production of the crop has been so low that for quite some time we will continue to import the commodity. However, it is good now that something with regard to raising the prices has been done, and we hope that the payment will be prompt. We are hoping that the promise of prompt payment was not made for the sake of it. If we want to save the meagre foreign exchange that we have, we should implement the promise that cotton farmers will be paid promptly for their crop.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, together with prompt payment to farmers for their crop, we should also look into the question of improving the quality of roads leading to the cotton growing areas so that cotton is collected in good time and delivered to the ginneries in good time also. If roads leading to cotton buying centres are improved, we can be assured that the crop will be collected and delivered to the market in good time.    Sir, quite often we, politicians, only raise issues in this House when we are complaining, but I would like to take this opportunity at this juncture to congratulate the National Cereals and Produce Board for the improved management it has acquired of late. In the past we used to have big problems in the sense that the National Cereals and Produce Board used to take a long time before paying for drops delivered; we used to take up to one year. However, these days the Board is able to pay farmers within as short a time as one week after delivery of crops. For example, in Tharaka area where the Board is very busy buying maize, farmers are being paid one week after delivering their crop. If you deliver your cropon a Friday, you are paid the following week on Friday. So, to divert from what is very common of us, I wish to take this opportunity to thank the Board. I can see one of the Assistant Ministers in the Ministry of Supplies and Marketing here, and I want him to take my congratulations on behalf of the whole Ministry. I think the creation of the Ministry of Supplies and Marketing has played a big role in improving the services of the National Cereals and Produce Board. We hope and plead that same trend continues so that the food we need for feeding our growing population can continue to be produced at improved standards. We appeal to other related boards to emulate the example set by the National Cereals and Produce Board.    Finally, I wish to address myself to the Ministry of Public Works. Since the Minister himself is here, I want to plead with him that if we want this country to develop this country at a reasonable rate, we should take the issue of roads very seriously. As I said earlier on, I wish to urge the Minister for Public Works, in consultation with the Minister for Planning and National Development and the Vice-President and Minister for Finance, to look into the question of improving our roads. We may talk of production and other issues, but without proper mode of transport we will not be able to develop as fast as we want.    /The Temporary Deputy Speaker(Mr. Mahihu) left the Chair/    /The Temporary Deputy Speaker(Mr. Wabuge) took the chair/    END…………………..L    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sure that mostof the hon. Members are facing similar problems because of the heavy rains that had hit the country. I would like to request the Minister for Public Works to ask for more funds because when ever a question is raised here asking him when he will repair or tarmac such and such a road, he says that he willdo it when funds become available. For example, last December, this House passed a Motion requesting the Ministry to tarmac Road C92. I was very impressed by the support that Motion was accorded. I also thank the Minister because he also supported that Motion, but upto now, we are still waiting for funds to be made available so that road can be tarmacked. Therefore, I think the Minister for Public Works should request the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance to give him more funds, so that we can see what his Ministry is doing. We trust that the Minister has got the ability to manage that Ministry but we would like him to put more pressure. We would like to see the results of his Ministry. I would therefore request the Vice-President and Minister for Finance to listen to the requests of the Minister for Public Works, so that he can repair or tarmac our roads.    With those few remarks, I beg to support.</ NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Kisiero): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me a chance to join my colleagues in congratulating the Vice-President and the Minister for Finance for the Budget that he outlined in this House last week.As we all heard Sir, the theme of the Budget wasEnhanced economic growth through exports. The Vice-President and Minister for Finance explained how exports would become a very important tool in the economic development of this country, by forecasting our attention on certain areas of exports. First of all, he made the private sector the real driving force, in that he gave the private sector all the necessary tools in order to ensure that they manufacture and export their goods withvery few problems. In that respect, Sir, the Vice-President and Minister for Finance introduced the Export Processing Zones as a new novelty in his approach to make exports the centre piece of our economic development. The Export Processing Zones will become a very important tool in helping this country to develop its industries very fast. The terms that have been offered through the Export Processing Zones are very generous, and I am very sure that many investors will be happy to come and invest here because they have been given all the necessary protection. That protection includes such incentives as export compensation schemes, whereby they will be compensated for materials that they may have imported into this country for the purpose of manufacturing. They were also given an incentive through the exemption of import duty. The Vice-President and Minister for Finance assured us that in due course, that would evolve into duty drawbacks.    Sir, since all those trade incentives and protection have been madeavailable to the industrialists, I hope that our embassies abroad will pass that message very clearly to those people who may be willing to come and invest in this country. If they invest here, they will gain financially, and through the incentives which have been offered by the Government,they will be able to compete favourably with other manufacturers in other countries, and they will be able to export high quality goods. It is very important for our country to export goods of very high quality. The world market is very selective, it buys the best goods only. I am sure that since the Vice-President and Minister for Finance has given the investors verygenerous terms, very high quality goods will be produced in Kenya, and very soon Kenya will become another Hong Kong in that world of exports.    Sir, through the Budget I learnt that the Minister for Public Works has included the Road D275 which passage through Mount and Elgon area in his Ministry is vote. That road runs from Kaptama and passagr through to Kapksokwony, Koksiro down to Namwela. That road is very important to the economic development of Mount Elgon. If that road is tarmacked as indicated in the Development Estimates, it will assist the people living therein enhancing their economic development. At the moment, due to the poor road conditions, the security forces there cannot move fast enough. When we get problems one of fromone of our neighbouring countries many people die because our security personnel cannot move fast to help them due to poor road conditions in that area and as a result Many people have lost their livestock. Therefore, the tarmacking of that road will help greatly in enhancing security in that area.        Sir, again the tarmacking of that road will help in the transportation of farm produce. Our countryis very good in agriculture, and therefore, if our roads are good, we can produce more because we can easily take them to the markets. Sir, we cannot talk about all those good things when we know that there are a few churchmen who are totally out to destabilise this goodGovernment. It is most regretable that although all the people in this country have refused multi-parties, a few people still insist that they have a right of opinion which must be imposed on the majority.(END……..M)Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, I was greatly shocked when I listen to Radio Netherlands last week to hear somebody saying that the President of this Republic comes from a small tribe called Kalenjin and that a majority of the people in Kenya want multi-party system of Government but a few people in authority have refused to accept their views. I do not know who in the first place told them that Kalenjin is a small tribe? The truth of the matter is that Kalenjin is not a small tribe. It extends throughout the Rift Valley and some parts of the Western Province and even outside this country, there are Kalenjins. Who told them that President Daniel arap Moi is a President of the Kalenjins? He is the President of all Kenyans who all accept him as their President because they love him. Why should the foreign media be fed with wrong information?    It is also most distressing, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, tonotice that our clergymen are virtually misquoting the Bible for their own selfish ends. The Bible says very clearly that give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and to God what belongs to God. However, the clergymen in this country are saying "No" to this and are taking both what belongs to Caesar and what belongs to God. I am saying this because they want to continue playing the role of clergymen and that of politicians. We would like to know who is right; the clergymen or the Bible. It is also distressing to note that these clergymen are not as humble as they are expected to be. Jesus humbled himself even unto death and a religious leader who is expected to a follower of Christ, is supposed to humble himself before God. However, it is unfortunate that religious leaders in this country want tobe heard over the radio in this country and overseas. So, where is their humility? Where has their humble attributes gone to? Where dc they consider themselvesto be? Are they on the side of Jesus or on the side of politics? Many of the clergymen have told lies to the people and we have all witnessed this. The Bible clearly states that "Thou: shall not give false witness against thy neighbour" However, the clergymen in this country have been systematically telling us lies. They have been misquoting the Bible to suit their own ends They havebecome the judges.Weare actually being put in hell now by these clergymen and yet they do not have the keys to the Book of Life. How come they are judging the leaders of this country by saying that they areof no good and that they are all sinners and yet they do not have the key to the Book of Life. So, these church leaders should stop misquoting the Bible and stop adopting a-holier-than-though attitude.    With those few remarks, I beg to support.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKAU: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this very important Motion. The Budget that was presented to this House by the Vice-President and Minister for Finance outlined policies that are ideal for the development of this country. At the moment, our country is facing a serious problem of unemployment. The most important thing for us leaders to bear in mind is that the socio-economic development that has been achieved inthis country over the years has come about as a result of political stability that we have enjoyed in this country so far. At every stage, we should remember that the dynamic leadership of his Excellency the President has created this stability and that every leader should do his best to ensure that stability is maintained. It is this stability that is a prerequisite for socio-economic development.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the policy regarding the promotion of exports is a very important policy. While appreciating the fact that this is a very important policy, all those in the industrial sector of this country should note that Kenya, like any other country in the developing world, is faced with aproblem that it has to overcome, if it has to succeed in export market. I am saying this because factors that are taking place in the world today, pose very great challenges to the improvement of the world-market. So, while we prepare ourselves for the European Common Market in 1992, we should take note of this fact. The other factor that we should take note of is the change that is taking place in Eastern Europe where everybody is looking forward to this Market. Therefore, it is important for those in the export market togiven more incentive by the Government.        Again, I plead for the farmers to be given necessary incentive in order to produce enough food and cash crops in order to create employment in the country.        Having said that, I would like to state that all these budgets and Soon will come about if we have peace, security and a cohesive society. I am very sorry that despite all that this country has done as compared toother developing countries, a few elements are trying to wreck our political system. I would like to say that some of those people who advocated for multiparties in this country, never experienced the type of parties which we had. The question of multi-parties in this country is a Constitutional matter. The Constitution is an overriding document to any law made in this country. Therefore, anybody touching on a clause in the Constitution, should be charged with treason.        I feel sorry for Matiba and Rubia. They were in this House when the Constitution was being amended to make Kenya a one-party system of Government. They are the ones who did this and supported it. They know that they are playing with the same Constitution. They are also aware ofan attempt to amend the Constitution in 1966/67. People were going out telling others that they want to change the Constitution. The Constitution will not be changed outside but inside this House. Since Matiba and Rubia were Members of this House and they know that the Constitution cannot be amended outside this House, the only thing they could do, if they succeed, is to ask this House to amend it to allow them to do what they want. Otherwise, they should shut up because it is treason to talk about the Constitution.        The other thing is the church. This country has been very peaceful and I regret because we are heading to a situation like the one prevailing in Latin America where the church is involved in Politics. We are facing a situation similar to the one in Uganda where the Church is troubling the country. Therefore, anybody trying to politicize the church is making a big mistake for this country. They should be told tokeep off politics and not to take it to church.        As a christian, I feel sorry for what is happening in the CPK church. For example, the Very Rev. Njenga is saying that people died in Muoroto. If any person has not come up to say that he/she lost a wife/husband,child and so on up to this moment, who is Njenga to say that so many peopledied? Does he have a son, wife or relatives who died there? If he has, then let him come with a father of such a relative to prove to us that such people actually died.    With these few remarks, I beg to support.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Ntimama) : Sir, I rise to support the Motion on the Financial Statement which was presented by the Vice-President and Minister for Finance. Apart from being a people's Budget, it is also a Budget for the economic development of this country. I would like to thank the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for preparing the Financial Statement with the full knowledge of developing the economy of this country.    This is a Budget for investors and for the promotion of exportsfor this country. It is, therefore, a Budget for serious economic development. The Vice-President and Minister for Finance must be thanked for helping the President embark on serious economic development. I think it is upon us-----</NEWSPEECH>    <HEADER>QUORUM</HEADER>    <NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: On a point of order, Sir. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Minister for Local Government but as you can see, Sir, the House does not have a quorum to debate this Motion.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mahihu); Yes, there is no quorum. Ring the Division Bell.</NEWSPEECH>    (The Division Bell was rung)    END….I    <NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mahihu): We have aquorum now. You may continue, Mr. ole Ntimama.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. ole Ntimama): Thank you, Sir.    I say this is a Budget for economic and social development of this country, and I was thanking His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for having presented a very good Budget indeed. However, we need to be conscious of improving the economic development of this country. We should all encourage our industrialists to be able to export, our farmers to produce for export, jua kali also to produce for export and also to attract investment.    Sir, as you very well know, investors can only be attracted in a situation of peace and stability. His Excellency the President Daniel arap Moi, for all his life as a politician, has always been on the side of peace, love and development. We must back everybody that goes to contribute for the peace and stability of this country,and we must condemn everybody who goes to try and put us into problems of situations that will create problems and disorder in this country.    Before I go to talk about politics of the land, again I want to thank the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for having in the past decontrolled the price of fertilizer. This has had a very positive effect as far as the farmers are concerned.The fertilizer price has come down and people are planting using fertilizer for their own crop which they have not done before because of the price being rather too high.    Sir, I also want to talk a little bit about the Kenya Meat Commission (K.M.C.). This commission is an industry that is supposed to help the cattle farmers or the ranchers of this country. But ithas a problem although it is right on its feet now. This is becausesome institutions do not pay the K.M.C. They eat the meat, but they do not pay. The commission is probably going to be in a problem of cash to pay the farmers. I would, therefore, urge and request those big institutions to try and pay the K.M.C. so that it will have no reason not to pay the farmers. This is because a local industry like the K.M.C. is very important. It has to develop inside the country even before we think of export. I am sure the K.M.C. will survive. It will be very well organised if everybody pays whatever they consume. I would also urge these institutions to order meat from the K.M.C. and not from private institutions so that we can build up this industry which is the only one that can guarantee to pay the farmers.    Sir, I have said that peace and stability is the only way we can develop, especially some of us who have been left behind by the colonialists. I keep on repeating this one. We are now trying to catch up with everybody else. So, we need peace and stability. I will go on to say that in as far as Kenya is concerned the multi-party system of things is not on our political agenda at the moment. 'Pluralism' or the so-called democratic pluralismis not on our agenda at the moment. What is on our agenda is the education of our people, the elimination of illiteracy in this country and so on. Also, what is on the agenda is unity and His Excellency the President has even gone out of his way trying toeliminate tribalism in Kenya through the one-party system and also through unity, peace and love. Unity is on our agenda. The provision of food for our people is also on our agenda.    However, what does the multi-party system of Government come to help us to do? Right now, it might be on our political agenda in the next 40 years. But it is not on our agenda at the moment. We have to fill up our stomachs. We have to export.We have to educate our people to prepare a platform for take off. We Have also to extend our health services andwe do not want any interruption. Those are the things that are on our social and political agenda right now. These people - Matiba and Rubia -rich and sophisticated, do not anymore think about those important things on our agenda. They are thinking of their own personal power because the money is already there. So, power is the next thing. They want to use every means in their disposal to cometo power and to wreck the stability and peace of this country.    Sir, I want to reiterate and say that the Government is not asleep. No Government worth its salt can sit aside and watch people playing around with stability and peace of the land, in the pretext of trying to give people freedom of speech and soon. There is an extent to freedom of speech that can wreck the country. But when the freedom of speech go to an extent of wrecking this country, then some action must be taken, including moving people out of this society to go and rest them some where and give us time to develop.    Sir, I would like to pose a question. What does a Multiparty system help with us especially in things like development in ourown rural areas? Do you have to have a multi-party system to get your nursery school built? I want to warn those people and say that in as far as we are concerned, we will not accept a multi-party system in this country for now.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also want to give the Western European nations a little piece of advice. Kenya has been a friend of the West all along; we have fought many battles together, including that against the spread of communism in Africa and in other developing countries. Now the Western nations have  taken a long time to develop their democracies; some of them have taken hundreds, or even thousands, of years to do this, Now I donot know why they want to revolutionise us, push a knife through ourthroats or tell us what we should when we are not prepared for it rightnow. I think they should understand; I hope They are good friends who do not want to set this country aflame, or see trouble here.This is because our welfare is also their welfare; stability in this country also corresponds to their own welfare.    I, therefore, think these nations should let us evolveour democracy normally the way many other countries did, because that is about the best way in which this country can do it. It is wrong for them to push us, cajole us and threaten us with cutting back aid to us.    Thank you, Sir.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. BARNG'ETUNY: Ahsante sana, Bw.

Uongozi ulikuwawao wakati huo; leo ni mwingine xx na kesho utakuwa wa mwingine, na hatuwezi kuwabalia kuichafua nchi yetu Kwa hayo machache naunga mkono </NEWSPEECH>    END…..K<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Lijoodi) (Ctd.): our one-party system, society and economy. Kenyans are very dynamic, and you can see this dynamism through all the changes that we have made not only in our Government, but also in Kanu itself. So, we are prepared to re—examine ourselves and make sure that Kanu becomes a more effective party than it has been in the past.    Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to specifically pay tribute to the Budget Speech because of its generous provisions for rural industrialisation.The present unemployment situation requires that we make it possible for small-scale industries to be created in rural areas. I was particularly happy to see that, because of the hardships we have been experiencing through the declining. value of the Kenya Shilling, it was realised that the Shs.10 million import concession on imported machinery from abroad was becoming rather small. It is gratifying tonote that the Vice-President and Minister for Finance increased it to Shs.20 million as being tax-free on the importation of machinery to be located in small—scale farms. What now remains is for lending institutions to revise their lending conditions and make it possible for Kenyans to invest in rural areas on easier terms than is the case at the moment.    I have in mind particularly the amount of money required for an entrepreneur to lay down before his loan can be extended. This amount is 25 or30 per cent, and it is supposed to be the down payment required as equity contribution on investment, which is still quite high for many Kenyans. We would, therefore, request lending institutions to revise this percentage and make it easier for Kenyans to invest in small—scale industries in rural areas in order to generate employment.    I would particularly like to commend His Excellency the President, who announced recently that he was going to create a special task force of Criminal Investigation Department officers to take care of those who are misusing Government funds for corruption purposes. This corruption has had avery negative effect on our development, and the programmes that are being implemented under district development committees are being frustrated bythose who would like to benefit from them. I am sure that this task force will go a long way in ensuring that our resources are properly used for the benefit of most Kenyans.    As far as the agricultural sector is concerned, it carries the highest potential for the generation of employment, and those of us who live in districts such as Kakamega are particularly interested in seeing the tea industry being promoted. In the last few months since the visit of His Excellency the President to Kakamega, when he announced that a factory was going to be built in Kakamega, wananchi have been responding very positively by increasing the acreage under tea and, supported by the present favourable weather, the amount of tea that is available for processing has more than doubled. Therefore, we require a minimum of two factories immediately in that district in order not to discourage wananchi from continuing to sustain and improve their tea cultivation.    End F    Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we therefore hope that the Ministry of Agriculture, in conjunction with the Kenya Tead Development Authority will make every effort to ensure that Kakamega District is provided with two tea processing factories at the earliest opportunity in order to make sure that the tea leaves that are being produced in that district are not wasted. This is because at the moment the tea has to be processed in private factories long distances away from the district and therefore incurring very heavy transport costs which definitely reflects on the earnings of the farmers. we therefore urge the K.T.D.A. and the Nyayo Tea Zones Corporation to make sure that immediate arrangements are made for the construction of the two factories in that area.    Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say a word or two about the banking system which is extremely important for our economic development. We are very much encouraged to see the current trend where the banks are selling shares to Kenyans. This is because we would like to see most of the banks in the country owned by Kenyans. A lot of the money that is being borrowed by even foreigners to establish industries in this country is money that belongs to Kenyans. We would therefore, like to see most of this money being utilised by Kenyans themselves to establish industries. We therefore encourage most of the other banks to take the example of the Kenya Commercial Bank and Barclays Bank by offering shares to Kenyans to purchase and own part of these banks so that they can participate in generating development activities in the country.    With those few remarks, I beg to support the Motion.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>DR.

The reduction of the various duties especially on passenger cars is a great relief to the public. But the actual figures reduced are very insignificant indeed. It would have been better if we had a wider margin of reduction so as to facilitate purchasing of motor vehicles and particular the smaller passenger cars to enable the middle income people and also other people to buy these motor vehicles.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the reduction of duty on raw materials and equipment to facilitate faster rural industrialization is a great move to ensure that our rural market centres are developed. In fact this move will help in creating employment opportunities in the rural areas and it will also help in creating wealth in order to curb the rural urban migration of people to seek jobs.        Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, which will be improved is the area of raw materials and equipment to be used for the production of goods and services for the export market. The reduction of duty in those areas will also play a major role in ensuring that our produce and services are competitive. It will also help us to earn more foreign exchange. Also along the same lines, I would like to say that goods and materials destined for educational institutions, public health institutions and medical institutions should not attract more taxes because in this way we will be able to improve the welfare of the people of this country. Laboratory equipment for schools and technical colleges and other institutions should not be taxed. This is because the people of this country are also burdened with cost-sharing in education and therefore heavy taxation on these equipment would act as a disincentive to our people.    Therefore any reduction of duty on goods which are not manufactured in this country will improve and facilitate the promotion of education in this country. The other area which is very important is the area of sports. Now we are watching the world Cup in Italy. Our people like sports and we also need to improve on this area. We know that Kenya is a giant in athletics; our people have excelled and they have brought gold medals to this country. They are good ambassadors for this country.        Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, many people in this country love soccer and we should improve on this area. Weneed to strengthen the Ministry of Culture and Social Services. We need to have more competent people appointed to various positions. I appreciate what the Government has done in appointing the great athelete, Mr.	Mike Boit, to be the Commissioner for Sports. This is a great move but I believe that the Ministry of Culture and Social Services should be strengthened. I am sure that the day will come when we will have a Ministry of Sports to make sure that sports development in this country is given proper attention. An So, all the equipment relating to sports should never attract any tax. This is because our sportsmen and women have given this country a great name and identity. This country is recognised all over the world.    END G     Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir, the other thing that I would liketo talk about is the outbreak of the celebral malaria in Eldoret. This disease has caused fear and harvoc among the inhabitants of Uasin Gishu District. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Government for sending drugs, personnel and environmental experts to enlighten the people about the environmental aspect which promotes this disease in the area. But I still think that we need to improve this because the disease is now spreading to new areas like Soi Moiben, Simat Sub-location and Kapret and Gerat Locations. So, I would like to appeal to the Ministry of Health to send more personnel and drugs to those areas. I would also suggest that they establish treatment centres and filter clinics in the locations and around health centres to filter those patients who would need to be admitted to the district hospital which I am afraid is already congested. In fact, when I took some patients to this hospital, I found the situation to be very pathetic. In fact, it is very tragic in that the disease takes about three days to kill the patient. Since this is a frightening situation, I would like I call upon the Ministry to put more efforts in strengthening their centres outside the district and to ensure that the drugs, personnel and ambulances are available to ferry the patients to the hospital.    The other request that I would like to put forward concerns hospital charges. The problem sometimes is made more serious when a whole family is attacked by the disease. It becomes very difficult for such a family to pay the required charges at the hospital. So, I would like to appeal to the Ministry at this time when the issue is of emergency to reduce or waive the payment of these fees in the district hospitals in that area. In fact, many of these patients are unable to even purchase the drugs when they are given prescriptions. I would also like to appeal to the private clinics and hospitals in Eldoret and elsewhere to offer their services at subsidized rates so that more people can get treatment.    I would also like to urge the Ministry of Public Works to take advantage of the dry spell to repair the roads in that area. This is because if the roadsare not repaired now, when it rains it might be very difficult to contain the situation. When the roads are passable then people willbe able to move from the farms, the settlement scheme to the nearest health centres or to Eldoret District Hospital. If this was done people would be prevented from panicking.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other issue concerns the drugs which might prove ineffective in curing this disease. It has been said that the normal anti-malarial drugs are not effective in combatting this disease. So, I would like to suggest that they should be removed from the market so that people do not buy them. In fact, I think the promotion of the 4-2-2-2 cure against malaria that we also hear in the Voice of Kenya and read in the newspapers should be withdrawn because this has proven to be ineffective against celebral malaria. So this promotion should be curtailed until the situation improves.    Lastly, I would like to say something about our ruling Party Kanu. According to our Constitution, we are supposed to have only one party system of Government. This means that this talk of multiple parties is illegal. The advocates of multiple parties are day-dreamers. Action ought to have taken against them a long time ago even before their gospel started spreading in the country. We do not have to warn such people because they are breaking the law by their actions. The law should, therefore, take its own course. There is no negotiation on this issue which was enacted by Parliament. We do not have to negotiate with anybody because we do not want any chaos in the country. We are a developing nation that is well-known and recognised in the world. Why are we getting foreign aid and investors in this country? This is happening because there is political stability in the country. So what are these people talking about? I think these are ambitious and destructive and if they are not satisfied with what they already have, then we should let them perish.    Thank you.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. WABUGE: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also liketo take this opportunity to congratulate the Vice President and Minister for Finance for ably delivering the Financial Statement on Thursday. Looking at the Budget itself I conclude that it is a moderate Budget which favoured the poor people of this country. Although that remains depends on how it is going to be implemented and what its results are going to be. Although we can have a very beautiful Budget, if we do not have the implementors who are committed, the Budget would not produce anything. I would, therefore, like to urge the implementors to be patriotic and committed to ensure that the country survives. This is because our survival depends on the Budget.    Having said that, Mr. Temperary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me now move on to presumptive tax. I think tax is killing the incentive of the farmers. Farmers are the people who feed this nation and it must be clearly understood that the security of any nation, Kenya included, depends on food. This is because without food, there cannot be any security. So the moment we kill the incentive of the farmers then we are asking for problems. I would like to urge the Treasury to ensure that they only tax food as a last resort. This means that food should only be taxed only when the country is on the verge of bankruptcy. But looking at Kenya, I can see that economically we are very strong. The Government should not at any one time tax agricultural products. The presumptive tax has, to repeat, killed the morale of the farmers so far as the production of maize and wheat is concerned. This is because in-puts have become so expensive. In fact, ifone is to produce more food he needs more fertilizer which is taken away by the presumptive tax. In fact, even dairy farmers have been affected by this in that they need to buy more feed for their cattle to get more milk from them. So as a result of these taxes fanners have opted to relax. They are not buying any feeds to get more milk from their cattle. So, I would like to repeat by saying that agricultural products should only be taxed when the country is on the verge of bankcruptcy.    We all agree that people must pay taxes, but we should always remember that too much taxation has negative effects.    End H…….    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, another thing which I would like to touch on is state corporations. These corporations have become a big liability to the country. They axe supposed to be making profits but what is happening at the present moment is that they are making losses and are being bailed out by the Treasury every year. I would like to urge the Government to look at these corporations closely because they have outlived their usefulness. Those corporations which are not making profits should be done away with immediately so that the money which is channelled there is directed to projects which can produce adequate employment opportunities.    Unemployment is another thing.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah.): On a point of order, Sir. I have great respect for hon. Wabuge but could he use the words "some state corporations?" It is not all state corporations that are making losses.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. WABUGE: Sir, if I can remember, I said that some of the state corporations which are a big liability to the Government should be done away with. This has been said time and again and I think the Vice-President and Minister for Finance should do away with such corporations with immediate effect.    On unemployment, we should work hard to see to it that it is reduced. It can only be reduced if we encourage farmers to produce enough food and cash crops. If we do that, then we will be fighting unemployment. We should give farmers incentives and encourage state corporations to employ more people. At present, the Government is the largest employer and the country depends on it. The Government would be wasting resources in paying salaries of those working in non-profit making corporations. If this is done, there will be no economic stability in this country. The Government should have a minimum number of employees and the private sector should cater for the largest number of job seekers. The private sector will only do that if it isBw. Naibu Spika, wakati Bajeti inaposomwo, lingekuwa jambo la busara kufikiria mishahara ya wafanyakazi. Kuna vituvingi ambavyo, bei vyake hupanda na, kwa hivyo mishahara na marupurupu ya wafanyakazi ni lazima yafikiriwe ili watu waweze kuendelea na maisha yao vizuri. Bw. Naibu Spika, wakati huu ambapo tunatoa kibali kura matumizi ya pesa za Serikali ningependa kuomba kwamba wasorovea wapelekwe huko pwani na hasa Kilifi ili ardhi ya Serikali iweze kupimwa na wa watu kankki wapatiwe hati za kankki ardhi Kilifi ina ardhi ya kutosha, kuna, trust land na pia ardhi ya Serikali, lakini kwa vile hakuna wasorovea huko, watu wanakuwa maskwota.    (END...........D)Bw. Naibu Spika, sheria inayohusu ardhi, yaani Land Act, inasema kwamba mwanakenya yeyote anaweza kuomba ardhi ya Serikali. Ikiwa watu wa kupima mashamba hawata-pelekwa kule Kilifi kupima ardhi ya Serikali, basi wananchi katika sehemu hii, wataendelea kuomba ile ardhi bila kupewa. Hivyo ni kusema kwamba wataendelea kuwa maskwota katika maisha yao yote. Ni kweli kwamba Serikali imetoa amri kwamba ardhi ya Serikali katika sehemu ya Kilifi ipimwe na wale ambao wametuma maombi wapewe sehemu ya ardhi hiyo.    Kwa hayo machache, naunga mkono.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Ahsante sana Bw. Naibu Spika kwa kunipatia nafasi hii ili kuiunga mkono Hoja iliyoko mbele yetu. Kwanza, ningetaka kusema kwamba Bajetiya mwaka huu imekuwa nzuri kuliko Bajeti za miaka yote iliyopita. Nasema hivyokwa sababu Bajeti ya mwaka huu, imewafikiria sana wananchi wa kawaida, kwasababu bei za vitu muhimu hazikuorgezwa. Jambo hili linaoryesha wazi kwamba Makamu-Rais na Waziri wa Fedha anayafikiria sana maslaha ya wananchi. Ikiwa tunaisifu Bajeti ya mwaka huu, ningetaka kuiomba Bunge hili lihakikishe kwamba Bajeti hii itabaki vile ilivyopendekezwa na Makamu-Rais na Waziriwa Fedha mpaka mwaka ujao. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu hapo mbeleni, kumekuwa natabia ya kuanzisha mini budgets, yanni bajeti ndogo ndogo, baada ya kusomwa kwaile Bajeti kuu. Tumeshuhuaia visa vya kuongezwa kwa bei za vitu muhimu hapombeleni hata kama Serikali haijaongeza bei za vitu hizo katika Bajeti. Tungetaka Serikali yetu tukufu ihakikishe kwamba hakutakuweko na ongezeko la bei ya vitu muhimu baada ya Bajeti hii. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu tusipowafikiria wananchi wa kawaida, basi, tutaendelea kuwaumiza. Kwa hivyo, ningeiomba Serikali ihakikishe kwamba bei, za  vitu muhimu hazitaongezwa ovyo ovyo ili tuweze kuwalinda wananchi katika taifa hili letu.    Nikiendelea, ningetaka kusema kwamba Bajeti ya mwaka huu imetenga kiasi fulani cha pesa ili kuweza kukamilisha miradi ya maendeleo. Ningetaka Wizara zinazohusiana na miradi hii, zihakikishe kwamba miradi ambayo ilianzishwa hapo mbeleni na haikukamilishwa, iweze kukamilishwa kwanza kabla ya kuanzisha miradi mipya Kwa mfano, katika Kinango, walianzisha mjengo wa ofisi ya mkuu wa tarafa katika Kinango ambao ulisimami shwa mnamo mwaka wa 1987 na mpaka sasa huo. mjengo haujakamilishwa. Sasa Serikali itatumia pesa nyingi zaidi wakati itakapoanzisha mjengo huu-kwa sababu bei, za vitu vya mijengo zimepanda sana. yule aliyepewa kandarasi ya mjengo huo, alikimbia kabla ya kumaliza kazi yake na hakuma mtu yeyote. katika Wizara ya Fedha ambaye alifikiria kumfuata yule mtu. Kwa wakati huu, ule mjengo ungali unasimama kule Kinango, na kila wakati, mim	i ninalete maswali katika Bunge hili kuhusu jambo hili. Ninapozungumza katika Bunge hili leo, viombo vingine vilivyowekwa katika mjengo huu, vimeanza kuoza na hili ni jambo litakalosababisha hasara kubwa sana kwa Serikali. Ikiwa tunaisif Bajeti ya mwaka huu, ni lazima Wizara inayohusika ihakikishe kwamba mjengo huu unakamilishwa ili mkuu wa tarafa awe na ofisi nzuri ya kuweza kuwatumikia wan arc hi kule Kinango.     Vile vile, kuna kituo cha afya kiitwacho Mwanda Health Centre  katika Kiango. Hata leo asubuhi, niliuliza Swali hapa kuhusu kituo hiki cha afya. Mradi huu ulianzishwa mnamo mwaka wa 1986 na mpaka sasa haujakamilika na ninapoleta swali hapa, ninaambiwa kwamba, pesa zilirudishwa katika Idara ya Hazina mwaka jana. Ni kwa nini pesa hizo zilirudishwa? Ni kwa nini pesa hizo zinarudishwa kabla ya mradi huo kukamilishwa? Ningetaka kuwaomba wale maofisa wanaorudisha pesa katika Hazina kabla ya miradi kukamilika, waukomeshe mtindo huu. Ni lazima pesa hizo zitolewe tena ili kuweza kukamilisha kituo hiki cha afya cha Mwanda.Nasema hivyo kwa sababu ni aibu kubwa kwa Wizara kuanzisha mradi muhimu kamahuu na kurudisha pesa katika Hazima kabla ya kuukamilisha. Sisi tulipanga katika.kamati ya maendeleo kule wilayani kwamba ni lazima mradi huu ukamilishwe nasasa ni aibu kusikia kwamba pesa zilirudishwa katika Hazina ya Serikali. Wananchi katika sehemu ya Kinango walikuwa na hamu kubwa wakingojea kituo hiki kimalizike ili waweze kufaidika.    Bw. Naibu Spika, ni wazi kwamba miradi ya Serikali ambayo ilianzishwahapo mbeleni na sasa imesimamishwa, inaendelea kusababisha hasara kubwa, sio tukwa Serikali, lakini pia kwa wananchi wa jumla. Sisi katika kamti ya maendeleo ya wilaya tukiketi na kukata shauri kwamba mradi fulani upatiwe nafasi ya kwanza katika maendeleo, tunafanya hivyo kwa sababu tunajua shida za wananchi katika sehemu hii. Lakini hata tukisema hivyo, tunakuta kwamba ule mradi umesimamishwa na pesa kukaa bila kufanyishwa kazi na mwishowe zinarudi shwakatika Hazinaya Serikali. Kwa hivyo, ningeiomba Serikali ihakikishe kwamba utaratibu ambao umewekwa unafutwa wakati wa kutekeleza miradi ya maendeleo kote nchini ili wananchi waweze kufaidika.    Nikiendelea, Bw. Naibu Spika, ningetaka kusema juu ya wale watu wana- zungumza juu ya umuhimu wa kuwa na vyama viwili vya kisiasa katika Kenya. Mimi langu ni kutoa onyo kwa hawa watu ili wajihadhari. Si si katika Kenya tumekuwa huru tangu miaka 27 chini ya chama kimoja cha Kanu. Ningetaka kuwaambia wanao-zungumza. juu ya multi-parties kwamba tunataka multi-development katika Kenya na si multi-parties. Waswahili husema, "Kizuri chajiuza, kibaya chajitembeza". Hivyo ni kusema kwamba, Kanu yajiuza na wale wanaotaka vyama viwili vya kisiasa wanajitembeza. Sisi katika pwani tunasema kwamba watu wanaotutaabisha; watu wanaotaka kuharibu maendeleo ya nchi hii, wanapaswa kupigwa salala. Ninaliomba Bunge hili liwapige salala wale wanaotaka kuipotosha Kenya hii.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>AN HON. MEMBER: Salala ni kusema nini?</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Kama hujui maana yake ni shauri lako. Kwa vile sasa sisi katika Kenya tuko watulivu, hatuna haja ya kuendelea kuzungumza juu ya vyama viwili vya kisiasa kwa sababu tukiendelea kufanya hivyo, hatutakuwa tukifanya maendeleo yetu katika nchi hii.    END EKwa hivyo, ninafikiri watu hawa wamenisikia, na ningeomba tuendelee kuyadumisha maendeleo ya Kenya bila kuwajibu tena, kwa sababu kila tukiwajibu wao hufura vichwa. Tunafaa kunyamaza tu na kuendelea kuleta maendeleo nchini, na tukifanya hivi, nina hakika kwamba wataushika ule msemo wa Kingereza unaosema kwamba ikiwa huwawezi, waunge mkono, yaani "If you cannot beat them, join them." Kwa vile watu hawa hawawezi kutushinda, nawaomba watuunge mkono ili tuendelee na mambo ya Kanu katika nchi hii.    Bw. Naibu Spika, nikiugusia upande wa ujenzi katika Bajeti hii, ningependa kusema kwamba barabara zetu zimekuwa mbaya sana kote nchini, hasa kule Kinango, ambako mvua ikinyesha barabara zake hazipitiki. Kupitia kwako, ningewaomba wale wanaohusika na ujenzi wa barabara waone kwamba Kinango pia imekumbukwa. Kuna hospitali kubwa katika mawakilisho yangu, na wagonjwa huko wanapata taabu kwa sababu hospitali hiyo haina gari la kubebea wagonjwa wala hakuna aina nyingine ya usafirishaji kwa kuwa wenye magari hawati kuyapeleka huko kwa sababu barabara huko ni mbaya. Kwa hivyo, ningemwomba Waziri wa Ujenzi, wakati tunapoisifu Bajeti hii kuwa nzuri, arekebishe barabara zetu.    Kwa hayo machache, Bw. Naibu Spika, naunga mkono.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Lijoodi): Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I also would like to add my voice to that of those who have spoken before me in congratulating His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance on the most considerate Budget Speech that we have had in the last two years. While most Kenyans were waiting to hear which items had gone up in prices, some of us who are interested in development listened very carefully to his speech and, for the first one hour or so, he pointed out major policy issues which were going to have positive development on our economy.    In particular, we would like to congratulate His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance on encouraging savings, which are extremely important for investment in this country. We also want to congratulate him on ensuring that where there were changes in taxation and prices, they did notaffect Kenyans who are hard-pressed because the difficult conditions that we are experiencing at the moment. The Budget Speech also made created an atmosphere for investment in this country, and this is extremely important particularly because of the unemployment situation that we are experiencing at the moment.    We are particularly grateful to know that the Export Processing Zone is now going to be implemented. In the past, we have had some conflicting interests in export processing particularly when industries have wanted to process products for the export zone, bearing in mind the quality and prices prevailing in the: world market and, at the same time, to cater for the domestic market. We are grateful that the Export Processing Zone is going to be implemented, knowing that Kenyans have the capacity to join other industrialists from all over the world in making this a reality. What now remains is to maintain the present political stability in the country in order to ensure that these proposals are effectively implemented.    In the light of the on—going debate, we are sure that those who sure advocating a multi-party system here have got the message from wananchi because this message is clear wherever we have travelled. Most Kenyans would like to maintain the status quo of one party, in this case, Kanu, and they would like to make Kanu more effective than before. Most Kenyans support the Party and, therefore, we would like to maintain this stability in order to implement our economic development policies. In this respect, I sincerely hope that our hon. Kanu Chairman of Nakuru, Wilson Leitich, has not carried out his threat to cut off the fingers of those who are advocating a multi-party system. We know that these people have been misled, and they donot actually understand what they mean by raising two fingers. Those who are advocating a multi-party system are only speaking in the voice of their masters abroad, but we know that the most effective system is that which is based on the culture and traditions of the people for whom it is meant. Therefore, we do not want to adopt a political system that is based on foreign traditions but rather to maintain and improve. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Okwara): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.    It is the Government's intention to extend all irrigation-schemes throughout the country in order to speed up development and increase food production. However, the Ministry has no plans to extend the existing Bura Irrigation and Settlement Scheme in Tana River District to cover Garissa District.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. SALAT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the Assistant Minister's reply Bura Irrigation Settlement Scheme covers Tana River District along the Tana River, and Bura Division, which is on the other side of the river, has the same geographical and ecological features as the Bura area in Tana River District. That being the case, what is hindering the Ministry from extending this project to cover Garissa so that Garissa people may also grow a lot of food?</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. OKWARA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the initial plan was to cover about 12, 000 hectares of suitable land for irrigation. Now 6, 700 hectares were to be developed in the first phase. However, due to cost escalation and lack of a reliable water extration system only 2, 500 hectares are under irrigation.  For this reason, we have to complete the first phase before we can think of extension.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. ARTE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is talking of lack of a reliable source of water while we know that the Tana River is the biggest in this country and it runs through Bura Irrigation Scheme. What does he mean by "lack of reliable source of water"?</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. OKWARA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is a lot of silt in that river which affects the gravity of the water system.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. SALAT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I appreicate that the Government has plans to cover at least the potential 12,000 hectares before extending the scheme. But, may I know from the Assistant Minister what happened to the original plan? As far as I the Ministry had undertaken a surveysoil, water and so on fiveyears ago with a view to extending this scheme to cover the Bura area in Garissa District. But up to now nothing has happened.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. OKWARA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we had never planned to cover Garissa District as such.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. SALAT: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is misleading the House. Since he was appointed to his post recently, I think he is not aware of what the Government before his appointment. Plans had "been carried out, the survey conducted and wananchi told that irrigation secheme in Tana River District was going to be extended to Garissa District. Is the Assistant Minister in order to mislead the House by saying that the Government did not have any plan or conduct any survey over five years ago with a view to extending this scheme? Could he "back, do his homework and then come and tell this House what has happened to that survey?</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. OKWARA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member for Fafi thinks that I am hiding something; I am not hiding anything. The facts are that a survey was carried out to cover about 30, 000 hectares. However, further studies were needed to ascertain the which areas were suitable for which crops. These studies were never conducted as the Government concentrated on the development ofthe Bura Irrigation Scheme in Tana River District.</NEWSPEECH>    END....B    <NEWSPEECH>MR.

GAKUNJU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is not true that these benefits have not been paid. The cheques are lying at the office of the Public Trustee, Nyeri. They were actually posted on 11.6.90.</NEWSPEECH>    (Laughter)    <NEWSPEECH>MR. P.K. KINANJU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think it would help the House if the Assistant Minister could tell the House in whose favour the cheque was drawn. Was it in favour of the Public Trustee or the deceased? I am asking that because we know that when money is forwarded through the Public Trustee, it is kept for years before it is paid to the beneficiaries. Who was the payee?</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. GAKUNJU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I cannot say whether the cheques were drawn in favour of the Public Trustee in Nyeri or in the name of the late Jadan's family.

BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is using a phrase that is not conducive. He says that he thinks the cheques were drawn in favour of the Public Trustee, meaning that he is not sure of the position. As a House, do we believe what he thinks or should he not tell us what the correct position is?</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. GAKUNJU: Mr: Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is no reason to think that I do not think. I believe that the cheques were made in favour of the Public Trustee, Nyeri, who will in turn pay the deceased's heirs who are entitled to the money.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO:  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,think .it would be honourable for the Assistant Minister to accept that he does not know who the payee of the cheques is and promise to bring the right information later on. The issue of what he thinks does not arise since the supplementary question put to him is specific. Could he undertake to bring information to the House, telling us who the payee of those cheques is?</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR.

WAMEYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Education the following Question by Private Notice.    Why were the second year students of Asumbi Teachers' Training College sent home on 14th May, 1990?</NEWSPEECH>    END……….C    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri) : Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. On 12th March, 1990, the Second Year Students of Asumbi Teachers Training College boycotted classes demanding a refund of the harambee money they had contributed in 1989. When they threatened to use violence the  Principal of the College, in the presence of the District Education Officer sent away the students    Sir, the students were demanding a refund which the Principal would not have effected without consulting the board of governors. The board of governors met on 19th March, 1990 and authorised a refund of that money. The students were recalled, xxx refunded their money and they sat for their examinations.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Question touches on harambee money. What was that harambee money for and how much had been collected by the college.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. KARAURI: The students were asked to bring about Kshs.1,000/- from their parents, and 443 students paid Kshs.1,000/-therefore, the hon. Member can know how much money was paid. Sir, xxxxx since there were very many harambee meetings organised for that district during that period, that harambee for the college did not take place.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: What was the project that was supposed to be started with harambee money?</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. KARAURI: Sir, the board of governors had decided to hold a harambee meeting so that they could collect funds to improve a few facilities in the college, therefore, they asked every student to bring Kshs.1,000/-.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think theAssistant- Minister is misleading the House. The board of governors could not have organised to hold a harambee meeting, with_out specifying the project to be assisted or started by the harambee money. Could the Assistant Minister tell us which specific project was supposed to be helped by that harambee money. He should not tell us that they wanted to improve the college facilities because, improvement of college facilities is not a project. There should have been a specific project that they wanted to undertake in that college - It can either be a library, diningroom or something else.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. KARAURI: I do not seem to have those details, but I can check them later.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: If the Assistant Minister has not done his homework properly, would he be asked to bring that reply tomorrow? We can give him time, to do so.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. KARAURI: Sir, that is not a question of homework. The board of governors should have decided </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Deputy Speaker, is supposed to give a ruling whether my supplementary question was valid or not, but the Assistant Minister should not do so. I requested that the Assistant Minister to bring the reply tomorrow.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR.

Baada ya Bajeti wananchi walifurahi na kusema kwamba Bajeti ilikuwa nzuri, lakini kesho yake Baraza la Mji wa Mombasa lilikutana na kuona kwamba ni vizuri kuongeza nauli Kenya Bus. Bajetinauii la Mji wahaikuongeza chochote lakini Baraza la Mji wa Mombasa liliongeza nauli zote za Kenya Bus Kwa hivyo, ningemwomba Waziri wa Serikali za Wilaya atueleze ni kwa nini Baraza la Mji wa Mombasa liliongeza nauli za Kenya Bus baada ya Bajeti. Hilo limekuwatatizo kubwa sana/kwa hivyo, kama Waziri yuko hapa ningemwomba alijlou hilo  swali. Tena ningependa kumjulisha kwamba wakazi wa Mombas wamemwomba atupilie mbali hizo nyongeza za nauli kwa sababu hiyo ni kunyume cha vile wananchi walivyokuwa wakifikiria baada ya Bajeti.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR.

DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Ndzai you were on the Floor yesterday before we adjourned, and therefore, you should continue.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. NDZAI: Bw. Naibu Spika, ningependa kuendelea kuunga mkono Bujeti ya mwakwa huu. Tuko katika Bunge hili hili kutoa kibali cha pesa za Serikalizitumike katika Wizara mbali mbali.    Bw. Naibu Spika, wananchi waliunga mkono sana Bajeti iliyosomwa hapa na Makamu wa Rais na Waziri wa Fedha. Lakini Waswahili husema, "usinivike kilemba cha ukoka". Tunatarajia kwamba baada ya Bajeti bei za vituiambavyo havikuongezwa bei hazitangez wa mwezi wa Fular mwaka ujao. Vitu Vya kawaida havikuongezwa bei, lakini kama baada ya mwezimoja au miwili tutasikia vitu hivyo bei, basi wananchi watakuwa wamevikwa kilemba cha ukoka.        Bunge hili  likisha pitisha kwamba Wizara mbali mbali zinaweza kupatiwa pesa, ni lazima zipelekwe katika wilayambali mbali ili miradi ambayo imepitishwa na kamati za maendeleo wilayani iweze kukamilishwa. Mara nyingi tumeona kwamba nesamiradi ya maendeleo ikishapitishwa na kupatiwa pesa, maofisawanaohusika hawafanyi kazi haraka inavyostahili, na baadaye pesa hizo za miradi hurudishwa-katika Treasury, kabla wa miradi ambayo ilikuwa imependekezwa na kamati ya maendelea wilayanikukamuluka. Kwa mfano, huko Magharini kuna mradi moja ambao unajulikana kama Mjana Heri Self Help Water Project ulipewa Kshs. 700, 600/- tarehe 1. 7. 89, lakini ax mpaka sasavifaa havijakamilika, kununuliwa. Kama vifaa vote 	havijanunuliwa mpaka sasa ni vibaya sana kwa sababu vitu vinapanda bei,na mradi hukamiliki. Hayo ni makosa ambayo yanafanywa na watufulani baada ya pesa kutolewa na Serikali. </NEWSPEECH>    <HEADER>HANSARD</HEADER>    Wednesday, 13th June, 1990    The House met at Nine o'clock.    /Mr. Deputy Speaker in the Chair/    <HEADER>PRAYERS</HEADER>    <HEADER>POINT OP ORDER</HEADER>        <NEWSPEECH>MR.

BIDU asked the Minister for Health what is delaying the completion of Mwanda Health Centre in Mwavumbo Location, Kwale District.        <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Dr. Godana): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.    The completion of Mwanda Health Centre was initially delayed by lack of various building materials which caused the extension of completion period. The project should now be completed by the end of the current financial year, or at the end of this month.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the delay in materials is immaterial because there is an agreement for that health centre by the contractor. Now how come that there was lack of building materials when the contractor had already agreed to complete the health centre by December, 1989?</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>DR. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Bidu should surely know, and I am sure he knows, that even when contracts are concluded and it is expected that certain events will-take place at a certain future date, sometimes there arises certain acts beyond the control of the contractor which even legally exemp him from liability. The contract was concluded and it was expecte that it should be completed by a certain date, assuming that all materials would be available as and when required from the market. In fact, there have been shortages of materials which were beyond the contractor's control.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the Assistant Minister has agreed that the health centre should have been completed by the end of the financial year 1989/90, and it was not, when will it be completed? Can he give us the exact date since the money has already been allocated?</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>DR.

KIILU asked the Minister for Water Development when the Masinga-Ekalakala Water Project will be completed.    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Kisiero):Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.    The estimated completion date for Masinga-Ekalakala Water Project is sometime in June, 1993. However, then will entirely depend on availability of funds by Ministry. The total costof the project is Shs.91 million, and so far only Shs.1.24 millionhas been received and spent on fencing, a pump house and the rising main pipes.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. KIILU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in his reply the Assistant Minister has said that Shs. l.24 million has been spent on the project while the report of the administrators say that Shs. 2.24 million has been spent on it. Why is there a difference between his figure and that given by the administrators?</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. KISIERO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not know what report my hon. friend is talking about. In 1987/88 Financial Year no money was allocated for the project. In the 1988/89 Financial Year it was indicated that Shs.2 million would be allocated for the project. Out that Shs.l million was released in the first allocation while in the second allocation only Shs.240,000/- was received.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR.KIILU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, does the Assistant Minister mean to say that the Ministry stopped the work for a while so that it could look for more funds?</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. KISIERO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is true that due to the size of the project - I said earlier it is estimated to cost about Shs.91 million - the Ministry has decided to implemented it in phases. This because if we were to wait for a lumpsum of Shs.91 million to be available its completion may take a long time owing to the fact that we do not have a lot of money to go round.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. LEWA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, how serious is the Ministryin implementing this project? The project is estimated to costa total of Shs.91 million, but so far only Shs.1.24 has been spenton it. Could the Assistant Minister indicate what kind of phasingout programme they have? There is a big difference between the estimated total expenditure of Shs.91 million and the already spent Shs.1.24 million and this project might never be completed.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR.KISIERO: Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sure my colleague appreciates the fact the Ministry relies funds from the Treasury, which in turn relies on funds collected from and other sources. If the Treasury does not collect enough, or if the financial needs of the whatever little money there id. In this case if the Ministry is allocated more funds it is ready to  spend more funds. </NEWSPEECH>    <HEADER>Question No. 225     Extention of Bure Irrigation Settlement Scheme</HEADER>    MR.SALAT asked the Minister for Regional Development what plans the Ministry has to extend the existing Bura Irrigation settlement Scheme in Tana River District to cover Garissa District.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL HERITAGE (Mr. Nooru) (ctd.): Kwa- hivyo,- ninamwuliza Waziri- achukue-hatua-sasa, kwa-sababu. tukichelewa,-kesho— wanaweza kutamka maneno fulani halafu Wakenya wawapige raakofi na kung'oa macho yao. Hapo ndipo watakuja kusema eti Serikali ndiyo imefanya hivi na vile. Hawatasema kwamba wananchi wa Kenya wameukataa mpango wao ndipo wakapigwa, bali watasema kwamba njama hii imepangwa na Serikali.    Kile ambacho waalifu hawa wamesahau ni mila za Kiafrika ambazo zinasema kwamba ni lazima tumheshimu kiongozi kwa umri wake, awe amechaguliwa au la, au awe wa ndini. Hivi ndivyo mila zetu zinavyotuhubiria. Tukikosa kuonyeshana heshima au tukikosa kumheshimu Kiongozi wa nchi hii, hili halitakuwa jambo la vyama vingi vya kisiasa, lakini la kufa na kupona. Sisi hatuko tayari kupoteza maisha ya wananchi. Kwa hivyo, tungefaa kuliangalia jambo hili kwa makini na kuwachukulia watu hawa hatua ifaayo.    Jambo lingine, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, linahusu maendeleo ya nchi hii. Makadirio haya tunayojadili leo ni mipango ya maendeleo katika miezi 12 ijayo. Ni lazima tuitumie vizuri kodi iliyolipwa na wananchi ili iweze kuwafaidi wananchi, hasa kikazi. Kwa hivyo, wale ambao tumewapatia jukumu la kuendeleza uchumi wa nchi hii, hasa watumishi wa Serikali, wanafaa kufanya bidii sana kwa sababu hali ya maisha inaendelea kuwa ngumu na tukienda pole pole bila kufanya bidii, tutaachwa nyuma. Mtukufu Rais anatueleza kila wakati kwamba tuko mbioni kwa sababu tunashindana na ulimwengu kimaisha. Wale ambao wamekabidhiwa pesa za umma ni lazima wazitumie vizuri wakati ufaao kwa sababu wakichelewa, gharama ya maisha itaendelea kuongezeka. Kama mradi umepangiwa kukamilishwa katika mwaka mmoja, ni lazima ukamilishwe katika muda huo kulingana na uwezo wetu wa fedha.    Ningependa kusema kwamba nchi hii inaelekea upande mmoja na mtu mwingine akijaribu kutufuta miguu, hatutakubali. Ni lazima sote tuwe makini na tayari kutumia silaha tulizo nazo, kama vile rungu, visu, mishale na kadhalika, kupigana ili tusirudishwe nyuma. Usiku na mchana, tutaendelea kumlinda Mtukufu Rais na Wanakenya wengine. Kwa hivyo, hatutaki mawazo mengi kutoka kwa wale ambao wanajaribu kuwapotosha wananchi. Mawaidha tunayotakani ya Mtukufu Rais, Chama cha Kanu na Serikali ya Kenya tu kwa sababu ndiyo yametuwezesha kuwa vile tulivyo sasa, huku tukijadiliana ni wapi tunapoelekea katika raiaka kadha ijayo. Kwa hivyo, wale ambao wana mawazo ya kuwa na vyama vingi vya kisiasa wanafaa kwenda kuzisadia nchi zile ambako wananchi wanapoteza maisha yao. Nchi jirani zetu zina shida, na watu hawa wangekwenda huko pamoja na mali yao ili kuzisaidia. Wananchi wa Kenya wanafaa tu kujitaidi usiku na mchana kwa sababu kunao wengine kati yetu ambao wanajaribu kutuchochea, na ni lazima tuwe waangalifu sana huku tukiyalinda maisha ya wananchi wetu kila wakati. Wajibu huu ni wa kila Mwanakenya, awe mkubwa au mdogo, au kiongozi aliyechaguliwa au aliyeteuliwa. tunafaa kuwa "askari", halafu tuchukue silaha zetu tupigane na adui zetu.

Members, it is now time for the interruption of Business. The House is, therefore, adjourned until Wednesday, 13th June, at 2.30 p.m.</NEWSPEECH>    The House rose at thirty minutes past Twelve o'clock.        End X<NEWSPEECH>MR.MAKAU (Ctd.): Produce goods that are able to compete with other goods in the export market. If you look at whatever has been written about the European Economic Community Countries, you would find that the preferential treatment that we used to havethrough the Rome Agreement, is not going to be accorded to us any longer. Therefore, whatever goods that we are going to produce in this country should be competitive with those from other countries of the world. While we are trying to explore for markets in our neighbouring countries, we must realize that these are not markets that we can rely upon for long.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, although the Vice-President and Minister for Finance included in his Budget measures to promote exports, thereis one aspect of the problem that he should address himself to. We were assured that through the discounting, of financial bills, our people will be able to get export compensation. However, I feel there are certain factors that ought to be taken into consideration with regard to this export compensation. It is important that the loopholes that exist in the export compensation should be tackled. A lot of exporters in this country have cheated the Government by claiming to have exported goods which they have actually not exported and these loopholes should be checked thoroughly. At the same time, when we consider the export bills that will be discounted, something which is an incentive to those in the export business, we should remember also that a time will come when it might not be possible to guarantee those who are in the export business. The Vice-President and the Minister for Finance, together with the Minister for Industry, should make sure that when they export goods to the neighbouring countries, they are paid for those goods. If any problems crop up in getting paid for these goods, what guarantee Will there be that those who have exported their goods to these countries will be paid?    So, it is a high time that an insurance scheme was established so that those traders who export their goods to the neighbouring countries are guaranteed of payment. I am saying this because there are export insurance schemes in the developed countries of Europe to guarantee payment for goods delivered. Some of our neighbouring countries as we all are aware are not stable and if we deliver goods to them and certain problems arise there, we are likely not to be paid.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, one thing which has happened, in this country which has shown prudent economic management is the control of inflation where by inflation stands at 10.6 per cent in the Budget which has just heen presented. This means that our management of the economy is excellent. The other area which is worrying not only Kenya, but the whole Africa is the external debt. As you are aware, Africa internal debt now stands at more than 262 billion dollars     End NWe are very fortunate in this country because at the same time as we are struggling to manage our external debts, the writing off of such debts by our friends, such as the Germans and others, has reduced our debts to such an extent that the ratio of servicing these debts has now reached 27.5 per cent. However, in thinking about external debts, we would like to urge those who give loans to look at those who are servicing their debts and come up with ways and means of trying to compensate them. Kenya should not be lumped together with other countries that have forgotten their debt repayment and are no longer servicing their debts.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, one other area that I would like to touch on in this Budget is the question of the Export Processing Zone. Whereas the Vice-President and Minister for Finance says that everything in this regard is working very well, I would like to point out that one of the areas that has been earmarked as an Export Processing Zone is Athi River. When you think of that area in the light of export processing, you find that the people who will be working there will need infrastructure, such as housing. Investors will want to invest in that area, but one of the biggest problems there is lack of infrastructure that would be able to attract investors. We should not just think of people coming all the way from their own areas and leave alone those people who are going to work in the Export Processing Zone. The infrastructure I am talking about includes things such as schools. The people who are going to establish industries there will need to send their children to school. We lack schools in Athi River, and so do we housing. A scheme should be established to ensure that we have the necessary facilities in the Export Processing Zone.    One area of the Budget that is very important is taxation incentives. Those who are going to invest are now going to be given a 10—year moratorium, and they will be able to get some of their goods duty-free. One thing that we should not forget to do is that, .while we know that encouragement of investment will create employment, we should not lose sight of the fact that we need tohave our local people involved in this investment. While the Budget talks about a 40 per cent incentive, which is very good, it should be added that in the course of time, those who are going to have joint investment ventures with the indigenous people in this country should be given more incentive especially in the question of cultivation. The present 40 per cent should be reduced by about 2.5 per cent to about.37.5. per cent, and the moratorium should be increased. When you think of Mauritius and other countries that have succeeded in such ventures, you find that they have given investors good incentives, and this is why we argue that our case should be similar to theirs.    With these few remarks, I beg to support.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILDLIFE (Mr. Gakunju): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to contribute to this very important debate. I would like to start by thanking His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for having presented a very progressive common man's Budget. Let me add that reading through the Budget, one finds that it is very encouraging. Contribution to our growth is slowly shifting to industrialisation and, for this reason, there is need to expand and improve our export performance. It is, therefore, very fitting that export processing zones are being established and matters of export compensation are being looked after. So, it is very important that we improve our manufacturing and the quality of our products, such as farm produce. We have big export opprotunities in very potential areas.    I have just come back from the Gulf, which is only four and a half hours from by air. People there get their meat and other similar products from far away Europe and even Australia. However, we have the Kenya Meat Commission and other organisations here which can sell these things to these people. So, apart from the concession being given by the Government, we need to improve our export performance both in the public and the private sectors. I think it is important for export promotion organisations, such as the Kenya External Trade Authority, to be revitalised and expanded so that they can look into thismatter. It is no use for us to get all the concession and duty refund and then fail to perform satisfactorily.    As I said, we have markets all over the world, and not just in the Middle East. We have markets for our products even in the Preferintial Trade Area countries, Europe, Far East, the American Continent and other places. We, therefore, need to look for a way of facilitating our trade by improving our organisation structure and export promotion so that we may earn more foreign exchange.    The other area that is equally important is tourism in which have potential for improvement. Growth in the past few years has been very good, and we need to improve and expand this sector by making our people participate in it in one way or another. We should not only encourage tourists to come here but also take proper care of them. Our people should make such good items that these tourists can take them back with them. It is very fitting that our Jua Kali industries should consider producing, apart from normal wares, gift items that tourists can take back with them. These should not be available from other countries.    On the question of our agriculture, the expansion of the production of coffee, tea, cotton and other crops should be encouraged. Our pyrethrum is in very big demand internationally, and its production should be expanded and improved.    End O    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the growing of pyrethrum in this country should be expanded and improved because pyrethrum is in very big demand internationally. This can only be done if we improve our infrastructures in the countryside. This is because some roads in the rural areas are impassable after heavy rains. It is very difficult to move farm produce to the markets and it is equally difficult to move farm inputs to farming areas. Generally speaking there is a very great need to improve our roads. The delay in using the money that is being paid by the farmers in the way of levy in improving the roads in the farming areas should be looked into so that the roads and other infrastructures that will make the farmers improve their communications are enhanced.        The improvement in the paying methods to the farmers for their produce, the cut-down on the time that they have to wait for their money for their produce should be looked into so that they are paid promptly and regularly without wasting time. This will then be able to help in mailing them increase production. The availability of farm input s and the other goods that the farmer re quire should be looked into so that the farmers do not have to make unnecessary trips to the cities and towns. This is because travelling has become prohibitively expensive. The trips that a farmer has to come to the towns to look for the necessary materials should be reduced by equipping the business, shops and distribution centres up-country. We should encourage and improve the rural-urban balance so that the farmers can have their inputs taken to them. These inputs - should be distributed by people who are backed by finance and credit; people who can stock their shops; people who know business by being trained. This is because we have very many young people who could do these things if they had the facilities to do so. Credit facilities should be made available to them so that they can run businesses thatwill assist the ordinary mwananchi in the rural areas. Things like water and electricity should he provided to our people in the rural areas. I appreciate that this is a long term affair but it is important that it is looked into.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would now like to touch on the question of efficiency in the Civil Service and parastatal organisations. You will find that the ordinary mwananchi has to travel from a remote corner of his district to the district headquarters several times just to follow up a letter. You will also find that officers at the district headquarters keep telling that mwsnanchi "Come back tomorrow; become back the day after tomorrow" and so on. Travelling is very expensive these days and the person travelling from up-country to the towns not only wastes money but also wastes time. Time that could be spent onthe farm is being spent on the road to travel to the district headquarters or to the divisional headquarters to look for a reply to a letter or for a snail piece of information. so, more efficiency on the part of civil servants would help in solving this problem.        With those few words I support the Motion. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR.MCHARO: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I would like to start by congratulating the Vice- President and Minister for Finance for presenting a Budget which will stimulate the economic growth of this country. It will also promote export activities in this country. But these goals can only be achieved when we have complete stability in this country. I would therefore urge that we continue supporting the party Kanu. In my view, those who are bent on advocating for a multi-party system for this country have their own hidden motives. They are seriously speaking, not interested in the economic growth of this country. We should therefore condemn them in totallity. Appropriate action should be taken against such people. This is because they are trying to frustrate our efforts to achieve the economic goals of this country as spelt out in the Budget Speech that we are discussing today.        Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like to say that the clergymen who seem to be causing a lot of trouble may not be having the interests of this country at heart. Apparently most of them appear to be members of the Church of the Province of kenya. I happen to belong to that church and I am a bit sorry about this matter." There are very good clergymen in the C.P.K.. and who are supporting the Government fully and at this juncture I would like to commend the C.P.K. Mombasa branch in the Coast Province. They have never been controversial. So, they are very good members of the C.P.K. and I would like to request them to pray very hard for their colleagues so that they can change their ways.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the aim of the Budget is to promote and develop the economy of this country. The rural-urban balance policy is commendable and needs to be given full support by the Government and the investors.We want to see the rural trade and development centres given full support and in this regard I would like all the divisional headquarters and other important towns to be identified for this kind of development. We would like the electrification programmes and the provision of water to these areas to be speeded up. Roads and telephone facilities should be properly developed. The rural areas should be linked to the urban areas with proper road network so that the whole country can develop for the benefit of the people. This will also enhance the industrialisation process of this country.        Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when we talk of promotion of exports, we must also continue supporting the small scale industries so that we may achieve the rural-urban balance. When we look at the reports of the Public Accounts Committee, we find that quite a lot of money that is earmarked for the development of small scale industries remain unspent. I feel that this money remains unspent because we have not yet found ways of encouraging our people to take the development of industries quite seriously. Here I would like to urge the Government to go and identify the right people who should go into industrialization. The Government should identifu people with the necessary  know-how and given them thorough training.                End.P..After that training they can be taken to various places where industries are being developed. The local entrepreneurs should be given financial support to develop small-scale industries in. the rural sector. If we did that, then we would accelerate the industrial tempo in the country.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like to urge that the agricultural programme in the country be given more attention. Although we are doing that already, you will find that some cash crops like cotton have been neglected. I was surprised and saddened to read in the papers the other day that we are still importing cotton in the country when we have sufficient resources in the country to grow enough cotton for local consumption and even for export purposes. I am happy to see that in the Budget, cotton development has been given some attention. I think we should identify the areas in the country where this crop can be grown, We should do thorough research so that we can increase cotton production in the country. I am saying so because even in my area there is scope for the development of this cotton. But at the moment, the crop is being grown haphazardly. So, in my view, a lot of research needs to be carried out there to identify the areas most suitable for the growth of this crop and to introduce farmers to the crop. The Government could also deploy more agricultural extension officers to show the farmers how best to develop this crop. If we did that then we would be able to produce enough cotton to feed our local textile industries. In fact, it is my opinion that more cotton growing should be introduced in the small-scale industrialisation programme for the benefit of this country. The results of all this would more cotton for our textile industries and more cotton exports to our Preferential Trade Area (PTA) partners.    The other thing that I would like to emphasise is about the storage problems facing our farmers. You will find out that a lot of crops like maizeare going to waste just because there are no storage facilities near the farmers. As a result of this farmers lose a lot of money. It is my view that storage facilities need to be established all over the country in small market centres. Ways and means should be found for marketing the farmers crops to ensure that the farmers do not lose their crops. In fact, at the moment very many farmer's crops are going to waste because of poor storage facilities and lack of adequate marketing facilities. We would like the Governemnt to look into this issue and to pay special attention to the marketing and storage of the crops of the small- scale farmers in the rural areas .     Thank you.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (MR. Mak'Anyengo): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my colleagues in congratulating the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for a very balanced Budget which intends to develop the rural areas. It is balanced because many of us in this House represent rural areas. The Budget is in fact mindful of the welfare of those in the rural areas. The only problem that we have is that every year he prepares a Budget that is very good to wananchi, but the implementors fail to do their part. You will find, for example, a project that is supposed to take one or two years takes five or six years to complete. I have in mind a health centre in my constituency that was projected to be completed by April, 1987, but todate that facility is not yet completed. It has happened so because the contractors who had been given the work fail to do their job and even those from the Ministry of Public Works and from other Ministries fail to do proper supervision. As a result of this by the time sucha project is completed, the Government will have spent three times what it should have spent. Worse still, when the project has failed they turn round and start blaming the hon. Member of Parliament from that area saying: "You see the Mheshimiwa is the one who has not worked hard to complete the project. “It is high time these implementers were told that in orderto help the Government, the country and to maintain peace and stability, they should work harder and pull up their socks. That is the only way through whichwananchi can benefit from such projects. Furthermore, when these implementers fail to comply with what is in the Budget, wananchi get annoyed and look up at the Government as having failed to fulfil certain things.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, every Year in the Budget money is provided for road repairs after the rains. But it is strange that in certain places, like in Nyanza District, there are roads that have been repaired for the last three years. One particular road in that area has remained impassable for a very long time despite the fact that bridges and culverts on it have been washed away. When you ask why this situation is so you are told that there was no money that was allocated for this road. But when in the books of the Ministry's estimate's. you will find that there is money for maintenance of roads. So, one wonders as to what happens to this money if the roads are not being repaired. I would like to point out that the Ministry should try to whip some of its 'boys' in the rural areas to ensure that they work in accordance with the wishes of the wananchi otherwise there will be no difference between them and those who are undermining the Government.END Q……….This is because when you make the wananchi not to understand what the Government intends to do for them, you are in a way an economic subvert which is not different fïom a political subvert.    A lot has been said about multi-parties and all the nonesense that goes with it. Perhaps, some of these people who talk too much about multi-parties do not understand what they are saying because some of them were in never in the "thick and thin" during the struggle for Independence. If they were, they would not have attempted to talk about this thing. For example, Mr. Matiba does not even ka know what the struggle for Independence was all about. He was a civil servant and also a student at that time and he does not, therefore, know how bitter the struggle between various political groups that existed was. We had the Kalenjin Alliance, Maasai United Pront, Abaluhyia Political United, Luo United Movement, APP and so on. Those of us who participated in this thing, feel it in our bones when the issue of multi-parties is raised.    For example, the incident which many people have mentioned about Machakos was so sad. I remember seeing Ngala Mvendwa and Dr. Wfaiyaki running on foot - leaving their vehicles - because they could go faster that way. These things happened and anybody who is talking about multi-parties is trying to retard the progress that we have made in this country. However, we should not take such people lightly. Those who are advocating for such a system are working day and night. They have also recruited the churches.    For a long time, I have been pointing out in the Press whenever these church people talk and some of my friends have been thinking that I have a grudge against the church. That is not the case. I am a Christian and I was brought up in a christian home. My father was a padre and I know what Christianity is all about. I also know how a christian and a padre should behave in the church. I am against this type of christians who haveturned the pulpit of the church into a political platform for their political ambitions.    One funny thing which these church fellows forget is that if we, politicians, started to go into the day to day happenings in their churches, they would be ashamed. There are certain things that we know they do in the churches that if they were said publicly, they would have no followers. I do not have to mention examples but it is common knowledge that some of them were defrocked for certain activities that were unbecoming to the church. We are christians and we would like to follow the example of our church leaders. The church should not appear to be tribal.     Why is it that it is only a group of certain people that is so vocal about this church business? We have other denominations like Catholic, Seventh-Day Adventist and so on. Why do we not hear from them? Is it only the Church of the Province of Kenya (CPK) that is so much concerned about the welfare of the people? When we look at them, we see that they are acting contrary to church regulations.    I would like to appeal to the Government and particularly the Minister in charge of internal security to prosecute the Very Rev. Njenga because it would be wrong not to do so since he has said something which has been proved to be false. If that is not done, then it would encourage other people to stand up and malign the Government without any proof. He should be prosecuted for giving false information to police officers. He cannot go on insisting that eight people died in the Muoroto saga without giving us the facts to prove his allegations. The names of .the 'dead' people which he gave have been denied by their relatives.    With those few remarks, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI (Ctd.): Ni kwa nini uchumi wa Kenya uachwe hivi? Hayo ni mambo ambayo yananiudhi sana.        Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, nikisema habain ya watu ambao wanataka vyama vingi, mini na wewe tuna ujuzi mwingi sana kuhusu siasa. Tulijua kabla ya 1963 vile mambo yalivyokuwa na vile yali-vyokuwa katika mwaka wa 1963. Sisi tuliingia katika Bunge hili kama watu 40 wa chama cha Kadu. Tulifanya mpango mpaka tukampata Mzungu mmoja akateuliwa. Lakini unajua kwamba tulipata taabu. Kila asubuhi mmoja wetu alikuwa ashtakiwa. Wakati huo ni chama cha Kanuambacho kilikuwa kinatawala. Kwa hivyo, kila mwanachama wa Kadualikuwa anateswa. Kulikuwa hakuna usalama mpaka mtu aingie Kanu.Tuliona hatuna lingine la kufanya ila tu ni kuingia Kanu kwasababu tulikuwa tunachekelewa na watu hata barabarani. Tulionelea ni heri tupige Kadu marufu ku tuingie Kanu. Tulifanya bidii na sote. tukai- ngia chama cha Kanu kwa kauli moja na tukawa watu wa pamojn , nchi moja na kila kitu kimoja.    Lakini kabla hatujapiga Kadu marufuku, huko Pwani tulikuwa na chama kingine kinachoitwa Coast People's Union. Pia kwingineko kulikuwa na vyama vingine kama A.P.P. na kadhalika. Utaona kwamba pahali palipo na kiongozi ndipo patakapokuwa na chama. Kwa mfano, sisi sote tulimpenda sana marehemu Ngala. Kwa hivyo, sisi sote tukawa Kadu. Pia Rift Valley, wakati ule walimpenda Mtukufu Rais, Murgor, Seroney na kadhalika, wote wakawa Kanu. Tena Taita walimpenda Mwanyumba na wote wakawa Kanu. Unaona sasa tofauti iliyoko? Pia kwa sababu wakamba walimpenda Ngei, wengi wao wakawa A.P.P. Je, huo ni uwakilishaji wa Kenya nzima au makabila?    Hataxi zaidi ni kwamba kule Pwani kwa sababu tulijua Wajaluo wote walimpenda Odinga na Mboya, tukimwona Mjaluo anafanya kidole cha Kanu tulikuwa tunamshika. wengine walikuwa wanauawa na wengine kutahirishwa bila maji Je, usalama uko wapi hapo?</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI: Asante, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipa wakati huu ili niungane na Wabunge wenzangu kwa kumpongeza Makamu wa Rais na Waziri wa Fedha kwa Bajeti nzuri aliyosoma katika Bunge hili. Bajeti ya rawaka huu ili kuwa nzuri na ya matumaini sana.    Kwa sababu wakati wangu wa kuongea ni mfupi, ningependa kwanza kusema juu ya viwanda vya sukari. Tunajua kwamba sukari imepungua nchini na ingawa nyingine inaagizwa katoka nje ya nchi hii, waitoshelezi mahitaji yetu. Ajabu ni kwamba mitambo ya sukari inafifia na ingawa mingtup inatengenezwa, nyjgasuae mingine  inaachwa tu. Kwa mfano, Serikali inatumia pesa nyingi kurekebisha mitambo ya sukari mikoani Nyanza na Magharibi na hali ile ya Hkoa wa Pwani nahasa Ramisi, haijarekebishwa. Kwa vile tuna naa upungufu wa sukari, ni kwanini Serikali haiwezi kusimamia kiwanda cha sukari cha Ramisi ili tuweze kupata sukari ya kntosha au ifanye kiwanda hiki kuwa shirika la Serikali?.    Kitu kingine ni kwamba mtambo waikorosho ambao ndio mali ya watu wa mkoa wa Pwani, umeachwa kufifia na sasa umefungwa hali wakulina hawajalipwa. Eaya yote yanafanyika na hali maofisa wa Serikali wanaangalia tu. Inaonekana kama watu wengine wanafanya kazi kinyume cha Serikali. Tunawesa kuwataja tu watu wenye nia ya kuwa n_a vyama vingi vya kisiasa nchini kumbe kuna watu wengine ambao wanataka Serikali ianguke kiuchumi kwa manufaa yao. Ni vizuri tuwachunguze economists ili wasije wakatuharibia Serikali na ripoti zao za uongo ili wananchi wasiilaumu Serikali. Mambo haya yanaudhi sana.    Mtambo wa korosho unafifia na hali Wizara na economists wako. Sasa miwa inaharika shambani. na hali sukari haitoshi nchini. Hii ni hatari. Uchumi wa nchi hii ni wa watu wote na ni lazima waangaliwe kwa heshima kubwa. Kwa mfano, Mhindi mwenye kiwanda anatoroka, miwa 300 million imeharibika, watu na serikali wanamdai mhindi million kadhaa na hali anaachiliwa hivi hivi. Tunataka Serikali itoe pesa za kufufua ule mtambo wa sukari kule Pwani. Hawa pia ni watu wa Kenya na wana haki ya kupata keki ya taifa. Ingefaa pia ule mtambowa korosho ufufuliwe mara moja ili wananchi waweze kuuza koroshozao. Watoto wengi hawakwenda shuleni mwaka huu kwa sababu malipo ya korosho, hayajatolewa na kampuni hiyo. Kwanini mtambo huu uliachwa mpaka Ukaanguka?    Wajaluo wote walikuwa Kanu, Mboya na Odinga. Basi kazi yetu sisi"watu wa Kadu "na C.P.P. ilikuwa ni kuwakamata na kuwafanya hivyo. Hata mara nyingine unaona mtu amedungwa kisu na kuuawa kwa sababu ameonyesha alama tofauti. na mwenzake. Je, tunatak a kuirudisha hatari hii tena? Mimi nina ujuzi na nasema sitaki hatari hii. Watu wengine husema ni afadhali wafe kuliko kuuona ulimwengu huotena. Basi hata mini sitaki kuiona tena.    Kanu sasa imeunganisha watu na wamekuwa ni kitu kimoja. Tukisema tunasema kwa kauli moja na hii ni sawa kabisa. Leo tune watu ambao wako na ule ukuu wa kufikiria jambo kabla hawajaondoka. Leo tuna watu ambao ukisema hili ni nzuri anakwamba ni mbaya. Je, tumekomaa hapo? Bado tuko na fikira ambazo hatujatiamia. Nihatari kuwa na stesheni mbili za redio kwa sababu tunawapoteza watu wa Kenya mara moja. Hii ni kwa sababu kuna watu wengineambao wanaweza 'kutaluna' na 'kumeza' mambo lakini kuna wengineambao hawawezi kufanya hivyo.    Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, si lazima eti wewe uwe na cheo fulani ndipo nchi iwe sawa kwa sababu hawa wanaotaka vyama vingi ni wale waliokosa vitivya Bunge ama viti vya Uwaziri. Je, ikiwaumekosa Uwaziri na mwenzako amepata, umsaidie ili aendelee kuijenga nchi. Ni lazima wewe uwe waziri ndipo uone nchi ina- endeshwa vizuri ama ni lazima wewe uwe kiongozi ndipo uone kwamba nchi inaendeshwa vizuri?    End S.Si lazima Rais atoke katika kabila lako ndipo useme kwamba nchii hii inaendesnwa vizuri. Ikiwa mtu ni. nwananchi nalafu mungu ambariki na wananchi wamkubali ingefar atuongoze ili tuendelee mbele. Tabia ya kuchimbana na kuchochea fujo ni hatari. Kwa kweli pesa nyingi ni "sumu"; Ivlungu an ge kuwa anampatia kila mtu pesa chache za kujisaidia. Hii ni kwa sababu hawa watu wanaopigania kuweko kwa vyama vingi vya kisiasa ni matajiri wakubwa sana.' Sijui kama wananchi wanajua watu hawa wanaweza kukodisha ndege na kuit or oka nchi hii pamoja na familia zao.    Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, mimi ni Mwislamu na ninajua dini ya kikristo inataka kuiharibu nchi hii. Hii ni kwa sababu viongosi wa wakristo wanaipinga Serikali kila siku. Sisi Waislamu tumeambiwa tumwogope Mungu na Serikali. lakini kwa sababu Wakristo hawataki kuisoma Eurani tuna taabu hii. Ningewaomba waisome Kurani na watajua kwamba ni makosa kuingiakanisani na kuanza kuipinga Serikali.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELORIENT (Mr. Mturia): Ahsante sana, Bw.

Wakati Nairobi ulipokuwa mji mbichi nilikuwa hapa na Rubia nikifanya kazi yangu ya kuuza miraa polepole. Wakati huo mtu huyu alikusanya mali ambayo thamani yake hamwezi kujua hadi kuteuliwe kamati ya uchunguzi. Katika Nairobi peke yake, mtu huyu ana zaidi ya ploti 400. Ukienda London utakuta kwamba Rubia amenunua ploti nyingine huko. Kwa hivyo, hata Rubia akiondoka hapa - na anataka kuvuruga nchi ndio aondoke  ataenda London ambako ana pesa. Katika benki za Swizerland Rubia ana pesa na kwa hivyo hata akiharibu Kenya hatajali kwa sababu ataenda mahali maslahi yake yako. Hata anaweza kwenda na gari lake hadi mpakani mahali ambako mtu mwengine alipitia akiwa amevalia nguo za mwanamke na kwenda London.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>Bw.

Huko Kisumu walikuwa wameandika kwamba "multi-parties, multi-problems",  na hayo ni maneno ya kweli.    Ningependa kuongea juu ya makanisa Mimi nimeshangazwa na kanisa la Church of Province of Kenya (C.P.K.). Ni kwa nini kanisa la C.P.K. Iinawaalika watu wa magazeti katika makanisa yao. Why should they write the pressmen tocome and list en to ,their sermons.

Alisema kwamba mama kuyo kelilcuwa cha kifo cha kawaida, na akamuuliza Rev. Njenga aombe msamaha. Nafikiri Serikali imekuwa nzuri sana kwa hawa watu Nafikiri ni vizuri hawa watu waonje jela kidogo hata kama itakuwa siku mbili kwa sababu wameanza kushika jicho la Serikali.        Watu wote wa Kenya wanamuunga Mtukufu Rais  mkono, na wanataka chama kimoja.    Kwa hayo machache naunga mkono.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL HERITAGE (Mr. Nooru): Asante sana Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipatia nafasi hii ili nami niungane na wenzangu katika kuuinga Hoja hii mkono kwa dhati.        Jambo ambalo liko mbele yetu linahusu mpango wakuwasaidia wananchi. Hiyo ni kuonyesha kwamba sisi kama taifa ruzima tunajua tunapotoka na tunapokwenda. Kama vile wahe. Wabunge wameuliza, ni nchi ngapi katika Afrika zinapanga mambo yaoya maendeleo ya maika mitano, na pia kusoma Bajeti kila mwaka kama vile vile tunavyofanya Ni ajabu kuona kwamba baada ya miaka 27 tangu tupate Uhuru kuna watu ambao wameanza kujaribu kuwapotosha wananchi wa Kenya. Mambo ya vyama vingi ni mambo yakufa na kupona. Wakati wa kuongea kwa mdomo umekwisha. Pahali ambako hayo maneno ya vyama vingi yamefikia ni  sana, na mwafrika hawezi kuongea kwa mdomo tu. Hata katika magazeti yetu, m silaha zimeanza kutajwa.    (End…..V)    Wanakenya wote wameonyesha msimamo wao katika jambo hili. Mtukufu Rais, kama kiongozi wa nchi hii, ambaye amechaguliwa kulingana na Katiba ya nchi hii, amesema kwamba hawa watu hawatapata leseni Za kuhotubia wananchi. Kwa hivyo, kuandika"barua za kuomba leseni baada ya Mtukufu Rais kutoa amri hiyo, ni kupuuza amrihiyo. Mtukufu Rais Daniel arap Moi, ndiye kiongozi peke yake katika nchi hii na kupuuza amri yake, ni kama kuwatusi wananchi ambao walimchagua yeye. Huuni uchokozi ambao mvanamume anavumilia kwa mara ya kwanza lakini si kwa maraya pili. Kwa hivyo, wakijaribu kutia vidole mbili juu, basi tutaka kimoja nakubakia kimoja tu. Sisi tumesema wazi kwamba katika Kenya hakuna haja ya kuwana vyama viwili vya kisiasa na wale wanaotaka kukiua chama chetu cha Kanu, ni lazima wafahamu wazi kwamba tutawaua kabla ya wao kutuua.        Kwa hivyo, ni lazima hawa watu wachache waelewe wazi kwamba watu wa Kenya wametosheka na maneno yao ya uwongo na wameamua kukaa imara nyuma ya Mtukufu Daniel arap Moi. Hii si mara ya kwanza ya watu wachache kujitokeza na kujaribu kuharibu amani katika nchi hii. Tangu Mtukufu Daniel arap Moi aliposhika usukani, kuna watu wachache ambo wamekuwa wakijaribu kiuchafua Serikali yetu kwanjia ya kuharibu uchumi wetu au hali ya siasa katika nchi hii,lakini wameshindwa. Eawa watu wangali wako na wamejitokeza ili kuwapotoshawananchi. Nia ya hawa watu kuharibu maisha ya watoto wetu lakini tungetaka kuwaambia wazi kwamba tuko tayari kupambana na wao. Mtukufu Rais wetu ni mtu anayependa amani na kwa vile anamwogopa Mungu,  amejitolea kuyalinda maisha ya watu wa Kenya.        Bw.Naibu Spika wa Muda, hivi majuzi wengine walijitokeza na kusema kwamba watu kadhaa waliuawa katika ghasia zilizotokea hapa Muoroto. Kuna watu wengine ambao wanafikiria maisha ya watu yanaweza kuchukuliwa ovyo ovyo, lakini sisi katika Serikali ya Kenya, tumeamua kwamba tutaendelea kuyalinda maisha yawananchi. Kuna wengine kama Rubia na Matiba ambao wanafahamu wazi kwambasheria za nchi hii ziliwekwa ili kuyalinda maisha ya wananchi. Vile vile, Katiba ya nchi hii ina nia ya kuyalinda maisha yetu. Sijui ni kwa nini wanasahau kwamba katika nchi hii, kuna sheria za kuyalinda maisha ya wananchi.    Vile vile, kuna sheria katika nchi hii ambayo inawalinda wananchi kutokana na uchochezi na unyanganyi. Imesemekana kwamba kune, mwanakenya mmoja ambaye ana ploti 400 katika mji moja wakati wengine hawana pahali pa kuishi. Kila siku, tunawatafutia maskwota katika nchi hii, pahali pa kuishi, lakini tunaposikia kwamba kuna mtu mmoja ambaye ana ploti 400, tunashindwa kuyafahamu mambo haya. Ikiwa yule mtu anayafikiria maisha ya watu wengine, ni kwa nini hawezi kutoa hizo ploti kwa wananchi ili waweze kujenga pahali pa kuishi? Kila wakati Mtukufu Rais amejitolea kufanya michango ya kuwasaidia watoto walemavu, kwa wagonjwa na kadhalika.    Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ni kweli kwamba tangu watu wengine wapewe madaraka ya kuwaongoza wananchi katika sehemu zao mpaka leo, hawajaonyesha hata kidogo kwamba wana nia ya kuwasaidia wanakenya. Hakuna mtoto hata mmoja ambaye wameinpeleka ng'ambo kwa matibabu ya ugonjwa wa moyo au magonjwa mengine. Kila siku Mtukufu Rais anafanya michango na wakati mwingine anatoa pesa kutoka mfukoni mwake ili kuwasaidie wasiojiweza. Hawa watu si wageni katika nchi hii. Wamekuwa Mawaziri katika Serikali hii na wawakilishi wa wananchi katika sehemu- mbali mbali. Ikiwa sasa jambo wanalozungunzia ni la manufaa kwa wananchi, pengine wananchi wangewatetea. Lakini ajabu ni kwamba wananchi hawa haja na maneno ambayo hawa watu wanasema. Ningetaka kumwomba Waziri anayehusiana na mambo ya usalama katika nchi hii ahakikishe kwamba hawa watu wanachukuliwa hatua. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu sheria zetu ni wazi kabisa. Tumeapa hapa katika Bunge hili kwamba tutayalinda maisha ya wananchi kwa kuhakikisha kwamba kuna usalama katika nchi hii. </NEWSPEECH>        END W    HANSARD    Tuesday, 13th June, 1990    The House met at thirty minutes past Two o'clock    /Mr. Deputy Speaker in the Chair/        <HEADER>PRAYERS</HEADER>    <HEADER>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>MR.

DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Kiliku is not here? Let us have Mr. Wambua's Question.</NEWSPEECH><HEADER>Question No. 245Covering of Murram Pit on Plot No. 106</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.WAMBUA asked the Minister for Public Works why his Ministry has not covered the murram pit on plot No. Masii/Mbaani/106, "belonging to Mrs. Monica M. Musumbi, which was dug during the construction of the Machakos-Kitui Road, despite numerous reminders from the complainant addressed to the Chief Engineer (Roads), Nairobi, and the District Roads Engineer, Machakos.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Maiyani): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Ministry is planning to cover the murram pit before the end of July, 1990. It was not possible to cover the pit before due to lack of a bulldozer  which was required for doing the job in that area, which was required for doing the job.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for the information of the Assistant Minister this road was constructed way back in 1960's and the pit has been there from 1963 up to now. Has there not been bulldozers since that time? Could the Assistant Minister tell us why this pit has not been covered for about 30 years?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have an explanationas to why the pit was not covered. Initially many people in thatarea did not want the murrain pit filled in the hope that it would develop into a dam to provide water. It was only after that expectation failed to materialise that they requested that the pitbe filled. However by this time construction equipment had been removed from that area. The nearest bulldozer today is working on an access atthe proposed African Inland Church Teachers' College, Konza. The District Works officer intends to complete the work at Konza bythe end of June, 1990. That is why I have said that this job cannot be completed until July, 1990 - it is the same bulldozer at Konza that we intend to move to this area to cover this murram pit.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think I do not need all this is explanation. My question is specific: When will the Assistant Minister cover this pit? This pit is very dangererous because so far it has claimed the lives of two head cattle. Who will compensate for the loss of these cattle?</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this job will be done in July, 1990 after the bulldozer has completed the work at the proposes African Inland Church Teachers College, Konza. I have also explained that it is not the Ministry' s fault that this pit has not been filled; it is because this particular person wanted the pit to develop into a dam that the Ministry's machinery was moved from there without covering the pit. How that she has changed her mind we have agreed to go back in July, 1990 and do the job.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, is the Assistant Minister aware that in 1979/80 there was a series of correspondence between the complainant and the Ministry officials, including the Permanent Secretary, in which the complainant was requesting the filling of the pit? I have given references of those letters.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is exactly because of that correspondence that we have decided to take the action I have mentioned July,1990.</NEWSPEECH>    END………A    <NEWSPEECH>DR. MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if I heard the hon. Member well, he said that there is corresondence on this subject dating as  far back as 1979/80. If that is so, could the Assistant Minister tell this House why it has taken up to ten years to act on such correspondence? Ten years is a one long decade.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it has taken that long because at first the person wanted a water dam. When he finally said that he wanted the place covered, the machines had been removed from the area and were doing other works elsewhere.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. WAMBUA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. This man had never requested for a dam construction in that area. All he did was to ask the Ministry to cover the pit. Can the Assistant Minister tell us why this pit has not been covered despite the various requests made to the Ministry?</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, my reply is based on records available in the Ministry. After the work at the site was completed, the man expressed his wish to use the pit as a water reservoir and the machinery on site was moved away to do other works.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon. Bidu. The Assistant Minister is dealing with a point of order.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. MAIYANI: As I was saying, when the man wanted the pit covered, the machinery had been moved to do other works elsewhere in the district. It isonly recently that he indicated clearly that he wants the pit covered, and we have obliged. The only hinderance at the moment is that the time is not opportune because the dozer available in the area is engaged in some work at the Africa Independent Church College at Konza, a project which is of importance to the public. We cannot abandon the work to go and cover the pit in question. However, as soon as the work is completed, the dozer will head to Masii.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. WAMBUA: Mr. Deputy  Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister produce any documentary evidence to the effect that this man needed a dam in that particular area? I can produce the letters that have been addressed to the Ministry bythe man indicating that the pit has been a dangerous trap to his livestock. In fact, two head of cattle have been lost in the pit Can he produce his evidence?</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the documents are not at issue in this Question. I have, after all, given an undertaking that this pit is going to be covered in July when we complete working on the Africa Independent Church College, which is an important institution for this nation.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR.

Assistant Minister find a way of getting the assistance of a medical officer since he seems to be sick?</NEWSPEECH>    (Laughter)    <NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Well, do we have anybody from the Attorney-General's Chambers to respond to hon. Bidu's Question? Very well. Let us go back to Dr. Misoi's Question for the second time.</NEWSPEECH>    <HEADER>Question No. 258     Payment of N.S.S.F Dues to Mr. Kimuraei</HEADER>    DR. MISOI asked the Minister for Labour waht has delayed the payment of N.S.S.F. benefits for Mr. Kiptalam Kimuraei, F.M. No. 109-647-424, of P.O. Box 2401, Eldoret.    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. D.M. Amin): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.    Withdrawal benefits for this claimant was applied for on 29th March, 1989. This claimant did not enclose his retirement letter as required by the Fund regulations to enable processing of his benefits. Two letters have been written to him by the Fund, one on 29th March, 1989 and another one on 11th August 1989, requesting him to furnish the Fund with the letter of retirement. Up to now, we do not have the relevant information and we require the retirement letter.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>DR. MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while I do appreciate what the Ministry has done, could the Assistant Minister provide me with copies of these letters so  that I can ascertain whether they were sent to the right address? If two letters have been sent to a person and he has not responded and he has approached me for help, then the best thing for me to do is to get information from the Ministry so that I can help. Can the Assistant Minister give me copies of the two letters he has referred to?</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is no need to give the hon. Member copies of the letters I have referred to. What the claimant needsto do is to bring his letter of retirement to us and, definitely, he will be paid his dues.</NEWSPEECH>                                    <NEWSPEECH>DR. MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are trying to help somebody who has retired and who has applied for his retirement benefits.  If the Assistant Minister insists that they have written two letters to this man, my simple request is that a copy of one of the letters, or both, be given to me so that I can be able to break this puzzle. Since that is the only way I can help this mwananchi, can the Assistant Minister assure me that I can get these copies I am asking for?</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the hon. Member comes to our offices we can give him the copies he is asking for.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. WABUGE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the members who are registered in the Fund are given the numbers and every month money is deducted from them and remitted to the Fund, and in view of the fact that at the end of every year employers send what we call reconciliation to show how much one has contributed, and since it has now become obvious that the Fund appears to be confused, will the Assistant Minister go and streamline the organisation so that people retiring, having attained the age of 55 years, can be able to get their benefits and enjoy them before dying?<NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, some months ago, the Minister for Labour himself issued a statement concerning this issue, and the Ministry is ready to do all it can to assist the concerned wananchi.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister address  himself to the supplementary question raised by hon. Wabuge and stop telling us what the Minister said, because the statement issued by the Minister has nothing to do with the Question before the House?</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, earlier on, I said that we require the Fund claimants to produce their retirement letters simply because it has happened that some people have come forward to claim their dues while still in employment. To ensure that such things do not happen, then it is mandatory that a claimant should produce his retirement letter before he claims his dues.</NEWSPEECH>    	'    <NEWSPEECH>MR.

Assistant Minister ever answer a question correctly?</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Mutiso): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir Would  hon. Bidu apologise to the House for referring to the hon. Assistant Minister as this man?</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Sir, he is not a woman; he is a man,  I apologise for that.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Does hon. Mutiso want the hon. Assistant Minister to deny that he is not a man?</NEWSPEECH>                                <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR  LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Mutiso): Sir, everybody here knows that hon. Ogur is a man, but he has been described by hon. Bidu in an abusive language, and that is why I asked him to withdraw these remarks.</NEWSPEECH>	    <NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon. Bidu has kindly withdrawn the remarks. Do you want to raise a supplementary question, Mr. Wambua?</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. WAMBUA: Yes. Most of the answers we get concerning public health are not true. Last week I asked a Question here about Machakos General Hospital, and the Assistant Minister told me that 400 blankets, 300 bed sheets and 200 pillow cases have been set aside for the hospital but nothing has even been taken to that hospital upto now could he now tell us whether the answer he will given in August will be the same as the answer that he gave me last week?</NEWSPEECH>    END……C                                                                    <NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: The answer, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, is yes.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. MWANZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I am seeking your guidance with regard to the type of answers that this particular Assistant Minister gives to Questions asked in this House. It has been the practice of the Assistant Minister to give misleading answers to the House and I am seeking guidance from the Chair regarding this matter. We have been leftin a very awkward position when	, instead of  being given proper answers to questions, we are given misleading answers. Hon. Wambua has quoted a very important example where he has been told by the same Assistant Minister that blankets and pillow covers have been delivered to a hospital in his area, only to go there and find that these items have not been sent there. Similarly, an there is an ambulance in a hospital in my area which has been "broken down for a long time and when I asked a Question here, I was told by this same Assistant Minister that the ambulance is on the road. Our people are now laughing  at us and I do not think that this is good for the dignity of this House. This House must be dignified by being given the correct answers to questions.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Ogur, of course, you do realize that this is a very serious matter.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have clearly informed the House that my Ministry will open the maternity ward at Kakamega Provincial General Hospital, in August, and it is not yet August. Secondly, with regard to the Question at one time asked  by hon. Wambua, I said that the blankets and the required linen, were delivered at the Machakos General Hospital. The hon. Member does not stay at the hospital and he cannot come here to say that the blankets have not reached the hosptal.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>DR. MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, when we ask Questions in this House, we do so on behalf of the wananchi whom we represent and we do this in public interest. Therefore, the answers that we get to these questions must  be as correct as possible and therefore, the Assistant Minister cannot dodge such a simple question as, when was this maternity wing completed? Instead of giving the House the correct reply, the Assistant Minister says that he needs to consult the records to know the answer. I think this is                                                        ridiculous. Could the Chair, please, direct this particular Assistant Minister to answer questions as they have been put to him?</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this particular maternity ward was completed at the end of May this year and will be opened in August thisyear. Secondly, I did indicate that the blankets in question were delivered to Machakos District Hospital this year.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am surprised to hear the answer from the Assistant Minister, namely that the maternity ward was completed in May this year. I have with me here, the minutes of the Provincial Monitoring which say that Committee in Kakamega which sat on the 2nd April, 1990, which say that the Committee was surprise to learn that the 100 bed new maternity ward in Kakamega Provincial General Hospital has not been opened for use although construction work was completed over six months ago. Was this maternity ward completed six months ago or in May this year?</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, any layman may think that this maternity ward. is complete just by looking at the building, rut when you go inside to look at the details, you find there are various items that are needed before the ward can be opened for use. It was during a meeting held on 6th June, this year, that it was confirmed that this maternity ward is now complete and the necessary equipment will be delivered in august this year.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Mutiso): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Hon. Dr. Wameyo has read from a certain document -which probably is not a public document which means this House may not be able to ascertain whether what he is reading is correct. Therefore, can he lay this document on the Table for us to see?</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to inform the hon. Member and the House that I am a Member of the Provincial. Monitoring Committee in Kakamega and what I was reading from are the minutes of this Committee. For all intents and purposes, the provincial commissioner, the district commissioner, myself and others fran the ministry of Health who are Members of this Committee cannot be considered to be laymlen. The truth of the matter is that we are able to know whether a building is complete or not and that what                                is missing is probably just a bad. In this particular case what was missing was the equipment but the building was fully complete. At the same time, there were no beds for patients nor were there any delivery equipment and water was not flowing in the pipes. What we are interested in hearing from the Assistant Minister is an assurance in this House that equipment and the necessary line will be delivered to the maternity ward and that it will be opened in August. If by 1st September, this maternity ward will not be opened, we would demandan explanation from the Ministry.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Mutiso): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the hon. Dr. Wameyo is trying to dodge my point of order. It is required by our Standing Orders that if any hon. Member quotes or reads from a document, he should lay document on the table if it is not a public document. Therefore,could hon. Dr. Wameyo could you lay the document he was reading from on the Table. Dr. Wameyo lay the document on the Table?</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR.DEPUTY SPEAKER: Yes, hon. Mutiso happens to be right, Dr. Wameyo.Could you lay that document on the Table.</NEWSPEECH>    (Dr. Wameyo laid the document on the Table)    <NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: All these facts added together, prove that this maternity ward is complete and therefore, I have not been misleading the House in any way as had been alleged earlier on.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPE.AK:ER: Okay, shall we move on now to the next Order.</NEWSPEECH>    <HEADER>COMMITTEE OF WAYS MID MEANS</HEADER>    (Order for Committee read)    <HEADER>MOTION</HEADER>    THAT, Mr. Speaker do now leave the Chair    (The Vice-President and Minister for Finance on 5.6.90)     (Resumption of Debate interrupted on 12.6.90)     (Third Day of the Budget Debate)<NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI :On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there being no hone Member wishing to speak, would I be in order to propose thatthe Mover be now called upon to reply?</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>HON. MEMBERS: Oh No! No !</NEWSPEECH>            <NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: It appears that bon. Members are gathering their thoughts.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. M'Mukindia): Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to the Budget Dabate. Let me first of all take this opportunity to join my colleagues in congratulating His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for presenting a really far-sighted Budget Which lays down key economic policies that this Country is going to follow over the next couple of years.</NEWSPEECH>            END D                                                                    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. M'Mukindia) (Ctd.): The main emphasis of the Budget is export promotion, and I believe that most Kenyans, especially leaders in all sectors of the economy, politics and social welfare, should look into this area and ask ourselves what we can do in order to encourage the promotion of exports. In this respect, we must realize that the policies that have been laid down will take time to take root, and probably even longer to bear fruit. Therefore, there is hard work to be done on the part of all Kenyans, especially business leaders, to ensure that these policies actually take root and bear fruit for the benefit of this country.    Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, one of the key areas of our society-onwhich we have not heard much comment regarding the economic policies followed by this country is trade union movements. In order for the export promotion effort to bear fruit, trade unions must also come in and play their full part. We know that unemployment, for example, has been one of our biggest problems and that there has been a tendency on the part of trade unions to worry too much about the conditions under which those who are employed work, but little or hardly anything is said about our efforts to create employment for those who are unemployed. This may be understandable because trade union officers are, in away, employed by those who are already working. However, I think trade unionleaders should take it upon themselves to look around, ask questions and encourage business leaders to look into the possibility of creating more employment for those Kenyans who are unemployed.    The Budget has also laid emphasis on revamping the financial sector, and we must congratulate the Vice-President and Minister for Finance on what he has done so far to encourage the growth of capital markets through the recent changes that he has proposed on unity trust and increased liquidity in terms of bearer certificates relating either to local or foreign currency.    The other item that has been discouraging investment has been withholding tax, and the Vice-President and Minister for Finance has said thatany withholding tax will be a final tax. Therefore, all these measures taken together indicate that in the long term, this Budget will not only increase                                        investments in this country, but also encourage the economy to be more vibrant, using our limited resources more efficiently than before. Therefore, all of us should give maximum support to the policies enumerated in the Budget Speech.    While that is true, we must also know that this country has gone through a very difficult time economically and that we have to tighten our belts, appreciating that these policies are not going to bear fruit tomorrow. We must encourage wananchi and tell them that a lot of work is being done to ensure that although employment and the economy are going to grow, this will take a bit of time. In the meantime, we are in for a period of difficulties, but this is passing because the Government has taken appropriate action to ensure that in the long term our people get employment and our economy grows.    The rural-urban balance can only be sustained by creating more investments in rural areas. Once again, what a rural investor can import without paying import tax is only the value of Shs.20 million. While we appreciate what the Vice-President and Minister for Finance has done, it istrue that Shs.20 million today is not a lot of money, and we must encourage the Vice-President and Minister for Finance to go even further to improve the value of what rural investors can import in terms of capital goods without paying duty. I believe that a figure of about Shs.50 million would be more appropriate, especially when we look at the way things are becoming more expensive every day. In so far as rural investment is concerned, one may wonder what the role of such institutions as the Development Finance Company of Kenya, the Industrial Development Bank, the Kenya Industrial Estates, and so on, is except for a few of them, most of these institutions, including the Development Finance Company of Kenya, the Industrial Development Bank and, to some extent, the Kenya Industrial Estates and the Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation, are based in Nairobi. I have had occasion to talk to some of the officers in these institutions, and found that they hardly know anything about rural areas. Being are presentative of a rural constituency, I have also put questions to people as to whether they have ever heard of the Development Finance Company of                                        Kenya, the Industrial Development Bank, and so on, and they can help them. Almost invariably, most wananchi, including some fairly big businessmen who, although they may not have had a lot of  education, have proved their financial and management ability by setting up industries in rural areas, do not know that such institutions exist.	    Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I· think time has come for these institutions to go out into rural areas to sell their services. It is most inappropriate for such big financial institutions as the Development Finance Company of Kenya and the Industrial Development Bank to have several lines of credit from foreign countries, which may raise say Shs.10 million, Shs.20 million or more and the money is never utilized. This has been the case with some of these financial institutions. You find people in rural areas visiting commercial banks insearch of Shs.5 million or Shs.20 million to finance their businesses. I think time has come for each of these institutions to go out and sell their services more actively. Their sitting here in Nairobi will not help to increase and promote investments in this country nor will it create employment in rural areas. I would, therefore, appeal to the Office of the Vice-President and Minister of Finance to make sure that these institutions wake up.    Just to highlight one of the points here, recently, the Ministry of Industry carried out some seminars throughout rural towns in which a lot of questions were asked. In Meru, for example, the Permanent Secretary was asked several questions regarding what the Ministry of Industry does to encourage investments. The kind of questions that were asked clearly high lighted the ignorance of the people in rural areas, and that was unfortunate because the Ministry has officers sitting here in Nairobi and getting fat salaries who are not really doing very much. Time has come when each of us has to playa role, and I think political leaders in this case, Ministers, Assistant Ministers and other hon. Members should take the first step to encourage all officers to go out to ensure that people know what is available so that we may create employment.    End E                                            Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are also grateful to the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance for the interest it has continued to show in parastatals. We know that lack of proper financial control has been a problem. But really it is accountability that is the key to all these politics. This is because accountability in management, whether in the civil Services or the private sector is what will determine the level of confidence that the investors, local or foreign, will have in those areas of investment. If, for example, I have no confidence in a given company and this company floats shares, there is a no reason for me to go and buy those shares. Therefore unless I am assured that the managers of that organization are accountable and straight forward I will not buy shares in that company. I would therefore like to urge the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance to look into this problem. I Place a lot of emphasis on this matter because I believe it is the basis for everything; It is basis for our success in the future. If we are unable to ensure accountability in the management of all our sectors, then no matter how good some of these process are, we may not succeed as well as we should. It is not just in parastatatals and the Civil Services where accountability should be shown but also in the private sector. The mangers there must be properly accountable; they must not misuse public funds which in as shares or other securities.    Mr. Deputy Speaker,Sir, again, none of these policies will succeed if we do not have a stable political environment now in the future. This is because no investment bears fruits within a day. This means that if I have to invest money today I expect that in 10 year’s time that money will still be secure and I will be reaping fruits from that investment. Therefore what we must stand for is stability in the short and in the long term – Political and economic stability, now and in the long term.                                                    Therefore, the political policies that we have such as having a single- party system, one president, one country must be supported by all. This is because this is what will ensure long term  stability in this country. Anything that can cause divisions amongst us and anything that can shake the base of our stability should be discouraged in all ways. All leaders should come out in full force against those forces that try to destabilize this country.     Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Must also realize that the amount patriotism we have in this country is great. Some people mistakenly believe that they can easily shake the base of the stability of this country. As of now all the people in this country believe they are Kenyans and this is because they are Kenyans. Sometime ago there are a problem in the country because not everybody in Kenyan thought he was as Kenyan. You may have been within the borders but I know that in some cases some people within Kenyan borders say “We are going to Kenya” although they are actually in Kenya. Therefore we must ensure that in all cases every one of us, small or big, tall or short, gets an equal opportunity. This is because it is only then that we can be sure that all the children in this country have equal opportunities, whether they come from East, North West or South. That is absolutely important.    With those few remarks, I beg to support.</NEWSPEECH>                                                                <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Onyancha) : Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chance to contribute on this Debate at this stage. I would like to begin by congratulating his excellency the Vice-President and minister foe finance for presenting a very balanced 1990/91 Budget. This Budget is indicative of the stability that we have in this country. This means we have time to sit down and plan our own affairs including economic  affairs.    	I also take this opportunity to thank his excellency the president for ensuring that we have stability in this country with in which we able to do our things in our own way. I also wish to take this opportunity to mention one or two points here. With Regard to the on-going debate on the multiparty system let me say that it is not an accident that Kenya is a one party state. We starts with many parties in his country. We experimented with them and slowly we found out that they were not working. Our people, through this supreme house, decided to change the system. The matter was discussed and the people finally decided that the other political parties should be done away with. These parties wound themselves up voluntarily. Those who were in the opposition like the defunct Kenya African Democratic Union crossed the Floor and joined the only existing party today and that is Kanu. This came about because people had time to think about the system; they had the time to experiment with many parties. They finally found out that the system and found that it was not working. So, through the wishes of the people Kenya became a one Party state. During the current debate on the multi-party system, Some people have expressed the views to the effect that when we talk of a one-party State we are not Democratic                                                            That is not correct. We are a one-party State but we are a very democratic state because this is what our people want. We have reached where we have reached because our people want. We have reached where we have reached because our people have so decided through various institutions including this House.    	So, Mr. Deputy Speaker,Sir, it becomes very, very distributing when we find that some people in this country are trying to use the prevailing situation this debate about multi parties to try and destabilize our country. I would like to take this opportunity to say that the Government should be on the  alert and it should not take what is taking place now lightly. If you look closely what the C.P.K Clergymen are doing today, you will find that they are not acting like people who do not know what they are doing. They are people who are carrying out a plan which they are doing. They are people who are carrying out a plan which they have devised carefully with others. They have been given instructions on how to go about this business. What happens is that this week you will find one clergymen from another angle will speak on a similar matter from a different approach. They are very system and this is why I am saying that we the majority in this country and who are supporters of our party , should stand up and speak with care. I say this because sometimes it appears as if it is we who are giving these people ammunition with which to hit us. We are not careful in what we say.            END F                                                    Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that when a leader in this country standsup and says something, he should first try to foresee the consequences of what he is going to say. This is because the normal thing is that when one does something he should expect to see results of that thing. So, when one is about to speak he would foresee that something is going to happen which will make him couch his language. Even when somebody has something good to say, he should ensure that it does not provoke anybody and create uncalled for criticisms.    It is disturbing to note that clergymen are using the pulpit to attack our system of Government. I think they have gone a long way towards that direction. We are not trying to threaten anybody since in this country people have the freedom of speech; but we also know that this has a limit. Whena person says things that incite a society, then he is going beyond the limits of freedom of speech. Those who are talking at the moment know very well about this. There is a certain member of the church who has been insisting that eight people died in Muoroto. Although he has been asked to produce evidence to prove his case, he has been unable to do so. But unfortunately, he still insists that he is right. He has further said that the truth will come out; what truth will come out of what does not exist? If people had died in Muoroto, then there is bound to be evidence to prove that. If he does not have that evidence then he should shut up his mouth. He cannot claim that the what he is saying is religious because religion requires that everybody, including the clergy should tell the truth. If he is not fulfilling that religious requirement, then he is on to something quite different. What could that something be? I believe it could be that he is trying to fulfill a large grand plan to try and destabilize the country.                                                        Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the time has come when we shouldsay that enough is enough. Although we are not threatening anybody, if a person goes that far and there is evidence to that effect, he should be prosecuted andI believe the time has come when he should be. These people have a forum of reaching our people, that is, through the pulpit. So, we should not try to under estimate what they are telling the people. This is because even the well educated people still believe that a clergyman cannot lie. So, when people are exposed to clergymen like in churches time and time again, they will come to believe that these clergymen are telling the truth when they are not. I therefore believe that these clergymen should be controlled by the law of the land which governs each and every person, be he a clergyman or layman.    Apart from that I believe also that the time has come when leaders in this country, especially those in responsible positions, should clearly to be counted. Each person should declare his stand. Even in this House every Minister, Assistant Minister and Back-bencher who supports the Government should stand up to be counted. This will show us truthfully those who are justsitting on the fence. This is not the time for anyone to sit on the fence. This is the time for every leader to support the Government and His Excellency the President.    With those few remarks, I support.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR RECLAMATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF ARID, SEMIARID AND WASTELANDS (Mr. Mokku): Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika, kwa kunipatianafasi hii ini nijiunge na wenzangu kusema mach ache juu ya Bajeti hii Kwanzakabisa ningependa kumpongeza Makamu wa Rais na Waziri wa Fedha kwa Bajeti yake ya mwaka huu. Bajeti hii kwa kweli imeyaangalia sana maslahi ya wananchi wote. Pia nina amini kuwa baada ya Bajeti hii hakutakuwa na mini-budgets zozote.    Baada ya hayo ningependa kusema machache juu ya msimamo wa Chama chetu cha Kanu. Sote tumesoma magazetini na kusikia redioni kuwa kuna watu wachache ambao wanataka kuanzisha vyama vingine vya kisiasa hapa nchini. Msimamo                                            wetu viongozit ki kuwa na Chama kimoja tu cha Kanu. Huu ndio msimamo wa watu wa Kenya. Sasa ninashangaa kuwa baada ya hayo bado kuna watu wachache ambao wana ongea juu ya mpango wa kuwa na vyama vingi katika nchi hii. Ningependa kujiunga na wenzangu waliokuwa wakisema kuwa watu hawa wanajaribu kuwapotosha wananchiwa nchi hii. Mtu wa dini ni mtu ambayp kazi yake ni kuwaongoza kidini wananchi na pia kutokana na hayo huaminiwa sana na wananchi. Lakini utashangaa sana kuona mtu wa dini akisema maneno ya uwongo ambako anawapotosha wananchi. Je, mtu kamahuyu anawezaje kuaminiwa na watu?    Bw. Naibu Spika, ningependa kuchukua nafasi hii kusema kuwa mtu wadini kama huyu akiendelea na mtindo kama huo baadaye atakosa watu katika kanisa lake. Je, kama kasisi amesema kuwa watu wanane waliuawa na akiambiwa adhibitishe hawezi, si huyu mtu anasema uwongo? Msimamo wetu kama viongozi ni kuonyesha kuwa watu kama hawa wana nia mbaya. Labda haja yao kubwa ni kuleta misukosuko katika nchi hii. Na pia ningependa kusisitiza kuwa tusione shida inatujia halafu tukaena kungojea itujie. Ni lazima sisi viongozi tuwe katika msitari wa mbelena kutafuta njia za kuwachukulia hatua watu kama hawa. Kulingana na sheria zanchi hii mtu akisema uwongo, kunazo njia za kuuliza ni kwa nini anasema uwongo, kunazo njia za kuuliza ni kwa nini anasema uwongo. Pia tuna uwezo wa kumuuliza audhibitishe uwongo huo.    Wale wanaotaka mfumo wa vyama vyingi inafaa wafahamu kuwa nchi hiioi huru na tunajitawala wenyewe.        END        G…..                                                    Sisi hatuna mtu mwingine yeyote ambaye tunamtegemea atuongoze. Sisi tunajua vile tunavyofanya na tunafanya hivyo kwa manufaa ya wananehi wote.    Jambo la kwanza, Bw. Naibu Spika, mi kwanba yafaa sisi viongozituwe na nidhamu Ingefaa tuwe na nidbamu katika kuongea, kutenda na pengine katika kazi yote ambayo tunafanya. Ni vibaya kiongozi aki tamka kusema jambo fulani lifanyike na pengine hajui matokeo yake yatakuwa namna gani. Kwa hivyo, sisi kama viongozi, kitu cha kwanza, ingefaa tuchunge ulimi wetu. Kwa mfano, Waziri ama Waziri Msaidizi akitamka kitu, anaongea kwa niaba ya Serikali na pengine anatoa maoni yake binafsi hata bila kufikiria ubaya ama uzuri wake. Kwa hivyo, yafaa sisi viongozi tujihadhari sana na maneno yetu wakati tunapozungumza.    Kuhusu uchumi, Bw. Naibu Spika, nafikiri katika Jamhuri hii yetu ya Kenya hali ya upandaji wa gharama ya maisha (inflation) imepunguka kutoka asi1imia 13 hadi asilimia 9. Kwa hivyo,nafikiri ni lazima tujipongeze sisi wenyewe katika Jamhuri yetu ya Kenya tukiwa nchi moja katika barala Afrika kwa kuwa tuko katika halinzuri kiuchumi. Kwa hivyo, ni lazima tujisifu ili hawa watu ambao wanaongea mambo ya vyama vingi waone kwamba sisi tunaendelea vizuri kuliko vile wanavyofikiria.    Kuhusu mambo ya upangaji wa uzazi, Bw. Naibu Spika, tumepunguza cuguzekola uzazi kutoka asilimia 4.8 hadi asilimia 3.1. Hii ni kuonyesha kwamba tunatimiza ule mwito wa upangaji wa uzazi, na ningewc himiza wananchi tuendelee namna hiyo.    Pia, nafikiri yafaa mitaje machache kuhusu vile Serikali ya Mtukufu Rais imewafanyia wananchi wake katika kila wilya wa kila ya meando ya wilaya imepatiwa pesa kama KSh. 150 milioni za kusaidia wafanyabiasha va wadogo wadogo.                                                    Kwa hivyo, ingefaa wale watu wanaozungumza hapa na pale wajue kwamba Serikali ya Mtukufu Rais inampatia kila mmoja nafasi ya kujiendesha mbele. Pia, hali nzuri ya usalama dhabiti katika Jamhuri hii imewafanya watu wengine walete rasilmali yao hapa. Kwa hivyo, ni lazima sisi wananchi tujivune kwamba sisi tunaishi katika nchi moja ya amani, upendo na umoja.    Bw. Naibu Spika, bila kusahau, ningependa kuwapongeza Waislamu katika Jamhuri hii yetu ya Kenya. Tumesikia wengine wakisema hivi na vile. Lakini hadi sasa msimamo wa Waislamu katika Jamhuri hii ni kusaidia na kuiunga mkono Serikali hii,na ningependa hata dini nyingine ziige mfano wa waislamu, hasa wakristo wa dhehebu la church of the Province of Kenya (C.P.K).Kwa hivyo, ningependa  kuwapongeza waislamu katika jamhuri hii ya Kenya na ningewahimize waendelee kuiunga mkono serikali na chama cha Kanu. Ningewahimiza waendelee kuiunga mkono Serikali na Chama cha Kanu.    Ahsante sana,Bw. Naibu Spika.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Mwenje): Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity.    In support of this Budget Speech, I would like to take the opportunity, first of all, to thank His Excellency the President for appointing me an Assistant Minister in his Government. I would like to assure him and the House that I will serve this country, the Ministry and the President with all my total loyalty without any reservations. I can assure him that I am prepared to go even further to make sure that in the service of this nation, the little that I can contribute, will be contributed to the maximum.    Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in support of the Budget which was very fair and encouraging, there are a few sections                                                 which are really worth noting because the Vice-president and Minister for Finance was very realistic this time. Insteadof increasing the price of certain commodities, he went to the realities of amending tariffs and areas where we had loopholes and where revenue had been lost. In that way, the collection of this revenue will depend on the efficiency of our officers whom we hope will heed the call by the Vice-President and Minister for finance it will not serve any useful purpose if the amendments are done and the efficiency remains low. We must appeal to our officers in the revenue collection sector to see to it that there is efficiency in the collection of revenue so that the Government realizes all the funds that are due to, and so that we are able to get all the services.    I wish to cite the Customs Tariff where the Vice-President and Minister for Finance says that goods that are kept in thebonded warehouses should be allowed to go to the bonded factories so that the raw materials can be used and we do not have to waste all that time that has otherwise been wasted. Time is also money! We have wasted a lot of time between the areas of the bonded ware houses and bonded factories. So, this loophole which has now beenfilled will assist quite a lot. Also, the section of the Value Added Tax: (V.A.T.) will help quite a lot. The Treasury Bills will also assist quite a lot. Instead of the Vice-President and Minister for Finance having to attract Treasury Bills from the banking sector, he went out of his way to attract. Them from individuals. So, it is up to the Central Bank of Kenya now to see that this is now implemented properly. Those people with money should hoy! buy Treasury Bills from the Central Bank. The Central Bank alsoshouldgo out of its way to do some kind of marketing to individuals who have money. This is a very, encouraging affair and I hope the Central Bank will take it seriously and go                                                        out now to do marketing of this business.    this was a very fair Budget and we hope that it will go along way to assist the public. Everybody was happy about it. It did not affect us so much. In fact, all it did was to close down all the loopholes where Government had been losing money. In so doing, it becomes a very encouraging Budget and we hope that the officers and the public, will reciprocate. Those who are suppose to pay tax should now pay  because they have seen the fairness of the Government.     Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the infrastructure of country economy depends on peace in that country. As the President said, this country has been able to succeed because we have had peace so far.                                                                                So it is important for us to tell off those who think they can spoil peace in this country; those who think that they will mess up the stability of this country. Messrs. Rubia and Matiba themselves Know the importance of peace in this country; those who think that they will mess up the stability of this country. Messrs. Rubia and Matiba themselves know the importance of peace in this country and yet they are trying to advocate for chaos in this country. They are so defiant that even after the President said in his address at Embu that they will not be given licences, they went ahead to completed application forms and presented them to the Nairobi Provisional Commissioner asking to be allowed to address public meetings. Let them know that even if they were given those licenses nobody in Nairobi will attend their meetings.    One wonders why some of them who have in the past been defending the party are now trying to antagonize the party. One would certainly conclude that they are doing this because they are no longer doing this for themselves but on behalf of their foreign masters, who want to see chaos in this country. They applied for the licences even after the President had declared his stand in order to justify the receipt of what they were promised by their masters; they want to be in a position to ask for it on the grounds that they  applied for the licences,but they were refused,    So,Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I agree with those ,who say these people are upto something and must tell us what their motive is. If they interfere with peace in this country, then legal action mustbe taken against them. because they do not have the support of anybodyin Nairobi, Central Province or anywhere else for that matter. They should tell their foreign masters that they have failed and will not even succeed in future and ask to be given what they were promised on that understanding.    While I do not like confrontation with church leaders, butI want to tell some of them that when you point at somebody with one                                            finger, three other fingers point at you. So, those church leaders who have been pointing a finger at the Government should first ofall tell us how clean they themselves are. I have no qurrel with somebody like Rev. Njenga, but I wonder how he can say that people died at Muoroto While Muoroto residents went to a policestation reported loss of sufurias, spoons and plates. How would onefail to report to the police the death of his relative? Rev. Njenga should know that the country still waits to know how his wife met her death, Whose death is still a mystery. To me he is just being haunted by his wife’s death.    Mr. Dputy Speaker, Sir,we also know the relationship between those talking about multi-parties and the church leaders: We know that Rubia's son is married to the daughter of the archbishop ofthe Church of the Province of Kenya. This is why they are bound to defend one another in this dubious affair.    Without those few remarks, I beg to support.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. TUVA: Ahsante san, Bw. Naibu Spika, kwa kunipatia hii ili nami niseme machache. Ningependa kumpongeza Makamu wa  Rais na waziri wa Fedha kwa Bajeti ya mvaka huu awbayo haikuwaumiza vananchi kama zile za miaka iliyopita. Ningependa aendelee na kuwatoza kodi zaidi matajiri na kuwapunguzia mzigo wa kulipa kodi wananchi maskini.    Vile vile ninazipongeza nchi za Cameroon and Misri ambazo zinaliwakilisha Bara la Africa katika  mashindano ya soka yakombe la dunia.Hadi sasa wameonyesha kwaba Bara hili linawezakutoa wachezaji mashuhuri. Ningependa kuyaomba magazeti yazidi kusaidia katika kueneza moyo wa kupenda michezo katika nchi hii. Ninafikiri magazeti ni "adui" mkubwa wa ustawi wa michezo. Hii ni kwa. sababu yakiona udhaifu kidogo katika. michezo, hasa hapanchini, yanapenda kuandika mambo mabaya sana kuhusu michezo; ningeyaomba yageuze nia yao.                                                BW. Naibu Spika, katika siku chache zilizopita kuraekuwa na vifo vingi katika barabara zetu. Kwa hivyo, ingawa Serikali imejaribu kuchukua hatua fulani kuhusiana na matatu na mabasi, ningeomba, kana inawyezekana, tuanzisae majadiliano kupitia katika magazeti ili kuona kama tunaweza kupata njia nyingine ya kupunguza ajali za barabarani. Katika siku moja unaweza kuona matatu mbili zimepata ajali katika barabara moja na kuua zaidi ya watu sita. Nihuzuni kubwa kwa nchi hii kuona kwamba watu wengi wanapoteza maisha yao sababu ya uendeshaji magari bila ya uangalifu wakutosha. Kwa nini ajali hizi zinatokea? Wakati mwingine viongozi hutoa sababu ambazo sizo za kweli. Ninafikiri jambo moja linalozidisha ajali barabarani ni kwamba matajiri huwataka madesva vvao wa matatu wawaletee kiasi fulani cha pesa nao madreva waveke kiasicha pesa kinachosalia. kwa hivyo, ninafikiri tunaweza kuwa na majadiliano zaidi ili kuona kama tunaweza kuzipunguza ajali barabarani.        Wakati huu tunaongea juu ya utozaji wa kodi, ambao ulipwa na matajiri na maskini pia, ili Serikali ipate pesa, ningepend Treasury itafute njia inayoweza kutumia na kupata pesa nyingi  za Harambee ambazo hazifanyiwi kazi. Si semi kwaaba tuvunje mpangowa Harambee. Lakini Makamu wa Rais and Waziri wa Fedha anavweza kutafuta watu wenye ujuzi  kama yeye - na si kama nisi iliwaangalie vile Serikali inavyovzeza kupata kodi zaidi kutokana napesa ambazo zimewekvva na vvatu Wengineo        Wakati huu utalii unatupaitia pesa nyingi Kuliow kahawa nachai. Kwa hivyo, ningependa Serikali ione kwamba vifaa vinavyowavutia watalii ni vya hali ya juu. Hii ni kwa sababu kuna wasiwasi kwamba pengine tutazipoteza nafasi za utalii kwa nchi nyingine njirani au kwa nchi  nyingine za bar a nyingine.    Vile vile, ningependa kupendekeza kwamba Juaiba la Mikutano la Kenyatta lisimamiwe kwa njia ambayo itaruhusu wale wanaofanya mikutano yao ya mwaka au baada ya miaka minne waveze kukutana hapo. Tunataka mikutano mingi iwezekanavyo ifanyike katika Jumba la Mikutano la Kenyatta kwa sababu kuna nchi nyingine katika bara hili ambazo zinajaribu kujenga mabaraza ambayo yanajaribu kushindana na Jumba hili letu. Kwa arfano, katika Jiji la Harare kuna jumba la mikutano zuri sana, na watu wa nchi ya Zimbabwe wanajaribu kuuza juaiba hilo lao kushindana nasi Katika Jiji la Abidjan kuna juaiba lingine ambalo, ijapokuwa ni dogo, linalojaribu kushindana na Jumba la Mikutano la Kenyatta. Ikiwa kutakuwa na nyumba nyingine za mikutano ambazo zitajengwa katika bara la Afrika, basi tutapoteza nafasi nyingi. Kwa hivyo, ningependa Serikali ijaribu kuhakikisha kwamba vifaa vya kuvutia watu kuja hapa Kenya vimezidi kuongezwa ndiposa tupate wageni zaidi.        Bw. Naibu Spika barabara katika mbuga za wanyama zinafaa kuwa zikisimamiwa vizuri, hasa katika eneo la pwani ambalo linavutia watalii sana. Lakini barabara katika eneo hilo zimejaa mashimo na nyingine huwa hazipitiki. Kwa mfano, barabara No. C103 - Malindi hadi Tsavo East huwa haipitiki kabisa na mara nyingi watalii wamekuwa wakirudi njiani kwa sababuhawawezi kupita kwenda katika mbuga za wanyama. Hata uwanja wa ndege wa Malindi unafaa kuangaliwa sana kwa sababu huwa unatumiwa sana na watalii kutoka ng'ambo. Tungependa uwanja huo ufikiriwe sana na Serikali ili uwekwe katika hali nzuri na ndege kubwa ziweze kutua huko badala ya watalii kuwa wakija Nairobi halafu kupelekwa huko kwa ndege ndogo. Watalii wengi huchoka sana inavyofanyika hivyo na kuvunjika moyo na kukosa kurudi hapa tena.        Bw. Naibu Spikawakati wa Bajeti tunafikiria vile Serikali inavyo weza kupata pesa, na ningependa kusema kwaaiba Serikali inaweza kupata pesa kutoka kwa wananchi ambao wana mapato mazuri na ambao wanalipa kodi bila kuumia kwa kununua vitu vingi. Utakuta kwamba katika eneo la pwani kuna shida la maskwata ambalo tulianza kulizungvunzia hata kabla ya Uhuru. Ningependa Serikali ichukue wakati na kuliangalia tatizo hilo. Watu wengine katika Nairobi hufikiria kwamba shida                                                        la maskwata katika Mkoa wa Pwani linatatuliwa na mofisa wa Utawala wa Mikoa, lakini hao maofisa hawana mawongozo kamili. Kwa hivyo, ningependa Serikali iwe na mkao wa kuzunguaiza mambo haya. Ikiwa maofisa wa Ofisi ya Rais hawawezi kuketi na kuzungumza na kutoa mwelekezo utakaofuatwa, basi chama cha Kanu kinaweza kufanya kazi hiyo katika Governing Council au katika delegates' conference. Jambo hili la maskwata linaleta matatizo na hata watoto wengi hawawezikwenda shule kwa sababu wazazi wao hawana njia yoyote ya kujipatia mapato.        Bw. Naibu Spika kila mawaka sisi watu wa Mkoa wa Pwani tunaaaibiwa kwaaiba tunalia, lakini utaona kwamba kilio chetu kina sababu nzuri. Kwa hivyo, ningependa kutoa mifno mitatu hapa ambapo mambo yameharibikia machoni mwa Serikali. Kwanza, nataka kutaja ule mtambo wa maziwa wa Mariakani ambao ulikuwa inasimamiwa na Serikali. Mtambo huo ulikuwa ukihudumia wilaya za Kilifi na Kwale na uliharibika kwa sababu ya usimamizi mbaya wa Serikali. Pili, kiwanda cha sukari cha Ramisi kiliharibika na watu wengi wakapoteza nafasi zao za kazi. Nina hakika kwamba kuna pesa nyingi sana ambazo Serikali ilidhamini katika kiwanda cha Ramisi, na kikiharibika inakuwa si vizuri. Kwa hivyo, yafaa Serikali ichukue hatua kuona kwamba mtambo huu umefufuliwa ili watu wa sehemu hizo wapate kazi na pia wakulima wa miwa waweze kulipwa kwa mavuno yao.        Miwa si kama maharagwe au mahindi kwaaiba utapanda na uvune baada ya wakati mfupi; miwa ni mmea ambo hukomaa baada yaaiuda mrefu. Kwa hivyo, hakuna jambo lolote ambalo linaweza kufanyiwa miwa iliyopandwa wakati mrefu kidogo ulio pita isipokuwa kutafutiwa soko. Utakuta kwamba watu wengi wamefutwa kazi katika kiwanda cha sukari cha Ramisi na watoto wao hawawezi kwenda shule. Vile vile, wakuliaia waliokuwa wamepanda miwa katika mashamba aiadogo aiadogo ili kuweza kuiuza katika kiwanda hicho kwa sasa hawana aiapato yoyote.        Mfano wa tatu ambo ningetaka kutoa ni wa kiwanda cha korosho. Kiwanda hicho kilijengwa pamoja na halmashauri mbali mbali za Serikali. Wakuliaia walipokuwa na chaaia cha ushirika cha Kilifi walifanya bidii sana na kununua hisa katika mtambo huo hadi kufikia 35 kwa mia, na rekodi ziko kuonyesha hivyo ni kweli. Lakini mambo                                                mengi yanafanywa na Serikali kwa wakati huu bila kuwahusisha .wenye hisa ambao wana onekana kwamba hawana nguvu au uwezo. Serikali ndiyo inayokata shauri itafanya jambo gani. Kwa sasa nasikia Serikali inataka kuongeza hisa, na ninafikiri kwamba sababu yake ni kuaifanya yule aikuliaia aidogo ambaye ana hisa katika mtambo huu aone kane ni duni na hisa zake zinunuliwe kwa nguvu.    Kwa hayo machache, Bw. Naibu Spika , naunga mkono.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR TECHNICAL TRAINING AND APPLIED TECHNOLOGY (Prof. Ongeri): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I take this opportunity to associate myself with the excellent Budget which was presented by His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for finance to this august House. Economic stability must be a pre-condition to political stability. Without political stability, it would be virtually impossible to run and effect programmes which have a direct benefit to the consumer, in this case, the mwananchi. It is this political stability that this august House is concerned about.        [Mr. Deputy Speaker left the Chair]    [the Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Tuva) took the Chair]        Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are concerned about political stability because we feel that there are a few individuals who have renegaded to themselves the authority and the power to execute what they think is fair to them at the expense of the majority. As elected Members of this august House, we cannot stand idle guessing or watching a few hundful individuals twisting this nation to the chorus of their masters. This chorus does not sound music to us; it is a strange chorus which is not in unison with the chorus of Kenyans. The chorus of Kenyans is unity, basic development and love for their President. That is the chorus of Kenya. That other chorus, to me, appears to be engineered externally. We are asking a very basic question: where is this chorus leading us?    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, there has been a euphoria; people dreaming, sleeping and waking up thinking that they will be the future presidents of this nation or that they should be the instant presidents of this nation. This euphoria                To me, is a sickness. We must accept that at any one given time- there will be one president in this country. At the moment, Kenyans have chosen hon. Daniel Toroitich arap Moi to lead us in this nation. I want to be on record that as I stand here, we, elected Members of this House, are fully behind the President of the Republic of Kenya. This euphoria on pluralism is obviously geared towards diverting our attention from much more fundamental issues at hand.            Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the fundamental issues that I say are at hand were clearly enunciated in the Budget Speech. We want this nation to move towards export strategy approach.    END…J                    THE MINISTER FOR TECHNICAL TRAINING AND APPLIED TECHNOLOGY (ctd.):     Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we want this nation1 to reap the economic benefits of our agriculture, industries and our natural resources. The Budget was geared towards enabling them wananchi to enjoy the economy of this land, yet there are those few people who have decided that they must agitate for the sake of doing so. I submit, Sir that those people are riding on somebodys back. They are riding on a camel, but they do not know whether its feet are stable or unstable. They are riding on a road that is dangerous. I do not think our nation can stand idle and watch people pertuating dangerous moves. We must therefore curb those dangerous moves sir that language which is so strange must be curbed. I submit that there is no l body else who is more mandated to determine the fate of those people other than the mwananchi. Them wananchi in thisis  land of Kenya from west to east, north to south, has clearly stated that he wants one party system of Government. That 	day dreaming, it is the reality of the situation. That is what every "hon. Member in this Parliament is being told be his constituents. We want a united Government, a Government that will help us move away from the poverty of the third world. That is the kind of Government that our President has tried to bring a about. He has brought a Government of reconciliation, unity and love.    Sir, there is some hatred which has found its way to the church. I must say that it has been brought by a few individuals in one church. Itwas very interesting because yesterday we read who their collaborators are. The matter is now becoming clear, to us. Sir, those of us who have sworn to defend this nation will do so at any cost. If it means raising up against those peopl                                                                we shall do so I think somebody is taking this House for aride for requesting to be given a licence to hold public meetings. Whom do they want to address under whose mandate? What do they want to tell Kenyans. I suspect that since those people are not in the Government, they want to hold public meetings so that they can explain the people how they intend to use their riches to get power. Will Kenyans' accept that? Absolutely no.    Sir, I must say that the sovereignity of this nation is supreme. There are 23 million Kenyans who want to stay in peace. Those Kenyans want to see their children every morning going to school. They want to enjoy the 8-4-4 system of education. There are very many njua kali" people who are very happy. They want to reap the benefits of this country. Therefore, si Sir, those few individuals who are trying to un twist the majority Kenyans are doing so for the love of power and money. We know where their money came from we know where they want to take us. We know that they want power. Some of those people who are looking for power do not know that perhaps they are being manipulated by some other systems which we know very well.    Sir, it is quite clear that the prescription for that type of arrogance is for us to say no. Also swift action should be taken against those people. They cannot hold a nation to ransom because it is made of diversity of people, religion, culture, tribes, ecology and natural resources. In that diversity, we have accepted that we shall streamline ourselves and move forward as one nation. Today, Kenya is one of the few countries that enjoy peace. We know what peace means. We have been able to push our economy to a certain level. As the Vice-President and Minister for Finance enounciated in his Budget                                                                THE MINISTER FOR TECHNICAL TRAINING AND APPLIED TECHNOLOGY (ctd.): in the next five years or so, this country should look forward into becoming one of the newly industrialised nations.    Sir, the Government led by His Excellency the President has tried to provide and is still trying new opportunities for the unemployed people, new incentives to the. farmers, industrialistin the commercial sector. What else can we expect from a President who has dedicated all his life to this nation. Sometimes I feel that we are over stretching our President. I think some people are taking undue advantage because of his magnanimity and love for this nation. They now want to stretch him to the limits. Part of that stretching is rooted on tribalism. Since Independence we have been trying to fight tribalism, but this time, we must root out that ugly head called tribalism. Today, for example, my children do not know my tribal base. They see every Kenyan as their colleague. Why should somebody remind us about history? To some of us. history is very bitter to remember. My grandfather was murdered by colonialists in trying to defend his existence in thisnation. My relatives were also locked up by the colonialists. Therefore, nobody should have a monopoly ox of saying that "I suffered and therefore, I have a right to be so-and-so". We all suffered. We have accepted that we should stay together and become one nation and one people.    With those few remarks, I beg to support.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. Kabingu-Muregi): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for according me this time to say a few words in connection with the speech which was delivered by the Vice-President and Minister for Finance during the Budget day.                                        I wish to thank the Vice-President and the Minister for Finance for providing Kenyans with such a good k simple Budget that will benefit all the sectorsan our Republic.    Sir, the reduction of duty on motor vehicles was a very good step because our country, and especially the rural areas depend on motor vehicle transportation. Easy availability of vehicles is one way of promoting development in the rural areas, particularly for agriculture purposes. Sir, with regard to the debate on multioparties, I would like to say that the Nyandarua people support the President and the one party system of Government. Nobody from Nyandarua will ever recognise the multi-party system.        END….K                                                                                                                                Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I must say here that it is surprising tohear the kind of utterances now "being made "by Rubia and Matiba, when we clearly know that during the amending to our Constitution to legalize a oneparty-system of Government, these two gentlemen were Members of this House,and they voted for the amendment of the Constitution to provide far this one-party system of Government. Now, that they are no longer in this House, theyhave decided to sell themselves to the enemies of Kenya with the whole intention if disrupting peace and stability which Kenyans have enjoyed over the years.        Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I believe that "by proposing the mutlti-party system of Government, these gentlemen are just taking a short cutto achieve their ambitions. You will remember, Sir, that in 1978, we had a group that emerged called the "Change the Constitution Group" whose aim wasto campaign for the changing of the Constitution to amend the provision which enables the Vice-President to take over the running of the Government for 90 days after the death of the President. This group wanted to use a simple short cut to achieve their ambitions and it is the same thing that is happening now. These people want to use the short-cut of a multi-party system of Government to achieve their objectives. I think they should be told quite clearly that they are day-dreaming.        Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, some of these dissidents havegone to the foreign press and issued wrong information just to smear the name of this Government. It is through these advocates of the multi-party system that it has been said through the British Broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C.) that Kikuyus are a very superior tribe in Kenya. This is a very unfortunate and uncalled statement because this is likely "to cause problems to a single-tribe in Kenya. What we know in Kenya, is that all tribes here are equal and there is no tribe that is superior to others. I personally am a Kikuyu and I am sure my fellow Kikuyus feel the same, namely that we are equal in all respects to other tribes, and we do not have ambition as has been said of us.                                                                What is even more important is that we support our" President 100 per cent. I would, like to take this opportunity to ask whoever heard, that kind of a statement to ignore it completely "because it was not representative of the feelings of the Kikuyus in this country. We have make our position quite clear on this matter and I think the sooner this debate on the so called multi-party system was stopped the "better for us all so that we can  forge ahead in other more important issues of our development, which is what Kenyans need more than anything else.    Having said that Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like totouch on the problems facing the people of Nyandarua. At the moment, milk farmers are not able to deliver their milk due to the poor state of roads in the area It is for this reason that the Kenya Co-operative Creameries proposed establish milk collection centres in ol Kalou and Ndunyu-Njeru townships to ease the current problem of milk transportation. However, since the K.C.C. acquired plots and fenced them off in these two townships in readiness to provide the necessary equipment, it is now about three years and the proposed milk collection centres have not taken off the ground. At the moment Nyandarua farmers are asking when these centres would start operating. It is true that through the provision of these facilities in such strategic positions as had been proposed, would assist farmers in the delivery of their milk.        Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I have said, the state of roads in Nyandarua is alarming and I am pleased to note that the Minister for Public Works is present. The two year continuous rain has destroyed our roads and most of them are not impassable and all we need is fin the Ministry of Public Works to provide us with tippers to cover the potholes that develop from time to time on our roads. We also need a grader "because the one we have is too old to be of any use to us because it keeps breaking down from time to time. We would like to get a new grader plus four or five tippers to cover up the potholes that develop on our roads from time to time. I would like to thank the Minister for the grading work that has been carriedout on our roads from time to time. However, the problem at the a moment is ' that as soon as grading is done on these roads, it rains in the afternoon and the state of the roads become worse than "before. This cleans the money used in the grading work is wasted. So, I am asking the Minister to make sure that our maintenance team is provided with the proper equipment so that they can cover the potholes which make over roads very difficult to pass through. I am sure the Minister concerned is listening to this and will take the necessary action. I am saying this because I know him to be a very able Minister who have occasionally been able to visit Nyandaru.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also wish to thank His Excellency the President for the concern and love that he has shown to the Nyandarua peoplein the payment of installments for the shambas which he helped us to acquire. Originally, we were given 30 years within which to pay for these shambas and we are pleased to note that the 30 years are just about to lapse. However, we have been called upon to complete payment for these shambas and a notice has been issued. We are grateful to the President because through his mercy and concern for us, this notice has now been extended and we are still having time to pay for these shambas. Our farmers are very happy and are praying to God to give the President long life.        Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are also very grateful to our President for ensuring proper management of these shambas and the issuance of the title deeds to their owners. Now that our farmers can borrow money from the banks more easily, I hope they are going to develop these shambas. This has been made possible through the love of our President.        Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to assist the Vice-President and Minister for Finance ty suggesting that more assistance should be given to gemstone miners, particularly those in Taita-Taveta and elsewhere. I would like to suggest that  proper incentive should be given so that they can be able to sell their gemstones m v stray k to overseas markets.                                                        They can also capture the market in Thailand and thereby earn this country a lot of foreign exchange which we badly need. Through this trade alone, Kenya can make a lot of money because we are very rich in gemstones in this county.    With those few remarks, I beg to support.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MTHISTIR TOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Kones): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this Debate. First of all, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for presenting to the House a very fair Budget, which takes care of all classes of wananchi in this country.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to request the Ministry of Public Works to put more effort into the maintenance of roads, especially in tea growing areas. A lot has been done in this regard, but a lot more still needs to be done in terms of road improvement. Kenya is an agricultural country and I, being an Assistant Minister for Agriculture, think that a lot of agriculture is suffering because of poor road maintenance. I believe, now that funds have been made available, a lot of work will be done on road maintenance.I would also like to appeal to the Ministry of Health to try to improve our medical facilities, which are now deteriorating very seriously. Most of our dispensaries, health centres and district hospitals are running short of almost all necessary drugs. I know that sometimes funds have not been available, but with the new Budget, the Ministry should be able to move in quickly to save the situation. I appeal to the Ministry to look into the problem of a mysterious disease that is now facing Kericho. I know that the Ministry has already done something about this problems, but I still believe that it should move in with a lot of vigour to try to control this disease. I hear that a lot has to be done in terms of public education. So, the Ministry should organise some public meetings to educate the people on how to conduct themselves in such conditions. I am sure that the Ministry is very able and that it is going to take care of this problems very quickly. Let me commend and congratulate our beloved President on what he has done for this country. The Budget that was read out the other day is very fair and one of the best in the Third World, and our President takes all the credit for this. At this moment, when we are paying tribute to our President, it is most unfortunate that certain elements continue to preach seeds of discord. There is no doubt that these elements are totally misguided. When we talk about many parties and make it a very big issue that diverts all our efforts that are geared towards development, this is most unfortunate. There is no doubt as to whether a multi-party system can work in Africa. I think such a system will notwork especially in Kenya because we tried in the past and it did not work. The one party system, however, is the most successful because it has run our Kenya Government very well.Certain people are not satisfied, and we know why this is so. They should, however, come out and say what they want without hiding in the mist of political parties. Some speakers here have made it very clear that this is a move calculated to take away the leadership of this country. We are totally satisfied with the leadership of His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi, and no number of any more parties will improve the running of this country. What these elements are up is the leadership of the country, but they do not realise that causing all this confusion may not benefit them at all. If Matiba is asking to be given a licence to address a public rally, the hon. Member concerned, who is here today, should ask him to come to Nakuru on Saturday to be given a chance to address the public. There will be a big gathering in Nakuru on that day. I am sure that he will not even dare come, leave alone address the people.    Even if such people were to be given a chance to address the public, what would they tell us. Matiba was in this House for nearly 11 years, and he enjoyed himself here up to the time when he was not able to cope with the running of the Government. That was when he decided to quit on his own. He now thinks that he has something to tell the public! Why did he not say it when he was here? Rubia had a similar chance. Why did he not say what he wants to say now when he was here? These are the fellows who have amassed a lot of wealth through their unscruplous ways of life, and they now want to dump all of us into problems, but we are not about to yield to this persuasion. This is the time when all Kenyans, especially leaders, should really stand firm behind the President. We must stand to be counted because this is one of the hardest times that we have faced in this country. Our President has run through many hurdles, and this is just another one, but we are sure he will go through it without any problems at all. The unfortunate thing is that some people areTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Kones) (Ctd.): setting hurdles for the President all the time why is he not left to rule the country in peace and concentrate on things that are development oriented? Why should our President be bogged down to solving very petty issues all the time? I am sure that somebody somewhere is just malicious, and he does not want to see somebody else succeed in the running of the country, as is the case with our President.</NEWSPEECH>    <HEADER>QUORUM</HEADER>    <NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The House has no quorum at the moment.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva): It is true that the House has no quorum.    Ring the Division Bell</NEWSPEECH>    (The Division Bell was rung)        <NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva): We now have a quorum in the    House.    You may proceed, Mr. Kones.</NEWSPEECH>            <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Kones): I will now proceed, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. It is also shocking to hear some clergymen supporting those, advocates of the multi-party system. These clergymen have a duty to play in this world and that is to preach the word of God. I do not understand how they have managed to cross into politics. They are trying to create total confusion in this country. Nobody can answer a clergyman when he talks from the pulpit. These fellows are taking a very big advantage of that privilege of talking behind the pulpit. They invite pressmen to their churches and they use the pulpit to attack this country. I think it is high time these clergymen were properly screened to ensure that they preach pure word of God and nothing more. We cannot a situation like this one to continue. It is totally unfair for a bishop to preach bull_shit to a congregation of about 4,000 people who have gone to the church to get spiritual nourishment. I do not understand why the pressmen like covering these sermons so extensively and yet they fail to cover rx properly politicians who come out strongly to condemn the multi-party systems. I do not understand why most of the C.P.K. leaders "When Bishop Alexander LIuge was thrown out of a certain Anglican church in the United States recently because of preaching against homosexuality the C.P.K. bishops never said a word about it. It would appear that they believed that it was a good thing for Bishop LIuge to be thrown out of that church. This is because they never commented on that matter. This should make them realise that there is racialism in some countries that claim to be totally democratic. I think muge was thrown out of that church just because he is a black man.    THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Kones): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, these people who are trying to use disgruntled elements in this  country to advocate for a multi-party system for this country do practise a lot of racism. We should stand firm as an African nation and go by our own traditions. We should accept only that which we know is good for us.We cannot go aping, foreign cultures and traditions ail over the world. We need to have a solid foundation "because without this foundation we will continue to "be tossed from place to place with foreign ideas. Africa must stand firm and reject foreign ideologies. This is because these foreign ideologies will cause chaos.    With those few remarks, I "beg to support.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mr. Njiru): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to associate myself with ay colleagues in congratulating His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for introducing a very good Budget  into this House. It is a Budget which has brought real relief to the members of the public in this country. But we should also bear in mind that without political such a good Budget would not have been presented to this House. So, I would like all of us to thank His Excellency the President very much for the manner in which he has steered the affairs of this country. His good leadership has enabled the Office of the Vice-President and ministry of Finance to prepare the type of Budget that was presented to this House the other day. Things like sales tax-have been very considerably reduced. Kenya has also introduced the Export Processing Zone which means that all kinds of goods that are manufactured for export will be escorted duty-free.  So, all tills hascome about as a result of the political stability that we have in this country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is our 27th year of Independence and indeed on 11th June, 1990, we celebrated the 30th anniversary of our party Kanu. But you will find that in this country we have two individuals who are day-drearning. When on goes to bed and falls into a deep sleep he can dream and be excused but the two gentlemen. I have mentioned namely, Mr. Rubia and Mr. Matiba, are day-dreaming. They think they can introduce a multi-party system in this country. His Excellency the President is not a dictator. When he heard that some people where talking about the introduction of multi-parties in this country, he went out to visit every part of this country. He has visited all the provinces in this country. I do understand that very soon he is going to hold public rallies in the Rift Valley Province. The people of this country have totally rejected the so-called multi-party system.''This is because the multi-party system will Create multiple problems for this country.        Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if you look into the past of these men who are advocating for the introduction of multi-parties in this country you will find that they have never been patriotic and they have never been genuine leaders in this country. But they and their sympathisers are power-hungry. Since they have not been able to acquire that power in the Kanu Government, th nowthink that theycan form their own parties so that they are called "Presidents" or Chairmen" or whatever they want to become.        If you read history properly you will find that at one time the colonialists who are now using these people introduced many political parties in this country. Every district in this country had its own political party.                                                In Embu we had the African Democratic Party; in Murang'a there was the Murang'a Democratic Freedom Party and in Nyeri the Nyeri Congress Party There were also other parties in other districts and provinces. All these parties brought only? chaos. All these were, tribal groupings. That is when parties like Kadu, Kanu, APP, KPU, the Maasai Front and the Kalenjin Alliance. The members of these parties started hunting each other.        Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in 1960 I escaped death very narrowly with the late James Gichuru at Ngong. We also went to Ukambani the land of the APP, where we lost one youthwinger called. Wambua. On reaching there we were stoned and the car of Mr. Ngala Mwendwa was overturned and set on fire. Wananchi attacked vans that were carrying bread, helped themselves to the bread and then overturned and burned the vans. During the Lancaster House Constitution Conference, our leaders decided to have only one party in this country; they chose Kanu. These leaders refused to accept communism. Both the late Mzee Jorao Kenyatta, President Moi and the other leaders decided to have only one party in this country. So we even now refuse to accept multliple parties. This the right thing for us to do. We want only one party in this country.        In Kirinyaga I have visited every location there and all the people have refused and condemned the introduction of another political party because that is the way of anarchy and bloodshed. There are, in fact, only one or two rich fellows who are advocating for multiple parties. These are unpatriotic fellows. These are the same fellows who were home guards during the days when we were fighting for independence. They are the ones who were murdering and killing their fellow Kenyans who were fighting for independence and are the same people who are advocating for another political party in this country.        It is not strange to find clergymen advocating for multiple parties too. This is because during the Emergency and the Mau Mau days, they were the ones who joined the colonialists by arming themselves to hunt and kill their fellow Kenyans. They were calling themselves.                                                                                                                            pastors during those days. They are the same people who were signing the death warrants for their own African brothers. So it is not strange for such people to still have the same mentality today.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir, the late Mzee Jomo Kenyatta said: "Let us forgive, but we will never forget". These people after what they had done were forgiven but they have never remained to do the right thing. When they were forgiven they did not receive the forgiveness genuinely. They are instead being provocative and saying: "Money speaks". This is what they are saying. They should have realised and learnt by now that people are not interested in what they are saying  They should also realise that they are not representing anybody's views but their own.    With those few remarks, I wish to support.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE Mr. Kombo) Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank you for allowing me to also contribute to this very important debate. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for the manner in which he moved the Budget and for the fact that the Budget is going to enhance the economic growth through export promotion. This will be very vital to this nation in the next few years. I am sure out of this Budget, the nation is going to benefit a great deal and that we shall see the results in the next few years. The Budget is also well balanced between the rural and urban areas. In the rural areas, he has proposed to give shs.150 million to the district development committees (DDC) which will boost the projects in the districts. There is also a proposal in the Budget to enhance the capital market. This will be a source of capital in this country instead of depending only on debts through banks. If you look at the balance sheets of most public companies, you will find out that a lot of their finances through borrowing. With the introduction of the capital market, securities or shares will be sold to the public thus creating a source of revenue. This is a progressive Budget which did not touch the mwananchi.                                                                             THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE.(Mr. Kombo) (ctd.): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also wish to thank His Excellency the President for the manner in which he has guided this nation for the time he has been our President and leader. He is a man who is loved by each and every Kenyan as shown by the large turnout whenever he has held rallies We are happy that many people turned out in large numbers to see him and I am sure that when he comes to Kisii there will be, as visual, no room for people to even stand. We will turn out in large numbers because we love him and we know that he is a great warrior and not a coward. Nobody should play around with him thinking that he is alone because we are all behind him. Let it also be known that people from Kisii District do not want any debate on multiple parties.

I have just been informed "that there is a if record which these people have cut which is playing about Muoroto which means that they planned these things. They wanted chaos.

I wish to commend some churches like the African Inland church  (A.I.C.), the Seventh Day Adventist (S.D.A.), the Catholic and so on. These churches are preaching the word of God. They are trully preaching the Gospel". According to Matthew 28: 19-21 which says and I quote:-    "Go ye, therefore, teach all nations  baptising them in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost and know I shall be with you".                                                                                                                         Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when gesus was on this earth he was asked by one person whether they should pay tax Then Jesus asked that man to give him the shekel he was holding. Then Jesus asked the man whose picture was on the shekel and the man answered Ceasar’s  Then Jesus told him, "Give up to Ceasar what is Ceasar's and z unto God what God's". So we would like to get gospel message from these people and not  the trash they are giving us now.The Church of the Province of Kenya, which some people are calling the "Church of the politics of Kenya", should know that it is supposed to preach the gospel. So let ne tell you that we shall not go to heaven as many parties but as one party. This means that even Jesus Christ recognises only one party and does not want many parties. The churclies should, therefore, that multi parties are not even accepted in heaven. Satan was even sent away from even because he wanted to form another party which was opposed to God.Let me now turn to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), from which we have heard a lot. Why do we not hear from that today Kenya's Parliament today opposed multi-parties?  Why do we only hear one-sided reports from the BBC? Now I want to tell those of us who go about talking about what we should correct that this is not the time to talk about what should be corrected in Kanu; this is the time to talk about either single or multi-parties. When the 3,000 plus Kanu delegates meet then they will talk about our Kanu problems. But those who are airing their views about Kanu problems they are washing their dirty linen in public and giving multi-party proponents the communication, which we should not give them, to use against us.    I know that all Kenyans love our President, peace, unity                                                                                        and we do not want anything that will distract us from the kind of development that we have achieved. Some people particular! the foreigners, would like to get a way of coming here and destroying this progressive nation. If we all become united, particularly we hon. Members, and work is with the President nobody I will get a way of destroying this nation. As I said those who are tired should go home, settle down qietly, eat whatever they have and leave us in peace so that we nay also get the benefits which they already have reaped and are satisfied about, we want this nation to be another Hong Kong; we want this nation to be an industries one; we want this nation to produce enough for us to eat; after the best politics is "tumbo" politics.With those remarks I beg to support.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. TERER Thank you Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chance, to commend his Excellency the Vice—Preside for presenting a balanced Budget. The theme of the Budget is "z An Enhanced Economic Growth Promotion". Of course, this implies that the agricultural sector has to be stimulated along with the other sectors.I would like to join previous speakers by suggesting that we should  improve our roads network, especially in the rural areas. The rural access should be allocated more money so. that farmers may be able to get their goods to markets. Of late, a number of major roads and highways have been repaired and I would thus like to congratulate the Ministry of Public works for that. However, there are still some areas where the roads are un vehicle worthy May be they should have signs posts they are un vehicle worty, especially at no. gat so that those use may drive along them with a lot of care.    Again our roads do not last long because very heavy                                                                                 commercial vehicles using these roads. I think these, vehicles should be made to pay for the damage they inflict on our roads we see a lot of heavy vehicles on our roads which travel across the boarders. Such sis vehicles inflict so much damage on our roads that a tarmac road may have a life span of only two years; this is very costly indeed we would like the Ministry concerned to increase the transportation of heavy goods by railway because this will actually save our  roads from damage It is even desirable to have railway lines extended to high potential areas. This save our roads damage and also make it cheaper to transport agricultural produce.    I would also suggest that the Ministry of Works decentralizes its services up to the divisional level so that wananchi may  have access to its services more easily. we would also like to have didicated officers so that whenever there are road problems they are attended to quickly and efficiently. Inefficient, or spoiled, officers should be sacked in order to  spare our roads from going to ruins.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to congratulate the Ministry of Education for expanding university education. but we have Form Six arts  students who cannot go for a diploma in education because it has been scrapped. I think if these young people with up to nine points have chosen to be teachers, they should be given chance. I suggest that the present teacher training colleges should be expanded to accommodate courses leading to the award of diplomas in education for arts  teachers. I also think we should not discriminate against students who go to study overseas in giving loans. I would urge the Ministry of Education to give loans to the students who go to study overseas. This is because                                                                                         most of them have good passes But  cannot get accommodation in our local public universities. So, since they will come to work for our country, we should actually consider giving them loans as most of them get into financial problems when they are studying overseas.    Mr. Temporary Deputy speaker, Sir, with regard to payment of teachers, salaries, I think there should be no excuse at all in delaying payment of teachers, salaries after they have worked for 30 days. In fact, the majority of teachers are dedicated to their work. But it is disheartening  to see them queuing for their salaries outside banks for the whole day on Saturdays only to be told by their banks officials that there are salaries have not been recevied from the Teachers Service Commission.                                                                                                                        I know that the Teachers Service Commission may not be to blame very much because the fault may be with the Treasury and, therefore, I would like to urge both the  Treasury and the Ministry of Education to be releasing teachers salaries in time so that they do not waste time going for their salaries. If teachers will have to be leaving school children quite often going to look for their salaries, that is a loss to the country.Having said that retires he is paid his benefits without much delay.    Turning to the jua kali sector, I think it seriously calls for ruralele ctrification. Rural electrification is a must because unless we have electricity in the rural areas, we are not likely to have a successful jua kali industry. I sincerely urge the Ministry concerned to intensify rural electrification so that we can have a lot of jua kali sheds all over the country.    Mr. Temporary Deputy speaker Sir, turning my attention to the Kenya Tea Development Authority, I would like to say that we eagerly await the publication of the report of the committee that was appointed by His Excellency the President to look into the functioning of that organization. At the moment, we would like not only to expand theexisting Kenya tea Development Authority factories but also build more factories closer to the farmers so that during the rain seasons farmers can be able to carry their tea leaves to the factory using donkeys and other available means. In the tea growing areas most roads become impassable when it rains. The clerks who are employed at the tea buying centres should be cautious because, at times, they do mislead the farmer. Something should be done about the clerks.                                                                                        Touching on the question of the multi-party advocates, I think the Church of the Province of Kenya is somebody's advocate. As I understand it, an advocate is somebody who is hired to do something for somebody else. So, I think those C.P.K. clergymen who have spoken for the multi-party system should be investigated; our intelligence network should be vigilant in dealing with these people so that they can be dealt with effectively and conclusively. We are tired of this question of having a group of people in the church opposing the Government, and, in fact, even going to the extent of being rude to our head of state. I think something  must be done immediately to stop this trend.    Finally, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me turn to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. I wish to point out here that most farmers would like to listen to the proceedings of this House, and I think the farmers who would wish to wake up early and attend to their farm duties cannot wait and listen to the broadcasts regarding the proceedings of this House after 10.00 p.m. I think the Kiswahili broadcast should be read after the six o'clock news bulletin in the morning so that farmers can be able to hear it.    With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sdir, for giving me this opportunity to talk on this Motion on the Budget Speech.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, people have talked a lot about the question of multi partyism. In the correspondence columns of our local dailies, we have see a lot of people writing about multi-partyism, and I call such people political theoreticians because what they are doing is strictly theoretical The issue of multi-parties reminds me of a country called Siera Leone. There was a president in Siera Leone who accepted having several parties in his country. One day, he lost the elections to the opposition, who went ahead to form a government and then declared a one-party system. So, what we are doing is strictly theoretical because the people who are preaching multi-partyism are not giving a guarantee                                                                         that when they come to power they will not declare a one-party state. It is all right to deal with theories, but quite a number of theories are not practical. We should, therefore, dismiss this multi-partyism as a theory that has no practicability. In Physics and Chemistry there are theories and some of them have remained and died astute. Others have been proved to be correct and have lived up to now  and people are still being taught. In geometry, when you have a theory, the solution of certain problems is based on the theories. Therefore, I think my colleagues should treat multi-partyism as a theory being preached by political theoreticians.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have told people in my constituency that I have no time for multi-partyism. Unfortunately, I am one of the few people in this country who, if there is a problem, cannot run fast enough.    (Laughter)I do not want a situation to arise which will involve me in having to run very fast.Sir, when we first amended the Constitution to introduce the one-party state, we were all sitting here with our colleagues who are now preaching multi partyism. We all went through the far door on Mr. Speaker's right and signed our names in there and came out through the other door, confirming this country as it is now. This theory of not wanting to play football unless you are captain is outmoded.    (Applause)There are some people who will not accept to play football unless they are captains, and this is what we are seeing in the preaching about multi-partyism. Somebody just wakes up and says, "since I am not a president, I think I should form my own party so that when I win the election I become the president and dec1 cure that I want a one party state". Sir, Albert Margai (?) is no longer there and we are not sure whether whoever comes will not declare a one-party state.    Sir, so far so good for multi-partyism. Since I do not go to church very much, I do not mind about church affairs very much.	                                                            ?            Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let us now talk about multi-taxation. Sir, we are paying tax in various' ways. We are Paying services charge those of us who  do some farming are paying value added tax (VAT) including income tax. The proposals so far are fine. But Sir, you are aware that the cashew—nuts factory at Kilifi collapsed and people who were working became Jobeless</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Kariuki): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it in order  for the hon  Member to allege that there is a value added tax (VAT) which paid on farm produce. As far as I know VAT is not levied on farm produce. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR WAMEYO: Sir, I produce sugarcane and I have a financial statement, and always five percent is deducted from anymoney paid on that sugar-cane. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Kariuki): On a point of information Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir. MayII inform the hon. Member that the tax that he is talking about is the presumptive tax, but not VAT</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: Sir, I do not mind about the name given to that tax, but a tax of five percent is paid on farm produce. Today we have the system of cost sharing in Hospitals five per cent is  paid on farm produce. Today  we have the system of cost sharing in hospitals and therefore, when you go to hospital you have to pay some money. Sir, quite a number of people have lost their jobs. The Cashew-nuts factory in Kilifi was closed the other factories which were closed down included Ramisi Sugar Factory, Miwani sugar factory, Uplands Bacon Factory and the Kenya Meat Commission. Recently, nearly a 1000 people were                                                                             laid off by the Kenya Airways. When those people go to the hospital they find it very difficult</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Kones): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy speaker, Sir. I would like to remind the hon. Member that Miwani Sugar Factory and the Cashew Nuts Factory at Kilifi have been a re-opened. I therefore, think that he is making misguiding statements.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: I do understand what the hon. Member has said about the Cashew Nut Factory at Kilifi, but at the moment, the workers are not there. They are not being paid.    Sir, just before I was interrupted, I was saying that those unemployed people are finding the going to be very difficult when they go to hospitals and they are asked to kshs 20/-. Sir, if they are lucky to pay that money, they are then given a prescription to go and buy medicine from the chemists. Sir, where do they get the money to buy that medicine? Sir, we should consider exempting those unemployed people from paying any money at the hospitals. Sir, society must have some people who  are disadvantaged, and therefore, the society should make efforts to look after their disadvantaged people just like we have some schools taking care of people who are crippled.    Sir, the availability of medicine in hospitals is very important. The other day we read the newspapers about deaths at Kericho and Eldoret. Recently, somebody said that those people died because of malaria. If people do not have money to go to and pay hospital charged they will find it very difficult to go there, therefore, they will choose to stay at home. Sir, I would like to plead with the Ministries to properly use the money that will be allocated to them.    With those few remarks, I beg to support.</NEWSPEECH>                                                                            <NEWSPEECH>MR, KIPKORIR: Thank you very much Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir for giving me an opportunity to support this MotionSir, His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance presented the Budget very well. The common man was worried  that the prices of the essential goods would be raised, but fortunately they were not. Sir, the prices of goods are raised day after day,, but during the Budget day we were happy because the prices of the essential goods were not increased. I would like to appeal to the Ministry to make sure that no mini-budgets come up until next years budget, so that the ordinary mwananchi can live comfortably. Sir, I am happy because of the way the Vice-President and Minister for Finance presented the Budget a I am also happy because of the prevailing stability in our country. We are proud of the leadership of His Excellency the President because he has brought love,peace and unity. We would like him to continue with the leadership of this country because everybody is happy.Sir, I was very surprised to hear some people advocating for multiparty system of Government. I think those people do not know the kind of problems that can confront multiparty systems. If they want to know about those problems caused by multi-party systems they should go to Kerio Valley and ask those people. When Kenya was a under  a multi—party system of Government, people used to sleep and travel in bushes due to the fights  that were going on. It is very bad for somebody to re-introduce tribalism again. We are all united under one political party and we are enjoying the leadership of our President. We feel very comfortable with his leadership. You should go to Kerio Valley and ask the people what the battle of kolewa was. Most people lost their lives that time. I would like to ask the Catholic Church and the African inland Church (A.I.C.)and all other churches to  disassociate themselves from those people who are appearing like  wolves in  sheep skins. They are covering themselves under the church, yet they are undermining the Government. Sir, as a Parliament,we should not allow such a thing to happen.    Sir, All Kenyans are united. Sir the other day the President was addressing the people at Kamukunji where all tribes in Kenya live. All those tribes living there are enjoying life together. How can you separate them possible to separate them it is not possible to separate them after 27 years of Independence                                                                                                                                 Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we would like to inform those few people who are now trying to divide Kenyans to watch out we cannot at this particular moment, forget how the late Mzee Jomo Kenyatta handled Kenyans in those earlier days. At that time, we remember how people used to group themselves into tribal groups and we remember the late President, particularly for being able to unite Kenyans. He enjoyed his leadership as we enjoy the present leadership of His Excellency Daniel axap Moi. We are  surprised to hear a few people advocating for multi-party system of Government. I support what hon. Dr. Waneyo has said, namely that these people are trying to divide us like the colonialists used to divide us. Perhaps they want to introduce a multi-party system of Government and then later change to something else. We in Kenya have achieved a lot in development under one-party-system of Government and we are not going to accept any other system of Government in Kenya. The majority of Kenyans support the leadership of His Excellency the President through whose wise leadership, we have achieved so much that others are now envious of our achievement.Having said that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to appeal to the Ministers to run their Ministries properly. We know there are some government officers who misuse public funds and these people must be brought to book. At the moment, we still have a lot to do in our development and therefore we need every cent that we can lay our hands on and we cannot stand back to watch people misappropriating development funds. I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to the Minister for Public Funds to increase the vote for rural access roads. In my constituency, for example, it is very difficult to travel because roads there are impassable. Therefore, I appeal to the Minister for Public Works to apply for more funds so that rural access roads can be improved so that we can minimize the problem of transportation from the rural areas to the towns.At the moment, we are experiencing a very serious problem of unemployment in this country and I would like to appeal to the Ministry of Commerce to decentralize its activities to the district level. They should hold several  seminars to assist wananchi in business In my constituency, there are several shops that have been closed down just because of lack of proper management and I would like to appeal to the Government through this ministry to assist our traders by taking them to seminars whereby they can be taught how to carry out their "business. This would enable them to re-open same of these shops for the benefit of the wananchi in the area. At the moment, there are traders in my area who are very much interested in carrying out business.Having said that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to appeal to the Ministry of Agriculture to increase the production  of food in this county. In my area, the land is very productive, particularly in the Kerio Valley and I appeal to the Ministry of Regional Development to employ wananchi from this area permanently, we do not like the idea of employing people as casuals for years. At the moment, aa there are seme of our people who have been employed as casuals for over three years and these people feel very frustrated. We would like the Government to employ these people permanently. The Kerio Development Authority should also try to help wananchi in the rasel area to improve their farms. They should try to impart the knowledge they have to the farmers so that they can improve their food production. They should not ask the farmers to pay for this service because their aim is to assist farmers to grow enough food for this country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, agriculture is the back-bone of our economy and therefore it is important that our people should improve their farming methods. Similarly, efforts should he made to assist farmers to improve their livestock. In my area, we have very few extension officers to help the farmers and I appeal to the Minister for Livestock to make arrangement to send in more extension officers to Kerio Valley so that they can advise our farmers on how to improve their livestock production. This would greatly assist in the development of livestock in this area.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, time has now come for everybody, including leaders to listen to what His Excellency the President has been saying. We should be very grateful to God for giving us such a President who is very much concerned about with the welfare of wananchi.                                                                             With those few remarks,. I beg to support.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. AKIBAYA: Ahsante sana Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda kwa kumipatia nafasi hii ili niweze kuungana na Wabunge wenzangu katika majadiliano haya ya Bajeti ambayo ilitolewa na Makamu-Rais ra na Waziri wa Pedha. Kwanza, ningetaka. Kusema kwamba Bajeti hii ilikuwa nzuri sana na yenye matumaini mengi kwa wananchi. Inaonekana wazi kwamba Makamu-Rais na Waziri wa fedha aligundua ujanja wa wafanyabiashara wakati huu. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu wakati wa Bajeti hii hatukuwa na hali ya kupotea kwa bidhaa muhimu kwa maduka kama ilivyo kawaida wakati uliopita. Hapo mbjeleni, tumekuwa tuki shuhudia visa vya ukosefu wa bidhaa muhimu katika maduka kabla ya Bajeti kusomwa, kwa mfano, unga, mafuta ya kupika, sabuni, misumali, kiberiti na kadhalika. Lakini wakati huu, tumefurahi sana kwa sababu vitu hivi havikupotea.    Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, tunamshukuri Makamu-Rais na waziri wa fedha kwa kutoongeza bei ya petroli. Hapo	mbeleni, bei ya petroli ilipoongezwa, watu wa matatu kesho kutwa wanaongeza nauli ya kusafiri na kwa hivyo, ninampongeza Waziri kwa jambo hili.                                                                                                        Kama nilivyosema, watu wetu wana mashamba madogo tu, na pengine huenda ugonjwa huu ukayaingilia mahindi na kuwatia watu wetu taabuni. Wakati umefika ambapo maofisa wa kilimo wanafa kutafuta mmea mwingine wa chakula uriaoweza kustawi katika sehemu hiyo ili watu wetu wasiwe wakiyategemea maharagwe na mahindi peke yake.    Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ningependa kuyataja machache juu ya barabara. Wakuu wa Wizara ya Ujenzi wanaona kama barabara za mjini na zile nyingine kubwa kubwa ndizo zenye maana peke yake, na kwamba barabara zilizo kule mashambani hazina haja ya kufikiriwa kamwe. Kama unavyojua, barabara zote huharibika, lakini mvua ni baraka kwa mkulima kwa sababu ikinyesha, majani hukua na ng'ombe huyala na kutoa maziwa mengi. Mvua ikinyesha, mboga hustawi vizuri na mkulima huziuza. Vyakula vingine, kama vile ndizi na mahindi pia hustawi vizuri, lakini, kwa sababu ya hali mbaya ya barabara, mkulima hupata taabu. Kwa hivyo, ni vizuri Wizara ya Kilimo ianze kuzifikiria barabara zilizoko mashambani.    Wakati Mtukufu Rais alipotembea Kakamega na kuzungumza juu ya viwanda ambavyo vingefunguliwa huko, wakulima wetu waliingia mashambani mwao kwa nguvu na majani chai yakapatikana mengi sana kiasi kwamba kiwanda chetu cha kutengeneza chai hakikuweza kuyachukua majani chai yetu yote. Mengineyo ya majani chai haya yalioza katika vituo vya ukusanyaji kwa sababu magari ya kubebea majani chai hayakuweza kufika huko. Hili ni jambo ambalo Waziri wa Ujenzi anafaa kuliangalia.    Nikirudi upande wa vyama vingi vya kisiasa, ni jambo la kuhuzunisha kuona kwamba Bw. Rubia na Bw. Matiba ndio wanaojitokeza kuongea juu ya vyama vingi vya kisiasa. Mabwana hawa wawili walikuwako wakati tulipounyakua Uhuru mwaka wa 1963, na wanafahamu vizuri kwamba tulikuwa na vyama viwili vya kisiasa, yaani Kanu na Kenya African Democratic Union (Kadu). Viongozi wa Kenya wenyewe waliona kwamba vyama hivyo viwili havikuwa vizuri, na ndipo kila mtu alisema, "Tutakiunga mkono Chama cha Kanu." Kila mtu anayeishi katika nchi hii anajua kwamba Kanu imeyafanya mengi katika afya, elimu, viwanda - hata vya Jua Kali - na kadhalika. Zaidi ya yote haya, tuna amani katika nchi hii. Mtu	                                                                yule anayesema kwamba tunafaa kuwa na vyama viwili au zaidi vya kisiasa hajatueleza ni ubaya gani ulio katika Kanu, na tungependa atwambie ni faida gani tutakayopata kutokana na vyama viwili au zaidi.    Nilikuwa Kisumu mwaka wa 1966, wakati marehemu Mzee Jomo Kenyatta alipokwenda kule, huku tukiwa na chama cha Kenya People's Union (K.P.U.). Kwa sababu ya ukabila na kuwepo kwa vyama viwili nchini, watu huko walikosa adabu kiasi kwamba waliacha kumpa heshima Rais wa nchi hii. Kila Rais, hata ikiwa ni chama gani, anastahili kupewa heshima. Wale waliokuwa Kisumu wakati ule wanajua ni nini kilichotokea. Bw. Matiba na Bw. Rubia wanatueleza kwamba vyama viwili haviwezi kuleta ukabila, lakini yule aliyekuwako wakati huo angwauliza swali moja. Baada ya msukosuko uliokuwa kule Kisumu, watu walianza kwenda Gatundu "kunywa chai". Ni kwa nini watu hao "walikunywa chai" hiyo? "Chai" hii ilinywewa kwa sababu watu walikuwa na hofu juu ya makabila mengine ambayo yalikuwa yametiwa nguvu na kuweko kwa vyama viwili vya kisiasa.    Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, maofisa wetu wa habari na utangazaji wanafaa kuwafundisha watu zaidi kwa sababu watu wetu wengi sasa hivi ni. vijana walio na umri wa chini ya miaka 35, na unapowaeleza kwamba nchi hii ilikuwa katika hali ya hatari wakati fulani na watu wakaumia, wanaona kama unawahadithia tu. Wakati mwingine wao hufikiri kwamba unatia chumvi katika maneno unayosema. Kule Nigeria pia kulitokea vita vya wenyewe kwa wenyewe kati ya Biafra na Nigeria. Watu wetu wa habari na utangazaji wangeleta filamu inayoonyesha taabu ile iliyotokea kule Biafra. Niliwahi kuwaona watu wakila panya, na watu wetu wanafaa kuonyeshwa filamu hii ili wajue taabu itakayokuja kukiwa na vita vya ukabila. Kuna taabu hapa Ethiopia, na watu huko wanakufa kwa njaa. Picha za mambo haya zinafaa kuletwa na kuonyeshwa na televisheni yetu ili watu wetu waone ni taabu ya aina gani itakayotokea kukiwa na vita vya kikabila. Kuna taabu pia katika Sudan, na watu wetu wanafaa kuonyeshwa picha za mambo haya.    Kwa haya machache, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, naunga mkono.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. JALANG'O: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would, like to join my colleagues in supporting thisvery important Budget for 1990/91. Firstly,                                                                        I would like to congratulate the Vice-President and Minister for Finance very much on a very well-balanced and well-presented Budget Speech, whose theme is "Enhance Economic Growth Through Export Promotion". The Budget Speech comes at a time when the Vice-President and Minister for Finance has reviewed economic developments in the country over the last five years. He has reviewed the significant economic development which this country has experienced as a result of our political stability and growth in agriculture and education.    I would like to quote a text from the Vice-President and Minister for Finance's Budget Speech. It says:-    "The economic well-being of a nation goes far more to the vitality and political foresight of its leadership and the stability of its institutions than to any other single act of the Government. Our beloved President has all along been on the forefront of maintaining peace and stability."There could be no better words to summarise the whole theme of the Budget for 1990/91 because without stability, peace and unity, Kenya would not be in the position it occupies today.We strongly condemn, and will continue to condemn, anybody, whether single or in a group, who tries to destabilise the economic development that this country has achieved over the years.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is a fact that there people who are never happy when there is peace, progress and development. All these economic achievements which have "beer, in leaps and bounds in kenya have come as a result of stability. Whether one likes it or not, one does not have to look very far to see what instability can cause. Let us look at what is happening in neighbouring countries. Let us look at the continent of Africa as whole there is no development taking place in many African countries because of lack of stability. We have to say it here without mincing words that anybody who does not support the course this country has taken has no place in Independent Henya. we will continue to tell both matiba and Rubia that there is no room for them in this country.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have a certain insect call the Mosquito. when a mosquito had enough it is very to kill it. Then a mosquito has had enough it becomes very disturbing. You have sleepless nights because a mosquito has had blood to the full. We have people who are well fed like mosquitoes that have sucked blood from a person. These are the people who are now calling for multi-parties because they have had more than their share. We say "no" to then and we will continue telling them so.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there was a time, and it is not very far oack, when these very same people were the ones advocating the type of things which they are not ready to support now, what has changed their belief? what has changed their strategy? we are saying that this wealth which is making them shout so much came from the sweat of the ordinary wananchi. The Government is going to ask both Matiba and Rubia how in the first instance they acquired that wealth that is    making them disturb this country today. This wealth came from the people who are suffering in the streets today. These are the people who have contributed the wealth of Matiba and Rubia. We have to tell Matiba and Rubia a blatant "No". I think that tine has come when we should ask each and every person who is not patriotic to this country to declare his wealth and alsc the source of his wealth. This is because unless that is done, these people will continue to feed on the sweat of the ordinary nan and at the same time come and step on their feet.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would now like to touch on one or two points about the Budget Speech. The Budget comes at a time when imports coming into Kenya have risen very significantly - by over 26 per cent over the imports of 1989 compared to exports of only 7.1 per cent. This gap between exports and imports has to be bridged; there has to be a balance  we can create this balance by cutting down on imports. The importation of motor vehicles is really draining the foreign exchange reserves of tills country. Kenya is one country in Africa which has the highest number of various models of motor vehicles. There are 300 models of motor vehicles in this country - the third largest number of motor vehicle models in a single country in the world. I think it is high time this country standardized on motor vehicles. We must stick to models of motor vehicles that are locally assembles. After all they are some of the very best. As His Excellency the President said recently, soon the production of the Nyayo Cars is going to start. They will be produced in abundance for the local market. I think we should try to curb this high number of imported motor vehicles so that we can reduce imports and also be able to improve on the balance of payments.Mr. Temporary- Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also very much welcome the restructuring of the cotton Lint and seed Herketing Board of Kenya. As a cotton farmer, I really welcome the exposition by His Excellency the vice-President and Minister for finance on hew restructure the cotton industry in this country. The country is spending a lot of foreign exchange to import cotton simply because the cotton farmer has net been able to be fully regarded for the cotton that he grows. It is high time that the cotton industry was restructured along the same lines as the tea and coffee industries so that cotton can earn this country the necessary foreign exchange. I am hopeful that this new re struct uring programme pre by the Vice-President and Minister for finance will be impleme: immediately so that the cotton farmer can have an improvement as far as the price of cotton is concerned. Shis will enable the cotton farmer to earn ox some dividends just the same way coffee and tea farmers earr dividends. After all we are in agricultural country and cotton is one major cash crop which this country has to promcte. I appeal to the Llinister for Agriculture to implement the proposals on the cotton industry so that the cotton farmer cen be able to reap    With those few remarhs, I beg to support.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Dr. B. A. Godana): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate.    First and foremost, I would like to congratulate his excellency tlie Vice-President and Minister for Finance and his entire staff, for having produced what undoubtedly has been an excellent Budget. I say this because looking back of the earlier years, I can say that this was the first that time that even the newspapers did not have the justification to go round seeking the opinions of the common people in the streets about the Budget. This is because it was obvious that the Budget left the common man unscathed. I think tills is clear evidence of the increasing sophistication of the economy; that the State can in fact manage to raise its budgetary revenue without hitting at the common man.    Having said that, I vrould like to touch on matters that are not directly in the Budget itself. In the very introductory remarks in his Budget Speech, His Excellency the Vice-President and Liinister for Finance praised the political foresight that the political leadership of this country has. The political leadership of this country has been singularly responsible for the enormous progress that we have made milike most of our own fellow African States on this continent.                                I think this needs to be emphasised; that it is that kind of leadership which has enabled us to live for 28 years in peace and harmony and to achieve levels of development which have been missing in most parts of this continent. The African crises of civil strifes, tribal wars, tribal massacres, military coups and consequent economical collapses rampart all over the continent have been occasioned primarily if not singatarly, by lack of the right leadership. We are, therefore lucky that since Indipendence under the founding father of the nation and, more recently under His Excellency President Moi, we have had the right leadership and have been saved from the sad fate that has befallen the rest of the continent.        Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, unfortunately, it seems when people enjoy peace and stability for long, they tend to take order for granted and forget the amount of organisation which goes into the making of everyday order. They particularly forget that order may be very easy to build and maintain, but it is much easier to undo. Evidence in African points to this. Order comes down like a pack of cards when it is touched by the wrong hands. The fact that we have been  peaceful and stable as a united nation for 28 years should not deceive us that we arem, therefore, past the stages which occasioned other African countries to fall into misfortunes. We are still a conglomeration of different communities; I aspirations and cultures, and if the right codes are not maintained or the wrong codes attached  let us not deceive ourselves that we can follow the path thatother countries have followed. It is therefore, surprising that people who are definitely educated and have held leadership in this country and are presumed to understand the emotions of the people, can think that they can deceive the rest of the country and say that we are now past the stage of separate communities of tribes and that we can now multiple parties without running the risk of the parties generating into tribal parties. I think these people are dishonest.    Let me say that individuals like the two former Cabinet Ministers, Mr. Matiba and Rubia. are individuals who have occupied public offices since Independence and should understand that we understand their profile; they are                                                                                        not individuals who have come down from Mars to us with a new message. We Know them and we have their profile in historical perspective. Tljese profiles do not tell us that they are people who can generaly believe in multi-party politics as is understood in the Western World. They also do not tell us that they can rise above tribal sentiments and that they can take into account the interests of Kenyans and regard and look at all Kenyans with indifferent eyes whether they are illiterate Turkana nomads of businessmen on the streets of Nairobi, even a coffee farmer in the Central Province or a fishmonger in Kisumu. I think time has come for Kenyans, particularly the leaders, that is people who are in responsible positions, to influence the attitude of citizens to assume greater responsibilities than we have displayed. We should understand that this nation belongs to all have the same emotions about the misfortunes of an individual, say, at Muroto or Turkana. I do not understand why, if we are one nation and we are that certain individuals, should particularly moved about a relatively small incident in the streets of Nairobi and be absolutly unconcerned when villagers in Turkana or in my own village are massacred by an invading force from across an international border. Very often we find a single criminal act or a incident in the streets of Nairobi making newspaper headlines while in the same newspaper a dozen people killed on some border point, Kenyans though they might be illeterate or come from an area that is economically peripheral, are put in the back pages. Why should such incidents or misfortunes befalling citizens in the far-flung corners of the Republic raise the same concern amoung us as they should? I think this is evidence that we are still fair from being indifferent and raising above the emotions of the communities to which we belong.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is unfortunate indeed that apart from politicians who have to pursue their activities to the politic end, religious leaders like bishops begin to adopt stands and betray tribal or subversive tendencies. This makes me wonder where they are going. I thought that it is permissible of course, morally it is not, but it is understood that individuals                                say that they are christians and then end up doing unchristian or tribal things, then it is obvious that somebody is trying to cheat God and I had thought that one cannot cheat God. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to end my contribution with a plea to all present and all others that we seriously need to guard ourselves against falling into the pitfalls which other states have fallen into. We must not deceive ourselves that those threats can escape us. We are as much capable of doing misfortunes to ourselves as groups or between groups as we have realised is happening in Liberia. there factors belonging to particular tribes seems to be a license for other tribesmen to kill. This is what is happening there where individuals have been hareheaded because from their features or attire they look like they belong to one particular community. I think we have been lucky and we must be thankful to God that we have come this far andwe must maintain the peace and stability that prevails in the country. I would therefore, like to call upon everybody to condemn those calling for multiple parties because it is very obvious that the real issue is not that they believe in such a system; that is absolute nonsense. This is a camouflage and we must condemn it.     Thank you.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. BULYAAR: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to join my colleagues in contributing to this very important debate. As other hon. Members have already said, there is no room in Kenya today for multiple parties. It is clear from the actions of Kenyans that most of them do not entertain such an idea and they have also realised that multiple parties bring bloodshed, tribalism and anarchy. All in all, we are not ready for multiple parties. Those who are advocating multiple parties are day-dreaming. This is because they are growrtups and were there when we had the multiple parties. They sn saw a lot of bloodshed because people were thinking and acting along tribal lines. But after Independence and the formation of the one-party system of Government, there was peace and stability. We are members of one family which is what a one-party sytem of Government is all about. Kanu is now our tribe.                                                                                    Kanu is our Mother and has done a lot of development in all corners of our country. Therefore, we should not listen to these few elements who are misled.Sir, I want to thank His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for this good Budget. I am sure now that all Kenyans are relaxed and can look forward to 1990/91 financial year with some hope. Let all the leaders in this country do as much as they can so that the money that has been given to each project is put into use as per plan. When projects are proposed we request Ministers and Assistant Ministers and also officials in the Ministry to see to that they are implemented and the accountability is done properly. In many cases, funds have been misappropriated and projects are not always implemented on time.    Sir, just going back to my Constituency, we are grateful to the Ministry of Tourism and wildlife for what is being done, especially in Marsabit District. we have quite a number of nationalreserves in Marsabit District and we want the Ministry to also considerthe people who live among wildlife. Wildlife is very important to our economy. But also most of the land in Marsabit District, which is national reserve, is arable land. It is the best land in the district. Some national reserves cover almost 90 per cent of sons locations, especially Kalala sub-location which has 9.6 Kilometres of land set aside for people and the rest is for wildlife. I would like the Minister for Tourism and Wildlife to see that more land is given to wananchi for farming. During dry seasons these people depend on famine relief from somewhere else but their land is good. I am sure it would be able to support them if they were allowed to cultivate the land.    Also, Sir, we have very few boreholes in Marsabit District. Some of them are not operating at the moment, especially Halisiwaborehole in Laisamis Division which has not been operating for the last five years. Every year the Ministry of water development has allocated funds for drilling new boreholes ana also rehabilitating old boreholes, but I do not know what they have been doing for the last five years because the only borehole in the whole of the location has not been operating for all those years. I would, therefore, like the Ministry of Water Development to consider all those areas where they had projects and somehow they are not operating due to some problems, say, mechanical or otherwise. They nrust treat those projects as priority and the money that has been allocated to those areas must be used for those projects which have been there but for some reasons they have not been operating due to some mechanical problems.    Sir, I also want to talk about Isiolo Moyale road. It is a very important road which links Nairobi and Addis Ababa. All commodities from Nairobi to Moyale and then to Marsabit District have to pass through this road. For the last few years we have had good relationship with our neighbour and this road is very important to us In fact, from Addis Ababa to Moyale the road has been tarmacked and the people are very happy. So, I would like to urge the Ministry of Public Works that while we are waiting for funds for this road to be tarmacked, we would like the Ministry to nrurram the road so that it is passable. We would like commodities to those far areas of our country to reach on time, especially Laisami Marsabit, Moyale and also North Horr. All the murrain now has been swept away after the rains. The road is passable but it has a lot of corrugation. All the businessmen have vehicles or lorries which are on hire-purchase and before they repay the money their lorries are already out of use. So, the Ministry of Public Works should look after this road properly.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</NEWSPEECH>                                                                                                <NEWSPEECH>MR. MURUKIA: Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda. Ningependa kutoa shukrani kwa Makamu-Rais na Waziri wa Fedha kwa vile alivyoleta makiso yake ya pesa ya mwaka huu. Tukia ngalia Makisio ya pesa ya mwaka huu tutaona kwamba hayamgusi yule mtu wa kawaida ambaye tunamlilia kila mara. Lakini imekuwa ni mtindo wa Makamu-Rais na Waziri wa Fedha tangu alipochukua jukumu la kutoa Makisio ya pesa kuwa na mpango kwamba kila mtu ambaye ana uwezo achukue jukumu la kulipa kodi lakini wale watu ambao hawawezi wanaachwa kando ili wajipatie chakula. Hii ni shukrani kubwa sana kwa Makamu-Rais na Waziri wa fedha.Pia, tukiangalia mambo ya Bajeti, tungeomba kusiwe na ile mini bajeti kwa sababu hii ndiyo inawaumiza wananchi sana. Wakati mwingine inaletwa katikati ya mwaka na inakuwa ni shida na kuwaumiza watu wetu wa kawaida. Ingawa Makamu-Rais na Waziri wa fedha ameleta njia za kupata pesa za Serikali, ningeomba kitu kimoja. Ni lazima kuwe na mpango kamili wa kulinda matumizi ya pesa za Serikali. Kwa miano, kwa upande wa shule, pesa zinaku- sanywa lakini ukaguzi unafanywa baada ya miaka mitano au sita na kadhalika. Hii inakuwa ni shida sana. Ikiwa ukagui utafanywa baada ya miaka mitano, je utasaidia nani? Hata mwenyekutumia pesa atakuwa ameondoka kwa hivyo, ningeomba njia za matumizi ya pesa za Serikali ichunguzwe zaidi ili wananchi wasiendelee kuumia.    Kuhusu wakulima, ingefaa wafikiriwe sana. Ikiwa hatufikiria wakulima katika nchi ndiyo maana tutazidi kuagiza vitu kama sukari, mahindi, ngano na kadhalika kutoka nje. Ni lazima tuwe na mpango wa kuwasaidia hawa wakulima wetu kwa sababu kama wakulima hawasaidi itakuwa ni vigumu kuipatia nchi hii cnakula. Shida moja imekuwa nibbarabara. Hata wakati barabara zilikuwa zinasimamiwa na Serikal za Wilaya zilikuwa nzuri kuliko leo. Kwa hivyo, ningeomba Wizara ipatie Serikali za Wilaya pesa kidogo ili zitengenezwe barabara Lakini kwa wakati huu ikiwa ni kuuliza Nairobi isaidie, mtu ambaye anakaa Ng'arua atawezaje kujua mambo ya </NEWSPEECH>    <HEADER>ADJOURNMENT</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY- DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva): Hon.

Member that the generator of Kinango Hospital has not been declared obsolete. The Ministry of Public Works has inspected the generator and has recommended it for repair as it is still economical. As a result of this, a quotation No. 1.16. Vol. 3/3/89 was floated and bids were received on 20th May, 1990. The documents are with Kwale District Tender Board awaiting adjudication. As soon as the adjudication is finalised, repair work will be carried out.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I asked a similar Question in 1988, and the same Ministry gave a reply to the effect that this particular generator was beyond economical repair. Now, since 1988 we have stayed without a generator and the doctors there cannot do efficient operations. I do recall that in 1988 we were promised that a generator stationed at Wesu Hospital would be brought to Kinango Hospital. How come that I am being informed that the generator has been examined and found repairable, when in 1988 I was told that it was beyond economical repair?</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, when you look at some of these machines, they appear to be very complicated. You need a specialist to look at a machine of this nature before you can declare it obsolete or otherwise. What I am saying in this House is that the generator in question has been inspected by a specialist from the Ministry of Public Works and he found it still repairable. The machine, therefore, will be repaired.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. MIS0I: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, my hon. colleague hats said that this particular equipment broke down two years or so ago. Can the Ministry tell this House when exactly the equipment will be repaired? Even if it is comlicated, it cannot take two years to repair. After all, if it is so complicated, then we should not have it.</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is true that the machine was thoroughly inspected by a specialist and he told us that the equipment could be repaired since it is still economical. I wish to assure the House that the machine will be repaired and work.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ANASWA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is a bit confusing because the hon. Member has said that in 1988 the same Ministry inspected the particular machine in question and declared it beyond economical repair. We are now getting an answer that the machine can be repaired. Is it the Assistant Minister who is telling the truth or is it the hon. Member? Can the Assistant Minister confirm or deny the statement that thei machine was inspected in 1988 and found to be beyond economical repair?</NEWSPEECH>        »    »' -                                        <NEWSPEECH>MR.

During the 1989/90 Financial Year, the Ministry of Public Works brough specialists who inspected that machine---------------- </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR..BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I had complained yesterday that we are not getting proper answers from the Assistant Minister. Could you, therefore, help us, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. In this respect The same Ministry inspected that machine in 1988 and proved that that generator was beyond economic repair. Now we are being told that the same Ministry inspected the generator, and it is now in good working condition. Now which is the proper answer? We are confused.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Health inspects human beings. The doctors under a my Ministry inspect patients but not machines  therefore, the hon. Member cannot say that my Ministry inspected that generator.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: From 1988 to 1990 is now two years. During those' two years the patients attending that hospital have having been offering a lot, because when an operation is going on and there is a power failure, some problems areas As a results some peoole have lost their lives. What is the Ministry doing right while waiting the tender to be processed the patients?</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: I do understand, and I hope that this House also knows that not all patients are operated on. Again I have not received any information to the effect that there were some patient who were supposed to be operated on using that machine, and; that the  hospital could not transfer them to other hospitals With such a machine.We have not yet received such information. However; "Sir," that machine has already been inspected. It has been found out that is still economical and therefore , it will be repaired. But in the meanwhile before the machine starts working or before it is repaired and tested, we shall transfer patients who need to be operated to other hospital where the machines are working and specilalsts can attend to them.</NEWSPEECH>    	    <HEADER>Question No. 2 59</HEADER>    Payment of Dues to the Ministry’s Ex-Casual Workers    <NEWSPEECH>DR. MISOI asked the Minister for Environment and Natural Resources why the former causal employees of the Ministry working at Nabkoi-Congalo Forest station have not been paid their total dues as per the Forest Officers’ letter Ref. N0.6/1/VOL.XII/367 dated 4th June, 1986.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. Hemed): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.    The casual employees were not paid due to the fact that the Ministry did not have funds to pay the casuals at that time. However, the Ministry is taking urgent steps to get funds from the Treasury and subject to the funds being made available, the casuals will be paid at once.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>DR. MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Assistant Minister is not answering the Question, which is on behalf of over 200 casuals previously employed by his Ministry, and whose payments were supposed to have been made five years ago. The amount involved is not high. It is Ksh. 30,100 according to the records of 18th September, 1985, when the officer in-charge wrote to the Ministry that these casuals should be paid. Could the Assistant Minister tell this House when those people will be paid ? some of them may even have died after suffering a great deal when exactly will they be paid? Was it omission                                                                                     in the employment of the casual workers?</NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. HEMED: Mr. Deputy Sneaker, Sir, in the first instance, the District Forest Officer, uasin gishu did not have the approval of the Permanent Secretary of my Ministry, to engage those casual workers. He engaged them on his own accord. Afterwards, the Ministry decided to pay those casuals, but since then the ministry didn’t have money to pay then we have requested treasury to give us that Money. The Ministry is doing its best to get that money from the Treasury. Once we receive that money the Ministry will pay the casual workers immediately, although we regret the time factor involved.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister tell us the action that his Ministry took against the officer who employed those casual workers without authority from the permanent secretary?</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. HEMED: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry supcharged the District, Forestor, Mr. Gatundu, but before he could pay that money he resigned from Government service. He was later re—employed in the Ministry of Energy. Measures have been worked out for him to repay that money, but we shall not wait for him to repay it we are trying to get money from the Treasury and pay the casual workers, and later surcharge the officer.</NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: It is not the problem of the workers to know  whether the district forestor was authorised to employ or not. Since the district forestor was an agent of the Ministry, could the Assistant Minister be specific enough and tell us when those workers shall be paid and how much? He should not tell us that the Minist is trying to took money, We are not asking for their trial. Can he tell us when they will be paid and how much money shal. </NEWSPEECH>                                                                                            <NEWSPEECH>MR. HEMED: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the amount of money to be paid is well known, Even the hon, Questioner knows exactly how much money will be paid to those casual workers. The amount of money that they will be paid is Kshs.30,1OO/  Since there is no vote provision for the Ministry vote for such payments, and those casual workers were recruited without the permission of the Permanent Secretary, who is the accounting officer, my Ministry is trying to get money from the Treasury to pay those casual workers. Once that money is received those casual workers will be paid immediately. We cannot say the exact time, but it will be as soon as possible.<HEADER>Question_No.250 </HEADER>    Weekly Flights By Kenya Airways To Garissa TownMR.

Is the Assistant Minister now denying that what the office of the President has authorised in writing is not his Ministry's responsibility? </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. OMIDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, collective responsibility is very much in force, and it is always there. If the hon.

WASIKE-NDOMBI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Question must have taken a few days in the Ministry of Education, but the Assistant Minister now comes to this House unprepared and without a satisfactory answer, only for the hon. Questioner to supply him with information. Has the Assistant Minister not taken any pains to find out the correct answer to this Question? </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. OMIDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Questioner simply asked the Ministry to direct the Teachers Service Commission to release the money. We have checked and verified that the TSC has not received the money.                                     Therefore, the Ministry cannot instruct the TSC to release money that has not been received. I have told the House that if the hon. Member can give us any further information he may have on this issue, we will take steps to initiate investigations. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for the Assistant Minister to expect the hon. Member to do homework for him? I would have expected the Assistant Minister to ask the hon. Member to lay whatever documents he has on the Table of the House so that the investigations can be commenced by the Ministry. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. OMIDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is the hon. Member who did not do his homework properly because he should have certified that the money had actually been forwarded to the TSC. I have said, and repeat, that if he can give us the information he has, we are prepared to go into the matter further. </NEWSPEECH>         <NEWSPEECH>MR.

The Questioner has said that the payments were forwarded from the office of the President to the TSC and he has quoted the relevant voucher numbers used in the transaction. What the Assistant Minister would have done is to simply contact the office of the President for that voucher which is quoted in the letter. </NEWSPEECH>     <NEWSPEECH>MR.

Mr. Arte's Question is No. 275, according to the Order Paper, but he has asked Question No. 215. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR.

However, I will now ask the correct Question. </NEWSPEECH>        <HEADER>Question No. 275</HEADER>    <HEADER>Fate of Kotile Water Project Funds</HEADER>    MR. ARTE asked the Minister for Planning and National Development what happened to the funds allocated to Lotile Water Project under the Rural Development Fund Programme (R.D.F.) in 1985/86 as per Minute No. 16/85 of Garissa District Development Committee (D.D.C.) meeting held on 8th June, 1985.     <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Ogle): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.    During the 1985/86 Financial Year, Garissa District was allocated a sum of £9,750 from the R.D.F. Garissa D.D.C. was requested by this Ministry to prioritise and recommend projects to benefit from the Fund. The D.D.C. met on 8th July 1985 and recommended 13 projects, one of which was Lotile Water Project. However, after the cost estimates and technical expenses of all the 13 projects were carried out, only eight of them could be funded and Ltile Water Project was not among them. The project's estimated cost was over Shs.600,000/=, which was the maximum ceiling allowed for an R.D.F. project. Although the project was deferred for funding during 1986/87, Garissa D.D.C. never mentioned it again, which may indicate its change of priorities on projects recommended for R.D.F. funding. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. ARTE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the same project was approved by the D.D.C. on 8th July, 1985. However, could the Assistant Minister tell us what the estimated cost of Lotile Water Supply is? </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. OGLE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I have said, the project will cost over Shs.600,000/=, which is over and above the ceiling for any R.D.F. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. SALAT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell the House what the ceiling is for any one R.D.F. project? </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. OGLE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not have that information with me here now, but I promise to provide the hon. Member with it at any time later. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. ARTE: Mr. deputy Speaker, Sir, could the hon. Assistant Minister tell us in which division these eight projects funded by the R.D.F. at that material time are located? Could he also give us their names? </NEWSPEECH>            <NEWSPEECH>MR. OGLE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the eight projects funded by the R.D.F. during the period under review were Jarajara Water Project, which was allocated £16,500; Young Muslim Association Farm Project, Balabala Cattle Dip, Ali Njugu Dispensary, Northeast Girls Secondary School Science Laboratory, Gorayale Borehole, Korakora Dispensary and Staff House and Korakora Irrigation Project. </NEWSPEECH>    End <NEWSPEECH>MR.

WASIKE-NDOMBI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, is the Assistant Minister satisfied that this amount is enough? This is because due to some kind of bureaucracy in processing applications for shooting films in this country the film industry is shifting down to Zimbabwe. What is the Ministry doing so as to arrest the situation? </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. LIJOODI: Mr; Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is not aware of any delays in the processing of requests for shooting films from overseas companies.

Dhanja Brothers, who was on site but by the time he completed construction of the Scheme the Kenya Power and Lighting Company had not supplied electricity in the area. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to know from the Assistant Minister, when this installation will be done by the Mombasa Municipal Council. When will electricity supplied in that Scheme? </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. MBORI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Mombasa Municipal Council is currently negotiating with the contractor so that he can complete the electrical part of the work. However, the Kenya Power and Lighting Company will connect the Scheme to the power as soon as the contractor erects the posts and fittings which include such gadgets as bulbs and holders and so on. </NEWSPEECH>                                                                                            <NEWSPEECH>MR.

MBORI: Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, these negotiations will not take very long. As soon as these negotiations are over, the work will start and the Member should be thankful. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Could the Assistant Minister tell the House how much money the Mombasa Municipal Council is going to pay. Dhanji Brothers for this work? I ask this question because people  paid money for electricity but they have been waiting for more than two years now in vain. The Mombasa Municipal Council is reluctant to give this project the attention it deserves. When will this installation work take place? </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. MBORI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question of the  Mombasa Municipal Council being reluctant does not arise at all. The Municipality has entered into negotiations, planning and so on.It should therefore be understood that the Mombasa Municipal Council is very serious about the completion of this particular project. To answer the hon. Member's question regarding the cost of installation, I would like to say that the work is estimated to cost KShs. 1,350,000.00. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR.

LEWA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Supplies and Marketing, the following Question by Private. Notice.    What plans does the Minister have to pay the terminal benefits of the former 2,000 employees of Kenya Cashewnuts Limited who were sent on unpaid leave on 16th February, 1990, and finally dismissed on 16th May, 1990? </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Mwenje): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.    The Government declared 2,030 Kenya Cashewnuts Limited unionisable workers redundant with effect from 16th February, 1990. This was as a result of financial problems that were caused by the  general mismanagement of the Company. The Government has already calculated the redundancy benefits for 1,030 workers who will not be re-employed by the Company when it is re-opened and this amounts to KShs. 25million. The redundancy benefits will be paid as soon as the money is available. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. LEWA: Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, the reply by the Assistant. Minister is favourable but not quite. These 2,000 people were sent away in February, 1990, and at that time there was no mention of redundancy. They were just sent on an unpaid leave. But today we are being told that they have been declared redundant. It is wrong to send people away from work without thinking of their terminal benefits. They are suffering; they cannot pay school fees and they cannot feed their children. They were given no notice whatsoever that they would be sent away. This is disturbing. Recently when the President was in Mombasa he announced that KShs.30 million  has been set aside for the rehabilitation of this factory. Why can some of this money not be used to pay these workers? </NEWSPEECH>    END.E..<NEWSPEECH>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is true that we shall have to spend about shs.30 million to re-structure the company. We shall also have to pay 1030 workers who were declared redundant about shs.25 million. The other 1000 workers will be re—employed when the company is re—opened. If this amount cannot be enough to pay all these workers, then the company will have to look for further funds when it starts operating to pay them. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. NDZAI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, when will this company start operating? </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the company will start operating as soon as the formalities are completed. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in his reply the Assistant Minister said that there were 2030 workers who were declared redundancy and that those who are going to be paid redundancy benefits are 1030. What about the other 1000 workers? </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is obvious that the 1000 workers will be re-employed by the company which means that they will not be declared redundant. They will be employees of this company. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH> MR. WASIKE-ND0MBI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the principle of redudancy is last-in-first-out. We have here 2030 employees who were laid-off and the company has decided to re-employ 1000. What was the criteria that was used to retain these 1000 workers? This is because the employees who had worked for this company for a longer period are the ones who should remain while the new arrivals are the ones who should leave. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the criteria used was: age; for those who were about to retire; productivity/performance of the worker, health and specialisation. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. LEWA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, .Sir, as I had pointed out earlier on, the employees were not involved in the negotiations at all. What formula was used to arrive at the amount of shs.25 million for terminal benefits of the laid-off workers? This is because to me, this seems like a very small figure. Was the figure derived from the number of weeks and years worked? This is because                                                I further believe that there should be an element of may be, one and half month for every year worked. Could the Assistant Minister explain the formula used to arrive at this figure? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, definitely every employee in that company had his own terms of employment which must have been stated out clearly in his letter of appointment. So, it is from these terms of employment that the figure was arrived at. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, sir, although the company declared 2030 workers redundant it now wants to re-employ only 1000. Could the Assistant Minister tell us whether these 1000 workers have been written letters calling them back for re-employment or are they still declared redundant? Are they officially on duty how? </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, even when it was operating the company did not require 2030 workers, but only 1000. These 1000 workers are the ones who will be retained. We cannot therefore say that the other workers will be called back to the company, however should the need arise, then we shall choose from those 1030 workers. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Gould the Assistant Minister respond to the supplementary question that I had raised? According to his reply he has said that about 1000 workers will be re-employed while 1030 will be paid their benefits. Could he tell us whether the workers who are going to be re-employed have been written letters calling them back to the company? </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. MWENJE: Not yet, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The letters have not yet been written because we have not yet finalised the formalities of restructuring the company. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I am going to allow just one more supplementary question. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. LEWA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has talked                                                                        of an agreement that was used to arrive at the figure of shs. 25-million Could he stipulate and tell the House what this agreement talks about? This is because, if the agreement is there, the Ministry should know what the clauses in that  agreement state. If he knows what the agreement states, then he should tell us and, on the other hand, if he does not know then he should admit it, go back and bring it to the House. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the terms and conditions of redundancy are very clear to each and every employee in this country. The Government will, thus, not go out of these terms and conditions. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR.

DEPUTY SPEAKER: Next Order. </NEWSPEECH>    <HEADER>MOTION</HEADER>    THAT, Mr. Speaker do now leave the Chair     (The Vice—President and Minister for Finance on 7.6.90)     (Resumption of Debate interrupted on 13.6.90)    <NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Do you wish to continue, Mr. Murukia? </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. MURUKIA: Yes, Sir. Ningependa kuendelea kutoka pale niliachia. Nilikuwa nikimpongeza Makamu wa Rais na Waziri wa Fedha  kwa Bajeti yake nzuri ya aiwaka huu. Wananchi wanalalamika sana juu ya bei ghali ya bia, malipo ya hospital na kadhalika na ingefaa mambo haya yaangaliwe. Kuna hudmna kama barabara, elimu na hospitali ambazo zilitolewa kutoka kwa serikali za wilaya na tungependa Serikali iangalie vile huduma hizi zinaweza kutolewa na serikali za wilaya. Kwa mfano, wakati barabara zilikuwa zikisimamiwa na serikali za wilaya, zilikuwa nzuri sana kuliko sasa. Hospitali pia hazikuwa ha ukosefu wa dawa. Ningependa kumuuliza Makamu wa Rais na Waziri wa Fedha atafute njia ya kuziongezea serikali za wilaya pesa ili ziweze kutoa knen huduma nzuri kwa wananchi.    Zamani, wananchi walikuwa na uwezo wa kuwauliza madiwani ni kwa nini. barabara hazipitiki, ukosefu wa dawa hospitalini na kadhalika. Lakini wakati huu, tunategemea makao makuu, Nairobi, peke yake. Hii  ndio sababu nasesa kwamba tukiwapatia pesa za kutosha, serikali hizi za wilaya zinaweza kufanya.                                                    kazi nzuri.Ingefaa pia Makamu wa Rais na Waziri wa Fedha aangalie juu ya ukaguzi wa pesa. Tunataka kodi inayotozwa wananchi itumike kwa njia inayofaa. Eakuna haja ya kuwatoza watu kodi na hali hawafaidiki hata kidogo. Ni-lazima kodi hiyo itumike kwa manufaa ya wananchi. Wale wanaotozwa kodi wanataka wapewe huduma nzuri, kama vile, barabara, hospitali na kadhalika. Sasa wananchi wanatozwa kodi mara mbili. Kwa mfano, wanatozwa kodi kwa njia mbali mbali na wanapoenda hospitalini, wanaulizwa watoe malipo. Ingefaa Serikali iangalie vile jambo hili litarekebishwa. Kodi inayotozwa wananchi pi ya hali ya juu na tungependa ipunguzwe pole pole kwa sababu mapato yao ni ya kiwango cha chini.Alipokuwa akisoma Bajeti ya mwaka huu, ms Makamu wa Rais na Waziri wa Fedha alisema kwamba kodi ya mapato sasa itakuwa ikitozwa nalfaida kutoka kwa wale ambao hawajalipa. Alisema kwamba faida itakuwa asilimia moja ya mapato hayo. Hizi ni pesa nyingi sana kwa sababu wale watakaotozwa kodi hii kwa mwezi mmoja ni wengi sana. Kama mtu hajalipa kodi, kile kingefanywa ni kuatoza faida mara moja tu. Ikiwa jambo hili litatekelezwa kila mwezi, basi itakuwa shida kwa wananchi.Kuhusu vyama vingi nchini, ningependa kusema kwamba hatujafikia wakati wa kufikiria juu ya jambo hilo. Nchi hli bado ni changa na hatuwezi kuilinganisha na Marekani ambayo imekuwa huru sa kwa muda wa miaka 200 au 300. Kwa hayo machache naunga mkono. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mrs. Ogot): Asante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika, kwa kunipatia nafasi hii ili niungane na wenzangu kumpongeza Makamu wa Rais na Waziri wa Fedha kwa Bajeti nzuri aliyosoma hapa. Bajeti yake ilikuwa nzuri kwa sababu iliwapa moyo wale wanaotaka kuanzisha viwanda seherau za mashambani ambajo watu wengi hukaa. Sasa itakuwa rahisi kwa wale wanaotaka kuanzisha viwanda mashambani kuleta mashine zao nchini kutoka nje.Tunafurahi kwa sababu bei ya chakula haikuongezwa katika Bajeti hii,THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mrs Ogot) Ctd:Ni lazima ikumbukwe kwamba akina mama ndio hufinywa zaidi wakati ambao bei ya chakula na vitu vingine inapandishwa. Tungependa Ofisi ya Makamu wa Rais na Wizara ya Fedha ifahamu kwamba aikna mama hawafurahii hali ya juu ya maisha iliyoko sasa nchini.    Ningependa kusema machache juu ya Wizara ya Viwanda na Wizara ya Vyama vya Ushirika. Katika mawakilisho yangu, Gem, tuna shida sana kwa sababu ya viwanda ambavyo vimeharibika. Kwa mfano, kile kiwanda cha sukari nyeupe kule yala kiliharibika miaka miwili iliyopita na sasa kuna ubishi kati ya I.C.D.C. na mwenye ki wanda. Kutokana na hayo, wakulima wana shida kubwa. Ingefaa I.C.D.C. na mwenye kiwanda hiki wapate suluhisho kuhusu jambo hili ili watu wetu waendelee kupeleka miwa yao katika kiwanda hiki.    Jambo lingine linahusu kabawa. Euu ndio wakati kahawa inachumwa kule Gem na sida tuliyo nayo ni kwamba tuna viwanda vya kahawa viwili katika upande wa Yala na Lunza iakini vyote vimeharibika kwa muda mrefu sana. Sasa imekuwa vigumu kwa wakulim kuikausha kahawa yao kwa jua. Ningeziomba wizara zara ya Viwanda, Wizara ya Kilimo na Wizara ya Vyama vya Ushirika ziwasaidie watu wetu ili kahawa hii.ambayo itatuletea faida kubwa isiharibike wakati inapokaushwa juani.    (Mr. Deputy Speaker left the Chair)     (The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mahihu) took: the Chair)    THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mrs .Ogot) (Ctd):    Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kuhusu barabara, kwa wakati huu barabara zote katika mawakilisho ya Gem hazipitiki; ni mbaya. Lakini namuomba waziri wa Ujenzi atusaidie kwa upande wa bara- bara ili nasi tuweze kusafirisha mazao yetu sokoni na  tuweze kuwalipia watoto wetu karo ya shule. Kwa miezi mitano sasa tangu mvua ianze barabara zote zimekuwa mbaya zaidi.    Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, sasa nataka kuingilia jambo la hawa wachochezi ambao wanataka kuanzisha vyama vingi hapa Kenya. Leo asubulii nilikuwa nikifungua mkutano wajakina mama  Kanu Maendeleo ya wanawake  ambao ni muhimu sana. Mkutano huu una- husika najakina mama ambao ndio wenye viti vya wilaya zote 42. Kina mama hawa walisema kwa kauli moja kwamba hawa jamaa wetu hasa Kenneth Matiba na Charles Rubia hawajui taabu za dunia maana tangu walipokuva vijana, wakati wengine walikuwa wakipigana na wakoloni, wao walikuwa masomoni. Wengine walikuwa upande wa wabeberu na baadaye tuliponyakua Uhuru waksingia kwa "easy life". Mmoja Katibu wa Kudumu na kuendelea na kazi aliyokuwa nayo wakati wa ukoloni na mwingine akawa "plot grabber" na kuwa Meya wa Jiji hili la Nairobi. Mpaka wakati huu hawa wenzetu hawaja pata shida; shida ambayoakina mama na baba wanapata katika sehemu za mashambani. Akna mama wamesema kwa kauli moja kwamba wamekataa katakata vyama vingi vyakisiasa maana vitaleta uchokozi na fitina. Hawa jamaa wetu walipokuwa ndani ya Serikali hii - wakiwa katika ndani ya Sunge hili walikuvwa wanaiheshimu Serikali hii. Lakini walipotoka nje, kwa uchochezi wao na pia kwa ajili yao wenyewe, sasa wanataka nchi nzima iharibike kwa ajli ya uchoyo na kiburi. Kina mama wamesema kwamba wanasimama imara na Mtukufu Rais hata ingawa kina baba wanataka kupayuka hapa na pale. Miaka hii kumi ya nyayo ndiyo imeleta "expansion" kubwa sana kwa mambo yaekina mama kwa Kenya nzima katika pembe zote.                                                                            Tunasema kwamba Mtukufu Rais amepanua elimu kwa a kina mama. Elimu ndiyo msingi wa maendeleo. Amefanya hivyo ili kuwawezesha a kina mama kuingia katika mipango mbali mbali ya maendeleo na tena kuwa- wezesha kushikilia kazi za hali ya juu, yaani kazi kuhusu "decision making" . Hii ndiyo sababu tunasema kwa kauli moja kwamba tunakanusha ama tunakataa hawa wawili wapewe nafasi ya kuzungumza na watu. Je, watawaambia watu wa Kenya nini? Je, watawaambia akina mama nini maana sisi tuliamka chini ya Mtukufu Rais? Hayati Mzee Jomo Kenyatta ndiye aliweka msingi wa nchi hii naf Mtukufu Rais Moi akachukua usukani na sasa tunataka kukimbia. Je, Matiba na Rubia watatuambia nini na watatuletea nini? wao wanataka kuleta uchokozi na tumekataa.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kati yetu ambao tunasoma magazeti tunaona vile akina mama huko Liberia wameshafunga mizigo yao  midogo kutatuta na  kubeba watoto migougouiua kwenda nchi jirani kwa ajili ya usalama. Mambo haya ndiyo Rubia na Matiba wanataka kutuletea, na tumekataa. Tunataka utulivu kwa watu wetu nyumbani na pia kwa watu wote Kenya nzima ili watoto wetu wasome na sisi tuendeshe maenaeleo ya nchi hii. Kwa wakati huu mtoto wako akienda shule una haki atarudi nyumbani jioni. Pia, bwana akienda kazini, una- jua atarudi jioni maana kuna utulivu. Sasa tumeshasherehekea miaka 30 ya utawala wa Chama cha Kanu na sisi hatuangalii nyuma. Tena, kwa rika lange sisi ndio tuliocna utengamano, fitina na ukabila wa vyama vingi, hasa upande wa Nyanza. Kwa hivyo, sisi  hatuko tayari tena kushikana mkono au kufanya harusi na wilaya yoyote ambayo itakuwa "hide-out" kwa hawa wachochezi ambao wanataka kuleta msukosuko na kuiangusha Serikali ya Mtukufu Rais. Kwa hivyo, nawaomba akina mama wote katika pembe zote za Kenya wasimame imara pamoja na Mtukufu Rais Chama chetu cha Kanu, na pia pamoja na Serikali ya Nyayo ambayo msingi wake uko katika nchi hii na kwa Bunge hili.	    Kwa hayo machache, naunga mkono. </NEWSPEECH>                                                                <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Ogle):  On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for hon. Mutiso to refer to me as "Manamba" when he knows that I am a very dignified hon. Member of this House? </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mahihu): I am sorry, I did not hear it. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MTETISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL HERITAGE (Mr. Omanga): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity also to contribute to the debate on our Budget  But, first, before doing so, I would like to take this opportunity to express my most grateful thanks to His Excellency the President for appointing me an Assistant Minister in the Nyayo Government in the Ministry of Home Affairs and National Heritage.  Sir, the people that I represent of Nyaribari Chache received the news of my appointment with great joy and I would like to take this opportunity to assure His Excellency the President of my loyal and devoted service to him personally as the Head of State and also to our Government.    Secondly, I would like to congratulate His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for an excellent Budget. It was fair and balanced, and also very well delivered. It is a key Budget for the development of our country.    Sir, before going into details on the matters of the Budget. I would like to associate myself with the sentiments and feelings that have been expressed in this House regarding the whole question of'multi-partism' or 'pluralism.                                w1ien Kenya attained Independence it took pains to think about the sort of system it would adopt and evolve. At that time it was a question of whether our philosophy was to be geared towards the west or East; there was a question of whether Kenya should go wholesale for capitalism or communism.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speakey Sir, in 1965, after a very long debate and a lot of consideration Kenyans decided that they would adopt what we call "African Socialism", which was well written and expounded in Sessional Paper No. 10 of that year. This meant that Kenyans, who had attained their independence through their own sweat and sheeding of blood, and who were determined under the late President Kenyatta, would evolve a system which was best suited to them, namely African Socialism.    Subsequently, the question of parties arose; we experimented with multi-parties but the experiment failed completely. We do not want to go for the same kind of experiment when we know that the result will be a failure. Therefore, asking Kenyans now to go back those many years ancl start considering repeating the same experiment, while knowing that the results will be disastrous, would amount to asking them to commit political suicide.	    I know that people have been asking whether we should or not follow other countries that have experienced changes. In fact, the whole question of pluralism has come up because of the events in Eastern Europe. However, right from the beginning Kenyans refused to follow other people blindly; that is purely on the basis of what they were doing. Kenyans have rejected the whole question of multi-partism and pluralism. His Excellency the President has travelled far and wide; he has been to Nyanza, Central, Eastern, Coast Provinces and everywhere in this country because he wanted to know the reaction of Kenyans                                                                        to the issue of multi-party system we know that people of Nyanza, Central, Eastern, Coast and Rift Valley Provinces have said "No", and will even continue to say a bigger "No", to multi party system In short, Kenyans have said "No" to multi-partism.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I remember when Mr. Rubia was the Mayor of Nairobi at that time I was the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs - his head had "grown" bigger than even the planet on which he was standing. He wanted a motor cycle escort from Muthaiga Roundabout; he even considered himself more senior than the late President Kenyatta. of course he knows his motor cycles were seized and they ended up as wreckage. Now Rubia's and Matiba's ideas will also end up in shambles because they have no basis, or foundation, in this country.    I remember not too long a time ago when the President was conducting a fundraising for a school in Rubia's Starehe Cosntituency - the President was forced to conduct a fundraising there because Rubia was spending more time in "expanding" his head than in giving service to his people - Mr. Rubia said, "Mtukufu Rais sisi Mwakenya—". So, what Rubia is propagating is no more than the "Mwakenyaism" in him; he is only using pluralism as a scapegoat. He and Matiba have gone beyond the limits. I think the Government should find out whether or not they are operating on their he own. The "disease" they want to spread in Kenya must be contained. If they have become contagious they must be put in some political quarantine so that they do not infect anyone. We know that these people are being pushed to say and do what they are doing. Somebody was talking about chopping fingers - I am sorry about it - but if multi-party system comes here, those fingers will not only be chopped but will be musticated. We must thus save situations before they "get out                                                                            "before the We get out of hand.    Mr. Matiba is now "blaming kanu and yet he was a life member of Kanu. When the party disciplined him he should have disciplined himself and asked the party to reinstate him. I want them to know that hon. Members of Parliament were nominated by Kanu and many of them are party officials in their own sub-branches. The hon. Members have expressed, on behalf of the constituents, the feelings of Kenyans about multi-parties at the grassroot level.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I can see that my time is running out, but before I finish, let me once again thank his Excellency the Vice President and Minister for Finance for the this year's excellent Budget which will enhance development.    With these few words I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATION (Mr. Mutwol): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute on this Motion on the Budget, I would like to start by thanking the Vice Presdient and Minister for Finance for the best Budget we have ever had. I do not want to repeat what other hon. Members have said about "mini budgets". I hope these will not come im about; everybody is happy with this year's Budget, but they are still wondering whether there will be "mini budgets" or noti after two or three months. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Eariuki): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Is the hon. Member really in order to allege that we have "mini budgets" in this House from time to time? I know, like any other hon. Member, that we have only one Budget Session in a year. I therefore do not know what the hon. Member means by "mini budgets because we have never had them</NEWSPEECH>                                                                <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER F0R TRANSP0RT AND C0MMUNICATION (Mr. Mutwol) Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sure that the hon. Assistant Minister knows what I am saying, but if he wants me to clarify, I am saying that there are normally certain price increases before the main budget comes. That is what I am saying should be avoided, otherwise this year's Budget was an excellent one.    Having said that, I would now like to talk a bit on the agricultural industry in this country. I would like to thank His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for reducing certain taxes that sure related to manufacturing in this country. It is my feeling, however, that taxation in the farming industry should be reduced as much as possible. Speaking as a farmer, I want to point out to the House that many farms in Kitale today have been abandoned, and many farmers have started growing wheat instead of maize because of taxation. The situation should be looked into with a view to assisting farmers. This country can export maize, beans and wheat if we assist the farmer to grow more of those crops. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, what I am driving at is that the spare parts for tractors have become too expensive for farmers. In fact, my feeling is that the prices of such spare parts and other farming implements should be controlled by the Government.    At this juncture, Sir, I would like to say something about state corporations. The time has come when we should look into those state corporations which do not generate profits. We have seen many corporations coming to this House to ask for external loans guarantees, and many a time the guarantees have been granted. I would like to say very categorically that any state corporations that do not make profits should not have their external loans guarantees approved. State corporations should make profits; they should not be looking for external loans unless it is completely necessary. Parliament has been used quite a lot to guarantee external loans,and at times the Government has been asked to repay some loans because certain parastatal organisations have not been able to make any profits. The time has come when we should look into the affairs of the parastatal organisations that do not make profits with a view to dissolving them.                                                                    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would now like to touch on the question of multi-partyism. I would like to say that the multi-party advocates in this countr; are not actually for multi-party government. There is something sinister about the whole affair, and there is something that the multi-party advocates are after in this country; they are not for multi-parties alone. If you look at these multi-party advocates, they have grown horns. If you look at Rubia and Matiba, they have something extra; all that they are after is not a multi-party government. They have gone beyond that. They have known that they have no followers. Even these licences Rubia and Matiba are asking for They are only asking for trouble so that Kanu Youth wingers go there and beat them up in order that they come up and say that the Government is inciting this and that. They must stop inciting Kenyans. They are inciting Kenyans so that when they are beaten up they will saythat the Government is bad. Do not forget that they are provoking the Government. You do not provoke the Government so that you get detained and then your masters overseas sympathise with you.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, these people want Amnesty International to sympathise with them and tell them that the Kenya Government is not good. They must stop provocation; they must stop asking for detention. This is an indirect way of asking for detention. They are asking for detention, or else let them say exactly what they want. If Rubia, Matiba and the rest have their own shadow presiden they should name him or her and then let Kenyans know what they are after. Otherwise they seem to have something in mind that they do not want to tell us. If they have anybody that they want to name as their own president, Kenyans would want to know who that shadow president is, otherwise they are not doing anything good for this coury. They must stop inciting Kenyans. Let them respect democracy. They have been around quite a lot and they know that democracy says that the majority shall rule. 99.99 per cent of all Kenyans have said no to multi-partyism. Who are these two people to tell this country that we need a multi-party government. They are not democratic and they have no respect for themselves and their own mother                                                                    Kenya is their motherland. I have never seen a son who comes, up and denies his mother. Denying your own motherland is just like denying your own mother. These people are denying their own motherland. They just want to us They know what happened during the traitor issue, and they are taking us back to that issue. They know very well what happened then, and we are not prepared to go back. They also know what happened to "The Change-the—Constitution Group". Kenyans have learned quite a lot and we are not going to be taken back. History has taught us quite a lot.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, what is required about Matiba and Rubia— They are sick because of too much wealth. They are dreaming because of wealth and they are swimming in wealth. A Parliamentary select committee should be appointed to look into the property of these two people. I have no property in Nairobi. Not even a single shop. Somebody just comes up, because he has a lot of property in Nairobi, and says that we want a multi-party government. That should be loked into. Let their properties be known and let us have some of the property. The time has come when everybody should account for his wealth. If you acquire wealth through dubious means, you have to account for it. We did not know about their property until they started swelling up. They are really swollen because of property. I did not know that rich people can really grown horns and fight the poor, knowing that the poor are weak. You cannot fight the poor. There should be a committee appointed to look into the property of these two people. I want to know how much these people own.    The issue of money banked outside this country should also be looked into. Both Rubia and Matiba have money banked outside this country. This money should be probed and brought back to this country. If they took the money unfairly from the poor man of this country, it should be brought back here.    Lastly, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me talk about the Church of the Province of Kenya. I would like to congratulate the Catholic Church and the Africa Independent Church and other churches for the stand they have taken on                                                                    the issue of multi-partyism. But the Church of the Province of Kenya has something in mind that we do not know. They are collaborating with Rubia and Matiba; there is not doubt about that. This church should come out in the open and tell us why they are fighting us. Who are they fighting? The very Christians who worship in the CPK churche's are our own people, except that they are misled by a few individuals like Reverent Njenga. He is just doing nothing except to tell lies and fools us as if we cannot read between the lines and tell the truth.     Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other thing that should stop is the kind of music that is being played at the moment. You just have to board a matatu and hear some kind of music which was not there previously. Some peopleare playing music which, to me, has tribal connotations. If Kalenjins play their---- </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mahihu): Hon. Mutwol, your time is Up. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Thank you very mucly Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir for a giving me a chance to contribute.    Sir, before I turn to the Budget Debate, I would like to say that economic stability can only be realised through political stability. Sir, it is very unfortunate  that people who are challenging the political system today,like Matiba and Rubia are the beneficiaries of the political stability which has been prevailing in this country. I do not know what is wrong with those two former as Ministers. They are the people who have benefiteduand acquired a lot of wealth because of political stability. Sir, His Excellency the President has every Constitutional right to continue to be the President of this country. The Vice-President  and Minister for Finance has the Constitutional right and the qualifications to continue with his duties. Sir, today our country is only facing economical problems but we do not have any political problems. We have democracy in our country. We have got  a Parliament where we can express our views, but we know some countries do not have Parliaments.        Sir, Matiba and Rubia are very rich. In fact we have very few people in this country who are as rich as Matiba and Rubia. These two people are challenging the  Government not because they have any problems, but because they are very rich and they do not know where they can take their riches. Sir,I would like to call upon to the industrialised countries which give us loans not to listen to people like Matiba and Rubia, as far as giving of loans andaids is concerned. Sir, we do not believe in imaging leadership. They should be told that we are all behind President Moi. Somebody said that the Rift Valley Province will                                                                                                                                    Say a very loud “No” to multi-party system.That loud no will not come "from Rift Valley only because President Moi is supported by the whole country. President Moi has support from even Central Province, Eastern Province, North-eastern Province, Coast Province, Rift Valley Province and the Nairobi area.Therefore, we should not talk about support from any specific province the President has support from the whole country. </NEWSPEECH>         <NEWSPEECH>AN HON. MEMBER: Even Nyanza Province! </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Yes, even Nyanza Province. He has got support from every province in this country. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mrs. Ogot): On a point of order, Mr. temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it in  order for the hon. Member who is contributing so well to say "even Nyanza Province" when he knows that area is the heart of President Moi. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Sir, we have seen the problems which have been faced by our neighbouring countries which have experienced political stability. If we have political instability the foreign investors cannot come to invest in our country. The debate which is going on right now is very shameful, because His Excellency the President says something today, and Rubia and Matiba say something else tomorrow. Sir, as Members of Parliament, we cannot sit down and watch things happening. If it were not for the Budget Debate which will run for seven days, I think we should have moved a Motion of national importance, to give Members of Parliament a chance to speak about what is happening today. Sir, our Constitution does not say that the President should come from a certain community                                                                                                                        It say’s that the president can Come fcom anywhere in the country provided that he is elected by the people like President Moi.    Sir, I would now like to turn to the Financial Statement. Since I came to Parliament in 1983 I think this years  Budget was the most acceptable budget that the Vice-President and Minister for Finance has ever given. The Vice-President and Minister for Finance cared very much for the common man. He set out a strategy to promote exports. He said credit support shall be given to those small exporters and the Central Bank of Kenya is making arrangements to secure those credit facilities through export bills. That is a very important point, especially to the indigenous people who want to export goods. Sir, we should have external markets so that we can realise economic growth. Unless we have external markets where we can sell our goods, we should not expect economic growth beyond 5.1 percent.	        Sir, we should sell our potatoes and horticultural produce to Uganda, Tanzania, Britain and any other country where we can get a market. Sir, we should have external markets for our goods so that we can earn foreign exchange. Unless we do that we shall not have enough foreign exchange to finance the import of capital goods. Sir, I would like to point out that there are some categories of businesses which must be left to the indigenous people. It is very shameful to see Mr. Shah owning a cafe or a cafeteria in Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu or in any, other town in Kenya. Why should those small businesses be run by Asians. The Ministry should categorize some of these businesses. They should be left to the indigenous Kenyans. These small businesses should be left to the indigenous black man the office of the vice-prisident and                                                                                                                                Ministry of Finance should categorize some of those businesses. One day I said that we should go to the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance and count how many Shahs and Patels go there everyday compared to the indigenous Kenyans. We should address ourselves to the indigenisation policy seriously. We should address ourselves to the problems facing the man who fought for our Independence, and who will become a victim if there will every chaos in this country. Sir, those Shahs, Patels, Matibas and Rubias shall run away if there is chaos, and leave the indigenous people here. We should address ourselves to the problems of the farmers. The coffee tea, cotton and horticultural crops, farmes are  the people to earn foreign exchange for this country.        Sir it is not proper for a farmer to go to the hospital and only to be turned away because of the structural adjustment policy  the cost sharing system. We should take care of those farmers because they are the people who export those goods and also feed our population. The farmers should be given a chance to auction their produce in Mombasa so that we can get the foreign exchange earnings back.MR. KILIKU (Ctd.):I call upon the Government to direct that this cagetory of nets "business be given to the indigenous"because if we are left at the mercy of free entrepreneurs, that we are going to continue to experience under cuts from time to time from the rich business tycoon. Our indigenous traders have no capital to compete with these tycoons and eventually they will have to fall out of business. So, it is important for the Vice-President and Minister for Finance to be able to categorize these businesses and give a free hand to the Minitiy of Finance distribute businesses to the indigenous Africans who axe able to manage them, By doing this, I am sure the Government would be going out of its way to assist the people </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR CO-OPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Cheruiyot): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my colleagues in congratulating His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for the very eloquent Budjet Speech which he presented to this House on the Budget Day. In this Speech, he surprised the hoaders who were hoarding goods in anticipation of price increases of the various commodities.    Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,before I start my speech, I would like to pay my greatest tribute to His Excellency the President because tk of the various probe committees that he has instituted recently, particularly in the tea and coffee industries. I know quite a bit about this because most of the co-operative societies which fall under my Ministry are from the coffee industry, As we all know that many of the small-scale coffee farmers have not been receiving payment for their coffee because there has been a lot of mismanagament in the coffee industry. There was lack of speed in anything that was being done, but due to the wisdom of His Excellency the President, he instituted a probe committee to look into the affairs of coffee management which has now revealed a lot of mismanagement which has resulted into "big losses of money in the coffee industry. This probe committee is still going on and therefore, I do not need to talk much about what they have so far revealed. This was a very good exerciseo                                                            THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CO-OPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Cheruiyot )(Ctd.):addition to that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, His Excellency the President did not just stop at that stage, "but also made sure that payment to the coffee farmers was speeded up. I would like to thank him for what he did at Embu last Saturday when he directed that Shs.7 million "be delivered for payment to coffee farmers there. He has monitored this exercise to make sure that the small scale coffee farmer gets his payment promptly and according to the a coffee he has delivered. Never before, Sir, have I witnessed management of this kind and therefore, I would like to pay the greatest tribute to His Excellency the President for "being mindful of the plight of the small scale fanner who has been hard hit the get rich quick attitude of' some people in the coffee industry.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other thing that we benefited  from this Budget, particularly in the co-operatives was the decontrol in the price of fertilizers. There was a lot of apathy because most farmers had threatened to abandon farming. I come from a wheat and amaize growing area and I know that many farmers have been threatening to pull out of farming due to the prohibiting prices of fertilizers. The price of fertilizers had gone up so much that a poor farmer has to sell two bags of maize to be able to buy one bag of fertilizer. However, when the prices were decontrolled, still the enemies of this Government were saying that the prices would automatically shoot up therety gansarr causing a problem in the farming industry. The price of fertilizers was reduced by 23 per cent and immediately all the co-operatives were very happy because the distribution network was implemented and production increased immediately and I would therefore like to pay tribute to His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for finance for ensuring that this is done promptly.     Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, another very important gesture by His Excellency the Vice-President in being mindful of the plight of the small-scale farmer, was the creation of the rural enterprise fund. This fund g was created to stimulate the rural enterprises where there is high potential for the establishment of rural industries. For a long time, we have had                                                        problems in the small scale industries. Our small-scale traders in the rural areas have been relying only on district joint loans which have been very small. Under this kind of arrangement, traders are only given from Shs.10,000/- to Shs.50,000/- loans. In view of the economic situation in Kenya today, Shs.50,OOO/- is so small that it cannot buy enough stock to fill two shelves of goods in a kiosk. We feel that this fund will go a long way in boosting and motivating "business in the rural areas. Therefore, the I.C.D.C. has done well in creating this rural enterprise fund to the tune of Shs.150 million.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, what now remains is for the hon. Members to guide the district developement committees to make sure that there is fair distribution of this money to the small-scale traders. At the moment, there, is a problem of unemployment in this country, We have very bright boys who are graduates of polytechnics who, if assisted with a small capital, would be able to start small-scale enterprises to assist themselves. We are grateful to have such a fund because through it, these people could be assisted to start small-scale businesses. This is a very major is break-through in this industry.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, before I conclude my speech, I would like to touch on the Rubia-Matiba issue. I think we should even thank His Excellency the President because he was the first person to tell the nation that there are certain people who are advocating for a multi-party system of Government. The House would remember that when His Excellency the President was in a meeting at Kisii, he told us there was a traitor in this country and immediately, debate continued in this House which eventually resulted in the fall of Mr. Charles  Njonjo. In the same way, when His Excellency was in Kisumu, he said that there are two people who had obtained friendship with foreign masters and were receiving money from these overseas friends, and this was Matiba and Rubia. These people are dictators these people are power hungry and I think they are just interested in being sent into detention. When the President was addressing us in this                                                                meeting, he categorically said that these people cannot be given licences to address public meetings. However, these people are so courageous and arrogaht that they have decided to go ahead and apply for the said licences. I think they really want to provoke the feelings of good thinking Kenyans, and particularly, the President. They want to provoke him to a point where he will react and take any action against them so that they can start saying that there are no human lights in Kenya. We know what their plans are and that they are prepared to go out of this country in the event of any problems.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank hon. Members who have spoken openly in condemning these people. I would like to say that we are not going to stop here, but will continue to Kenyans about the evil designs of Rubia and Matiba. It is unfortunate that the church leaders who should be praying for peace and stabilityin this countiy, are colluding with these people. "We have more than 5,000 church services held on every Sunday in this countiy and one wonders how reporters ever get to know that there is a certain speech that is going to be delivered at a particular church.[The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mahihu) left the Chair][The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kiliku) took the Chair]THE MINISTER FOR CO-OPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT (CTD.):Some speakers just want to address reporters, who may only have come to cover a press conference. Why do the churchmen not preach to the reporters? May be the reporters are sinful and require to repent. These reporters are very good, and they can take in whatever is said to them spiritually. Why should these churchmen go on insulting this nation? We shall never rest; we are prepared all the time, day and night or whether it is raining or not, and we will keep on educating Kenyans that these people are ou tto cause chaos.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have Uganda neighbouring us and yet nobody has mentioned it although, because of multiple parties there, there is racial strife and tribal problems with people killing one another every day. You do not hear the British Broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C.) say anything about Uganda. We wonder why Kenya, which is so peaceful, should be singled out for attack. Reporters from all over the world come here and stay in our hotels surrounded by a lot of material to write on. Instead of praising us for trying our best in the continent, however, they say that Kenya is ripe for multiple parties.    With these few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. KIRWA: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chance to contribute to this very important Budget Speech by His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance. First of all, I must thank His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance on presenting this very good Budget that has balanced the entire economy of our country and all sectors of development. He has clearly stated in respect of agriculture thta farmers ought to be encouraged because agriculture is the mainstay of our country's economy. There are some areas which, if taken care of, are going to encourage farmers very much.    Firstly, there is sugarcane-growing. This year, I should thank the National Cereals and Produce Board because it paid farmers promptly this time. This practice should be encouraged to ensure that once the farmer deliver his                                                            farm produce, he is paid promptly. Farmers take out loans and these loans accumulate interest. So, if farmers are not paid promptly, loan interest is going to be very high. While we are loan interest, I would urge the Agricultural Finance Corporation (A.F.C.) to seriously look into the rates of interest that it charges farmers. We know that although agriculture is a business, it is not well paying. Many farmers carry out farming just because it has become a custom and a source of food. When you take a crop like maize, you find that the marginal profit that the farmer gets is nothing can enable the farmer to prosper much in maize-growing. So, the A.F.C. should review the interest it charges the farmer and give him some concession or subsidy.    There is also another anomaly when it comes, to taking out loans from the A.F.C. Farmers have two accounts: one in the stores of inputs, say, the stores of the Kenya Grain Growers Co-operative Society; and the other in the A.F.C. These two accounts accrue interest at certain rates, whereas the farmer pays everything from the sale of the same produce that he gets from his farm, this is almost like paying double interest. So, it would be good to amalgamate these two accounts so that the farmer is charged only on account.    In talking about loans and the profit margins realised by the farmer, I would like to say that it is very important for the Ministry concerned to review its policy and look for ways of trying to shield the farmer particularly from the five per cent that is charged on the production of his maize and other produce. If you charge five per cent on all that the farmer produces, you are also going to charge him on the interest that he is going to pay. So, it would be good for the Ministry to look for a way of knowing the net income of the farmer in order to charge five per cent on the net income rather than to charge" it on all that he take s to the National Cereals and Produce Board.    Going to the rural urban balance, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank His Excellency the Vice—President and Minister for Finance very much for making some proposals that will go a long way towards alleviating the                                                                problems that we have in our country. However, there are some few cautionary measures that we need to have in respect giving out loans. The beneficiaries of these loans should be seen to be diligent and honest people who are going to utilise the loans properly so that these funds may be recycled for the benefit of many more people; otherwise this may be a dead scheme if we only lend the money to the first group and the second group only to find out later on that there are no funds to revolve for other people to benefit. So, those who issue loans should look for very diligent people who are really ready to work rather than those are only ready to take out the money to do other things than the business for which it is designed.    The issue of youth polytechnics is very important because we cannot provide employment to all our people, and the Government should make a very deliberate move to see that a youth polytechnic is established in every district, if not in every location, so that many of our areas may benefit. The situation, as it is now, is that our present youth polytechnics are some how lopsided in the sense that some districts may have more than 10 or 50 such polytechnics when other districts may have only one or none. So, it is very, important that those concerned look into this aspect because much emplyment will be coming from our small—scale industries.    I would also like to thank the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for giving some tax exeption on equipment imported for Jua Kali industries and schools. This important sector is going to assist the development of our country. The Vice-President and Minister for Finance has given very good concession to the Jua Kali sector, but this is not enough unless we make sure that the equipment meant for the Jua Kali sector does not go through many middle men. I would suggest that the Ministry of Technical Training and Applied Technology, establishes a central pool to co-ordinate the movement of the equipment that is going to be sold to the Jua Kali sector in such a way that the receiver gets it direct from the supplier. If it goes through many middle men, this is going to inflate the entire cost of the equipment, the same goes                                                                    for school equipment The Ministry of Education should have a sort of system of centralising the School Equipment Scheme that used to be there it is still there today, but more theoretically than practically so that school may get equipment at fairly reduced prices.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, sir, a lot has been said about multiple political parties and the "death" days, and I would like to join my colleagues by saying just a few words in this regard. Firstly, I look at this debate as a blessing in disguise because it has acted as a bell to tell us who is with us and who is not. It has given us an opportunity to know where some of the people who used to shout "Nyayo, Nyayo" a few years ago are now. It has also given us a chance to do so some soul searching in order to see what we can do to improve our nation. Talking about this debate, it is unfortunate that when we are given the ball, some of us aim at the goal while others aim very wide. The most important thing, however, is to concentrate on the central issue, that is one party versus many parties. We should not take this thing as being ethnic because, as we know, all Kenyans support His Excellency the President, and it would be wrong for us tolump a community in one pit and say that the entire community may not be as loyal to the President as other Kenyans. We know that this is an individual issue in which some individuals are interested in leadership positions.            Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as it was ably put by the hon. Dr. Wameyo yesterday, the crux of the matter is not the introduction of another political party but the crux of the matter is that somebody somewhere wants a position of leadership. If that particular individual is interested in the Presidency of this country we should tell him that we as Members of Parliament recognize His Excellency the President alone; he is enough for us Kenyans.    Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the only saddening issue is the calamity that can befall our nation if these people are not handled very well. This is because there are very many innocent people in this country who do not understand what is meant by one party or many political parties. They know only Kanu as the political that formed the Government. These are the people that I sympathise with; I have a lot of sympathy for them because they do not Imow what is happening. If these things happen in the rural area The nature of our settlement is so intricate that if anything happened now in Kenya, it would not be easy to tell who is who in a particular community So, this is the only saddening fact. This is the only sad issue that is going to affect our nation.    But as they say, a conflict is not a problem but the major problem is how you resolve that conflict. We as Kenyans should now resolve the conflict of multi partie in such a way that at the end of the day no Kenyan will have lost anything. This is because what is important is that Kenyans matter; even Matiba and Rubia are just like the rest of Kenyans. We need to take care of them. The best way to go about it is to handle them with caution.    Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MAHIHU: Thank you very much, Mr, Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to join my colleagues in making contribution to the Budget Speech which was delivered in the House on 7th June, 1990, by His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance. I say this because the Vice-President and Minister for Finance, in his Speech, highlighted the importance of the agriculture industry. Agriculture is the back-bone of our economy. That being the case, it is very important that we must look into the problems that might affect the economic growth of this country. I would like to mention roads, The condition of the roads in this country has been deteriorating every year.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me draw the attention of the hon, Vice-President and Minister for Finance to the fact that coffee and tea are grown mainly in the rural areas the roads in the rural areas are not passable and particularly during the wet seasons, Let me also mention that during the next three to four years, Kenya will be the only country which will be relied upon to produce tea for the whole world and it is therefore important that this nation gives special attention to the rural in the tea and coffee growing areas. The tea factories should be expanded so that in the next few years we can deliver all the available tea to the world market. Last year tea alone earned this country KShs. 5.5 billion, A lot of tea has gone to waste due the poor condition of the roads so it is very important that this sector of our enconoagr is given a lot of attention by the Treasury so that by next year when we have the same kind of rains there will not be so many difficulties facing the farmers, At least the roads should be murramed if not tarmacked                                                                                    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,Sir,let me also mention another sector which also affects our economy. Here I am talking about water supply in this country, particularly in villages and areas that are visited by tourists.We have tourist resorts at the Coast but you will find that water supply to those areas is not very regular. I therefore hope that the Office of the Vice. President and Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Water Development will give special attention to the water supply. I know that the Vice-President and Minister for Finance has stated more than once that the Mzima Springs Water Pipeline will be rehabilitated. But let me say that rehabilitation is not enough; we need a new water pipeline to supply water to the North Coast and South Coast. This is because even if we rehabilitate the same old pipeline it will still be taking the same amount of water to the Coast. I think we should double the capacity.The Sabaki Water Pipeline needs special and very urgent attention if not an emergency attention so that the water supply to the Coast will be boosted. Let me also draw the attention of the Government to the question of foreign exchange. The companies that earn foreign exchange need to be given a certain portion of their earnings as a matter of their right so that they can buy spare parts. It is very important that those people who earn foreign exchange - when they apply to the Central Bank of Kenya are given special consideration." They should be given encouragement so that they can earn more foreign exchange for this country. We need foreign exchange to buy medicine. It has been said by hon. Members in this House that we have a shortage of drugs in Government hospitals and that patients are told to go and buy drugs from chemists. We would like drugs to be made  available in all hospitals. Therefore the companies that earn foreign exchange should be given encouragement by the Government by being allowed to retain a certain portion of their earings as a                                                                            MR. MAHIHU (CTD); matter of their rights. This is Very important.At the same time, Mr; Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have the difficult problem of unemployment. School leavers in this country need employment. At this juncture I would like to thank His Excellency the President for appoint an Employment Commission which is currently sitting. The aim of this Commission is to look into the question of employment in this country. Unemployment is the greatest problem we have in this country We have more than 0.5 million children in primary schools arid probably a very big number in secondary schools. We also have nearly 30,000 students in our universities. You will find that every year very many university graduates visit the Labour Exchange looking for jobs, We should set up programmes to look after the graduates who leave the universities. We should help them to get employment,    Mr, Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch on the local authorities service charge which was recently approved by this House, The Nairobi City Commission and the other local authorities are charging this tax to the people and they must all deliver the goods. It is very worrying to find potholes in the streets of Nairobi, Mombasa and many other towns. You cannot drive well because of potholes; you cannot enjoy the environment because of uncollected refuse Garbage has remained uncollected for many weeks. Since we have allowed local authorities to levy this tax, ex we expect them to render good service.            MAHIHU (CTD);    Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me touch on an issue that has been occupying our minds the multi-party debate. I was a District officer I in Kitale during those years when Kenya had many political parties. I speak from experience. At that time I was occupied with separating the warring parties. we have said enough on this issue. I think those who dream about multi-parties have heard what Kenyans want. Without the approval of this House there is no question of introducing political parties in this country. So, to discuss this question of multi-partyism is to discuss an illegality; it is an illegal issue.                                                                                                            These people even had impudence to apply for a permit from the Nairobi Provincial Commissioner to hold a meeting. They are, in fact, very lucky that I am not the Provincial Commissioner in Nairobi because if I was then this house would be passing a Motion here on the action that I would have taken.    Since, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Parliament has not approved change of the Constitution and therefore it is illegal to talk about multiple parties or to worry the Nairobi Provincial Commissioner. Fortunately Mr.Waiganjo was my student and will know how to handle them. I have a lot of confidence in him and know that he will act accordingly.    The other issue which I am going to talk about for record purposes is the Church of the Province of Kenya (CPK). The christian community in this country is a follows of the Nyayo Government. All christians, be they members of CPK or otherwise are Kanu members. Let us not waste our time on a few people who have gone astray. I am categorically saying that the CPK community of over 2 million members is follower  of the Government. The people we are talking about who have gone astray and are making noise here and there are just about three, four or five. As far as I know there is no quarrel between the church and the state; the relationship between the two is perfect. These people are very lucky in that they have access to the Head of State. If they have a problem they should not resort to the press; they should instead use the existing machinery which has existed since Independence to have access to the President. So, let us not create a situation where the foreign press might think that there is a crisis in Kenya because there is none. This is because all christians are followers of the Government and are members of the Party. I am a Life Member of the Party as well as a church elder. There is no conflict between the church and the state.    Nobody in this country, except the President, is above the law. If a person in this country irrespective of his position breaks the law, then the law should take its own course. I believe that is the approach we should use. I would like to appeal to the christian community in this country to stand firm behind the President, the Government and the Party so that we can continue enjoying                                                                the peace and stability that have had since Independence  With those few remarks,I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTE FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr.Ogle): Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ninatoa pongezi na shukrani nyingi sana kwa Mtukufu Rais kwa kuliongoza Taifa hili kwa busara hadi kutuwezesha kupiga hatua kubwa katika maendeleo bila matatizo yoyote. Ni kutokana na uongozi huo ndipo makamu wa Rais na waziri wa Fedha aliweza kupata fwsa au nafasi ya kuteletea Makadirio ya Mwaka, kama ilivyo desturi yetu hapa nchini. Hii ni kwa sababu hili jambo la kuwa na Bajeti kila mwaka nchini ni jambo geni kwa majirani wetu. Ni katika nchi hii tu ambako kuna siku maalum ya kuwasilisha Makadirio ya Mwaka. Kwa hivyo, tunahitajika kumshukuru Mungu na kumpongeza Mtukufu Rais kwa kutupatia uongozi dhabiti ambao umeifanya nchi yetu kuwa mfano kwa nchi nyingine ulimwenguni. Kutokana na uongozi huo ndiposa kuna usalama na udhabiti usio kifani katika nchi hii. </NEWSPEECH>    Sote tunajua kuwa ni kwa manufaa ya nchi hii na kwa vizazi vijavyo kuendelea kudumisha amani katika nchi hii. Hivi karibuni tumesikia na kusoma mengi magazetini kuhusu vyama vyingi vya kisiasa. Kwa maoni yangu haya si mambo mageni kwani tofauti iko tu katika utumizi wa multi parties. Njama za kuweka Serikali ya ukabila hapa nchini zilianza zamani sana. Njama hivi ziraeanzishwa na watu fulani wachache ambao nia yao ni kuwa na Serikali ya ukabila hapa nchini. Hii ni kwa sababu jambo hili limejaribiwa mara nyingi. Jambo hili lilianza tangu ule wakati ule wa wale watu wa "Change-the-Constitution", lakini Bunge hili hili likalikataa jambo hilo. Baada ya hapo kukawa na "Ng'oroko" ya kutafuta mkato wa kuchukua hatamu za uongozi wa nchi hii ambako kulikuwa na njama za kumnyonga Mtukufu Rais na viongozi wengine ili nchi. hii iwe na msukosuko; lakini hata njama hizi hazikufaulu. Baadaye kukawa na "Pambana" ambako kulikuwa kunachapishwa makaratasi ya kuchochea lakini jambo hili pia lilikataliwa na wananchi. Tena baada ya hapo kukaja "Mwakenya" ambayo nayo haikufunga goli. Hapo mwaka wa 1982 kukawa na najariboiya mapinduzi ya waziwazi ambayo hayakufaulu pia. Kukawa pia na njama                                                                 za kuziangusha financial institutions ili kuuhujumu wehumi wa nchi hii; lakini jambo hili pia nalo halikufaulu. Kwa hivyo, njama hii ya sasa ni desperate attempts ambayo ni kama zile njama nyingine nilizozitaja hapa. Kwa kusema kweli hii ya sasa ndiyo dhaifu zaidi kwani baada ya kuanzishwa haikuchukua hata siku tatu bila kungunduliwa.    Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, hapa nchini sote tuna uhuru wa kuabudu. Mimi ingawa ni mwiislamu ninajua wakristo wenzangu wanazingatia jambo sote tunajua kile mkristo aaminicho. Sote pia tunajua kitabu cha Mungu Kina sema nini. Hakuna mahali popote ambapo kitabu cha Mungu kinachochea ghasia Kuna madhehebu mengi sana katika dini ya kikristo. Ni watu wachache tu katika dhehebu la CPK ambao wana njama la kulifanya dhehebu hili liwe la kikabila. Kwa kuwa wakristo ni watu wa kumwamini Mungu wao, bila shaka njama hii haitafaulu.Baada ya hapo ningependa sasa kuzungumzia juu ya uongozi wa Taifa yaani Presidency. Katika nchi hii tunayo Katiba na kunazo desturi kuhusiana na utawala wa rais. Urais si jambo geni katika nchi hii. Hii ni kwa sababu tulikuwa na Hayati Mzee Jomo Kenyatrta, mwanzilishi wa Taifa hili. Yeye ni mtu ambaye tulimheshimu hadi dakika ya mwisho. Pia hadi leo tunamheshimu. Uongozi wa Mtukufu Rais Moi, kama ule wa Hayati Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, hauambatani na mashariti yoyote. Hii ni kwa sababu hata yeye aliutwaa uongozi wa nchi hii kupitia mpango ule ule uliowekwa na Hayati Mzee Jomo Kenyatta. Moi hakupitia mlango wa nyuma bali alichaguliwa na wananchi. Kama kunaye Rais ambaye alichaguliwa katika Bara la Afrika, basi ni Rais Moi. Mtu akisema kuwa yeye hafai ati kwa sababu ni wa kabila lingine basi mtu huyo atangoja sana. He will wait for many many years. Mtu huyo atangojea mpaka amee ndevu. Ingawa watu wengi wanasema ati kabila fulani ndilo kubwa hapa Kenya, ningependa kusema kuwa hakuna kabila ndogo hapa Kenya.Kabila la Somali lina watu wachache lakini wakali sana    (laughter) IKifikia maneno ya tfafrika, haki ya Mungu ni wakali Hii ndio sababu nasema ingefaa tuheshimiane. Ni uhalifu wa wazi wazi kwa mtu knjaribu kubishana na cheo cha Mtukufu Rais. Kama Kenyatta hakubishwa, ni kwa nini Moi. abishwe? Ingefaa uchochezi huu ukome.    Hizi kanda zinazochezwa huko River Road, ni hatia chini ya sheria. Kanda hizi zimetoka Wizara ya Habari na Utangazaji na zina nchoro wa court of arms. Ile sheria ya national flag, emblems and names Act inaweza kutumika juu ya kanda hizi. Sheria inasema wazi wazi kwamba kama kanda hizi ziko na mchoro wa court of arms, nakala haziwezi kutolewa na kuuzwa kibiashara. Ingefaa hatua ya haraka ichukuliwe na wale polisi wa patrol wanausipata kanda hizo, ni lazima wajue kwamba kuna sheria amoayo inakataa uchezaji na ununuzi wa kanda hizo. Kwa wale ambao hawaijui sheria hii, inapatikana katika Sehemu ya tatu (a) na (c).Wengine wetu ambao si mawakili husoma vitabu vya sheria kwa minajili ya maslahi ya nchi hii.    Ni vizuri tukae pamoja kwa amani na kila mtu ale ule mkate ambao Mungu amenroatia. Ninawaonya wenye magazeti kwamba wakiandika uvumi na kuchochea ghasia, hawatakuwa na pahali pa kuuza najuo ndio utakuwa mwisho wao. Kwa hivyo ni jukumu la wenye magazeti kutumia ule uhuru waliopewa kuhubiri mambo ambayo yataleta amani nchini.Ingefaa tuheshimiane kwa sababu kabila zote za Kenya ziko sawa. Hata kabla mambo ya vyama vingi kuanzishwa, unwingine ambaye hana haya kama vile tuliambiwa na Mhe. Muregi alihojiwa na BBC na akasema kwamba kabila lake ni 'superior’. Je, mtu kama huyo akiwa kiongozi, wale Wakenya wengine watakwenda wapi. Kwa hivyo, ni lazima uchochezi kwa Mtukufu Rais ukome leo. Hii ni kwa sababu cheo cha rais kina desturi yake.     Kwa hayo machache, naunga mkono. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Bomett):  Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir I also rise to thank the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for the able manner in which he presented this year's Budget.    I would like to stress one or two points with regard to agriculture. This is because, agriculture, as the Vice-President and Minister for Finance is the mainstay of this country. It is important that horticulture is strengthened in this country because it is a sector that can employ a lot of our people in the country. The only way to strengthen it is to make sure that there is adequate transport to ferry horticultural products, such as, flowers, vegetables and fruits to the temperate zones of Europe. It is important that we not only use aircrafts to transport horticultural, products abroad but also to ensure that they import what we need in the country In that way, we will be asn able to assure the horticultural farmers that there will be adequate aircrafts to transport their produce abroad.     Having said that, I would like to join the other hon. Members in the on-going debate on multi-parties versus the single party system of Government. I think it is not even legal to talk about multi-parties because it was passed in this House that we shall have only one political party and that is Kanu. It is very disheartening and questionable why anybody in this country finds faults in Kanu. There is only one explanation to that, in the name of tribalism.    A political party is a vehicle which politicians use to acquire power. We know that those who would like to have another party are doing so because they want to get means of getting rid of Kanu Government. We know tha the aim of these people is to get rid of the presidency of President Moi. This is very well known. The reason why they are doing this is not because President Moi is not able.    In fact, ve have not seen an African President who stoops so low to the ground to listen to what a child has to say. Who would have wasted his                                                                time to listen to a sick woman by the roadside? What sort of man do we need? Our President has travelled up and down and there is no district that he has not been to. If that were not so, the elected representatives in this House would have complained. So far, nobody has opposed the work of His Excellency the President.    These people who are doing these things are doing so knowingly. I will not say that this matters only evolve around Matiba and Rubia but it is an organised institution which is, indeed, tribal. If it is not an organised affair, why is it that there are cassettes now being played in the streets of Nairobi? I have one of the cassettes here which also bears the national court of arms This cassette was meant to remind us of the late jomo Kenyatta who was loved by all the tribes of Kenya. He was not a tribalist but the President of the Republic of Kenya until his death. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND HOUSING  (Mr. Bomett) (Ctd.): We loved him very much. But people are trying to reduce him to a tribalist He never died a tribalist He died a Kenyan and, first and foremost, he died a leader of Africa. These people who are doing this are bringing the Court of Arms into disrepute. What are the police doing? This is the Voice of Kenya allowing the sale of the cassettes while it is one of the Ministries of this country. There is also another cassette here which is written in Kikuyu. It says "I came to destroy peace in the world", or "Thina wa Gicagi kia Muoroto"!     Sir this is incitement. They are inciting the people of elected Kenya against the elected Government of this country. How long shall this he accepted? How long will this he tolerated? If blood is spilled in this country, who knows that this will not be the blood of your child?Sir, we are going too far. This is not a question of partie This is tribalism. They are trying to tie Kikuyu. Kikuyu are the people of this country. They are our people. They are not here to be tied and to be put in jeopardy. I feel that the Government ought to act right now. It is also shameful that this is being done, in the streets of Nairobi during the day when the police are going round and also we have the Nairobi Provincial Commissioner who is actually in charge of security in Nairobi. We ask how far do they want to push us. How far do they want to push us?    I am an elected representative from Nakuru. I am elected by Kikuyu. My voters are Kikuyu and have nothing against the Kikuyu. They are our people. But these people are inciting them. Was it by mistake that somebody complained the other day that the portrait of the late President should be hanged this or that way?  Why complain at this particular time.and not before? What choice?     Sir, we cannot be fooled any longer. This is becoming more sinister. I would like to say that it is high time these people                                                                    were stopped. This is actually a very clever way of doing things. It is being people who are psychologists. I am a teacher by profession and I know how to play around heads of people. These people are actually doing what is more serious than using a gun because they want to incite the people to hate the Government. This is an elected Government of this country.    Sir, the youth of this country who were born recently may think that hairing another party or several parties will be a good thing. No! We know that this will bring bloodshed and chaos. We also know, that this is not what is required in this country. In fact, in Rumania after many years, they are now fighting again. In Yugoslavia they are almost disintegrating and we do not want that in Kenya. We must put a stop to all this debate.    Thank you,Sir. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT  (Mr. Chesire): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Hon. Bomett produced two cassettes which bear the Court of Arms and the National Emblem. He further told us that these two cassettes which bear the Court of Arms of the Republic of Kenya are being sold in the streets of Nairobi along River Road. Could he tell us whether the sellers of those cassettes have any authority to sell them Whether the copyright holders printed here have authorised such a sale? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND HOUSING (Mr. Bomett):  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was just passing through the streets of Nairobi and I heard the voice of the late President, Mzee Jomo Kenyatta. In the middle of the speech there was also the National Anthem being played. In fact, I stood momentarily because I thought that His Excellency the President was passing by. Whether these people have permission to buy and play the cassettes publicly I cannot explain. </NEWSPEECH>                                                                        <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT  (Mr. Ogle):- On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. There is no doubt about the illegality of the selling of the cassettes because on the cassette it is clearly stated, and I quote:-    "All rights of the producer and the owner of the work reproduced reserved unauthorised copying, hiring, lending, public performance - which is the case now and broadcasting of this tape is prohibited". </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE  (Mr. Kariuki): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. We would like more clarification on these cassettes because they are a reproduction of a record that was cut by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. So, the clarification we would like to have from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting is whether they are the producers of these cassettes and, if they are not, whether they have already authorised any individual to publish these cassettes like hon. Ogle said, there is writing on the cassettes that all the rights are preserved by the producer. Who is the producer of the cassettes, whether it is the Ministrer  Information and Broadcasting or an individual? It could well be a production of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and, if so, was it authorised? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL  CO-OPERATION  (Mr. Obure): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. This appears to be a fairly grave matter, and in the light of the sentiments that have been expressed by hon. Members in this House, which I fully share, I would like the Chair to order that a full statement be made to this House, indicating the authority for the production of the songs and also whether the Minister of Information and Broadcasting has fully licensed the production of these cassettes I think we are entitled to this information as a House. </NEWSPEECH>                                                                        <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT  (Mr. Chesire) : On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the point that was mentioned and which was very Serious is the playing of the National Anthem in the streets. There is a very specific law regarding the playing of the National Anthem. It is not something that you can play anyhow and anywhere.      Therefore, I think, everything aside, whether there is going to be a statement or not from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on the matter, the fact that the National Anthem is being played in the streets of Nairobi is a very serious and grave matter which requires immediate attention by the police, the Attorney General and everybody else who is concerned. This country cannot be taken for a ride. We cannot allow the National Anthem to be sung anyhow. That matter which is very grave must be brought to an immediate end right now. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kiliku):  Now that everybody has expressed his sentiments on the matter, I call upon the Assistant Minister for Information and Broadcasting, hon. Kachilla, to comment on it. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. ole Kaparo): On a point of information, Mr. Temporar; Deputy Speaker, Sir. I would just like to inform the House that it is unlawful for any persons, or a group of persons, to misuse, or abuse, the national flag, Anthem and emblem. In my opinion, the playing of  the national Anthem, as if it were pop song is a grave abuse to it Cap 199, which protects the national flag, emblem and Anthem, makes it an offence for anybody to abuse, even by conduct, the national flag, emblem and Anthem. What is at issue here is not the legality of the issue, but is the prosecution of the distributors, peddlers and the players, even those who do it in their homes. This is because you can play the National Anthem, even in your own. House, as if it was pop music the National Anthem must receive its due respect both during the daylight and night.    Also the law does not allow even the Ministry, or else for that matter, to distribute it as if it were pop music. This is a matter of grave concern and I think the right thing to be done is for the Government to move swiftly against the distributors and players of the National Anthem who have been treating it as if it were pop music. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kiliku): Let us give the Assistant Minister for Information and Broadcasting, hon. Kachilla, a chance to comment on the matter. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Kachilla): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Honestly this is a very serious matter and we are also taking it    very seriously. In fact when I heard all these songs in the streets I was shocked and I even interviewed one of the sellers, but I did not get a precise answer. So I as requesting hon. Members to give us more time because we are investigating the matter and we will bring our findings here. This is a sensitive matter because reproduction of original material like music without authority is prohibited. We will have to find out the source of this music and this is why I am requesting that we be given more tine and we will report back to the House. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KAMUYU: On a point of order, Mr.Temporary Demity Speaker Sir, This is a grave matter because it toucnes on the national security and also the position of the President Could the Minister in charge of internal security take action to ensure that playing of this music is stopped tonight? Can we also have assurance that immediate investigations will be launched into the matter because this is direct sabotage? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION  (Mr. Munyi): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. As other hon. Members have Said, this is a grave ana serious matter. Right now if you go to River Road you will hear the National Anthem being played by people who have uterior and malicious motives. It is a known fact that every time the National Anthem is being played, even at the Chief's district officers and district commissioners offices, people must stand up as a sign of honour to the National Anthem. We must be patriotic enough to let everybody know that the National Anthem signifies respect for our nation, which we are proud of So, those who intend to sabotage what the Government is doing must be exposed and punished. Thank you, Sir. </NEWSPEECH>                                                        <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE  (Mr. Kariuki): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister for Information and Broadcasting has clarified the matter; he has said that this is a production of his Ministry, which produced the original record. Now, will the Assistant Minister tell us that his Ministry will treat this matter as theft  in fact thair is what it and that appropriate steps are going to be taken? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPEMENT (Mr. Ogle): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Depaty Speaker, Sir. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kiliku): Order Hon. Kachilla, although you have Promised to give more details on this issue later, would like you to tell the House whether you will take any action against the culprits. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BOARDCASTING: (Mr. Kachilla): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I said earlier on this is very serious matter and if we take it lightly we will not get to know the culprits. I am assuring the House that we will have to get the culprits. This is a duplicate of the original record that was produced by the Ministry and will have to know where the duplicates are being made. Hon. Members know that dubbing machines are many these days, but we will have to know where the dubbing is being done. With regard to national security, the only solutions for the Government to invade the places where these cassettes are being sold. That all I can tell the House now. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT  (Mr. Ogle): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy- Speaker, Sir. </NEWSPEECH>                                                    <NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kiliku); Order Since the Assistant Minister has promised to issue a statement on this matter, I think we have to move on. Mr. Said-Hemed, continue please. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES  (Mr. Said-Hemed): Ahsante sana Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda kwa kunipa nafasi ili nami rutoe maoni yangu juu ya Bajeti clyosomwa hapa na Makamu wa Rais na Waziri wa Fedha. Kwa hakika, Bajeti hii ni nzuri sana kwa sababu itawasaidia wananchi wa kawaida sana. Ni matumaini yangu kwamba hatukuwa na bajeti nyingine ndogo ndogo ambazo zitapunguza faida ambazo zinatokana na Bajeti ya mwaka huu.                                                                                                    Kuna mambo yanayoendelea juu ya hawa watu wawili ambao wanajifanya kuwa mabwana wakubwa katika nchi hii hata kuliko Rais wetu. Hawa ni watu ambao wamekwishaamua kwamba hawamjali mtu yeyote. Bunge hili likipitisha jambo fulani hawa watu wawili hawajali; Mtukufu Rais akitoa uamuzi juu ya jambo fulani hawajali na chama cha Kanu kikitoa uamuzi fulani hawajali. Wanajifanya kuwa wao ni </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Ogle): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Much as I would not like to interrupt my hon. colleague, and in view of the fact that we attach a lot of importance on matters pertaining to national security, here in my possession is another cassette which I think should be taken in line with the other one. This is also a highly seditious cassette. Could the Assistant Minister for Information and Broadcasting also look into it? </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>AN HON. MEMBER: What is the title of the cassette? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT(Mr. Ogle): It is titled "Muoroto 25.5.1990 - We Shall Not Forget this History". </NEWSPEECH>    (Hon. Ogle laid the cassette on the Table)        <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. Said- Hemed): Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, watu hawa ndio wanaosababisha mambo haya yote: mambo ya Muoroto cassettee; mambo ya Hayati Mtukufu Rais Kenyatta; mambo ya Wimbo wa Taifa kupigwa ovyo ovyo barabarani na mambo ya kutumia Alama ya Serikali kwa njia isiyofaa. Ukifanya uchunguzi, utakuta kwamba ni hawa watu wawili na wengine ambao hawajajitokeza ambao wako nyuma ya vitendo hivi ili wazoroteshe amani ya nchi hii na Serikali yetu chini ya uongozi wa Mtukufu Rais Moi. Watu hawa hawa wawili walikuwa Mawaziri wakati mmoja, ile hali sisi hatujapata nafasi hiyo. Je, watu hawa wawili wanataka kutuambia kwamba kama wangekuwa Mawaziri leo wangetoa maoni ya aina hii? Je, wangekuja hapa Bungeni kama Mawaziri kutuambia kwamba wanataka vyama-vingi vya kisiasa? Ama ni kwamba kwa sababu sasa hawana ofisi yoyote ya uongozi ndipo wanaongea namna hii? Je, wanaonge'a wakimwakilisha nani? Tunataka kuja wanamwakilisha nani, hata ikiwa ni welfare organisation. Yafaa watuambie                                                                                           THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. Said-Hemed)(ctd.): wanazungumza wakimwakilisha nani. Ikiwa ni chama cha siasa, hawamo; ikiwa ni katika Bunge hawamo na hata hawana welfare organisation. Je, wanazungumza wakimwakilisha nani?        Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, mmoja wa watu hawa wawili alikuwa katika Bunge hili watu walipofanya uamuzi wa kuwa na chama kimoja cha kisiasa na kuibadilisha Katiba kusema hivyo, na aliliunga badiliko hilo la Katiba mkono kusema kwamba Kenya iwe na chama kimoja cha kisiasa. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>HON. MEMBERS: Wote wawili! Wote wawili! </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. Said- Hemed) : Naam, wote wawili walikuweko hapa na wakaliunga mkono badiliko la Katiba lililokifanya chama cha Kanu pekee katika Kenya. Wakati huo hawakuinuka na kupinga badiliko hilo la Katiba kwa sababu walikuwa na bendera. Leo hawana bendera na yafaa wajue kwamba hii ni dunia. Leo unaweza kuwa Waziri, kesho uwe katika Viti vya Nyuma na kesho kutwa ukarudi kuwa Waziri. Historia ya Kenya inaonyesha kwamba kuna watu wengine ambao wamefukuzwa chamanai na baadaye wakaweza kurudishwa na kuwa Mawaziri. Kwa hivyo, hawa watu wawili wangestahimili na wakati wao ungefika. Lakini hawa ni watu ambao wamekwishaamua kuichafua nchi hii. Wameanza kuchochea watu kwa kutengeneza kaseti za aina hii ili kulichajua Jiji la Nairobi na Serikali yetu tukufu naona imewapa nafasi kubwa sana. Maoni ya wananchi yanajulikana Kenya nzima, na siku ya Jumamosi ijayo barabara zote zitalenga Nakuru ambako Mtukufu Rais atakuwa na mkutano wa hadhara. Huo mkutano utathibitisha kwamba matakwa ya wananchi wa Kenya wote' ni kuwa na chama kimoja cha kisiasa na kwamba hawawaungi mkono watu wanaotaka vyama vingi hapa nchini.        Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ikiwa hawa watu wawili wanajaribu kuanza kuwa— chafua Wakikuyu, yafaa waelewe kwamba katika Kenya Mkikuyu ndiye aliyeanzisha maoni ya kuwa na chama kimoja cha kisiasa hapa Kenya. Ikiwa Wakikuyu Rubia na Matiba si Mawaziri leo, yafaa waelewe kwamba nafasi zao zilichukuliwa na Wakikuyu wenzao. Uongozi katika nchi hii waweza kuchukuliwa na mtu yeyote. Mimi leo au mhe mbori tukifanywa Mawaziri tunaweza kuendesha kazi. Tuko karibu watu 200 hapa na hatuwezi sote kuwa Mawaziri. Kwa hivyo, ukipewa nafasi kuwa Waziri, mshukuru Mtukufu Rais                                                        THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. Said-Hemed) (ctd.): na akikuachisha kazi mshukuru pia kwa sababu amekupa nafasi kuwa Waziri. Katika historia yako itasomwa kwamba kuna wakti ulipokuwa Waziri katika nchi hii. Usijaribu kuchakufa nchi.    Bw. Saibu Spika wa Muda, hali ikichafuka katika nchi hii Rubia na Matiba ndio wataumia zaidi kwa sababu wana mali mengi sana. Wana mahoteli, nyumba na biashara. Je, sisi tuna nini? Ikiwa wanafikiri kwamba mchafuko Kenya utawaletea manufaa, wanazidanganya nafsi zao wenyewe na wanawadanganya wale wanaowaunga mkono. Umefika wakati ambapo ni lazima Serikali iweke mguu wake chini na kufanya uamuzi juu ya watuhawa wawili ili kusimamisha uchochezi hapa nchini. Hatukubaliani na uchochezi. Ni lazima mambo haya yakome. Leo wametoa kaseti ya Muoroto, kesho watatoa ya Hayati Mzee Kenyatta na kesho kutwa watatoa kaseti ya aina nyingine. Ikiwa jambo hili halitasimamishwa kwa haraka na wanaohusika kupelekwa mahakamani na kushtakiwa Hata yafaa yule aliye na haki za hizi kaseti ajulikane na ijulikane ni duka gani linalotoa kaseti hizi na ni nani wanaolipa gharama ya kuzitoa.        Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, nikishasema hivyo, nataka kusema kwamba Wahe. Wabunge katika nchi hii wana jukumu kubwa la kuhakikisha kwamba miradi ya Harambee ya kujenga shule, hospitali, na mingineyo imefanyika katika nchi hii. Inatakikana Wizara ya Elimu ijitolee na kuongezea juhudi za wananchi ili kuwaonyesha kwamba pia Serikali inataka kuleta maendeleo.        Kwa hayo machache, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, naiunga H:oja hii mkono. </NEWSPEECH>    END.......S    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Mbori) : Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chance to join my hon. friends in congratulating His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance, for the very able way in which he presented the  1990/91 Budget Statement.Sir, Kenyans, should consider themselves extremely lucky to have been given a God fearing leader in the person of His Excellency the President, who in his foresight saw it fit to, Nominates prof.sartoli as the vice president and Minister for Finance because for the first time he shall be remembered for having presented, a unique Budget. I have said that it was a unique Budget because in any given year, when a budget is about to be read, people expect shocks and surprises. Sir, this year, for the first time, the Budget was for the common man,  The Budget for various reasons had no shocks or surprises, took care of the welfare of the 90 per cent of Kenyans who live particularly in the rural areas.    Sir, after 27 years of Independence, our country has been presented with a Budget which will be remembered, for a long time to come. The Budget has taken of the vast majority of our people who do not earn more than kshs 20/- per month. That Budget has not shocked or frightened anybody for the first time. I hope that the Vice-President and Minister for Finance shall not introduce mini—budgets later which will cause surprises and shocks.    Sir, for the last five months, rains in Kenya have been very heavy and they have also caused a lot of damage. Most of the earth roads in the rural areas have been washed away and damaged.    Some of those roads have been damaged, so badly that they have become impassable. The Ministry of Public Works has got a lot of work to do all over the country. There is one road in South Nyanza, C26, namely Oyugis-Kendu Bay Road which has become completely impassable. I am sure that my hon. colleague from Karachuonyo will support me on this I find it difficult to visit wanache when it rains because when we drive, along that road, we get stuck. Some people in that area say that, maybe, they do not have Members of Parliament, and yet, most of us use that road, some of us are Assistant Ministers in this Government. I trust that the Minister for Public Works has enough manpower to  repair such roads, after they have been damaged by raust. Such roads can easily be repaird I would, therefore, like to appeal to the Minister for Public Works to be repairing those roads, during rainy seasons, so that passenger vehicles can move with ease unless that is done, wananchi will continue to suffer They will also not able to reach the main centres of communication  where businesses is done. Since man is in social natural animal he  requires contact which is very necessary.Sir, having said that I would now like to turn to the current state of affairs in the country. This Budget seems to have come at the wrong time when the country is debating a, highly political matter, namely single party system versus multi party system Sir, this is a political country, and therefore, we should talk politics. Those who read the history of this country know very well that in 1982, the Constitution was amended in this august House to extent that Kenya became a dejure one party state. I am not a linguist , but I believe that a de jure means by law" – if I am wrong, my hon. friends will correct me. A de jure one partymeans "by law". It is unfortunate that my good colleagues who had been here, in the Cabinet knew that Kenya was a de jure one party state. They are actually testing the ability of this august House. We, as individuals can die, just like our other friends have died we can also be voted out by the public, but this august House will live forever and the institutions for which it stands will remain clean. They will not be tarnished by a few individuals who think that because they are not in Parliament, Kenya can suffer or because they were not elected to come here, Kanu is wrong.    Sir, I would like to inform those people that we have got a holy trinity in Kenya - a political holy trinity headed by His Excellency the President. That political holy trinity is supported by Kanu and by a  Government which was popularily elected. Who are they individuals to destroy that holy political trinity? You might be drunk with power and wealth, but you will later vomit them because you are just an individual. You cannot go against the solid solidarity which is behind His Excellency the President of the Republic of Kenya and go unnoticed, I do not see why those people should be given political quarantine so that they do not longer person the rest of Kenyans. The law regarding detention has not been amended It is still exsiting. I would therefore, like to appeal to His Excellency the President and the Government to take deterent action against those disgruntled fellow. They are drunk with their wealth which is not helping us. Why should they be spared at the risk of 24 million Kenyans? They should learn that this country is guidedTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr.Mbori)(ctd.) ;by a very strong solid belief, that we have an excellent leadership in the person of His Excellency the President who takes care of everybody. Those people who had been in the Cabinet believe that they can penetrate every where They have been deceived, they are day dreaming Kenyans are not day-dreaming. However thinks that we are same as used to be in 1963 is day dreaming. He should know that the political understanding of the ordinary man in the countryside has risen 50 per cent. It is more than what it was 27 years ago. Those people should not believe that they will get some characters who will want to follow them. That will not happen. </NEWSPEECH>	    (END....T)<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Mbori) (Ctd.): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this should, serve as a very good lesson to our good friends who are trying to betray the constitutionally elected Government of His Excellency Daniel arap Moi. Our President is an excellent leader who cannot be compared with any other leaders in the continent of Africa. I think it is correct to say that he is a man of all seasons; he is a man for all that we need and I wonder who else we need in this country. We have seen these two gentlemen as Cabinet Ministers and we knew their weaknesses. We know that they are grabbers and did many other bad things and I do not know why they think we have forgotten all about this so we can now vote for them. We do not need a referendum in this courtly to show that His Excellency the President is the only President in this country. This has been proved in the provinces when the President has been holding meetings there. If this is not enough proof for these people, then they must be blind and it is time that they opened their eyes to see what achievement Kenya has made through the wise leadership of President Daniel arap Moi. We do not need to hear anymore from these people.    With these few remarks, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. ole Kaparo): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this — — — </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kiliku): Before you continue, Mr. ole Kaparo, perhaps I should ask hon. Bomett to lay the cassette; he referred to on the Table. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. BOMETT: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will lay the cassettes on the Tables now although my intention was to do so later since I cannot walk easily. </NEWSPEECH>        (Mr. Bomett laid the cassettee on the Table)    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. ole Kaparo): Iwould also like to contribute to debate on the Financial Statement which was ably presented by the Vice-President and Minister for Finance. The Budget this year does not have much to be said about because it was a very good Budget; it is a Budget that is going to promote rural investment; it is    a Budget that is export orientated and it is a Budget which is general terms, is a Budget for growth and development.        Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, any budget can only be meaningful if it has the necessary atmosphere upon which it can operate. You may have a very good budget but if there is no atmosphere of peace, that budget will be absolutely useless. I am saying this because for any meaningful development to take place, any country would require peace amongst its wananchi. This is why hon. Members are talking about the current debate now going on, not because they, have nothing else to talk about, but because they have great interest in peace ana stability in their country. We as leaders have interest in our stable country Kenya now and in the future so when we talk about the advocates of the multi-party system, we have a good reason to do so. However, there is one thing that I would like to tell these people, namely that before they begin talking about as a multi-party system of Government, they must have the legal standing upon which to advance their argument. If for example you wanted to start a second or third political party tomorrow, and presented your application documents to the Attorney-General or the, Registrar of Societies, all he has to do is to look at Section 2 (a) of the Constitution of Kenya and then write back to you and tell you, that According to the Constitution of Kenya, it is completely illegal for him to register that party. That is all he has to say.        Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sure that the people who are now talking about a multi-party system of Government are not ignorant of this fact. However, I would like to make it absolutely clear to them here and now, that this country requires peace for development. We also require unity of purpose in this country to be able to build upon mat we already have. Every Kenyan should know that the best he can invest in in this country, is peace and stability and those who are aversed to that idea have done all the investment they require, however, they do not want others to do the same. Here, Sir, we are talking about individuals and I would like hon. Members to understand this very clearly. We are talking about individual who want to                                                                             rock the boat due to their selfish interests. They want to rock the boat make because they know that when it is steady, they cannot get a chance to make their evil machinations to take effect. It is in the rooking of the boat that they will be able to put into effect their evil aspirations. However it is important to note that as Kenyans, we are all in this boat and therefore, let nobody be misled into thinking otherwise. We are all in this boat which is called. Kenya. Right now, we are in living in peace and stability and we must decide what our priority today is. Is your priority as a Kenyan a multiparty at your home of Government or is it safety? Is your priority to get clean water at your home and a good road leading to your shamba or is it fear and alarm. To be able to get health facilities and to educate your chidren, you require peace and stability If these two things were put before you and you were given a chance to choose whichever you like, I have no doubt in my mind that all Kenyans would choose peace and stability. It is in this light that I say we should talk about the individuals who are creating this problem.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am a lawyer by profession but I am a very loyal lawyer. I am a lawyer who is loyal to this country, to this Government ana to His Excellency the President, Sir, I am not alone as a lawyer in my commitment to this Government. I know there are hundreds of lawyers in Nairobi and elsewhere in the country who are iam loyal to this cache Government and to His Excellency the President and the ruling party Kanu. However, there are no doubt, a few lawyers  are disloyal and they too are not alone in that respect because I know there are also a few politicians who are notloyal to this Government. Similarly, I know there are some church leaders who axe not loyal to this Government and we must distinguish between those who are committed to this Government and those who are not. We should not generalize the matter azri. but should be able to distinguish between right and wrong. I am saying this because I honestly believe that the greatest majority of Kenyans in this countiy, irrespective of their backgrounds are absolutely loyal to His Excellency the President.                                                            THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. ole Kaparo)(Ctd.): Those people who think that they may get a following that will destabilise this country are not being quite honest with themselves; they are only playing games with the minds of Kenyans, but Kenyans cannot accept to have mental games being played against them. We need to be united in word and deed for a harmonious society that thinks only of Kenya.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if I may recall, history, of which I was a good student some time ago, Europe, for example, used to be ruled for many centuries by kings and queens without parliament to advise them. Its people used to say that that was a divine right from God. It was only recently that a constitutional government was established there, from which we copied our own Constitution. France took up to 1789 to remove King Louis XIV, when Napoleon took over leadership. Russia used to be ruled by Tsars for a long time. After the civil weir, America was ruled by one party for 40 years. Why was this so? It is because those countries wanted to create single nations out of a fragmented world. If those countries had that right to vote for themselves, why, in the name of God, should we not have the same right? In any case, who is the best judge of our own destiny? Is it not Kenyans? It is, indeed, Kenyans who are the best judges of what we require.        However, let us not be complacent and say that because we have said this, those concerned will hear us and keep quiet. Of course, they are not going to keep quiet. That is why we have all these things in newspapers and elsewhere. It is because these people have agents everywhere. So, we must be on perpetual guard as we say with loud and clear voices, "We stand for our nation, unity and His Excellency the President."    Thank you. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH> THE MEMBER FOR KISUMU TOWN (Mr. J.O.H. Omino): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for recognising me. I would like to compliment the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for presenting to this House an excellent and well-balanced Budget.I was told that when I stand up to speak in this House for the                                                THE MEMBER FOR KISUMU TOWN (Mr. J.O.H. Omino) (Ctd.):first time, I would be making what is called a maiden speech. So, I went to the dictionary to check what the word "maiden" means and found that it means, among other things, a horse that has not won a race, an unmarried virgin female, and something that has not been climbed or defiled. I am none of these things.         (Laughter)        I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that in his very well-presented budget Speech, the Vice-President and Minister for Finance kept faith in some of the landmarks of our economic planning and history.                                                                    Here, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I refer to Seasonal Paper No.10 of 1965 - African Socialism and Its Application to Planning in Kenya. I am an ex-civil servant as no doubt everybody in this House knows and in the 1970s we made an attempt to try and revise that document and I want to tell you that we failed. This is because the thought and the energy that was spent in drafting it was detailed and deep. It was no doubt rooted in African socialism itself.        The theme of this Budget has been very well treated and it is really difficult to find fault with al1 the provisions contained therein. But there are some other details which I think we would be failing if we did not draw the attention of the Vice-President and Minister for Finance to them so that he could give them consideration as the years go by. The appreciation of foreign currencies vis-a-vis the Kenya Shilling has had a devastating effects on some of our industries in as much as if you borrowed money designated in foreign currency you suffered tremendously. I would like to propose that the Vice-President and Minister for Finance should give consideration to absorbing that fluctuation so that the Kenyan business person who borrows money only has to pay the equivalent of the Kenya Shilling value of the foreign currency loan when he borrowed it.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the much talked about structural adjustment programme has done no less and I believe and I know that in fact it has made it impossible for the banks to expand credit. Without credit not many business people will survive in the present climate and I would like to urge His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance to consider relaxing the restrictions on expansion of credit so that                                                                                        fledgling businesses particularly those of indigenous Kenyans can be supported. Most of our banks have big accounts belonging largely to parastatals. I would like to suggest that where that is the case that element of facility granted to parastatal should be discounted for purposes of determining the amount of lending are allowed to give to local business people.        Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have a paradox in this country at the moment; that although the economy has not been expanding as rapidly as we wanted it to, the construction sector is expanding and I wonder whether in fact it is not because of public-supported programmes. If we want to have a good measure we ought to see it in terms of private investment. The Budget also draws our attention to the fact that for the first time our expansion in the manufacturing and services industry has outstripped expansion in agriculture. This is the direction into which we should go. This is because most of our agricultural produce, particularly tea and coffee, is susceptible to international price fluctuations over which we have no control. I would like to draw attention to the fact that if we do not rely too heavily on tea and coffee, we should spend a lot more money in promoting cultivation of other crops that are not susceptible to price fluctuations as tea and coffee.        Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there has been change in the taxation system and a reduction of the corporation tax from 42 ½ per cent to 40 per cent and that is a very welcome move. Those of us who have been involved in some kind of business know that    2 ½ per cent is a very chunk from your tax. So, I would like to thank vice-President and Minister for Finance for having given consideration by providing this relief.        Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am a pensioner and I would like to declare my interest when I am discussing the issue of pension. It is accepted internationally that in all organized and civilised societies, employers should provide pension for their ex-employees when they retire.                                                                                                                                                        THE MEMBER FOR KISUMU TOWN (Mr. J.H.O. Oraino) (ctd.):    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is also acknowledged that pensions are, in fact, deferred compensation or an income held by an employer to tried a worker over after retirement. There are three categories of pensions schemes in this country; namely those that are self-financed and administered, those that are trusteed and those that are insured. As an ex-civil servant and a pensioner for that my pension is not indexed or in other words as inflation keeps on eroding our incomes my pension becomes even more and more valueless. So I would like to propose for future consideration that though be given to indexation of pensions so that my real style of living which my employer undertook to sustain at a certain level for me is not unduly, reduced. When I have retired there are certain activities that I cease to undertake, but the life style that I was already used to, by virtue of the renumerations that I was being given, did not change. So if, for example, I was earning shs. 10,000.00 per month I would say that the other activities that were related to my going to work and maintaining that office accounted for 50 per cent of my income. So, ray proposal is that we should work to a stage where pensions should not be less than 50 per cent of one's income when he retires.        The National Social Security Fund (NSSF) is basically a provident fund. I think we should proceed to a stage where we can convert it together with other pension schemes to a proper national pension scheme. If one, for example, has a pension scheme that is insured it becomes subject to the Insurance Act and on the other hand if you have one which is funded, it becomes subject to the Income Tax Act. If you are, however, part of the Civil Service Pension Scheme which is not funded and is not insured, then you are not subject to any act at such. So, my proposal is that we should move to a stage where we have a body that ensures that there is some kind of uniformity in the kind of pension which is offered to our people. If such a pension scheme can be made national, then it would be much the better.I must now make a few comments on this animal called multi-parties.                                                                        When we were fighting for our Independence, we were told: "Seek ye first the political kingdom". We sought, fought for and got it. To—date, Kenyans have been praised for democracy, stability and economic proggress. All this has taken place under the one party system. Our praises have been sang to the high heavensby the same people who would now have us change. What has changed? We are still Kenyans.    With those few remarks, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH>        (applause)    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION (Mr. Obure): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by my colleagues. in congratulating His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for presenting a realistic and forwarding looking Budget.                                                                                THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION (Mr. Obure) Ctd:I say so because it addresses the economic and social problems which we face today in this country. Before I say anything regarding the Financial Statement, I would like to congratulate all Kenyans for the peace and stability which they have maintained all along thus making it possible fo_r us to achieve a high rate of economic development. That peace, and stability however, is now being threatened by a few ambitious individuals. At this time, we should be talking about consolidating our achievements. We should be seeking ways of resolving those problems that afflict our economy, the threat to our environment and such social problems as unemployment. But a few individuals sure diverting our attention to a debate on political affairs.    Kenyans know the achievements which they have made under the one—party political system. These achievements can be seen and are very well known. For example, there has been rapid expansion in our educational system. We have seen many training opportunities open to Kenyans in a manner which many people in other countries cannot believe. We have improve health services under the one-party a political system. We have a road network which is the envy of many other countries. We have improved our telecommunications system and there has been a rapid expansion in trade and industry. All these have been achieved under the one-party system. Above all, Sir, we have enjoyed dignity, respect and honor of being able to and manage our own affairs in a free and democratic country under the rule of law.    We have a system which we know has worked and we know the achieve we have made. Why do a few individuals want us to experiment with a system which has proved to be a total failure elsewhere? The multi-party system has failed in Africa. It failed here in Kenya in the 60s because we spent too much time fighting among ourselves. We abandoned the multi-party system                                                    because it proved unworkable. We joined it to be an effective tool of dividing Kenyans and we abandoned it because it gave us an opportunity to degrade ourselves into tribal and regional groups.    Sir, look at the chaos which the act multiparty arrangement has created in Nigeria, Sudan, Uganda, Angola and Liberia. All over Africa, there are problems which have been created by the multi-party arrangements. Some of the wounds which have been inflicted will never heal. The chaos which has been created in some countries will last many years. As this goes on, people continue to suffer.    	THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION (Mr. Obure) (Ctd.):    Kenyans are prepared to protect their country against the few individuals who want to steer us  away from the path of development and also stability. I believe that those advocating for foreign multi-party arrangements are acting on behalf of foreign Governments and agencies which all along have wanted to dictate their wishes on us. I strongly believe that they are mere puppets of foreign Governments or agencies. The few individuals have chosen to betray their own motherland.        Sir, foreigners do not understand the way we think and the way we live in Kenya, and we cannot allow them to dictate us. I had an opportunity to visit a few countries recently and I know that the majority of the people, say, in United States of America, or in Western Europe as a whole, look at the one-party system of Government as being synonymous with the communist system in Eastern Europe which is now collapsing. This is where decision-making was decentralized and decisions were dictated further down the line. This is the way they look at one-party system of Government. They do not understand how our one-party system here operates. we do not expect them to know that because they do not live here. They are not part of our Kenyan society. But all that we know is that our system is very, very different from others.         The communist system is collapsing today because it is not sensitive to the needs of the people. But our system is very sensitive to the needs of the people we are elected and given mandate by the people. The local councilors are also elected and given mandate by the people to run their own local institutions. So, the people have given the leadership a mandate. But that was not the case in Eastern Europe and that is why their system is collapsing.        THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERATIONAL CO-OPERATION (Mr. Obure)(Ctd.):    All I know, Sir as I stand here, is that all Kenyans are  fully behind President Moi. All Kenyans have full confidence in him because of what he has done for this country, because of his honesty and because of what he stands for. All Kenyans are very grateful to His Excellency the President for his tireless efforts in welding Kenyans into a cohesive united nation. All Kenyans, wherever they are, have tasted the fruits of Uhuru and are, therefore, determined to defend and to protect the Government from those individuals who are trying to undermine the image of the Government. Kenyans are mature enough and we jealously guard the sovereignty of this country, and we shall stand in the way of those who are trying to rundermine us.        Sir, I am confident, when I stand here, to say that we Kenyans have the capacity to determine our own destiny. If have the capacity to choose what is best for us and we should be left alone to do so.        Sir, I now want to turn briefly to the Budget and to congratulate the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for the admirable way in which he has administered the country in monetary Policies. As a result of that, our country today is highly respected internationally because of the effective and efficient manner in which we manage our economy.        Sir, I want to congratulate the Vice-President and Minister for Finance in particular for the prominent encouragement he has given to the development of the capital markets. In my own opinion, this is an important way of mobilising resources from wananchi so that they can invest in this important area of the capital markets. I am sure that the funds which could not find a way into the economy will now come into the economy and be                                                                    invested into the various are as so that wananchi can now have their affairs being managed by  professionals in various companies I want to appeal to all Kenyans to mobilise all their funds and resources and invest in this area.    	    Before I sit down, Sir, I want to mention very briefly something about the condition of roads in Kisii District in particular. The road network has collapsed because of the heavy rains we have had recently, and I want to appeal to the Government, out particularly the Ministry of Public Works, to carry out an emergency operation and help the coffee and tea farmers in those areas. I believe that we are making a significant contribution to the economy of this country andy therefore, we want to be helped in terms of repairing the roads so that wananchi can get their produce to the factories and also to the markets easily.     With those few remarks, Sir, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Kachilla): On a point order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I wish, to inform the House that tough action has been, taken in connection with the cassettes were tailing about here earlier on: The security forces have been mobilized and are already in the streets trying to get those who are selling these cassettes. This action has been directed by a higher authority. Therefore, there is nothing to worry about. Let us now wait for the report after investigations have been completed - I am sure it will be a very good report. That is what I wanted to inform the this House. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYNMENT (Mr. Otwani); Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to start my speech today; I hope I will continue on the next allotted day. I must start by commending the Vice-president and Minister for Finance for this typically "Saitoti Budget", which contain pragmatic and conscientious proposal for social and economic improvement. It is not just the traditional battery of taxation measures, but it draws a lot from past experience and looks deep in the future; it reflects the political foresight of our President and the stability of our institutions. This Budget contains strategies to meet national objectives like food security, increment of income and employment opportunities, rural and small town development and enhancement of foreign exchange earnings.        Surely this Budget is timely because it a very good answer to the political party pluralists. They have been asking what Kanu is doing for the people, to increase food, to increase employment opportunities, to remove corruption and so on. This Budget promises to answer all these questions, and the pluralists will have nothing to say. Those of us who come from the border are uneasy with our neighbors to the west. Our only consolation to the east and we are                                                                        not going to allow ourselves to be used by the multi-party proponents to wreck the security to the east because, if we do this we shall have nowhere to run to.        Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the multi-party proponents, particularly Matiba and Rubia, are obviously sadists these are people who delight themselves in seeing evil acted. Surprisingly, these people are terribly short sighted. This is because I do not see how they could imagine that when they form a second party it will win and they will take the Presidency. Even if they are allowed to form a party it will not win. If Oginga Odinga's party did not win, I do not know why Matiba and Rubia believe they will form a Government if they are allowed to, form another party. Now they are invoking the wrath of Kenyatta; Kenyatta loved  Moi; Kenyatta identified Moi as the one who would lead Kenyans to greate prosperity Kenyatta knew Moi would lay well on his foundation and he has done so. They should not involve Kenyatta in these cassettes, which seem to have been prepared in conduction with the church - the cassette on Muoroto seems to be drawing material from Mathew 24. I believe the Church of the Province of Kenya is cooperating with Matiba and Rubia. All we can say is that the more they make references to Kenyatta, the more, hopefully, Kenyatta's wrath will land on them. </NEWSPEECH>        <HEADER>ADJOURNMENT </HEADER>    <NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (MR.

MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I have noted that there are two Order Papers today, and the Assistant Minister just gave a notice of the motion Order No.8/in the Order Paper, but he did not move the Notice of Motion appearing or Order No. 7 in the Supplementary Order Paper. I think there is some confusion there. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.

BIDU asked the Minister of State, a Office of the President when the proposal by the Kwale D.D.C. to split Kinango and Mwavumbo Locations and other sub-locations in Kinango Constituency will be implemented. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Onyancha) Mr. Speaker Sir, I beg to reply. The Kwale District Development committee (D.D.C) met on 29th March, 1990, following my office letter to all provincial commissioners requesting them to instruct their district commissioners to discuss the possibilities of creating new administrative units in their districts at their D.D.C. meetings, and recommended among other things the splitting of a few administrative units in Kinango Division.    According to that recommendation, Kinango Division was to be divided into two divisions. Mwavumbo Location was supposed to be divided into two, and Puma Location was also supposed to be divided into two locations. In the same meeting recommendations were made to sub-divide some sub-locations. The following sub-locations were recommended to be sub-divided into two Mtaa, Mbovu, Munyenzeni, and Mwandimu. So far my Office has already received recommendations for the creation of new locations and sub-locations from all the provinces in our Republic. My Office will review all those recommendations and rank them in their order of priority and approach the Directorate of Personnel Management for the creation of the necessary posts recommended. Depending on the availability of sufficient funds, the posts in Kinango Constituency will be considered on those lines. Sir, while ranking the posts in their order of priority, the following factors shall apply. The size of the population to be served, size of the area to be created, the economic potential of the area to be created, the infrastructure of the area to be created the social/political trends of the area and the availability of sufficient funds.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Onyancha) (ctd. )Sir, on 30th May, 1990, my Ministry received recommendations from all over the country, as I had indicated, as follows:- Recommendations had been made to create 11 divisions, 165 locations and 523 sub-locations. The creation of any of those units will depend on the availability of funds. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Sir, while appreciating the long, but good answer given by the Assistant Minister, could he now tell us approximately when the Creation of those locations and sub-locations will take place? </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. ONYANCHA: I have already indicated that we have very many recommendations from all over the country. We are reviewing them right now. It will not be possible to all those sub-divisions at the same time, because we do not have funds. After reviewing those recommendations, we shall Record them in terms of national priority, We shall create those sub-divisions slowly, but the whole exercise will entirely depend on the availability of funds. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: I would like to thank the Assistant Minister again for that good reply, but can he now tell this House, whether he could place Kinango Division as a priority for sub-division during this Financial Year? </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. ONYANCHA: After my Office has completed the reviewing all the recommendations, we shall find out whether recommended Kinango Division qualified or not. </NEWSPEECH>                                            <HEADER>Question No. 268</HEADER><HEADER>Harassment of Porters by Moi Airport Police</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>BW.

ARTE asked the Minister of State, Office of the President in order to enhance effective administration, whethar!. he could establish an Administration Police Post in this area.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Kamuren): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The need for an Administration Police post at Jalish Centre has been identified by the Government and plans are under way to establish a post as soon as the funds are availableo Currently, the area around Jalish is covered ty Bothai Administration Police Post. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ARTE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Asssistant Minister for the answer he has given, could he tell the House the distance between Bothai and Jalish in kilometres. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, the area around Jalish will continue to be served by Bothai Administration Police Post until we have the money to establish this other new police post. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ARTS: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the area around Jalish is heavily populated and Jalish Centre is at the base of Boni Forest where banditry movement is very frequent. Therefore, could the Assistant Minister agree with me that there is urgent need to establish an administrative police post at Jalish immediately, and give us the time when he intends to do this? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my earlier reply, I said that as soon as funds are available, we shall definitely establish an administrative police post at Jalish immediately. I therefore request the hon. Member to give us time because according to the information, that we continue to get from our officers on the ground, it has become necessary to establish an adminsitrative police post in Jalish. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Malebe's Question. </NEWSPEECH>                        <HEADER>Question No.266 </HEADER>    <HEADER>Minerals Production Between 1985/89 and their value </HEADER>    MR. MALEBE asked the Minister for Environment, and Natural Resources whether he could give the amount of mineral produced in Kenya for the last five years, (1985/39) and how much has each mineral contributed towards the National Gross Earnings.     <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. Said-Hemed): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.    The mineral produced during the period 1985 to 1983 amount to 2,314,018 tons whose National Gross Earnings was £235,303,694. The accurate figures for 1989 are not available but will be compiled as soon as they are received from the miners. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I thank the Assistant Minister for his generalized answer to this Question, could he give this House the names of the minerals, and how much each mineral contributed to the National Gross Earnings. The anwer as he has given is generalized and it has not meaning as it now stands. We would like to know how much has magadi soda, diamond, gold, and so on, has contributed to our National Gross Earnings. This is what the Question is asking for. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. HEMED: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to point out to the hon. Member and the House that this information if available in my Ministiy free of charge to any member of the public, including hon. Malebe. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the Assistant Minister is deliberately refusing to answer the Question as I have put ito The question here is very specific and therefore, I expect a veiy specific answer too. Although the Assistant Minister says that this information is available to the members of public, it is common knowledge that most people in this country are not well informed. Most of the wananchi out there do not have this information and therefore, the Minister should not generalizehis reply. He should give us specific minerals ana tell us how much each of them has contributed to our National Gross Earnings in this country. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. HEMED: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the information I am talking about isME. HEMED (Ctd.):	    also published in the Annual Statistical Abract and the Economic Survey Reports compiled by the Central Bureau, of STandards and printed by the Government Press, copies of which are available in the Parliament Library </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>DR. MISOI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is true as the hon. Question stated that the Assistant Minister is trying to evade the Question. We know that this information is available in the Ministries and elsewhere, but this Question is the property of this House and the answer has got to be given here so that wananchi may know what kind of minerals are produced here, where they are produced and where they are sent and how much money wer are getting from them. This would also assist investors so that those interested can come here to explore these minerals </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. HEMED: Mr. Speaker, under the STanding Orders of this House, when information to a Question is available and handy, it should not be answered here. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. WASIKE-NDOMBI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister really in order to mislead this House by saying that if information to a Question is availabe, then it should not be answered in this House? Is he not just assuming that information regarding this Question is available to the members of public, and using this as an excuse not to give the proper answer to the House? If he has no better answer than the one he has given, could he be given enough time to look for the proper answer to this House? </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. HEMED: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have made it very clear here that according to the statistics that are available to us, the minerals that have been produced from 1985 to 1988 amount to 2,314,018 tons and have contributed to £235,303,694 to our National Gross Earning. I have also said that the accurate figures for 1989 are not available and that they will be compiled as soon as they are received from the miners. What more specific answer does the Questioner want. </NEWSPEECH>                                                    <NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I still maintain that the Assistant Minister has not answered this Question satisfactorily. If he does not understand English, he should say so. The Question clearly ask:-    "Could the Minister give the amount of minerals produced in Kenya for the last five years and how much each mineral has contributed towards the National Gross Earnings".                                                                                                                        In other words he should come up with a list of the minerals concerned and how much money has been earned from each of them. Could the Assistant Minister answer the Question before him? At the moment, he is not answering the Question at all; he is only going round and round. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. SAID—HEMED: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sorry to say that when I was in school, my friend was selling miraa in Meru. </NEWSPEECH>    (Laughter)    In any case, I would like to refer him to Standing Order No.37 (12), which reads    "A Question, the answer to which is readily available in ordinary works of reference or official publications, shall not be asked."    (Applause)    <NEWSPEECH>MR. MUTUA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is extraordinary. Do we refer to Standing Orders when answering Questions as clear as this one here?  </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Let us move on to the next Question.  </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. WASIKE-NDOMBI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister has given us a part of the answer to the Question, and we are now complaining that the answer is not complete. Is he not misleading the House by referring us to the Standing Orders when he has actually committed himself and given an unsatisfactory answer? </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. SAID—HEMED: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the details relating to all these commodities are readily available in our Parliamentary library. I have only given a.general answer relating to the minerals and the tonnage produced in this country, and the gross earnings the country has made from the sale of the minerals. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am a geologist by profession, and I, too, am able to get reference books and obtain the figures that the Assistant Minister is referring to. However, even if you refer to these reference books, you will not get information on how much ruby has been produced in the country and how much money this has earned. I would, therefore, challenge the Assistant Minister to bring the reference books with                                                             this information here. These books do not have any information on how much of the green garnets in Taita—Taveta Districts has been mined and how much money has been earned from them. Could the Assistant Minister teli the country what you do when you do-not find this information in reference books? The country would like to know how wealth from gemstones is treated by the Ministry. If this information is confidential, he should tell us that it cannot be exposed to anybody. I still insist that the Assistant Minister should go back to his office and come up with a breakdown of the required information or satisfy the country that the information is readily available in reference books. If not so, let him produce a reference book here to prove that he is correct. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. SAID-HEMED: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member is referring to ruby, and I will give him the relevant figures in respect of ruby. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Malebe, the Assistant Minister is reacting to your earlier point of order. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. SAID-HEMED: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 1985, 135 tonnes of ruby were mined, and their value was £85,602. In 1986, 68 tonnes were mined, and the value was £15,800. In 1987, 336 tonnes were mined, and the value was £115,000 </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MRS. NDETEI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the hon. Assistant Minister has been having these figures all along, why has he been wasting our time referring us to the library? He has the required details, and he should read them out to us. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. SAID-HEMED: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this information is readily available to everybody and, according to our Standing Orders, this Question should not have been asked. Secondly, the list I have here is very long, but it can be found in our statistics. The hon. Questioner referred particularly to ruby, and I have given him the information he wanted. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The hon. Assistant Minister has already referred to Standing Order No.37 and, now that he has answered the Question contrary to the Standing Orders, we need to get a                                                ruling from the Chair as to whether the Assistant Minister is not misleading the House. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: My ruling is that we move on to the next Question. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Now that the Assistant Minister has categorically refused to give a breakdown of the figures in question I know that he has a list of all the minerals we have could he lay the said list on the Table of the House for the information of hon. Members? </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR- SPEAKER: Mr. Malebe, I am sure there is no problem here. Why do you not see the hon. Assistant Minister privately? </NEWSPEECH>    Let us move on to Mr. Salat's Question.    <HEADER>Question No. 251</HEADER>    <HEADER>Telephone Services for Fafi</HEADER>    MR.

The constituency will be served by four manual exchanges planned as follows:-(i) 	In Bura East, plans have been finalised and the actual installation work of the switchboard will start soon, and telephone services will be available by the end of this year.(ii) 	Work for-Hulugho is planned for execution during 1990/91. (iii) 	Work for Jirajilla is planned for execution during 1991/92. (iv) 	Work for Nanighi East is also planned for execution during 1992/93. The four exchanges will have a 70-line capacity, but subscriber trunk dialling facilities will be considered later. </NEWSPEECH>END C<NEWSPEECH>MR. NUNO: Mr,Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the reply from the Assistant Minister,  would he consider installing telephone facilities in that area instead of waiting up to the end of the year? </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. MUTWOL: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure that the hon. Members knows that we cannot install telephone services immediately without installing the telephone exchange first. I have already stated that we are currently in the process of installing the telephone exchange. Other things will follow as soon as possible. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH> MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Falana's Question. </NEWSPEECH>    <HEADER>Question No.257</HEADER>    Terms of Service - Kenya Commercial Bank Workers In Marsabit    MR. FALANA asked the Minister for Labour what are the terms and conditions of employment of Messrs.    Golicha Jarso, Godana Arabo and Wato Bukicha, all employees of Kenya Commercial Bank, Marsabit.    <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. D.M.Amin): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. Messrs Golicha Jarso, Godana Arabo and wato Bukicha are  employed  on casual basis by Kenya Commercial Bank - Marsabit Branch  </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. FALANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for his reply, is he aware that after working for three consecutive months a person is supposed to be employed on permanent terms of service? But you will find that these gentlemen have worked as casuals since 1984. Could the Assistant Minister tell this House why these workers have been treated like that? </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, Mr. Golicha Jarso, 44 years old, was employed on 16th December, 1986, as a casual night guard at the Manager's house and has been getting KShs. 22.50 per day. His performance is said to be satisfactory and he is now being considered for permanent employment.    Mr. Godana Arabo, 45 years old, was employed on 3rd November, 1984, as a night guard on casual basis at the rate of KShs.22.50 per day. His performance is said to be satisfactory and he is being considered for permanent  employment. Mr. Wato Bukicha, 37 years old, was employed as a casual night guard at the Staff Quarters at the rate of KShs.19.55 per day. His performance is said to be below average and he has been cautioned on several occasions. He cannot, therefore, be considered for permanent employment. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. FALANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister very much for the answer he has given, he has admitted that these guys have worked as casuals for a long time. These fellows have been working without leave or off or public holidays. Now that they are being considered for permanent employment are they going to be paid for the leave days and public holidays they have worked for all these years? </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. D.M. AMIN; Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said that these people were employed as casuals. They have been getting their pay on a daily basis. But I can assure the hon. Member that they will will enjoy full fringe benefits once they are employed on permanent terms. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister has.said that these Kenyans have been working as casuals for the last six years. Why have these people worked as casuals for so many years? </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MS. D.M: AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the relevant law says that anybody who is paid on a daily basis is on casual labour and his terms of employment are purely temporary. But when these people are employed on permanent terms they will be considered for better pay. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. FALANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, these fellows have worked as casuals for six years. Could the Assistant Minister tell the House how long person is supposed to work on a temporary basis before he is absorbed into permanent employment? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said that these people have been receiving their pay every 24 hours - on a daily basis. If you are paid on a daily basis it does not matter how many years you work you are still a casual worker. However, once they are absorbed into permanent employment they will be remunerated in accordance with the labour laws. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MRS. NDETEI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is usually the discretion of an employer to decide whether there is a job or there is no job. From the reply given by the Assistant Minister, it is clear that there was continuous employment for these people for six years. I do not think that our labour law provides that continuous employment for so long should be treated as temporary employment. How can the Assistant Minister justify the continuation of casual employment for those three employees without converting them to permanent and pensionable employment at least for six years? They would earn some benefits afterwards. Could he explain why these workers have been exploited? When are they going to be paid the benefits they qualify for? </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Kenya Commercial Bank has not exploited these workers. These people worked as casuals and they were paid on a daily basis. It is true that they have worked as casuals for six years. But according to the  Labour-Act, if you are paid after every 24- hours, your employment is purely temporary. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. WASIKE-NDOMBI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we in this House assume that the  role of  the Ministry of Labour is to protect workers. But the Assistant Minister here is telling us that some of these employees have been cautioned for not being productive. As                                 far as I know, a casual worker is not subject to warnings because he is  on a 24-hour contract. From the Assistant  Minister's answer it is apparent that they should have been on permanent terms. Could the Kenya Commercial Bank, which is a very respected employer in this country, take on these employees on permanent terms right from the day they started working for the Bank?  Their permanent terms of employment should be back-dated to 1984. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will try to interpret the Labour Act here. A casual employee, according to the Act means    "An individual the terms of whose engagement provide for his payment at the end of each day and who is not engaged for a longer period than 24 hours at a time."    Therefore these people were casual workers and they were paid after every 24 hours . </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. FALANA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The hon. Assistant Minister is  confusing us. He is in fact confusin the whole nation. He admits that these fellows have worked for six years and yet he calls them casuals. The K.C.B. is a paratatal body which is exploiting its workers. The Assistant Minister must give this House a very clear explanation regarding this issue. He should not talk about 24 hours; he is confusing us. </NEWSPEECH>	    <NEWSPEECH>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not confusing the House. I am just stating the facts as they are. These people are casual workers and they are paid in accordance with the Labour Act. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister talks as if he  is giving a ruling. He speaks as if there is nothing hon. Members can do. For how long, according to the Labour Act, should a person work as a casual before being employed on permanent terms of service? We know that after working as a casual for at least six months a person must be employed on permanent terms. </NEWSPEECH>    END.D..                    <NEWSPEECH>Mr. AMIN: Anybody who gets paid after every 24 hours is a casual worker. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.

SPEAKER: He is well informed and is, therefore, not interested in your point of information. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think the reply we have been given gives a bad impression of the Ministry. It is really unfair to the wananchi for the Assistant Minister to insist that a casual labourer stays permanent on those terms. The Act states that you can he a casual	labourer for three aonths and then be sacked - I hope the Kenya Commercial Bank sacked them and hired and sacked again. You can remain a casual labourer for ever by being hired and sacked from time to time.In this particular case, these workers have been on the job for six continuous years. Can the Assistant Minister go back for further information and then come and tell us who a casual labourer is? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. AMIN: I will not go back for further information. I said that since those workers are doing a good job at the moment, they will be  considered for permanent employment. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.

SPEAKER: Next Question. </NEWSPEECH>    <HEADER>Question No. 220</HEADER>    <HEADER>Shortage of Parking Facilities in Nairobi</HEADER>    MRS NDETEI asked the Minister for Local Government that in view of the acute shortage of parking places in Nairobi City Centre, what steps he is taking to ensure adequate parking places are made available for the motorists.     <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Mbori): Mr. Speaker. Sir, I beg to reply.    The Ministry of Local Government has instituted the following measures to he taken by the City Commission to alleviate the present shortage of parking space    1. To look into ways of improving public transport in quality and quantity to decrease the number of passenger car trips to and from the City Centre by Nairobi residents.    2. Make provision of peripheral public car parks just outside the Central Business District such that motorists can leave their cars in these car parks and take public transport into the City Centre. Already eight such sites have been identified and construction work is expected to start soon. These sites are as follows:-    Nyerere Road next to the City Commission's park depot; Uhuru Park; Globe Cinema roundabout; the open space near the Railways Headquarters; University Way opposite Lilian Towers, Nyayo Stadium along Lang'ata Road; Waiyaki Way near Westlands Shopping Centre and between the City Stadium and Lusaka Road Bridge.    3. The City Commission has already completed designs and is looking for funds for the construction of suitably located by-pass routes, namely; ring roads, for traffic that has no business in the City Centre.    4. In addition, the City Commission is encouraging a rezoning system decentralising business and commercial activities from the City Centre bo outlying areas such as Westlands.    5. A requirement has already been enforced for all new commercial buildings to provide adequate space for basement parking for all those accommodated in such buildings. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MRS. NDETEI: Sir, as I am speaking now, motorists in the City Centre are really suffering. For example, if you go to the streets of Nairobi now, you will find, many breakdowns towing away cars to the traffic headquarters. Sometimes the yellow lines on some roads in town are not necessary at all. These yellow lines should be erased so that motorists can park there because people are really suffering. The Assistant Minister has given us long term plans and he has not even said when they are going to be effected. Immediate action should be taken so that motorists do not continue to suffer. What immediate action is the Ministry going to take within the next one week? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MBORI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Gracious Lady knows what is involved in these kind of plans and designs. It is unrealistic for her to demand that something should be done within the next one week.  Plans are already at hand and will be executed as soon as funds become available to the satisfaction of the hon. Gracious Lady. I think she should be  thankful for the provisions made so far. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR.

In view of this, Master Ngigi John Rimi, K.C.E. Index No. 25131003 is requested to collect his 1989 Kenya Certificate of Education Examination result slip and his school leaving certificate personally from the Headmaster, Musa Gitau Secondary School. </NEWSPEECH>	    <NEWSPEECH>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Assistant Minister for that satisfactory reply. But since a number of headmasters seem to be unaware of this policy, what steps are they taking to ensure that no student is denied his documents for non-payment of school fees? </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are two issues involved here. One is the expressed policy of the Ministry not withhold examination results because of non-payment of school fees and the other which should not be ignored is the parents failure to pay school fees. The headmasters are aware of the Ministry's policy on this issue. Apparently, it has been the method of heads. masters to try to realise the outstanding amounts. But to repeat the headmasters are aware of our policy on this issue. </NEWSPEECH>    Reasons For Sacking Commissionaire Nasimiyu      (MR.

MAKHANU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all know that Local Authorities and parastatals get funds from the Government. So, could the Minister putting them on the same level as Ministries vehicles? This is because they too are using Government funds and should thus be exempted from paying these charges. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. MIBEI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also know that vehicles operated by Local Authorities and parastatals do cause wear and tear to the roads. It is, therefore, necessary for them to contribute towards maintenance of those roads. We also know that Local Authorities and parastatals are income generating organisations and should thus pay toll charges like any other individuals or organisations whose vehicles ply on public roads. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR.

Towards the end of 1978, soon after the late of the Late President, the Government through the Voice of Kenya recorded and produced a long playing record No. K002 in memory of the Founding Father of the Nation, Mzee Jomo Kenyatta. The implementation of this assigment was vested in the Voice of Kenya which inturn entered into contract with Polygram Records Limited, Nairobi for the production and distribution of that long playing record. The contract, among other things, provided for the payment of loyalties to the Voice of Kenya at the rate of shs.10.00 for every record sold. The agreement is still valid and Polygram Records Limited continue to discharge their responsibility.    The latest available information indicates that on 31st January, 1990, the Company paid shs.1,450,00 to the VOK in this connection. In execution of the contract, Polygram Records Limited produced and sold many records both locally and overseas at shs. 40.00 per piece. Prominent Kenyans, such as Cabinet Ministers and other VIP were honoured with free copies. This also applied to distinguished visitors from overseas. The Provincial Administration and Kenyan diplomatic missions oversease were solicited to encourage the wide circulation of this record. However, the copy right is still retained by the VOK up to the present time.    The above arrangements relate only to the production and distribution of the long playing record and no provision howsoever was made for music cassettes of the type which is the subject of the present debate. It is quite clear that pirates have converted the long playing record into cassettes illegally. Consequently, the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) which is the legal successor of the VOK is investigating the matter and will take the necessary legal action in consultation with the Office of the Attorney-General and the                                                    other competent organizations of the Keriya Government.Mr. Speaker, Sir, it has also been confirmed that there has no fresh issue of the disc by the KBC and that what the vendors are selling in the streets of Nairobi at the moment are possibly copies made from the collections of those obtained from that disc of 1978.    With regard to the radio cassette on the recent Muoroto incident, the Ministry is liaising with the other relevant security institutions of the Governemnt with a view to ensure that the necessary legal action is taken. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Hon. Members, this is to draw your attention to the fact that after Question Time, the Business will be affected els appearing on the Supplementary Order Paper. I hope that every hon. Member has received a copy of that Supplementary Order Paper. For any further information, hon. Members can refer to Standing Order No. 142, Paragraph 6. Next Order. </NEWSPEECH>                <HEADER>PROCEDURAL MOTION </HEADER>Exemption of Bussiness from Provisions of S.O No. 137(1).<NEWSPEECH>THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR FINANCE (Prof. Saitoti): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the following Motion:-THAT, this House orders that the Business appearing on today's Supplementary Order Paper be exempted from the provisions of Standing Order No. 137(1).    Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am prompted to move the Procedural Motion because we would like to be able to move onto the discussion on the Vote on Account. I am sure that hon. Members are aware that the current financial year is due to end on 30th June, and since the discussion on the Committee of Supply will take quite a while to be completed, it is necessary that during that time of the debate - which will be after the 30 th June. the Business of the Government should continue to be transacted, It is for that reason, Sir,that I have brought the following Motions and I am sure that the hon. Members will agree that we should exempt the other Businesses in order that we can actually debate the Vote on Account. whose passage will, therefore, enable the Government to be able to discharge services to wananchi after the 30th June.    Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Biwott): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second this Motion.    In seconding, I would like to appeal to hon. Members to accept the explanation given by the Vice-President and Minister for Finance because it is self-explanatory, in that we move the Vote on Account in order to allow Ministries to function after 1st July, 1990; that is the new financial year.  It is a normal requirement that we vote this money before a certain date. I think the Speaker and the Clerk have seen it fit that this should be done today    with those few remarks, I beg to second. </NEWSPEECH>                                                (Question proposed)    <NEWSPEECH>MR.

Members have already received copies of the Vote on Account for the financial year 1990/91. As it will be seen, hon. Members are being requested at this stage, to vote a half of the net total sum of money as contained in. 1990/91 Printed Estimates of Recurrent gnd Development Expenditure: in order to carry on the services of the Government during the financial year 1990/91.                                <NEWSPEECH>THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR FINANCE (Ctd.): Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is-in accordance with the provisions of Sections 101 and 124- of the Constitution of Kenya authorising the withdrawal from the Consolidated Fund of sums of money not exceeding one half of the net sum included in the Recurrent and Development Estimates of Expenditure, for that year until such time as the Appropriation Act for the year comes into operation.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the details of the various Votes are contained in the 1990/91 Printed Estimates of Recurrent and Development Expenditure which were circulated to all hon. Members on Tuesday, 10th June, 1990. Hon. Members will, of course, have the full opportunity to discuss in details in the Committee of Supply some time later when the Votes of the various Ministries will then be discussed fully. I do not, therefore, wish to labour much the details of this matter. I would like only to request hon. Members to pass this Motion for it is very important as far as the continuation of Government services are concerned.    Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Biwott): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to second this Motion.    In seconding, I would like to stress the point that the Motion before us signifies in no uncertain terms the role of this supreme body. It is only this Parliament that has the authority to authorise expenditure, and it is because of that trust that we are being requested today to authorise the Vote on Account; that is half of the money we need for the next financial year because that money cannot be spent on 1st July, 1990 without the authority of this Parliament. This fact should serve to show those who doubt the integrity of this Parliament and also the authority of this Parliament to see, read and understand that this House has its own supreme authority. It is also an authority in terms of all the other laws and regulations and even the amendment of the Constitution        THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Ctd.):    The laws of this country empowers this Parliament to study and debate thoroughly, and bearing in mind the wishes of the people of this country decide accordingly. So, I thought I should perhaps mention that in order to refresh the memories of those who perhaps have not seen the proper role that this supreme body is supposed to be doing.    Having passed the money, as we are going to do in this particular Motion, it will be the responsibility of the civil servants to ensure that every penny of that money is spent wisely, and spent for the purpose for which Parliament has been told will be spent on. It should be spent in such a wise manner that the wananchi of this country will derive the maximum benefit and welfare from the very money that they themselves have contributed because the money we are voting today will come from the pockets of wananchi. It is public money and it will have to be looked after. It is also public money that the Public Accounts Committee is charged with the responsibility of ensuring that it is spent properly, and if not, to highlight the failings. In other words, therefore, we must from this House send the message to our civil servants and those who will be involved in the expenditure of this money to be efficient, productive and above all to be self disciplined because without discipline things will go wrong. I think it is time we in this House were firm about discipline and we should not allow our people to degenerate to an extent that even when they are supposed to be courteous, they are impolite, and they answer those whom they should not answer.    Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must take this opportunity to congratulate the hon. Vice-President and Minister for Finance for the most able manner in which he has conducted with the assistance of His Excellency the President, this House and also the civil                                                                THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Ctd.):servants who work with-him all the time and steered the economy of this country. He has done it very carefully, steadily and also ably during this time when things are very, very difficult when international economic scene is very trying because without that we would not have such a smooth self-sustaining economy that we in this country are proud of having today.    With those few remarks, Sir, I beg to second. </NEWSPEECH>        End G    <NEWSPEECH>Mr. WASIKE-NDOMBI: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I also rise to support this very important Motion. In supporting it I would urge that the Government officers responsible for issueing authorities to incur expenditure (A.I.E.s) should release them immediately so that the money we are voting can be put into use almost immediately. Permanent Secretaries, who are the Accounting Officers, have a tendency of delaying the release of A.I.E.s until as late nf as September, which makes other implementing officers find it very difficult to render badly needed services.If I may give an example, I will refer to Vote of the Ministry of Public Works. While it is good that God gave us a lot of rain this year which is a good gift - we have had our roads badly damaged by the heavy rains. we would, therefore, like the Minister for Public Works to give immediate attention to those areas which need emergency measures. This will enable farm produce like tea, coffee and sugarcane be transported to where they are required for sale.    we would also not like Government officers to be lavish in expenditure. When you go round some Ministries headquarters you see vehicles boarded for very minor repairs; some are boarded  because of minor repairs like light scratches as result of minors accidents, which would not cost Shs.200/- This happens because some of the officers intend to buy the same vehicles at a later date cheaply. Implementing officers should thus be aware of this kind of behaviour by some of our officers. Every cent voted by this House should be accounted for. The implementing officers should look at the reports of the Controller and Auditor-General to see how they can put a few things right in their Ministries.                                                                    Mr. Speaker, Sir, those officers who leave coats in offices while they go looking, after their businesses should leave their jobs for young and energetic Kenyans to take over. I have also noticed that most posts in the Civil Service, local authorities and teaching profession fare held by people in an acting capacity. This practice has rendered the Public Service Commission toothless. we would like the Commission to be informed of all the vacant positions so that it can advertise and fill them: We have a lot of university and other graduates who are looking for employment and yet very many important posts are held by people in an acting capacity.     With these few words, I beg to support the Motion. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIILU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am also very much pleased to join my colleagues in supporting this Motion and saying that since this is a lot of money, it should be spend wisely. If this money is spproperly by each Ministry wananchi would get proper services.     However, some officers in various Ministries do not do their work well: they do not spend the money allocated at the right time. I would be quite unfair of work for certain ministrie to return money to the Treasury when, there is a lot of work to be done by the same Ministries.    I feel that the Ministry of Public of works should have been given more money because it actually have a lot of work to do within this Republic. In fact, without goods roads our people cannot travel to various parts of the country.    Since without theapproval of this august no money can be spent, it is important that after the House aproves the expenditure of this money it is spent carefully. If expenditure of this money will involve employment of people I suggest that            	                                            Interviews for prospective employees be conducted at the division level. This is because in the previous interviews some candidates did not attend them at the district headquarters because their divisions are too far. Again, even some of those who went for the interviews at the district headquarters did not know where to get the interview forms from because there were too many people. This is public money and interviews for employment should be conducted at the Division headquarters so that everybody can get a chance of being interviewed.    End ..H        MR. KIILU (ctd.):     Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other thing that I would like to touch on is the question of misappropriation of public funds. Although we have the Public Accounts Committee in this House, the question of misappropriation of public funds has always been raised in this House. I want to suggest that those civil servants who do not take care of public funds should be dismissed so that misuse of public funds can be curbed. Careless officers should be dismissed to give way to other people who can served the public. We have seen situations where public money has been misused and when we ask Questions here we do not get satisfactory replies.    Sir, there are several Ministries that should have been allocated more money for development. I have in mind the Ministry of Reclamation and Development of Arid, Semi-Arid Wastelands, which I think has been allocated little money compared to what it is expected to do. I want to suggest that next time this particular Ministry be allocated a lot of money because it has a lot to do in the whole of this country.    With those? few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion. </NEWSPEECH>    <NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Ahsante sana, Bw. Spika. Ni lazima maofisa wa Serikali wajue kwamba hizi ni pesa za umma na kwamba mwaka wa matumizi ya pesa za Serikali una miezi 12. Tunapitisha pesa hapa leo na kabla ya Juni, 1990, utaona tumele tewa kitu kinachoitwa Supplementary Estimates kwa sababu zile tunapitisha hapa leo zitakuwa zimekwisha. Yafaa ikiwa Wizara fulani itamaliza pesa tunazopitisha hapa kabla ya mwaka mmoja kumalizika, maofisa wa Wizara hiyo waeleze ni kwa nini pesa hizo zilikwisha. Ikiwa hakutakuwa ha sababu ya kutosha, basi maofisa hao yafaa wachukuliwe hatua. Hatuwezi kukubali kupitisha pesa kila wakati na kabla ya mwaka wa matumizi ya pesa za Serikali kumalizika tunaambiwa tupitisha nyingine.  Ni Lazima tuwe  tukijua jinsi pesa tunazopitisha hapa zinavyotumika.    Bw. Spika, nataka kuchukua nafasi hii kusema kwamba mashirika ya Serikali aaibayo hayawezi kuajiri wananchi kazi yachunguzwei. Kitendo kilichotendwa na Shirika la Ndege la Kenya hivi majuzi kimeniudhi sana na singetaka mashirika mengine kukifanya. Ninasema hivyo kwa sababu ninasikia uvumi kwamba mashirika mengine ya Serikali    yanataka kufuta watu kazi. Hata kampuni za kibihafsi zinataka kufuata mfano wa Shirika la Ndege la Kenya wa kuwafutawatu kazi. Ule ulikuwa ni mfano mbaya katika richi hii. Nataka kulishukuru Shirika la Simu na Mawasiliano kwa sababu limeajiri watu kazi kwa wingi. Laziina shirika kama hilo liungwe mkon sana kwa sababu lina jaribu kupunguza ukobse fu wa kazi. Ni kwa nini, badala ya kuandika watu kazi, Shirika la Ndelge la Kenya liliamua kuachisha watu 2,000 kazi? Ikiwa kuna makampuni ambayo yanataka kufuata mfano wa Shirika la Ndege la Kenya, nataka kumwomba Makamu wa Rais and Waziri wa Fedha akomesha ndoto za aiha hiyo kwa sababu kitenda kama hivhb Ni kibaya saha. Hakiina haja ya kupitisha pesa hapa halafu baadaye? Mawaziri wanakubali mashirika ya Serikali yafute watu kazi. Yafaa mashirika ya Serikali yasimamiwe vizuri. Hatutaki kuwa tukitoa pesa hapa kupatia mashirika ya Serikali kila wakati halafu baadaya, wakishazipunja, wanafuta watu kazi kwa sababu wafanya kazi wamekuwa wengi. Hivyo, hatutakuwa tukielekea katika njia nzuri. Njia nzuri ni kwamba tukipitisha pesa leo, Wizara zote? Ziyae leze mashirika ya Serikali umuhimu wa kutumia pesa hizo vizuri.    Tumesikia kwamba Shirika la Posta na Simu nidilo lltakalowakilisha Afrika nzima katika mich zo ya akina mama kule Brazil, na huku shirika hilo linaandika watu kazi. Pia, tumeambiwa kwamba kufikia mwaka wa 1992 kila makao makuu ya divisheni hapa nchi yatakuwa ha simu ya kupiga mbja kwa moja. Ikiwa shirika linafanya kazi namna hiyo Kenya Ports Authority kwa sasa imeandika zaidi ya watu 10,000 kazi, nia sionl ni kwa nini mashirika mengine hayawezi kufuata mfano huo. Waziri wa Serikali za Wilaya, ambaye kwa sasa simuoni hapa, alislmamisha utaratibu wa kuandika watu 500 kazi katika Baraza la Mji wa Mombasa, na kufikia sasa baraza hilo haliwezi kuandika watu kazi. Hivi sasa mji na barabara za Mji wa Mombasa zimeoza-kwa-sababu hakuna wafanyakazi wa kutosha. Ingefaa Wizara ya Serikali za Wilaya ipatiwe pesa nyingi ili ikiopesha Baraza la Mji wa Mombasa ill liweze kuandika watu kazi. Tumesoma kwamba Mombasa ndio Inayoongoza katika orodha ya maradhi ya Malaria kwa sababu ya mbu, ile hali watu wa Mombasa wanalipa pese za service charge. Ikiwa pesa za service charge hazitumiki vizuri, basi yafaa Waziri anayehusika alete Mswada hapa kufutilia                                                maiipo hayo mbali. Ikiwa watu wanalipa pesa na hawaoni pesa hizo zikifanya kazi, basi hakuna haja ya kulipa.    Kuhusu Wizara ya Afya, nataka kusema kwamba kutokana na mpango wa Structural Adjustment Programme, watu wamelipa pesa katika hospitali ria hivi majuzi tukaambiwa kwamba pesa hizo zilikuwa zimewekwa mahali fulani kabla ya maofisa wa wizara hiyo kuketi chini na kuona jinsi zitakavyotumiwa. Tunataka kuarobiwa pesa hizo zilikuwa zimewekwa wapi na tuhakikishiwe kwamba faida iliyopatikana haitaenda katika mifuko ya watu binafsi. Je, ni kwa nini Wizara hiyo ilianza kulipisha huduma zake kama haikujulikana jinsi pesa zenyewe zitakavyotumiwa? Watu walizidi kukosa dawa na huku pesa zimewekwa mahali fulani.    Pia, nataka kusema kwamba mambo ya tenda yaandaliwe sana kwa sababu hapo ndipo pesa nyingi sana, hasa katika Wizara ya Afya, zinapotelea. Nina ushahidi wa kutosha kuonyesha kwamba tenda katika Wizara ya Afya hazipeanwi vilivyo. Yafaa jambo hili lichunguzwe sana kwa sababu linaweza kumaliza pesa haraka sana. Ikiwa tutapitisha pesa hapa tukiamini kwamba zitatumika kwa muda wa miezi 12 na kuwe na ulanguzi katika Wizara mbali mbali, hatutafika Juni, 1991, bila kusikia kwamba Wizara fulani imemaliza pesa tunazotoa leo. Ni lazima watu wawe na mawazo ya kizalerido ndipo tundelee. Ikiwa Wizara fulani itachukua hatua dhidi ya ofisa yeyote atakayepatikana na kosa la kutumia pesa za uinma vibaya, basi hatua hiyo itangazwe hadharani. Ikiwa itatangazwa kwamba Wizara fulani imemchukulia ofisa fulani hatua kwa kutumia pesa za umma vibaya, basi wale maofisa wengine wataogopa. Hakuria haja ya kuhamisha ofisa aliyepatikcina ria kosa la kupunja pesa za Serikali ria kumpeleka katika wizara nyingine.    Bw. Spika, niriamwomba Waziri wa Afya atupilie mbali nyongeza alizopitisha katika maiipo ya National Hospital Insurance Fund. Kuna tofauti kubwa sana kati ya KShs.20/- tulizokuwa tunalipa na KShs.320/- ambazo Waziri amiependekeza na kupi- tisha peke yake.    END.......IBw. Spika, kuna watu ambao watakuwa wanakatwa  Kshs.320/- kila mwezi, hata bila kujali kama wao ni wagojua au la. Hiyo ni nibima ya aina gani? Kama mtu anaruhusiwa kuweka hizo pesa katika bima nyingine hizozitakuwa pesa nyingi sana,  nazitakuwa ni bima ya juu sana. Huo ulikuwa umazi uarauzi mbaya sana. Ni  lazima waziu aondoe uamuzi huo; wa kuongeza pesa za National Hospital insurance Fund (N.H.I.F). Kama watu watakuwa wanalipa Kshs.320/- kila mwezi, basi lile nyongeza la pesa za watu wa Serikali ambayo Julai Mosi itakuwa halina maana kwa sababu itakuwa Cinachukuli na N.H.I.F. Ningependa Bw. Waziri ajue kwamba ameongeza pesa nyingi sana. Hata hakuuliza kubali cha kuongeza pesa hizo hapa katika Bunge yeye aliongeza tu. Bw. Waziri aliwajulisha watu nyongezaluto kupitia kwa magazeti. Kwa sasa wafanyakazi wanalalamika sana, na wamamwomba. Waziri, kupitia kwa sisi wahe. Wabunge, aondoe kabisa hilo nyongeza ya N.H.I.F. kwa sababu ni pesa nyingi sana kulingana na lile nyongeza la 10 au 15 kwa nuohahara ya  wafanyakazi wa Serikali na wafanyakazi wengne.        Bw. Spika, pia nilisikia Mtukufu Rais akisema kwamba mashirika ya Serikali na makampuni yataongeza mishahara ya wafanyakazi wao; na akawapatia wiki mbili wafanye hivyo. Mpaka leo, hatujasikia mashirika ya Serikali yakitangaza kwamba yameongeza mishahara ya wafanyakazi wao. Ni kwa nini wanakarwia hivyo? Wanapaswa waongeze mishahara ya wafanyakazi mwaazoma wa  mwaka wa Serikalio. Pia ningependa kuiuliza Ofisi ya Makamu wa Rais. na Wizara ya Fedha ianzishe kaaiati maalum ambayo itakuwa kichunguza matumizi ya pesa za Serikali bilakutarajiwa. Najua kwamba kuna Controller and  Auditor-General (Corporations), ambaye anafanya kazi yake vizuri, lakini ni lazima tuangalie vile pesa za Serikali zinavyotumiwa. Inaonekani Kama pesa zinatumiwa vibaya na nziriakwisha haraka tena na halafu tunaletewa pesa nyingine  hapa ilituzipitishe na waende wakazitumie tena vibaya.  Ni lazima huo mtindo ukomeshwe kabisa.Kwa hayo machache naunga mkono. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Asante sana, Bw. Spika kwa kunipa nafasi hii ili niunge mkono Hoja ambayo iko mbele yetu.    Kwa hakika Hoja hii ni Hoja ambayo imeangaliwa kwa makini, na kufikiriwa Srizuri, na kila mtu hapa anajua kwamba ni lazima hizo Wizara zote zipate pesa ambazo zimeomjja kupatiwa. Bw. Spika, naomba kwamba pesa hizo zipitishove lakini kwa wakati mwingi, hata kama tunapitisha pesa hizo, tukiuliza  maswali hapa, Mawaziri wengi hutuambia kwamba miradi yatakamilika "as soon as funds become available".  Sasa  ningependa kuwaambia Mawaziri kwamba leo tumeona pesa wazi wazi na tuna hakika, kwamba Wizara zao zitapatiwa. hizo pesa ambazo zimeandikwa katika orodha ya kanu za shughuli. Kwa hivyo, ningependa kusena ambayo kwamba miradi ambayo haya jamalika na yenye imenuiwa kuanzishwa ni lazima yakamilishwe kabisa. Mawaziri wasije hapa tena kutuambia kwamba miradi yatakamilika "as soon as funds become available. "     (END	J)             Bw.Spika, katika wizara ya Afya., siku hizi-kumetokea matatizo makubwa. Hakuna dawa katika hospitali zetu siku hizi na hata vifaa muhinu haviko. Lakini kwa vile sasa tutapitisha kiasi fulani cha pesa zitakazotolewa kwa wizara hii, ni lazima Wizara hii ihakikishe kwamba kila hospitali katika nchi hii imepata dawa za kutosha. Kama vile Waheshimiwa Wabunge waliotangulia kuzungumza walivyoseoa, hakuna haja ya kuwa na mpango wa cost sharing ikiwa wagonjwa hawaendelea kupata dawa. Eakuna haja hata kidogo ya kuwa na mpango kama huu ikiwa hospitali zetu zitaendelea kuwa bila vifaa muhimu. Ukienda leo katika hospitali ya Kinango, kwa mfano, utaona kwamba generator ambayo iliondolewa miaka minne iliyopita, haijarudishva. Mashine hii ilikuwa ikisaidia sana wakati stima zimepotea na hivyo ni kusema wakati wagonjwa wanapasuliwa, tunacrwomba Kungu tu, stina sizipotee. nasema hivyo lava sababu ikiwa wagonjwa wanapasuliva na stima zinapotea, maisha ya wagon jwa hawa huwa hatarini kubwa. Kila wakati tunasema juu ya taabu hii, tunaambiwa kwamba hakuna pesa, lakini leo tutapitisha pesa hizi, na kwa hivyo, ni wajibu wa waziri anayehusika, kuhakikisha kwamba ile mashine ya generator, imerudishwa katika hospitali ya Kinango.Bw. Spika, ningetaka kusema katika Bunge hili kwamba kuna tabia mbaya katika Wizara mbali mbali za Serikali. Utaona kwamba siku hizi maofisa wa Serikali wanachukua imprests na badala ya kurudisha pesa hizi mara moja wanachukua miaka mitano kabla ya kuzirudisha. Ningetaka kuchukua nafasi hii kuwaonya hawa maofisa wasizoee na tabia hii. Vile vile, ni lazima maofisa wanaopewa wajibu wa kuangalia peSa za imprests, wawe wakihakikisha kwamba pesa hizi zinarudishwa wakati unaofaa. Vile vile, ni lazima wahakikishe kwamba pesa hizi zinatumiwa kwa njia inayofaa. Kwa wakati huu, tuna ule mpango wa district focus for rural development, na ni lazima wanaohusika na pesa za maendelea, wahakikishe kwamba pesa hizo zinagawiwa wizara mbali mbali kulingana na mpango uliowekwa. Nasena hivyo kwa sababu kwa wakati mwingine, baada ya Bunge hili kupitisha pesa hizi, kuna maofisa wengine ambao wanapendelea kupeleka pesa nyingi zaidi katika sehemu zao. Hivyo ni kusema sehemu ambazo hazina mtu wa kusifikiria kama Kinango, zinapatiwa pesa kidogo sana. Kwa hivyo, ombi langu katika Bunge hili ni kwambapesa zitakazopitishwa, ni lazima zigawanywe sawasawa. Ni lazima kila wilaya ipewe haki yake ili Hospitali ya Kinango, kwa mfano, ipate pesa za kutosha.    Jambo lingine ambalo ningetaka kuzungumzia, ni kuhusu kazi ya kandarasi. Siku hizi watu wanaopewa kazi ya kandarasi, wanapewa kazi hii kwa njia ya upende leo. Kwa wakati mwingine watu hawa huwa ni jamaa za maofisa wanaohusiana na kazi ya kutoa tenders. Kwa hivyo, ni lazima Wizara za Serikali zihakikishe kwamba wenye kandarasi wanachaguliwa bila upendeleo wowote. Hatutaki mtu apewe kandarasi kwa vile yeye ni mjomba wa ofisa fulani. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu mambo kama hayo yametokea na mwishowe, tunakabiliwa na matatizo makubwa wakati wenye kandarasi wanawacha kazi zao kabla ya knzimaliza. Kwa mfano, katika sehemu yangu, kuna mjengo wa ofisi ya mkuu wa tarafa ambao ulianzishwa mnamo mwaka wa 1986, lakini hapo baadaye, mwenye kandarasi, alitoroka kabla ya kumaliza kazi hii. Ajabu ni kwamba mpaka leo, mjengo huu ungali unasimama na hii ni aibu kubwa kwa Serikali wakati tunafahamu wazi kwamba pesa za mjengo huu zilirudishwa katika Hazina ya Serikali eti kwa sababu hazikufanya kazi.    Bw. Spika, hii ndiyo sababu ninasema kwamba pesa ambazo tutapitisha katika Bunge hili, ni lazima zitumiwa kwa njia inayofaa na ni lazima maofisa wanaohusika wahakikishe kwamba pesa hizi zimetumiwa vizuri. Ni lazima pesa ambazo zimetengewa mradi fulani, zimafanyizwe kazi na kumalizika kabla ya mwisho wa mwaka. Hatutaki kusikia kwamba kiasi fulani cha pesa  kilirudishwa katika  Hazina ya Serikali ati kwa sababu hakikufanyizwa kazi.    Kwa upande wa Halmashauri ya Serikali, ningetaka kumuunga mkono mhe. Mbunge aliyesema kwamba ni lazima halmashauri yote ya Serikali yaige mfano mzuri wa Kenya Posts and Telecommunications corporation. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu ni halmashauri hii peke yake katika Kenya hii ambayo imewafanya watu wa Kenya, na Kenya kwa jumla kujulikana kote ulimwenguni. Kwa mfano, halmashauri hii ina wanariadhaa hodari sana ambao wameonyesha maajabu ya ushindi mkubwa katika mashindano ya michezo kote ulimwenguni. Kwa hivyo, ningeyaomba yale halmashauri ya Serikali ambayo yanapendelea knwafuta watu kazi ovyo ovyo, yaige mfano mwema wa Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu halmashauri hii leo inajiuza  yenyewe badala ya kujitembeza na hii ni kwa sababu inayaangalia maslahi ya wananchi.                                                                                	    Bw. Spika, ningetaka kusema juu ya Wizara ya Wafanyakazi. Ni lazima Wizara hii ihakikishe kwamba inawafanyia haki wafanyakazi katika nchi hii. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu kwa mara nyingi sana wafanyakazi wanatezeka sana na wanapokwenda katika maofisi ya wafanyakazi wakitaka matatizo yao yatatuliwe, hawasaidiwi sawasawa. Kwa hivyo, ni  lazima pesa tunazopitisha zitumiwe kwa kuwasaidia wafanyakazi na bila shaka pesa hizi zinatosha mwaka mmoja. Kwa hivyo, ni lazima Wizara mbali mbali pamoja na halmashauri za Serikali zihakikishe kwamba pesa hizo zinatumiwa kwa njia inayofaa. Kwa upande wa kuwaajiri watu kazi, tungetaka Wizara mbali mbali pamoja na halmashauri hizi, zihakikishe kwamba zinawaajiri wananchi kazi. Hatutaki tabia ya kuwaajiri wananchi kazi ya kibarua kwa miaka yote. Tunapopitisha pesa hizi, tunatumaini kwanba watu wetu ambao wamekuwa wakifanya kazi ya kibarua, wataandikwa katika kazi ya kudumu. Ninasema hivyo kwa sababu ya tabia hii ya kuwaajiri watu wetu kazi ya kibarua kwa miaka zaidi ya ndtatu. Hili si jambo nzuri na tungetaka watu wetu wawe wakiajiriwa kazi ya kibarua kwa miezi mitatu peke yake na kuajiriwa katika kazi ya kudumu anapofarya kazi kwa mwezi wa nne.    Bw. Spika, kwa upande wa miradi ya Serikali, nirgetaka kusema kwamba kuna miradi mingi ambayo yameanzishwa na Serikali. Kwa vile sasa tutapitisha pesa hizi, ni lazima zitumiwe kwa kumariza kazi hii na  hatutaki kusikia kwamba hakuna pesa. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu miradi hii sasa ya inazingojea hizi pesa na hatutaki zicheleweshwe hata kidogo. Tungetaka baada ya kupitisha pesa hizo leo, zitolewe mara moja ili mwezi wa Julai, kazi hii ianzishwe. Vile vile, ningeomba  kusiwe na upendeleo wa aina yoyote kwa upande wa maofisa wa Serikali. Pesa hizi ni lazima zigawe kulingana na mpango uliowekwa ili ziweza kufanya kazi inayohitajika kwa haraka iwezekanavyo.    Bw. Spika, kama tunavyofahamu, Wizara ya Fedha inaendeshwa na watu wanaojua umunimu wa pesa. Kwa  hivyo,  naiomba wizara hii iwe macho zaidi ili kuhakikisha kwamba pesa za Serikali zinatumiwa vizuri.    Kwa hayo machache naunga mkono. </NEWSPEECH>                                                                                <NEWSPEECH>MR. MANGOLI:  Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this very important motion which is asking the Government to get a certain amount of money from the Consolidated Fund, to be used by the various Ministries for the purpose of  meeting expenditure necessary during the year ending 30th June, 1951. According to the Constitution of this country, the Minister for finance, is expected to come to this House to seek Parliamentary authority to spend this money.  This gesture should inform the world at large, that Kenya respects its law.                                            	                                                                                                                        MR. MANG'OLI (CTD.):    I say this so that if any person thinks that there is no law here may now see it in the open. The Government cannot spend money until this particular Motion is brought to this House-for approval. I congratulate the Vice-President and Minister for Finance on upholding the law in this case.        Let me comment on the various Ministries and departments for which we are going to vote funds. We realise that money has now been allocated to various Ministries and departments. There are a number of things that the Ministries of Health and Public Works particularly should look at. Wananchi wonder why there is cost-sharing in the Ministry of Health. They are paying money for treatment, but they are not receiving drugs. We can see on paper here that the Ministry of Health is being given a lot of money. We hope that drugs will now be made available to wananchi. At the moment, when wananchi visit health centres, they do not get drugs; instead they are given prescription to buy them from chemists. Doctors collude so that wananchi buy drugs from their own chemist shops which they have opened in nearly all streets. We hope that, after the Ministry has been given this money, it will ensure that drugs are available in hospitals.        Mr. Spéaker, Sir, the Government has gone into too much cost-sharing, and we want the Government to review the whole idea. You find that the Ministry of Education is given a lot of money, but it is withdrawing various services from schools and one wonders what is happening if not conspiracy. Why is the Ministry withdrawing these services. For instance, subordinate staff members, such as secretaries in secondary schools, have been passed on to parents to pay. It is important that the Government, as a policy, reviews cost-sharing in order to find out its shortcomings. If mwananchi is overtaxed, when he finds himself pushed to the wall at the end of the day, he will charge back. So, the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance, which is important Ministry in this regard, should review cost-sharing. There is cost-sharing in the Ministry of Health and the National Social Security Fund, and all this burden falls back on the mwananchi. As an overall policy of the Government, cost—sharing should                                                                                                            MR. MANG'OLI (CTD.):    be reviewed because it is not in the interests of wananchi for all of us to continue to keep quiet in matters of this nature.        In the case of the Ministry of Public Works, we even wonder why we are voting this money for it. Some bridges were approved for construction sometime back, but they have not yet been built. Last year, the Ministry promised to build a certain bridge for me, that is, the Misemwa-Ndivisi Bridge, but it has not yet build it. The cost of this work has now gone up. The Road Maintenance Team of the Ministry of Public Works is no longer in existence, and I wonder why people are even employed in the team. The team keeps its trucks in their headquarters, and I never see them in Webuye where there are very many feeder roads that are impassable. I wonder whether we are voting money for this Ministry in good taste. We are asking the Ministry to implement the projects that have already been approved, and to avoid waiting until the cost of the work goes too high for the Ministry to finance it. The road between Eldoret and Kitale was repaired only recently, but you cannot pass through it right now. Is there some conspiracy between the Ministry's personnel and the people who build our roads? It is not believable that a road is repaired and you cannot use it in less than three months thereafter. We want the Office of the Vice—President and Ministry of Finance, which is the centre of expenditure, to make sure that what we spend is accounted for Accountability is very important.        With regard to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, I have been wondering from time to time why the Ministry has not even been having enough petrol to enable its officers to move about. When you have a function and you want officers of the Ministry to cover it, they say that they have no petrol. Now that money is going to be made available, we hope that the officers of this Ministry will move close to the people. We say this very clearly here so that the Ministry may know, as it receives this money, the services we require from it. It is not believable that reporters are placed in Bungoma and they cannot move out just because there is no petrol. Last week                                                                                                                MR. MANG'OLI (CTD.):    But one, the excuse used to be that there was no petrol and now that money is being sanctioned, the Ministry's personnel will be able to move out to cover what is happening in every division of our constituencies so that people may know that we are available.        When you consider the Ministry of Water Development, you find that a number of water projects are on—going. Time and again, I have been wondering what is happening to the Muchi-Khalala Water Project. Money for it was passed here, but I think it is a part of the funds that were later returned to the Treasury. We want to know what is going in the Ministry of Water Development and why this project has not been implemented, we need water because water is life. I am sure the Vice-President and Minister for Finance will convey this comment to the Ministry of Water Development so that we may have water. I say this because from time to time, Webuye town has no water. Officers of the Ministry say that they are going to improve the reserve water tank, but even the water itself has not been treated for quite some time now. The law requires that after every two weeks, water tanks be emptied and cleaned, but the water in Bungoma has not been treated for the last six years. Hence cholera has set in and children in the area are dying of the disease. I hope that the Ministry will adhere to the law. If Minister suppress the law, who else can uphold it? The water in Bungoma must have been in the tanks for the last 10 years, and yet the law is very clear on water treatment. Cholera has broken out there.        Turning to the Ministry of Co-operative Development, I would like to say that the Co—operative Union of Bungoma has a sort of bank in the town, and people who bank their sugarcane proceeds there are not being paid. I wonder why the Ministry is not taking this matter seriously. Farmers are suffering. The Co—operative Union held elections which seemed to be a sort of conspiracy to ensure that the same people were returned to office.    With these few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. TWARITH: Ahsante sana, Bw. Spika, kwa kunipa nafasi. Ninaiunga mkono Hoja hii kwa sababu ni ya maana sana. Hoja hii itahakikisha kwamba tumepata pesa za kutosha kuleta maendeleo katika kila Wizara.                                Bw. Spika, mimi naiunga mkono Hoja hii kwa sababu ikipitishwa na Bunge hili kila wizara itapata haki yake, Hata hivyo, ningeiomba Wizara ya Elimu, ambayo imepewa pesa nyingi, ijaribu kuimarisha kazi yake katika sehemu mbali mbali humu nchini , Kuna shule za mabweni katika sehemu kame lakini utaona kwamba chakula cha wanafunzi hakipelekwi kwenye shule hizo kwa wakati unaofaa, Kwa hivyo, ningeiomba Wizara ya Elimu ihakikishe kwamba imenunua magari ya kutosha ili chakula na maziwa viweze kupelekwa kwenye shule katika sehemu kame. Ninasema hivi kwa sababu hivi majuzi kulitokea shida kubwa katika mawakilisho yangu ya Baringo Mashariki. Hii ni kwa sababu shule za mabweni katika sehemu hiyo zilikaa karibu muhula mzima bila ya kupatiwa maziwa na chakula cha watoto. Maziwa yaliwekwa kwenye ofisi ya mkuu wa elimu sx katika tarafa mpaka yakaharibika na kumwagwa ndani ya choo. Maziwa yaliyokusudiwa kupelekewa wanafunzi katika shule 12 katika eneo la Kerio Valley yaliharibika kabisa. Makosa hayakuwa ya mkuu wa elimu katika sehemu hiyo bali yalikuwa ya Wizara ya Elimu. Hii ni kwa sababu Wizara hii haina magari ya kutosha katika sehemu hiyo ili kusafirisha maziwa hadi kwenye shule. Hata hivyo nikiangalia kwenye makisio ya mwaka huu ninaweza kuona kwamba Wizara hii imepewa kiasi kikubwa sana cha pesa. Ukiangalia R.31 - Ministry of Education - utaona kwamba Wizara hii imepewa kiasi cha K£509,510,490. Kwa hivyo ni lazima Wizara hii iyaangalie maslahi ya watoto wa Nyayo. Kiasi hiki cha pesa kinaweza kuiwezesha Wizara hii kununua magari ya kutosha kusafirisha vyakula vya wanafunzi hadi kwenye shule kote nchini. Vile vile utaona kwamba walimu katika sehemu mbali mbali kule masham_bani hawalipwi mishahara yao kwa wakati unaofaa.  Walimu husafiri mwendo mrefu kwenda kutafuta mishahara na huwa na shida kurudi shuleni haraka. Kwa hivyo, ningeiomba Wizara ijaribu kulipia walimu mishahara yao katika tarafa.                                                                                                                                    MR. TWARITH (CTD):	Wizara ikiyafanya mambo haya yote wazazi na walimu wataishukuru sana na walimu hasa watazidi kuipenda kazi yao. Ninajua kwamba walimu wanafanya kazi nzuri sana. Kwa hivyó ni lazima maslahi yao yaangaliwe vizuri.Ningependa kusema kwamba Hotuba ya Bajeti ilikuwa nzuri sana. Hata hivyo ningependa kuiomba Wizara ya Ujenzi iangalie mambo ya barabara. Kwa wakati huu hakuna mvua nyingi na ningeiomba Wizara ya Ujenzi ijaribu kurekebisha barabara ya kutoka Loruk, Nginyang hadi Kolol na sehemu nyingine. Hii ni kwa sababu hizi ni barabara muhimu sana katika usafirishaji wa maziwa hadi kwenye shule. Pia barabara hizi ni muhimu kwa shughuli za biashara katika sehemu hizo. Barabara hizo hutumiwa na wananchi kusafiri hadi Kabaraet na Nakuru. Lakini jambo la kushangaza ni kwamba Wizara ya Ujenzi haiji shughulishi na kuajiri vibarua ili wakate miti kando kando ya barabara. Kazi ya Wizara hii imekuwa ni kuweka lami peke yake. Wao hawashughulikii  barabara za mchanga. Sijaona kazi ya gravelling ikifanywa kwenye barabara hizo kwa muda mrefu. Mwaka uliopita walifanya kazi kidogo lakini utaona kwamba mwaka huu hawajarekebisha zile barabara za usalama au security roads katika sehemu yangu kwa hivyo ningeiomba Wizara hii ijaribu kurekebisha barabara kote nchini ili shule ziweze kuendelea kupelekewa chakula na maziwa. Hili pia ni jambo ambalo litawasaidia sana wafanya biashara.        Bw.Spika, siwezi kusahau kuzungumza juu ya ile Wizara mpya ya Kusitawisha Sehemu Kame hapa nchini. Ukiangalia makadirio ya mwaka huu utaona kwamba Wizara hii imepewa kiasi kidogo sana cha pesa. Yafaa Wizara hii ipewe pesa zaidi ili iweze kuzishughulikia sehemu kame kikamilifu.                                                                                                                                MR. TWARITH (CTD);Bw. Spika, ningependa kuiomba Ofisi ya Makamu wa Rais na Wizara ya Fedha, wakati wa kutoa pesa kwa Wizara mbali mbali, ifikirie zile Wizara ambazo zinashughulikia maeneo makubwa ya nchi hii. Hii ni kwa sababu robo tatu za eneo la Kenya ni kame. Kwa hivyo yafaa Wizara hii ya Kustawisha Sehemu Kame ipewe pesa za kutosha. Hii ni kwa sababu eneo lote la Mkoa wa Kaskazini Mashariki ni kavu. Vile vile sehemu za Turkana, West Pokot na Mkoa wa Sonde la Ufa ni kavu. Yafaa Wizara hii ipewe pesa za kutosha ili kuiwezesha kuifikia kila sehemu ya nchi hii bila matatizo mengi.    Pia, Bw. Spika, ningependa kuichukua fursa hii kuwaomba Mwaziri wetu wajaribu kuzitembelea sehemu zote za Jamhuri ya Kenya ili waweze kujionea kwa macho yao wenyewe shida zinazo- wakabili watu wetu. Ni lazima wafanye hivyo ili waweze kutambua ni wilaya gani ambazo zinakibiliwa na shida nyingi zaidi nani sehemu gani ambazo zinahitaji kusaidiwa kwanza. Wakifanyahivyo sisi Wabunge tuliochaguliwa tutakuwa na fur aha na pia wananchi wetu watatambua kwamba Serikali yetu inayajali sana maslahi yao. Kwa hivyo ni lazima Waziri na Mawaziri Wasaidizi wajaribu kuzitembelea sehemu kame ambazo zilipuuzwa na wakoloni hapo awali. Ni lazima Wizara hii ya Sehemu Kame ipewe pesa za kutosha ili iweze kuyatatua matatizo yanayowakabili watu wetu wanaoishi katika sehemu kame hapa nchini.    Kwa hayo machache, naomba kuunga mkono. </NEWSPEECH>                                                                         <NEWSPEECH> MR.KYONDA: Thank you, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my collegeues in this debate. It is important that this money should be released to various Ministries for the, provision of services to the wananchi. This gives us the hope that the people will be assisted in various ways because they have many complaints with regard to the provision of services.       The issue of health is a big concern of everybody. People are now complaining because they cannot get drugs in our medical institutions. We wonder what is happening and it is my feeling that there might be some people who are after giving our Government a bad name. Some people simply want to enrich themselves. It seems there is something wrong somewhere. This is an area the Ministry of Health needs to look into, perhaps, in conjunction with the police in order to unearth the consipiracy that might be there. All hon. Members who have spoken have complained about shortage of drugs and there must be something somewhere.           Recently, public health officials came to my constituency - I think they are still there - to check on cleaniliness in business premises, such as, hotels and butcheries and we were happy about it. Unfortunately, these official came round on one market day and ordered one hotelier to close his premises immediately. The food which had been prepared went to waste thus bringing losses. Thèy order the premises closed for petty reasons, such as, rough floors,  lack of in-door basins for washing hands and so on.Our people should not be harrassed like this. Since the inspection team is still going round, I would like to ask the Ministry of Health to put an end to this kind of harrassment. We will not oppose the going up of health standards and people being advised. Business premises should only be ordered closed after the person concerned has refused to adhere to the instructions of health officials. People should be given time to implement instructions of health officials instead of harrassing them and losses incurred.MR. KYONDA (ctd):	            The outcry is the same all over the country with regard to condition of roads. The roads are not maintained and are impassable duringthe rainy season. There is a section of a road in my constituency which is impassable and people are wondering, what is happening. This is a classifiedroad and we do not know what the Government, is doing about it. We have not been given any explanation and I would like to appeal to the Ministry of Public Works to do something about it immediately now that money is being available.     Last time, the Minister for Public Works assured me that roads in constituency would be repaired as soon as the rains stop. It stopped raining a long time ago but nothing is being done about the state of roads. A grader was sent to Makueni but it is immobile at the moment. Why was itmoved in the first place if it was not going to be used in doing the roads? Theseare some of the funny little things which bother us very much. Sometimes, you find workers from the Ministry of Public. Works stationed somewhere but doing nothing. For example, these workers can be stationed a kilometre from a section of the road which is impassable. These people just sit there doing nothing and all they do is drink and waste time yet they are paid every month.      These are some of the things I would call upon various Ministries to rectify because they are giving the Government a bad name and making the people to suffer whereas all efforts are being made to deliver services. How that funds are bèing released, I hope that my district officer will be provided with transport to enable him reach the people. My constituency is a large one and the district officer has been depending on borrowed transport when carrying out his duties.I mentioned earlier on about meat inspectors. I would like to complain on behalf of my constituents that these officers are asking the people they are supposed to serve for bus fare amounting to 60/- or 100/-. We know that the Government has laid down procedures with regard to how people are supposed to be served. Government officers are supposed to serve    MR. KYONDA. (ctd):    The people and it is upon the Government to provide them with transport. Government officers should not go round asking money from people who are earning very little. This is a very serious issue which should he looked into immediately.                       The other thing is with regard to overcharging on certain commodities. The other day I said that wananchi are being overcharged on sugar. This is a commodity that is needed in almost every home. The same also applies to wheat flour. When a such items are overcharged, Sir, you can imagine the number of people who are suffering particularly in the rural areas where the wananchi depend on the little they earn from their farm produce. The Ministry of Supplies and Marketing should streamline this anomaly. which has been going on for a very long time.        Now that money is being released, there should be proper planning so that the allocated funds cover the intended period. For example, in November hear that vehicles cannot be repaired because funds are exhausted. This is not very good at all. Wananchi should get necessary services from the Government because money has been voted out to cover the whole year and not just nine or 10 months.               With these few remarks, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH>                                                                                                                                    <NEWSPEECH> MR. BARNG'ETUNY: Ahsante sana, Bw. Spika, kwa kunipitia nafasi hii ili niweze kuiunga mkono Hoja hii. Ninaiunga mkono Hoja hii ili Wizara ziweza kuwa na pesa za kuendeleza miradi yao mbali mbali. Kwani kwa wakati huu utaona Wizara nyingi hazina pesa. Ningependa pia kuchukua nafa hii kuwapongeza Mawaziri kwa kuendeleza kazi rizuri. Ingawa ni hivyo, ningependa kuwashutumu wale Mawaziri wanaoongea bila kufikiria. Ingawa Mtukufu Rais ametuambia tuzungumze na sauti moja bado kuna Mawaziri wanaoongea tofauti sana. Kwa mfano, juzi nilisoma kwa gazeti la Standard kuwa mhe. Nyagah anataka kulipiga marufuku kanisa la Church of the Province of Kenya (CPK) hali anajua wazi wazi kuwa yule mwenye uwezo huu ni Mtukufu Rais au Mkuu wa Sheria. Mambo kama haya ni uchochezi. Kwa hivyo, ni jambo a maana sana kama Waziri yoyote anayetaka kuongea acachunguze sana maneno yake ili baadaye yasije yakaleta mambo mabaya. Waziri huyu huyu juzi pia alikuwa anasema ati tubadilishe au tusahihishe Katiba ya Chama cha Kanu. Baadaye alirudi hapa na kusema kuwa Mtukufu Rais afanywe Rais wa Maisha. Kwa sababu Mawaziri ndio wanaoingoza Serikali pamoja na Mtukufu Rais ni wajibu wao kuhakikisha kuwa wana msimamo mmoja. Ni wajibu wa viongozi wote kuwa vielelezo vyema kwa wananchi.        Sote pia tunatakiwa kuufuata mfano wa Mtukufu Rais. Wakati wale watu walipoanzisha mambo yao ya kuvitaka vyama vyingi, Mtukufu Rais alitembelea mikoa yote na kuwauliza wananchi maoni yao juu ya jambo hili na wananchi wakali kataa jambo hilo. Baada ya hapo ndipo yeye mwenyewe akasema kuwa mazunguunzo juu ya mfumo wa vyama vyingi yasimamishwe. Kwa hivyo, ni wajibu wetu viongozi kuufuata mfano wa Rais na kuhakikisha kuwa sisi sote ni kitu kimoja na tusiwe tunasema maneno tu kwa mdomo hali mioyo yote inafikira mengine Kama tutakuwa tunafanya kazi yetu kwa sababu ya mishahara tu, basi hiyo ni aibu kubwa sana. Serikali hii si ya mtu mmoja bali niatu wote. Sisi viongozi tunatakiwa kuwa ongoza vizuri wananchi. na hatutakiwi kufanya mambo ambayo yatawasumbua        Juzi Nakuru Mtukufu Rais hafeo alisema kuwa hataki kuitwa Mtukufu bali aitwe mheshimiwa kama watu wengine. Lakini watu bado wanamwita hivyo na mabishop wengine waliandika kwa magazeti ati hakuna mtu anayeweza kuitwa mtukufu. Je, tunaitumiaje demokrasia yetu? Je, maongozi yetu yamenyoka                                                                                                    au yameenda kombo?  Ni lazima tuwe kila wakati tunajua kile tunachofanya. Ni lazima tuhakikishe kuwa tumeitengeneza hii nchi kwa vizazi vijavyo.     Kwa hayo roachache, naunga mkono.  </NEWSPEECH>        [Mr. Speaker let the Chair]    [The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kagwima) took the Chair]              <NEWSPEECH> MR. P.J. MASINDE: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this Motion. It is proper that we support and pass this Motion so that the Treasury can release the funds to the Ministries so that they can carryout their projects that are yet to be completed. In fact, hon. Members have been promised completion of their projects during the new financial year and since that financial year is just around the corner we hope that Ministries will keep their promises. That will ensure that hon. Members do not come back here to ask Questions about the same projects.                 I would also like to take this opportunity to appeal to the Office of the Vice—President and Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Planning and National Development to ensure that the funds given to various Ministries are properly spent and for the purposes that they were meant for. This is because there is still a lot of shoddy work being done where projects are concerned thus making then in the long run more costly that they were supposed to be. This problem is brought about by lack of proper supervision by the concerned Ministries. I would like to suggest that these two Ministries should be carrying out the supervision of such projects.                  I would also like to say something about the Ministry of Supplies and Marketing which is a very important Ministry. Although that is so, we have heard of farmers having storage facilities problems with their crops, especially with maize and rice. Since there are no enough storage facilities, say in a given area, farmers are forced to store their crops in their own houses and when they harvest a new crop they are forced to sell the old crop at a throw-away price. I would like to suggest that in order to solve this problem, the Ministry                                                                                                        MR. P.J. MASINDE (ctd.):    sets up stores at strategic points near the farmers. This will ensure that farmers do not incur costs transporting their crops to the nearest store. This would also prevent the farmers crops from being wasted. If such foods are stored properly, then they can even be exported abroad and earn this country that much needed foreign exchange.                                                                                                                                                    MR. P.J. MASINDE (Ctd.):On this, I would appeal that the Ministry considers putting up such a kind of a store in Nam Dale Constituency we need it. We are close to the border and you never know what such kind of a store could do to help wananchi at one time or another.    Sir,I would like to congratulate the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation, as a parastatal body. we have read about some parastatal bodies not doing so well, others claim to be doing well. But we can see what the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications are doing. They are supplying wananchi with the services that they require.        However, while competition is a good thing, of late, we have read about the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation wanting to let private enteriprises compete with them. This is a very healthy idea. I only hope that the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation will not at one time come and start threatening wananchi because of stiff competition. By the very fact that they are allowing this competition, they must be ready to compete.        Sir, I also want to congratulate the Minister for Local Government for having ordered that there should be no more indiscriminate demolition of kioks and shunties in towns. However, I would like also to suggest that while that exercise is going on, he should also make sure that our towns are also kept clean and orderly. Therefore, I would request the Minister concerned to make proper use of services charge in order to keep our towns and City clean, and also to have our towns properly planned so that they give proper services to wananchi required by the law and, at the same time, they do not interfere with the normal business of wananchi, be they kiosks or otherwise.                                                                                                                    Sir, I would like to touch on the Attorney-General's Chambers. The Attorney-General's Chambers should educate the Ministries to look after the widows or widowers of the employees of the Government. We have heard of cases where civil servantsdied, as long ago as 1980, and their widows have not been helped to claim or get anything in form of compensation or terminal benefits. I am sure that quite a number of children belonging to these late civil servants have been thrown out of schools not because there are no funds but because the various Ministries concerned where these civil servants were working did not take up the cases. However, where they did take up the cases, the Public Trustees in the Attorney-General's Chambers have sat on the benefits and done nothing to help the wananchi who do not know where to go to after losing their better-halves. I strongly suggest and recommend that the Attorney-General's Chambers, as the custodian of the law in this country, help to make sure that the bereaved or those who have lost their members who have been in the Government service can continue living comfortable lives as they have done before. I am surprised to find that the private sector is quite well organised in such matters, but the Government or some Ministries which are supposed to have their employees at heart take this matter very lightly.        Sir, now that we are approving the funds to be used in Ministries, I would request the Minister for Public works to carry out certain works on Mumias-Nambale-Busia road. This is the gateway to the Provincial Headquarters, but to get there one has to pass through for me from Busia eight constituencies. This is because sometimes the read is is impassable. I would appeal that the Minister concerned makes use of this new financial year to make sure that this work is started. We have sung about it for too long                                                                                                                                        and it is high time it was done.    With those few remarks, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Muturia): Nashukuru sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipatia nafasi hii ili nami niungane na Wabunge wensangu kumpongeza Mtukufu Makamu- Rais na Waziri wa Fedha.        Kama vile nilivyosema siku nyingine hapa, ukiangalia "quality" ya wafanyakasi wetu wa Serikali katika Jamhuri hii ya Kenya utaona ni nzuri sana. Pia wafanyakasi hawa wana Kenya ndani ya roho zao. Hata utaona kwamba wakati Llakamu-Rai s na Waziri wa Fedha anapofanya kazi yake halali. Yeye anataka kumsaidia Mtukufu Rais na Serikali yetu tukufu kwa njia zote ili mwananchi wa kawaida asije akaguswa na taabu yoyote.        Pesa hizi ambazo zimetengwa kuiendesha kazi ya Serikali ni nusu. Hii ni kusema kwamba Makanu-Rais na waziri wa Fedha anaona umuhimu wa kuifanya Serikali iendelee na miradi ya maende-leo yote ambayo imepangwa ili isije ikafilisika kwa sababu tukingojea mpaka wakati pesa kamili zitakapopatikana utaona kwamba mambo mengi katika Kenya na pia miradi mingi itazorota. hii ndiyo sababu namshukuru Mtukufu Rais sana kwa kumteua Mtukufu Makamu- Rais na Waziri wa Fedha, Profesa Saitoti, kusinamia pesa za nchi hii. Hii ni kwa sababu inaonekana kwamba yeye hana kazi nyingine isipokuwa kufikiria mambo ya Kenya yanaenda namna gani.        Jambo la pili, ningependa kumshukuru Mtukufu Rais kwa kuizunguka Kenya nzima. Jumamosi alisema kwamba mambo yote kuhusu majadiliano juu ya vyama vingi yamekoma. Lakini I cannot help saying something about last Saturday.                            THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Muturia) (CTD):    Bw. Naibu Spika wa Mud a ningetaka kuchukua nafasi hii kusema kwaMba Jumamosi iliyopita, tarelie 16.6.90, itakuwa nisiku ya kukumbukwa na Wakenya wote katika nchi hii. Hii ni kwa sababu tanga siku tulipounyakua Uliuru wetu - hatukupewa Uhuru wetu sijapata kuona mkutano nwingine mkubvva sawa na ule niliuona huku Nakuru siku hiyo. Ningependa kumwona Waziri wetu wa Habari na utengazaji, mhe kanyi, ikiwezekana, ahakileishe kama filamu hiyo ya Jumamosi inatengenezwa vizuri na kutumwa katika balozi zetu zote katika nchi za nje na kuonyeshwa watu wa huko ili waone idadi ya wakenya wanaompenda Mtukufu Rais. Hii itatuondolea lawama ambazo tulikuwa tunievrekelewa na wengine wakati wa mjadala juu vyama vingi vya kisiasa, na ambao sitaki kuurudia kwa sababu ulikomeshwa na na Rais.        Sijui ni kwa nini waandishi wa habari wa kigeni hawakuja kuandika kuhusu mkutano huo. Pia ningemwonba Waziri wetu Wa Mashauri ya nchi za kigeni na Ushirikiano wa Kimataifa, mhe Ayah, waambia wageni kile kinachoendelea hapa nchini. Tunajua hata mwenda wazimu akiita mkutano wa waandishi wa habari na kusema maneno yake, waikenya wote watayasoma na kuona karna huyo ni mta masliahuri. Leo kila mtu hapa kenya amesoma yale yaliyosenvva na Mukura Nganga. Mgeni ambaye hawajui wfakenya viztiri akiyasoma maoni yake atafikiri mukaru anasema ukweli. Yeye anasema hakutoroka; ikiwa hakutoroka, anaweza liyeipiga muhuri pasipoti yake na kumpa kibali cha kuondoka hapa nchini. Ni mtu huyu tu ambaye alikuwa anataka koti Euu iamru asishikwe na hali alikuvra. bado aiaejificha mahali fulani. Tunataka mkutano huo wa Jumamosi huonyeshwe nje ya Kenya ili wageni wajue kwamba sisi tunaiunga mkono Serikali na chama cha Kanu.        Ningependa kusema kwamba pesa hizi zitasaidia sana. Katika                                                                                                                        Wilaya Meru na kwingineko katika Kenya kuna miradi mingi ambayo inaendelea. Kama hatungekubali pesa hizi zitumiwe utekelezaji wa miradi hio utasimama, na halafu ianze kuporomoka. Jambo hili likifanyika itakuwa ni hasara kwetu kwa sababu tutamia pesa nyingi kuirekebisha.    Bw. Naibu Spika wa muda, baadhi ya mashirika yetu ya Serikali yanafanya kazi kwa kujitelea. mfano mzuri ni Agricultural Development Corporation (ADC). Shirika hili limetuwezesha, kupitia Wizara ya kilimo, kuwa mbegu nzuri ya mahindi, nazi, viazi, ng'ombe wa gredi, nyama, nguruwe, kuku, maua na vitu vingine vingi. Inafaa mashirika mengine yaige mfano wa ADC. Hata nimesikia ADC linauza mbegu za nyasi kule Amerika ya Kusini na kutupatia pesa za kigeni. Hata hakuna nchi nyingine ambayo inauza nyama katika soko la Jumuiya ya Ulaya kama Kenya. Hii ni kwa sababu mifugo wetu wanalishwa kwa njiaz nzuri. Kwa hivyo, nyama yetu inauzwa katika ulaya, Amerika, Mashariki ya kati na ya Mbali na kwingineko.        Pia ninalishukuru Shirika la Agricultural Finance Corporation kwa sababu tangu lianzishwe mwaka wa 1963 - nilikuwa nmoja wa wakurugenzi wake wa kwanza - limekuwa likiwakopesha wakulima pesa, lakini sasa linafanywa kuwa benki ya wakulima. Sasa wakulima wataweza kufungua akaunti katika mojawapo ya matawi ya AFC na pia kupata mkopo wa kuendesha aina ya ukulima wanaotaka.        Kwa jumla ninamshukuru Makanru wa Rais na Waziri wa Fedha kuliomba Bunge lipitisha nusu ya pesa za matumizi ya Serikali ili miradi iendelee kutekelezwa. Nafikiri mradi wa Mutwote Police Station utaendelea kujengwa.    Kwa hayo machache naunga mkono. </NEWSPEECH>                                                                                                                                <NEWSPEECH>MR. KUBO: Ahsante sana Bw. Naibu Spika Wa Muda kwa kunipatianafasi hii ili nami niiunge mkono Hoja hii. Wabunge wengi Wanieeleza hali ya barabara katika nchi hii ilivyo. Mimi pia ningetaka kusema kwamba barabara nyingi simeharibika sana hivi kwaaba sehemu nyingine hazipitiki kwa wakati huu. Kwa hivyo, tukizipitisha pesa hizi, urekebishaji wa barabara katika nchi nzima ungepewa umuhimu nkubwa, kwa sababu tangu mvua ianze kunyesha barabara nyingi ziaekuwa mbaya sana. kwa mfano, barabara ya kivalwa-mboghoni Timbila imekuwa haipitiki tangu mzimu wa mvua uanze na kwa hivyo ndizi za wananchi zimekuwa zikioza katika sehemu hiyo. Vile vile barabara zinazoènda Leketive na kitovu na ile inayotoka Taveta hadi Eaoro hazi jarekebishwa kwa sababu hakuna pesa. Tuseletewa mtrekta mapya lakini hayawezi kufanya kwa sababu hakuna diseli. Ningenda Wizara inayoirasika iliangalie jambo hili kwa makini.        Jambo lingine linaloisumbua sehemu yangu ni mafuriko. Kumekuma na mfuriko na hadi sasa wananchi hawawezi kurudi katika sehemu zao kwa sababu barabara hazipitiki na pia mashaniba yainefunikwa na maji. Ningeiomba wizara ya Ustawi wa Maji ione kwamba, baada ya pesa hizi kupitishwa, trekta la kumba matope katika muifriko ambalo tunalo na ambalo halifanyi kazi kwa sababu ya ukosefu wa diseli, pesaza diseli zimetolewa na ikiwezekana tupewa trekta lingine ili eneo la Rumu River Basin, ambalo linachukua sehemu kubwa ya Taveta, lifanyiwe kazi.                                                                    Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, wakati tunapoonge'a juu ya pesa yafaa tukumbuke kwamba kuna tatizo moja ambalo limewakumba wananchi. Nina furahi kuona Waziri wa Afya ameingia hapa kwa sababu tatizo ninalotaja linahusiana na Wizara yake. Wananchi. wamelalamika sana juu ya kitu kinachoitwa medical examination fees, ingawa wanaunga mkono maongozi ya kugawana gharama; Mtu yeyote akitaka kupata medical examination certificate anatakikana alipe KShs.100/-. Kwa wengi wetu tunaona kama hizo ni pesa kidogo, lakini ukikumbuka kwamba vijana wanaomaliza masomo na kuitwa katika vituo mbali mbali za mafunzo hutakikana kupata medical certificate, utaona kwamba hizo si pesa kidogo. Baada ya mahojiano, wale wanaofaulu wanaambiwa wapeleke medical certificate na wanapoenda hospoitalini wanaitishwa KShs.100/-, kiasi ambacho huwa hawana. Kwa hivyo, tunaomba kwamba examination fees kwa vijana ambao wanajiunga na vituo tofauti tofauti ziongolewe.    Vile vile, utaona kwamba vijana wanaotaka kuchukua vitambulisho huambiwa waende wafanyiwe age assessment kama hawana hati za kuzaliwa, na hao pia huambiwa walipe KShs.100/- na wanapata taabu sana. Wizara inayohusika inafaa kuondolea ada hii mbali kwa sababu age assessment ni kitu kidogo sana. Hata utaona kwamba wananchi wanaofanya biashara ya kuuza mahamri na bidhaa nyingine kama hizo hutakikana kuliopa ada ya KShs.100/- ili waweze kupata medical certificate. Ukifikiria kwamba hao wafanya biashara wadogo wadogo hutakikana kuchukua medical certificate baada ya kila miezi mitatu, utaona kwamba wana tatizo kubwa. Ingawa tunaendele'a kutafuta njia za kuipatia Serikali pesa, jambo hili linawatatiza wananchi na linastahili kuchunguzwa sana.        Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, tunaifurahia Wizara ya Ardhi, Nyumba na Mipango ya Miji kwa sababu ilikubali kuwe na kamati ya kuchuguza matatizo ya maskwata katika sehemu mbali mbali hapa nchini. Lakini ingawa kamati hizi zime'wekwa, maofisa wa Sérikali wanazoziongoza mara kwa mara husema hawana pesa za kusafiria kwenda kutatua matatizo ya maskwata. Kwa hivyo, naomba kwamba kutengwe pesa ili iendeshe kazi ya kamati zinazotatua matatizo ya maskwata. Vile vile, kamati za land adjudication                                                zimesimamisha kazi kwa sababu hakuna pesa za kuwalipa wale wazee ambao husikia kesi za mashamba. Kwa hivyo, ninaiomba Wizara ya Ardhi, Nyumba na Mipango ya Miji ijaribu kupata pesa haraka ili iendeshe kazi zinazofanya.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, hata ingawa tunaunga mkono njia za Seriali za kutafuta pesa, watu katika mawakilisho yangu wamelalamika sana. Ingawa tunatakikana kulipa Customs Duty kwa vitu vyote vinavyotoka katika nchi jirani ya Tanzania, wananchi wamelalamika sana kwa sababu imekuwa ni lazima kila kitu kichuguzwe. Hata mwananchi wa kawaida akiwa na kikapu chake kidogo ambacho ameweka bidhaa kidogo alizonunua sokoni pale mpakani, huambiwa na polisi afungue kikapu hicho ili ionekane ni kitugani amebeba. Tunajua kwamba ni lazima watu walipe ushuru, lakini kulipisha ushuru na kuhangaisha wananchi wakiwa katika soko la Taveta si jambo la busara. Hao ni wananchi wanaonunua vitu vidogo vidogo kama vile leso au kitambaa kimoja tu cha kushonea nguo na hapana maana ya kumsumbua mwananchi aliyenunua bidhaa kama hizo. Ningeiomba Ofisi ya Makamu wa Rais na Wizara ya Fedha ihakikishe kwamba maofisa wa forodhani katika Taveta wanalipisha ushuru kwa bidhaa kubwa. Hana haja ya kuwasumbua wananchi wanaonunua vitu vidogo vidogo.        Nikishasema hivyo, nataka pia kusema kwamba katika Kenya wananchi wamelia kwamba hakuna unga wa ngano. Tuliliuza jambo hili hapa na tukaelezwa na Wizara kwamba unga wa ngano ni mwingi, lakini hauonekani katika sehemu za mashambani. Hili ni jambo ambalo linawaudhi raia wote, na kama kuna vikwazo vyovyote ambavyo vinafanya unga wa ngano usipatikane, Wizara inayohusika yafaa kuziondoa.        Nataka pia kuchukua wakati huu kusema kwamba barabara za Tsavo West National Park zirekbishwe kwa vile hazipitiki. Tunataka watalii wafika katika mbuga za wanyama, na kwa sasa nafurahi kwa vile watalii ni wengi. Ingawa hivyo, barabara katika Tsavo West National Park, hasa kutoka Mbuyuni Gate, Ziwani Gate kuelekea Mzima Springs an Kilaguni hadi Mtito Andei hazipitiki. Barabara hizo ziko katika mawakilisho yangu, na nimewahi kupitia sehemu hizo na nikana kwamba barabara zenyéwé ziko katika hali mbovu sana; hazijatengenezwa kwa miaka miwili. Ninaiomba Wizara ya Utalii na Wanyama wa Porini ihakikishe kwamba road maintenance unit ya mbuga za wanyama imezirekebisha barabara za Tsavo West National Park. Kwa wakati                                            watalii wengi ambao wangetufaidi hawazitumii barabara za Tsaveo West National Park, na urekebishaji wa barabara hizo ni jambo linalofaaa kuangaliwa kwa makini.    Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kabla sijamaliza hotuba yangu nataka kueleza wazi kwamba ingawa leo katika cartoon ya Daily Nation ilionyeshwa kwamba katika wlaya yetu tumekata shauri kwamba kila mwananchi anayepitia huko ni lazima tumsimamishe na kumhangaisha ili atoe kitambulisho chake cha Kanu, hatujafanya hivyo. Katika wilaya eetu hatutumii lazima, na nataka kulihakikishia taifa nzxima kwamba wananchi wa Taita/Taveta wanaendelea vizuri na uandikishaji wa Kanu. Tuna mpango wa kuwa na mikutano ya kuwaelimisha wananchi. Hatutaki kuwe na impression kwamba katika Wilaya ya Taita/Taveta watu wanalazimishwa kujiandikisha na Kanu. Wananchi katika Wilaya ya Taita/Taveta wanakipenda chama cha Kanu na wanajiandikisha kwa hiari yao. Hivi sasa kuna watu wengi ambao wanejiandikisha na Kanu na bado wanazidi kujiandikisha. Nataka tu kufafanua na kusema kwamba katika wilaya yetu hatutumii nguvu ili wananchji wajiandikishe na Kanu. Tumewaeleza wananchi wetu na wamejiandikisha na bado wanazidi kujiandikisha na Kanu.    Kwa hayo machache, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, naiunga Hoja hii mkono. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mr. Lomada) Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipa nafasi hii ili nami pia niweze kusema machache jyu ya Hoja hii inayohusiana na pesa. Litakuwa jambo la busara ikiwa baada ya kila Wizara kupatiwa pesa zake, Wizara zote zitapanga mipango yao kulingana na pesa watakazopata na kuhakikisha kwamba pesa zinatumika katika miradi ambayo tayari imekwishapangwa. Yafaa kuhakikisha kwamba miradi ambayo inakusudiwa kutekelezwa na pesa hizi imetekelezwa. Wakati mwengine unakuta kwamba pesa zinarudishwa katika Hazina Kuu ya Serikali ile hali miradi iliyotakikana kutekelezwa haijakamilika. Nataka kuziomba Wizara zote ziwe makini sana kuhusu jambo hilo.    Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, nataka kuichukua nafasi hii kusema mambo machache kuhusu Wizara ya Ujenzi. Utaona kwamba barabara zetu zina mashimo mengi ambayo ni hatari sana kwa waendeshaji magari.                                                                                                 Mimi nafikiri kwamba mashimo hay a hdiyo chanzo cba ajali katika nchi hii.Hii ni kwa sababu magari hugongana wakati madereva wanapojaribu- kuyahepa mashimo haya. Kwa hivyo, ningetaka kuchukua nafasi hii kuiomba wfzara ya Ujenzi izitunie pesa hizi kurekebisha barabara zetu. Ni lazima wale wanaohusika wahakikishe kwamba kila shimo limefunikwa. Ni lazima kazi hii ifanywe vizurikwa sababu wakati mvingine wanafunika mashimo haya kwa kutumia mchanga. Hivyo ni kusema kwamba baada ya siku chache, yale mashimo yanarudi na kuwa hata mbaya zaidi. Kwa xa mfano, ukiangalia ile barabara ya kutoka ELdoret hadi Kitale utaona kwamba pande zóte mbili katika barabara hii, zimevunjika-vunjika na sasa barabara hii limekuwa nyembamba sana. Hivyo ni kusema kama gari moja linawtoka mbele na nylngine nyuma, yote mawili yanang ang'ania sehemu ile nyembamba na jambo hili huwa ni la hatari kubwa sana na watu wengi wanepoteza mai sha yao katika ajali zinazosababishwa na hali hii mbaya ya barabara. Kwa hivyo, tutaweza kupunguza ajali zinazotokea kila siku, ikiwa tutajaribu kurekebisha hali hii kwa kupanua barabara zetu kuliko vile Zilivyo kwa wakati huu.          Bw.Naibu Spika wa Kuda, kmia jambo lingine ambalo husababisha ajali nyingi sana katika barabara zetu. Utawakuta madereva wengine, hasa madereva wa magari makubwa, ambao wana tabia ya kuyaweka magari yao kwenye barabara. Ikiwa gari limeharibika, utaona kwamba dereva analiweka kwenye barabara badale ya kuliweka kando ya barabara. Ni wajibu wa polisi ambao wana wajibu wa kuangalia maslahi ya wananchi, kuwaambia madereva kama hawa waondoe magari yao na kuyaweka kando ya barabara. Hata kama gari limeharibika, dereva anapaswa kulisongesha kando ya barabara ili magari mengine yaweze kupita kwa njia rahisi. Magari yanayowekwa katikati ya barabara wakati yameharibika, husababisha ajali mbaya sana na watu wengi wamepotesha maisha. yao kwa njia hii. Kwa hivyo, ningeiomba wizara inayohusika, hasa maofisa wetu wa polisi, ambao kazi yao nikuzunguka na kuangalia jambo hili, wahakikishe kwamba wanaofanya hatia hii wanashtakiwa. Ni lazima sheria ifuaiwe ili za watu kama hawa wawe wakichukuliwa hatua inayopaswa kuchukuliwa ili tuweze kupunguza ajali katika barabara zetu.                                                                                                                    Bw.Naibu Spika wa Muda, mkiendelea-kuzungumza juu ya Wizara hii ya Ujenzi, ningependa kuionba itie lami barabara ya kutoka Pokot Magharibi pahali paitwapo, Malik-pass mpaka ile barabara m nyingine itokayo upande wa Baringo kama vile mhe. Katurkana alivyosema. Jambo hili litawawezesha watu wa sehemu hii kusafiri kwa rahisi na kupungaza idadi ya magari yanayo tumia barabara ya Nairobi/Nakuru/ELdoret/Kitale na Kapenguria. Kwaa hivyo barabara hii ikitengenezwa, bila shaka idadi ya magari katika baraba hii nyingine tapunguka. Kama tunavyofahamu, sehemu ya Kerio ina mazao mengi kwa sababu ina mchanga mwenye rotuba nzuri sana. Katika sehanu hii wakulina hupanda aina zote za mboga, yaani, horticultural crops, na bila shaka barabara hii itawawezesha wakulima kusafiri sha mazao yao hadi sokoni. Jambo hili litawatia wakulima moyo wa kulima mboga zaidi  na hata mimea mingine.       Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ningetaka kuzungumza juu ya Wizara ya Habari na Utangazaji. Hii ni Wizara muhimu sana katika Serikali yetu kwa sababu kila mwananchi angependa kuyasikia yale mambo yanayofanyika katika nchi hii yetu na hata katika nchi nyingine. Jambo hili linawaelimisha na hata kuwasaidia wananchi katika mambo mengi sana. Sisi katika sehemu ya Pokok Magharibi, hasa katika Sigor, oltumna Kacheliba, tuna taabu kidogo, hasa katika upande wa televisheni. Katika sehemu hizi, ukiwa na televisheni yako, huwezi kuona chochote kwa sababu ile mashine ya television booster iliyokokariou, haina nguvu hata kidogo. Mimi nafikiri kwamba hata katika sehemu ya mhe. Kipkorir wananchi wana shida kama hii. Ningetaka kuchukua nafasi hii kuiomba Wizarahii ihakikishe kwamba ile booster station inatiliwa nguvu ili wananchi katika sehemu hizi waweza kutazama televisheni. Mimi sina televisheni kwa sababu hata nikinunua moja, siwezi kuitumia na kwa hivyo mimi pamoja na wale ninaowakilisha tuna tatizo hili na tumpitwa na mambo mengi. Kwa mfano, hizi majuzi kulikuwa na mchezo wa mpira na sikuweza kuutazama mchezo huo nikiwa kule nyumbani. Kwa hivyo, ningependa Wizara hii iweke television booster katika milima ya Chelangani ili wananchi waweza kutazama televisheni. Hili ni jambo la maana sana na ninatumaini kwamba Wizara itachukua        	                                                                                                            Hatua inayofaa. Vile vile, katika upande wa redio, tunapata shida kisogo, ingawa taabu hii si kama tunayopataka katika upande wa televisheni. Kwa hivyo, tungetaka pia tuwekewe booster ya redio ili tuweze kusikiliza redio kwa njia inayofaa.    Kwa hayo machache, naunga mkono . </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. TERER: Ahsante sana Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda kwa kunipatia nafasi hii ili niiunga mkono Hoja hii. Kwanza, ningependa kumnshukuru Makamu-Rais na Waziri wa Fedha kwa kazi nzuri ambayo amefanya ya kuzitembelea kambu sehemu zote katika nchi hii katika juhudu za maendeleo na za kumuunga mkono Mtukufu Rais. Baada ya kusema hivyo, ningetaka kujiunga pamoja na Wabunge wenzangu ambao wamezungumza juu ya barabara. Sehemu ninayowakilisha, ina mvua nyingi sana na hivyo ni kusema kwamba barabara katika sehemu hii huharibika sana. Hi kweli tumesikia mambo mengi kuhusu hali mbaya ya barabara kote nchini, lakini ningetaka kutoa maoni yangu kwamba jinsi ya kuzirekebisha barsbara hizi.                                                                                                                                                    Kama barabara zingerekebishwa katika kila tarafa, hili litakuwa jambo zuri Hivi sasa, wale wanaohusika na urekebishaji wa barabara hukaa katika makao makuu ya wilaya, lakini ningependa tuwe na vituo vya maofisa hawa katika kila tarafa. Pengine, barabara fulani zingerekebishwa na wananchi wenyewe wakisaidiwa na maofisa hawa wanaohusika na kazi hii. Wananchi wakiambiwa warekebishe barabara zao wenyewe, huku wakisaidiwa kwa mawaidha ya wale wenye ujuzi wa kazi hii, tutafanya hatua kubwa katika maerideleo yetu. Wakati mwingine, tunaziona trakta na graders zikiendeshwa kutoka mahali pamoja tu, huku nyingine zikiendeshwa ovyo ovyo tu bila kufanya kazi. Jambo hili si zuri kwa sababu linaonyesha kwamba wakaguzi. na maofisa wengine wanaohusika hawaitilii maanani kabisa kazi ya urekebishaji wa barabara.    Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ningependa kugusia elimu. Tumesema tayari, na tutaendelea kusema, kwamba walimu wawe wakilipwa mishahara yao kila mwisho wa mwezi kwa sababu Wizara ya Elimu inatengewa pesa zake sasa hivi. Hapana haja ya kukosa kuwalipa walimu kila mwisho wa mwezi. Walimu wengine wanapomaliza mafunzo yao hukaa bila kupatiwa mafunzo zaidi mpaka wanastaafu. Ingefaa Wizara ya Elimu iyatie maanani mafunzo ya in service. Walimu wengine huajiriwa kazi bila kupewa mafunzo yo yote ya kuendesha kazi yao. Maofisa wasaidizi wa elimu na walimu wengine wa Teachers Advisory Centres wengine huajiriwa bila kupewa mafunzo juu ya kazi wanayohitajiwa kufanya, na ningependa Wizara ilichunguze jambo hili.        Tumekuwa na maswali mengi juu ya N.S.S.F. na malipo ya uzeeni, na ningependa kuona huduma hizi zikipelekwa wilayani. Hapana haja ya malipo ya uzeeni kutengenezewa hapa Nairobi. Ingefaa rekodi za wafanyakazi ziwe zikiwekwa sawa sawa kabla wafanyakazi hawajastaafu. Hapana haja ya kungoja mtu astaafu ndipo aanze kuambiwa eti hajatoa kitambulisho na vitu vingine. Wizara inayohusika ingefaa kuwa na rekodi kamili ili mtu akistaafu apewe malipo yake bila kucheleweshwa.        Tunaona kwamba viwanda vingi viko mijini, kama vile Nairobi, lakini ingefaa viwanda vingi vipelekwe mashambani ili watu wasiendelee kumiminikia                                                                                                            Sasa, ningependa kuyagusia mambo ya usalama. Mara moja au mbili, tumesikia kwamba watu wametoroshwa Kenya na kuingizwa katika nchi za kigeni. Nimesikia pia kwamba watu huingia kule Lamu na kuwatorosha watu kupitia mpakani. Hii ni kama kusema kwamba usalama wetu si timamu, na tungependa Wizara inayohusika ilitie jambo hili maanani. Tunafaa kuwa tunaweza kujilinda wenyewe ili watu kutoka nchi nyingine wasiweze kuja hapa na kuwachukua watu wetu. Ningependa Kuihimiza Wizara inayohusika ifanye kazi yake sawa sawa.    Tumekwishaongea juu ya cost-sharing, ambayo ni nzuri kwa watu wenye pesa. Hatuwezi kusema kwamba watu walio na pesa kidogo wanaweza kuchanga cho chote. Kwa hivyo, watu hawa maskini wasiposaidiwa, hawatatoa cho chote katika cost-sharing.        Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ningependa kutaja kidogo habari ya Kenya Tea Development Authority (K.T.D.A.). Shirika hili linaonekana kuwa halina mpango wala haliangalii mbele. Hata ingawa michai imepandwa mingi sana, hatujui kama K.T.D.A. ina mpango wo wote wa kujenga viwanda vipya vya kutengeneza majani chai. Ningependa maofisa wa shirika hili wajenge viwanda vya kutengeneza majani chai. Tunajua kwamba utafiti unaendelea wa kutafuta aina ya michai ambayo inaweza kukua haraka na kuleta faida nyingi. Tungependa wale ambao wanauendesha utafiti huu wawe wakiwashauri wakulima.        Kuhusu michezo, ningependa kusema kwamba tumekuwa na michezo kadha tofauti tofauti hapa Kenya, na nchi yetu imepata sifa kubwa kutokana na michezo hii. Ningeihimiza Wizara inayohusika ianzishe professionalism ili wachezaji waweze kupata faida. Wakati huu, wachezaji ambao ni amateurs hawalipwi cho chote, na ningependa kuihimiza Wizara iwe ikiwapandisha cheo wachezaji kulingana na professionalism yao.        Huku nikiigusia Wizara ya Habari na Utangazaji, ninaichukua nafasi hii kuishukuru Sauti ya Kenya kwa kutuletea filamu za kandanda ambayo inaendelea sasa ambayo wananchi wanairurahia sana. Wananchi wengi wangetaka kusikia vile tunavyoyaendesha majadiliano hapa Bungeni saa 12.00 asubuhi. Wakulima hawana                                                                                                        Nafasi ya kuyasikiliza majadiliano haya saa tatu au nne za usiku, lakini watayasikiliza ikiwa yatarudiwa kwa Kiswahili asubuhi.                Kuhusu exports, ningependa Wizara inayohusika iendelee kutangaza mazao yale tuliyo nayo hapa nchini, kama vile majani chai, kahawa na vitu vingine kama nyama. Tukiuza vitu hivi nchi za ng'ambo, tutapata pesa za kigeni.        Kwa haya machache, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, naunga mkono. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>MR. KIPKORIR: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to support this Motion. I think it is time we congratulated His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance on having presented this Motion in good time. Those who are in the field should now assist wananchi by implementing various projects. Kenya is a developing nation, and we should move faster than ever, putting more effort in our projects. A lot of problems confront project imp1ementors, particularly in my area.                                                                    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are several projects in my area which have not been completed. Since we are now approving this money to be disbursed to the Ministries, the Permanent Secretaries should release this money immediately to the districts so that work on these projects begins without further delay. The Ministry of Water Development has a lot of uncompleted projects in my area. A big Town like Iten, with a population of over 20,000 people, is frequently hit by water shortages the designers of projects must design projects that are going to be durable. I say this because a lot of money was spent on a water project known as Sirgoit Water Project. The project never took off. They must identify permanent sources of water. Iten Town needs a permanent source of water so that more and more people may go and settle there, build houses and establish businesses. So, the Ministry must take urgent steps, to provide adequate water to that Town. Tot Trading Centre in Kerio Valley is expanding rapidly. Even the town of Chesongoch is also expanding but water supply is a big problem. Government officers and teachers who are posted to Kerio Valley experience a lot of problems due to lack of water. One has to travel a long distance to fetch water from the river. The Ministry of Water Development should implement water projects in urban areas so as to alleviate these water shortages. All market centres in the rural areas should be provided with water. When visitors go to the rural areas they find it very difficult to get water.    Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would now like to touch on the Ministry of Public Works. In 1986 this House passed a Motion urging the Ministry to tarmack the road from Iten to Sigor. This road is top priority of our District Development Committee. This road traverses the Eerio Valley.  The Ministry of Public Works should ask for more money to enable it to tarmack  that road.                                                        This road has been a D.D.C. priority for the last three years. So, something must be done about this road. If this road is tarmacked the distance between Iten and Sigor will be reduced to 60 kilometres. At you will find that at present you have, to travel from Iten through Eldoret, Moi's Bridge, Kitale and then to Sigor; from Sigor you can travel to Chesigur. The tarmacking of this road will reduce the distance considerably. You will find that it isnot easy to take sick people to hospital because no vehicle can travel on that road. People carry their sick on stretchers. So, I appeal to the Minister for Public Works to look into this problem immediately.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, over 70 per cent of the people of my district live in Kerio Valley. So, after Parliament has passed this money those responsible must make proper recommendations so that projects are implemented without delay. A road which was constructed from Chesoi Market to Kamogol Market Only Phase I of this road was constructed. But you will find that instead of starting Phase II from Kamogol Market to Cheparir they have not done so. They have not been able to maintain Phase I of this road. That is a serious matter. The Ministry should start from where they left and continue. The Minister himself should go there and inspect this work. The road must be maintained properly. The local people should be asked to look after projects in their local areas. Some people who do not have the interests of this country at heart tend to misappropriate public funds. The wananchi are wiser than those who misappropriate these public funds. Our people become bitter when these things happen. The Ministry should employ enough people to make sure that money which has been set aside for particular projects is properly used on those same projects. Money should not be misused.                                        Mr. Temporary Deputy SpeakerSir, touching on the Ministry of Health, there are no drugs in our hospitals even when there is money. What has gone wrong? Funds should be released immediately to purchase drugs for Tot Health Centre. Phase Two of this Eealth Centre must be implemented immeidately. This project is a top priority in our D.D.C. We expect that institution tobe upgraded to the status of Sub-district Hospital. You will find that people who have been bitten by snakes must be transported over 100 kilometres away to the District Hospital. As a result of this people have died from snake bites. The Ministry of Health should expand Tot Health Centre very fast. That Health Centre should be fully staffed by July, this year. Also there is no water in that place and something should be done about this problem. On agriculture, I would like to say that people in my area are now growing coffee. The Ministry of Agriculture should identify a site for the construction of a coffee factory in that area so that our coffee is processed there. Extension officers from this Ministry must assist farmers in that area so that they can produce better crops. Livestock development should alsobe enhanced in this country.    With those few remarks, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH>                                <NEWSPEECH>MR.KAMUYU: Thank you, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my hon. Collegues in supporting this motion that is aimed at enabling the Exchequer to withdraw over K£900 million for utilization in various Ministries from 1st July. This is very important because this House has to ratify the application of expenditure in accordance with the Constitution. The withdrawal of this money is not the most important thing but its management. Management has now become one of our greatest challenges in this country. This is a colossal amount of money and this nation must be watchful on how it is going to be managed. This is because the money belongs to the people and they, therefore, must wach on how it is going to be spent. on the outset, I would like to congratulate the Vice President and Minister for Finance for moving this Motion. Accounting officers in various Ministries should know that we will need public accounts which we shall look at critically. For example, we were shocked to read that grain worth a sum of Kshs.49 million belonging to thé Government had been misappropriated within the Ministry of Supplies and Marketing. This nation should be told when such things happening in a country whose people are almost starving. Where did this grain go? What explanation would be offered to the ordinary mwananchi. This scandal was contained in the Report of the Controller and  Auditor-General  and  was  highlighted  in Sunday newspapers.   Since we are talking about the expenditure of funds to be allocated, it is important that we know that we are talking about money management. It, therefore, means that we look after what we have and spend it properly. The amount stated is colossal and I am surprised that the Misi Ministry of Supplies and Marketing has kept quiet. We should be told what a happened with that maize worth Kshs.49 million. This maize was  perhaps eaten by ‘human rats' and no explanation has been given so far.  </NEWSPEECH>  <NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Order! Mr. Kasiuyu, that issue has been referred to the Public Investment Committee who will do investigation and report to this House.                                          <NEWSPEECH>MR. KAMUYU: Much obliged, Sir. I will now move to the Ministry of Local government under which the city Mortuary falls. I wonder why the mortuary charges Kshs.200/- per day per dead body. The majority of the relatives of the dead are poor people who at times are forced to disown their dead. A fee of Kshs.200/- per day is a lot of money and many people cannot afford.        I will now turn to the informal sector which is a very important part of our economy. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Local Government for putting to an end the demolition of kiosks. This is because the informal sector is a very important part of our economy. It is important that we also encourage the informal sector for the benefit of the people. We were happy to learn that the 37,000= kiosks or so in Nairobi will not be demolished. I would like to urge the Ministry of Local Government in their budget forecasts to encourage the informal sector. In other words, they should design model kiosks and finance the poor people to set up their informal businesses. This is part of jua kali and those interested in such businesses should be treated as such.        One area which the Nairobi City Commission has neglected is the Lang'ata Cemetery which has completely turned into a bush. A colossal amount of money is going to be dished out and services must be rendered to the wananchi. The Nairobi City Commission should allocated money for the maintenance of this cemetery so that those who are resting in peace have some clean surrounding. I am talking about this because many dead people from Dagoretti Constituency end up there. Very often I attend burials there and it is a shame to see bush grounds in the name of a cemetery. The Commission should send its workers to clear the existing bush.        I will touch very briefly on tea. One of the big experts of tea, that is, hon. Mahihu, said last week that the quality of our tea is going down. Here again, lam talking about the general management of the funds we have. If we do not take care of the quality of our tea, we are going to lose a great deal. All this is happening because I believe the rule of plucking                                                                                                            two leaves and a bud, has been ignored. It, therefore, means that leaves are being plucked and that is why the quality of our tea is going down.                                                                                                                                                                                     It would be best if we encouraged our farmers to only pick the bud and two leaves so that quality of our tea can go up. If we do not do that then, since the quality of our tea will continue to go down, people will start to buy tea from elsewhere which will result in our losing the foreign exchange earnings and our good name oversease. So, it is important that this matter be given the priority it deserves.    Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me also take this opportunity to thank His Excellency the Presidet for considering the plight of the landless in Dagoretti.	    With those very few remarks, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): I think it is time for the Mover to reply. </NEWSPEECH>        <NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to make a few brief comments on hon. Members' comments that they made while contributing to this Motion which as has been statedis very procedural in that it is seeking authority from this House on 50 percent of the expenditure as voted for in the Estimates of Recurrent and Development Expenditure for the year 1990/91. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank hon. Member for their very constructive comments that they have made. I would like to put pick several of their comments that I think are worthy of note.        In doing so, I would like to call upon all Government Ministries, Accounting Officers, Ministers and officers upon whom responsibility has been vested on to take heed of hon. Members' comments. This is because it is the various these various Ministries that are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that the Nation's resources are properly spent.        The first point that was touched on by many hon. Members, is the fact that, civil servants should ensure that the funds for here are spent in                                                                accordance with the budgets. I would certainly agree with hon. Members inthis respect because it is upto the civil servants to ensure that these funds have been properly spent and in accordance with the budgets as contained in these documents that have been released to hon. Members  the Printed Estimates. It is critical and important that this is adhered to and they should ensure that they are efficient, productive, disciplined and that they ensure that no expenditure outside the Printed Estimates is incurred. If an Accounting Officer authorises an expenditure which is not within the Printed Estimates, then he is committing a crime and should be hanged  by his neck.                  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Members also talked about unspent budget funds. This is a very serious matter particularly in so far éis the district development committees (DDC) are concerned. I would like to ask the hon. Members before this year ends to take a little time to look at the Development Estimates for 1989/90 and sit with their district development officers to ensure that the funds that were voted for have all been spent. If they have not been spent, hon. Members should not be afraid at all to take these officers to task. This is because it is the very people we represent in this House who are going to lose if those expenditures have not been incurred at all.                                    Sir, I would also like to say something concerning the Ministry. The fact that the Ministry of Health was touched on, or the fact that the Ministry of Health was particularly criticised for lack of medicine and also for the tendering procedures, well, the procedures do exist, and with the Minister for Health here, I am sure he has taken due notice and cognisance of hon. Members comments. Another comment that was made was the fact that imprests are not surrendered or accounted for correctly by officers, including, unfortunately, hon. Members when they go out on safaris. I can only urge once again that everybody, every person who is advanced with an imprest ensures that he surrenders it or accounts for it appropriately. The procedures do exist and I would only urge that every Kenyan who is given or advanced an imprest ensures that lie does account for it or he has the integrity and honest enough to surrender and account for the money.     Another point that was touched on was the overcharging, of commodities, especially with regard to price-controlled goods. I can only urge hon. Members to make sure that they advise their members of constituencies where they do discover that prices for controlled goods are not being followed, they should go to the police at once or ensure that the Administration is informed so that the shopkeepers can be apprehended, or even the licences can be cancelled. So, in respect of overcharges in such unscrupulous cases, we can assist the Government machinery to ensure that the culprits are brought to book.    Another point that was also mentioned was with regard to cost-sharing. I think our Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1986 lays down the basis of our economic growth in this Republic. One of the                                                                aspects that is touched on in that policy paper is cost-sharing. I am afraid to say that cost-sharing is here with us because the alternative is either to cost-share or to increase taxes, or not to have the services at all. The choice is ours and, therefore, it is important that hon. Members do appreciate the choices and the alternatives available in our hands. And under the circumstances, we have chosen that it is important that we do cost-sharing and cost-sharing is here to live with us.    Sir, those are basically the major points that I wanted to touch upon. But I want to say that in so far as accountability of the Government finances is concerned, it cannot be over emphasised that the Accounting Officers should actually take need. I repeat this once again in complete concurrence with hon. Members contribution here that it is up to Accounting Officers to account for funds. We should never a situation of funds being finished before the end of the year or before the accounting period because a Budget sets what is available for spending. So, if anybody spends outside the Budget, then we get into trouble. It is very important to recognise this aspect. It is also very important for Accounting Officers or Permanent Secretaries to become financial managers of this Republic. They should be responsible and make sure that they spend in accordance with the Budget.                                                                                    It is absolutely important that we as members of Parliament, particularly when we attend district development committee meetings in our areas, that we assist to some extent by calling for reports, particularly in respect of developme expenditure, from various Government departmental heads within our districts so as to see how much money they have received, how much of it they have spent and how they have spent it. I Know many of us may be hesitant to ask for these reports because some of the civil servants would not like hon. Members to see these figures, but it is important for hon. Members to attend district development committees and call for development reports. You should know whether the funds for projects in your constituency have been receive whether the AIE has been released; if it has been released, then find out how, in fact, the funds have been spent. This is a point that we hon. Members should take seriously, although, of course, a lot hinges on the Accounting Officers.    with these comments I beg to move. Thank you very much, sir.  </NEWSPEECH>             (Question put and agreed to)        <HEADER>AJOURNMENT</HEADER>        <NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Hon.
