FALANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to give Notice of the followingTHAT, in view of the fact that Kenya.is a renown sporting nation that has produced heroes/ heroines who have flown that Kenyan flag high at international meetings, this House urges the Government to set aside funds for establishment of a retirement scheme for them. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MCHARO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to give Notice of the followingTHAT, since continuous assessment testing is an essential aspect of the 8-4—4 education system, and in view of the tremendous efforts and resources by the parents, teachers and students in organising these tests, this House urges the Government to work out suitable plan to take into account 40 per cent of the continuous assessment test marks in the final examination at every terminal stage. </Newspeech><Header> ORAL-ANSWERS-TO-QUESTIONS </Header >Question No 193 Bigger Divisional Offices for Sigor<Newspeech> MR. SPEAKER: Mr.Twarith not here to ask his Question? We will leave it until the end then. </Newspeech>Question No. 206 Opening of Mananja DispensaryMR. KIILU asked the Minister for Health when Mananja Dispensary in Masinga Division will be opened and medical facilities made available to the wananchi.<Newspeech> THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Kibaki): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg toreply.The Mananja Dispensary, which is a Rural Development Fund project will . be opened and medical facilities made available to the wananchi when the local community provide its 25 per cent contribution in cash and kind to enable the work of fittings, fixtures and plumbing of staff houses; drainage; construction of pit latrines and fencing of the compound to be completed. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KIILU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the work that has been done there is almost complete,, why can the Ministry not consider assisting these people who live very far from other medical institutions? Can the Ministry not consider giving the local community drugs through the dispensary for the time bring? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KIBAKI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are talking about a dispensary which is a health institution, and you cannot have a dispensary or a clinic without lat¬rines. To do that, we would be contradicting ourselves as the Ministry in charge of health. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KIILU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the people who live in Mananja are very far from other medical institutions, can the Minister think of an alternative way of providing them with drugs? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KIBAKI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would very much like to help. As a matter of fact, three quarters of the money for Rural Development Fund projects</Newspeech> <Newspeech> THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (ctd.):is contributed by the Government and the local community contribute 25 per cent either in kind or cash. For instance, if they build the pit latrines themselves and complete the other basic works, all that would be counted as their contribution. That is something normal, and. what the hon. Member should do is to call those people together to do these other pieces of work which remain to be done. It is not very difficult to dig a latrine. After all, they dig pit latrines at their own homes according to our public health advice</Newspeech>.<Newspeech> MR. KAMUYU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, since this is a very important health dispensary and it looks like the local community is not able to organise themselves because of the way they are scattered, can the Ministry go out of its way and complete the project so that wananchi can start receiving health services? </Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR. KIBAKI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member for Kawangware makes a presumption</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KAMUYU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I require an un¬conditional apology and withdrawal of the Minister's pronouncement because I am not an hon. Member for Kawangware. I am an hon. Member for Dagoretti. </Newspeech>   	<Newspeech> MR. KIBAKI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you know, I meant to say the hon. Member for Dagoretti. This Hon: Member makes an assumption that the people of Masinga Location are not able, to organise themselves, but they certainly are. They are carrying out a lot of-Harambee work there because they are very able; all they require is guidance and help from the hon. Member for the area. </Newspeech>Question No. 202 Fate of Former Workers of Disbanded U.S.A.B.<Newspeech> MR. MAKHANU asked the Minister for Education, since the University Students Accommodation Board has been disbanded, where its former employees have been redeployed since they were serving a public institution. </Newspeech><Newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Following the disbandment of the University Students' Accommodation Board (U.S.A.B.) in November, 1989, the functions of the disbanded institution were taken over by the other public universities, that is Kenyatta, Egerton and Moi, in a fairly smooth change. However, it was only at the University of . Nairobi where some employees' services were terminated and those concerned paid their terminal benefits. The General Manager and his deputy, who were on second ment from my Ministry, were deployed in the Ministry of Education. The other employees who had been seconded to U.S.A.B. from other universities were absorbed back into those universities. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for this reply, I would like to say that he has said in his reply that not all went smoothly at the University of Nairobi. We are talking about a staff of about 50 employees. Whereas all other ex-U.S.A.B. employees from Kenyatta, Egerton and Moi Universities have been absorbed back into the system, a decision was made to lay off the-from the University of Nairobi. Could the Assistant Minister explain why. there was this disparity where 50 ex-U.S.A.B. employees from the University of Nairobi were laid off? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the U.S.A.B. was disbanded because of mismanagement, and quite a number of its officers had to be relieved of their duties</Newspeech>. <Newspeech> MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the Assistant Minister is not getting my question. I have asked him if he could explain why there was disparity in this matter. We are talking about four institutions, .that is, the University of Nairobi, Kenyatta, Egerton and Moi Universities. The other three universities have absorbed back ex-U.S.A.B- employees in a very smooth manner', but this has not been the case in the University of Nairobi. Could he consider all ex-U.S.A.B. employees from the University of Nairobi unless he is-prepared to offer us an explanation as to why their services had to be terminated? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KARAURI: No, Sir, we will not consider reinstating, people who mismanaged the U.S.A.B. In any case, their services were terminated and their terminal, benefits have been paid. If they have not collected their terminal benefits yet, they can do so at the University of Nairobi. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KIRWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the Assistant Minister is misleading the House. If the other three universities have reabsorbed their former U.S.A.B. workers, why does the University of Nairobi have to be such a special case that its former U.S.A.B. workers have to be laid off? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir,. I understand the point here, and I would like to state that the majority of the former U.S.A.B. employees were from the University of Nairobi of whom those who were directly involved in the mismanagement of U.S.A.B. had their services terminated, and they cannot now go back to work in the university. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. ANASWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the bone of contention here is that you will find that the former U.S.A.B. employees from the other three universities were reabsorbed and that all the former employees from the University of Nairobi were removed. Is it possible that all the former employees from the University of Nairobi were bad while all the former employees from the other three universities were good? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the disbanded U.S.A.B. was based at the University of Nairobi, and when the Board was disbanded, those were proved to have been directly involved in the mismanagement of the Board could not be allowed to go back to the university to manage the new board. </Newspeech>/<Newspeech> MR. MAKHANU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. the Assistant  Minister has not really satisfactorily answered our questions; instead, he is offering very contradictory information in the sense that the implementation of the presidential directive involved here has been flouted whereas the Ministry should be serious in implementing such directives. If it was a question of laying off all the former U.S.A.B. employees from all public universities, this should have been done. Why should the Assistant-Minister fail to implement a presidential directive. He is contradicting himself. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not understand what the hon. Member says, but if he wants to insinuate that the Ministry of Education can flout a presidential directive, he is totally wrong because we always follow such directives. In this case, we did exactly what we were supped to do. </Newspeech>Question No. 204 Deputy Head For Mahiaini Primary School<Newspeech> MR. P.K. KINYANJUI asked the Minister for Educationwhen he will appoint a deputy headmaster for Mahiaini Primary School. /Newspeech><Newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (mr. Karauri): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.My Ministry will appoint a deputy headmaster for Mahiaini Primary School after finalizing the interviews for the vacant posts of deputy headmasters/headmistresses of the primary schools in Kiambu District, which are presently being carried out. Successful candidates, including the one for Mahiaini Primary School, will be posted to schools as soon as this exercise is finalised. Furthermore, I wish to clarify that this school is presently correctly staffed with a total of 17 qualified teachers, 11 of whom are males and six others, females. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I thank the Assistant Minister for his good reply indicating that something is being done in line with my Question, could he tell the House why Mr. Christopher Wainaina, who was posted to the school as a deputy headmaster last January, was transferred back to his old school after only one week at Mahiaini Primary School? </Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, teachers are transferred to places where their services are required. If it was discovered that after transferring this teacher to Mahiaini Primary School that he should go back to his old school, I see nothing wrong with that. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in his reply, the Assistant Minister has promised that a deputy headmaster will be posted to Mahiaini Primary School as soon as the current exercise of interviewing candidates is completed. Could he indicate when this exercise will be completed? Mahiaini Primary School has had no deputy headmaster for the last two years. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, that school will have a Deputy Headmaster by the .beginning of second term this year. LS. SPEAKER: Next Question. Mr. Falans. </Newspeech>Question No.190 <Header>Demarcation of Land in Saku </Header ><Newspeech> MR. FALANA asked the Minister for Lands.and Housing why the Government decision made in 1983 to the effect that the areas in Saku that are in¬habited be separated from Marsabit National Re¬serve and also be surveyed, demarcated and title deeds issued to	the people has not beenimplemented to date</Newspeech>.<Newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND HOUSING (Mr.- Bomet) : . Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The area of the Marsabit National Reserve-in question is under .the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife.- .They have agreed to degazette this area and release it to my Ministry for proper adjudication. As soon as these formalities are completed by them, the Department of Land Adjudication and Settlement will immediately embark on the adjudication process.: </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. FALANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for that reply, this was not a normal request put to them. It was a Presidential Directive. This Presidential Directive was issued in February, 1983. How long does it take the Ministry to implement a Presidential Directive? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. BOMET: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is true that that  Presidential Directive was issued in February, 1933. On 21st October, 1983, the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife published a notice vide Gazette Notice No.3962 giving 60 days Notice that part of the National . Reserve would be . degazetted. This degazettement must be done by the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife before we can move into the area to adjudicate the land. </Newspeech> 	<Newspeech> MR.F ALAN A: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want the AssistantMinister to be very precise in his reply. We expect Presidential 	Directives to be implemented without delay. This particularPresidential Directive was given in 1933 seven years ago. But you will find that seven years after the directive was given, the Assistant Minister is talking of formalities. When will the Ministry carry out this Presidential Directive? we should not be left in suspense. The President's orders should be carried out without any delay. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. BOMET: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member should be grateful to His Excellency the President for giving this land back v	to the people. I would like to say that demarcation of land is notsomething that should be done  without</Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR. FALANA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am 	very, very, very, very grateful to His Excellency the President. I have always been very grateful to His Excellency the President. We ?	want that Presidential Directive to be implemented without furtherdelay. </Newspeech><Newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Onyancha): .On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I stand to seek guidance from the Chair. The hon. Member has used the name of the President in advancing his argument. I am justwondering whether . : he is in order to continue using the name of the President instead of saying it was a "Government order".</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. FALANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the firstparagraph of the supplementary information to my Question reads as 	follows:"In February, 1983, there was. a. Presidential Directive that part of Marsabit National Reserve be degazetted to allow	settlement by individual inhabitants."  I am therefore perfectly in order to talk about a "Presidential Directive." </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. BOMET: Mr. Speaker, Sir, matters dealing with land cannot be  handled in a hurry.  This is  because survey work has got to be done. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. A.I. MOHAMED: On a ' point of order, Mr. Speaker,  Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to say that matters dealing with land cannot be handled in a hurry, when this Presidential Directive was given seven years ago? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. SPEAKER: What is your point of order? </Newspeech><Newspeech>  MR. A.I. MOEAMED: Mr Speaker, Sir, the AssistantMinister is taking the House for a ride. He is not treating this Question seriously. Eight years axe too many. Could he tell the House what immediate plans he has to implement the Presidential Directive which was issued in 1983? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. BOMET: Mr,. Speaker, Sir, although that was not a point of order, I would like to  give the followingexplanation The final declaration of the degazettement has to be made by the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife. Also mutually accepted -arrangements will have to be reached with the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources in regard to the Forest Reserve which forms ; part of the water catchment area for Marsabit Town. Liaison with the provincial administration, under the .	Office of the President inorder to identify, the occupants of the Saku area to enable the Ministry to prepare plans for. : Survey and eventual issue of title deeds will have to be done. There is a lot of work to be done. Steps are being taken to adjudicate that land. </Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Kirwa's Question. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. PALANAT On-a  point  of order Mr Speaker Sir  I insist that we have been left in the dark regarding this issue for the lastseven years. Would the Assistant Minister give</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. SPEAKER: That is a supplementary question. I will not allow you to ask a supplementary question. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. PALANA: But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, do you not agree witi¬me that seven years is a very long time for a Presidential Directive to "be implemented? </Newspeech><Newspeech> Mr. SPEAKER: Mr. Kirwa's Question. </Newspeech>Question No .205Payment of Retirement Benefits to Mr. ChemwayamMR. KIRWA asked the Minister for Agriculture when Mr. Rokor . Chemwayam, P/No.4343, a formeremployee of the Ministry, who retired on 30th June, 1983, will be paid his retirement benefits."<Newspeech> MR. SPEAKER: Anybody here from Ministry of Agriculture?Next Question. </Newspeech>	Question No.213Tarmac king of Garissa-Wajir-Mandera RoadMR. A.I. MOHAMED asked the Minister for Public Works in view of the fact that reliable communication accelerates . the rate of development of the rural areas what immediate plans the Ministry has to tarmack the inter-district feeder road from Garissa-Wajir to Mandera Township. <Newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Maiyani)Mr. Speaker, Sir, I "beg to reply.The Ministry does not have immediate plans to tarmack Garissa-Wajir-Mandera Road because of lack of funds. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech> MR. A.I. MOHAMED: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reply by the AssistantMinister shows that he has no concern over this issue Efficient communication and transport systems are not only crucial infrastructural prerequisites for a country's economical growth but also a social necessity. The people of North-Eastern Province are being denied all these services. In fact, there is no food there and people are starving because of the bad condition of the road. Although the Assistant Minister has said that they cannot repair this road because of lack of funds, how can he say that when they do not even have plans for repairing the road? Could he seriously tell what plans they have of alleviating the suffering of these people? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have already explained the problem here is lack of funds. We have to get them from the Treasury to do that job. So, unless we get these funds there is nothing much we can do. However, the Garissa-Wajir-Mandera Road covers a stretch of about 727 kilometres. We, in the Ministry, are aware that reliable communication systems can accelerate development. The section of the road between Elwark and Mandera covering about 125 kilometres was tarmacked by the Direct Labour Unit, but surface dressing has failed in some areas. But generally, the base is good. The road between</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. A.I. MOHAMED: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I entirely disagree with the Assistant Minister that the section of the road between Elwark and Mandera is tarmacked because the condition of this section of the road was even worsened. There is no tarmack on that section of the road. Could the Assistant Minister show some seriousness in the Question because he is misleading the House by saying that? </Newspeech>	<Newspeech> MR. MAIYANI: MR. Speaker, Sir, the unfornate I. have is from my field officers in that area. According to that information the section of the road that we are referring to is supposed to have been tarmacked. The section of the road between Mandera and Wajir is the" one that becomes impassable during the rainy seasons. This is around a place called Katulo near the border of Wajir and Mandera Districts. The Ministry is concerned with making this road passableby murraming and grading it, but during heavy rains it is impossible to this work. In fact, I agree with the hon. Member that attempting to do anything on that road when it is raining makes it worse. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. SALAT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think .the Assistant Minister isnot being serious because the distance from Wajir through Mandera to Garissa isabout 1,000 kilometres. The people from this area, get their food stuffs from Nairobi and Nanyuki. That roads in these areas are in very bad shape. When the hon. Member asked him what plans they have to make this road passable, he replied that there are no funds. If that is the case, then what long-term plans do they have to make these roads passable? This is because the rains are not there all the time. We come from these places and we know what the area looks like. When the Assistant Minister gives the reason for failing to repair the roads as rains, he is misleading the House. Since there are no rains now, can he fissure that the roads are made passable? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am equally concerned about the passability of these roads. It is the intention of my Ministry to look for funds to murrain these roads and not to tarmack them. The section of the road  we are talking about is very long and its repair depends on priorities and availability of funds from the Treasury. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Hon. A.I. Mohamed has told the House that the road is not tarmacked while hon. Salat has asked the Assistant Minister what long-term they have for making that road passable. Now, instead of responding to those two issues that have been raised he is talking of lack of funds. Is he in order to meander away from the issues at hand? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am certainly not meandering because I have given a straightforward answer. We will be repairing sections of that road which are impassable. We will also make efforts to get funds to murrain the road, but as far as the Ministry is now concerned, we do not have any plans to tarmack the road. That is what I said and I did not meanderat all. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech> MR. A.I. MOHAMED: MR. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister isnot dealing with this Question with the seriousness it deserves. The wholepopulation in that province is starving. Could the Assistant Minister assurethe House that he is going to place the tarmacking of this road as the firstnational priority so that these people will not continue to suffer? In fact,90 per cent of the people of North-Eastern Province do not know what a tarmackedroad looks like. Could we be given our share of the national cake by havingthis road tarmacked because there is not even a foot of tarmacked road inour province. The nature of our land is very well known to the House and tomake matters worse we border two hostile countries. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are two issues at hand here;one security and secondly, starvation. First, I would like to advise the	hon. Member that, if there are-people who are starving he should report the matter tothe local administration at Garissa, Wajir or Mandera so that this matter canbe tackled without any delay. We can even use air transport to airlift suppliesto the people of that area. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KIRWA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think theAssistant Minister is not being very serious. What the Questioner said isthat people are starving because there is a communications' breakdown whichhas been brought about by the bad condition of the road. Instead of respondingto that the Assistant Minister decides to introduce some humour which is nohumour at all. I am not amused to hear that people should report to the localadministration when people are starving. That is a very serious thing to say.Is he in order to transfer the Ministry's responsibility and problem to anotheradministration section of the Government? </Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe I am in order because  the question of "starvation" did not come from me but from the hon member if it is so, then it is a very serious natter. If it is^ not true, then thehon. Member should  withdraw the question of starvation, we must</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. A.I.MOEAMED: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I do not-see the reason why the Assistant. Minister should demand that I  withdraw 	the question of starvation when it is a fact. I do not also see the reasonwhy he should transfer his Ministry's failure to other departments. Starvation has cone about due to impassable reads which his Ministry should have maintained. Can he tell us what he is doing to save the situation other, than transferring their failure to others? </Newspeech><Newspeech> HON. MEMBERS: Jibu hiyol</Newspeech>	<Newspeech> MR. MAIYAIH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member has repeated tvd.ee in ay hearing that people are starving because the roads are impassable,  Therefore, the starvation issue must be directed to the administration to organise relief food to be sent there. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech> HON. MEMBERS: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir</Newspeech>.<Newspeech> MR. SPEAKER: Next Question. </Newspeech>	Question No. 214Separate Departments for Arid and Semi-Arid Lands<Newspeech> MR. SALAT asked the Minister for Reclamation and Development of Arid, Semi-Arid and wastelands, since fifty two per cent of our land surface is arid and twenty eight per cent is send-and, whether he could consider creating two separate departments for  1	arid and semi-arid lands in order to ensure fair andeffective distribution of the available resources. </Newspeech><Newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR RECLAMATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF ARID,SEMI-ARID ALIO HASTSLANDS (Mr. Nyakiamo): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.My  Ministry does not consider it appropriate to have two separatedepartments for arid and semi-arid lands. To structure the Ministry along thelines suggested by this Question^ will lead to duplication of staff and otherresources. This will also lead to undue competition negating the complementarities needed to facilitate the utilization of the available human, technological and material resources for the benefit of all.Ministry is aware that during the first enervation of ASAL. themain focus was on districts in the semi-arid areas. The was because the donors,at the time, felt that they should start with those areas where they couldproduce faster results and then replicate those results in the and areas.At present time, we are designing programmes and projects for presentation tovarious donors. The projects fill cover the a; more arid areas of the country,such as, Garissa, Tana River, wajir and Marsabit. Project programme coveragewill expand as more funds become available. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. SALAT: sir. Speaker, Sir,. I thank the Assistant Minister for hisreply. The need to create this Ministry had been realised by His Szcellency	the President, when I say that 52 per cent of our land surface is aria andthe Assistant Minister tells us that the main focus on ASAL is on semi-aridlands, then it defeats the purpose of creating, this Ministry. Gould theAssistant Minister tell us the criteria they will be using in distributing theavailable human and material resources so that the larger portion of the countrywhich is arid is not deprived of the resources which would otherwise havebenefited that area? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. NYAKLAMO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last part of my reply touchedon that. I said that at the present time, we are designing programmes andprojects for presentation to various donors. The projects will cover the	more arid areas of the country, such as, Garissa and so on. I also said thatwe had emphasized ASAL. programmes on semi-arid areas. That- is not the a position	now.	For the information of the House, the functions allocated to myMinistry are  Assessment of potential and use of arid and semi-arid lands. Secondly, implementation of suitable integrated programmes including afforestationfor accelerating development in such areas. Thirdly, dam construction in<Newspeech> Mr.WABUGE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in-his reply the .Assistant Minister said that one of the projects they have proposed is on water. I was just  wondering where they are going to get the water from. Are they going to get underground water for that area or are they prepared to pump water from Lake Victoria to those areas for use for irrigation purposes to the benefit of this country? </Newspeech><Newspeech> Mr.Nyaklano: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I come from an area which is near Lake Victoria and I believe it will not be feasible to pump water from there to the North.Eastern Province. I said that we want viable projects and notprojects which are too big and which cannot be completed.i said that one of our functions is dam-and ..borehole construction. </Newspeech>  <Newspeech> MR. WABUGE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the Assistant Minister says thatthey do not envisage to undertake this kind project would he not agree withme that the Ministry should made some initiative to start such a project? Aswe all know a person without initiative is a non-starter and therefore, hisMinistry must have long-term plans to pump water from Lake Victoria to this area? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. NTAKIAMO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the  answer is yes. low ever, although we cannot foretell the futre, we cannot say No to that question.MR.

So ever, if he requires that information so badly, he can always come to our office in the Ministry of Agriculture and he will definitely get it. </Newspeech><Header> COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR </Header ><Newspeech> MR. SPEAKER: Hon. Members, you will remember I promised.  the House some weeks ago to give a ruling in connexion with the issue of carrying debate outside this House. This arose out of a Motion that was brought to the House by hon. Mwamzandi and it was believed that the hon. Minister for Health raised certain issues arising out of that debate, outside this House.Up until now, there exists no constitutional, other legal provisions or a Standing Order of the National Assembly that precludes hon. Members for debating, discussing, outside the House, matters still under debate, set to be debated or already debated by the House. Notwithstanding that, in Parliamentary parlance, Rulings of the Chair, constitute part of the acceptable norms and rules governing proceedings of the House. Existing constraints or restrictions in this regard have so far been guided by Rulings of the Chair. Rulings of the Chair are demanded by hon. Member, to provide basis for handling any similar situations in the future. Hon. Members also contribute to the build up of rules of procedure of introducing Motions seeking to effect a specified rule of procedure. On Occober 17, 1969, Che House look a specific decision Co debar any concinuacionby Honourable Members, of debaces, discussions outside Che House on Matters before ic, etc.A resolution Co this end was concained in a motion moved, debated and adopted on Chat date.  Prior to October 17, 1969, the Chair and the House had not taken any firm stand on this matter. During the Seventh Session of Che First Parliament (1963-1969), three occassions had arisen needing specific decisions in line with that in Che resolution- of October 17, 1969. VIZ:i) On May.28, 1969 an unnamed government spokesman published through the Kenya News Agency, a statement criticizing among others, certain allegations made by Honourable Members during debate on the Presidential Address. The issue that this was improper was raised in the House;ii) On June 24, 1969 the then Leader of the Opposition the Hon. J. A. Oginga Odinga, made a Press Statement in which he expressed his views on the Financial Statement on the Annual Estimates, that was shortly to come up for debate in the House. The issue that he should not have done so, was raised in the House; andiii) On August 11, 1969, the then Minister for Education Dr. the Hon. J.G. Kiano, M.P. addressed a press conference, whereby he  replied in detail to the issues raised. during debate on a Motion on Adjournment of The The House (end of Normal Siccing)on August 8, 1969. .. The issue that he should not have done so was raised in. The House -4. The above three incidences were deal with as follows:i) The unnamed Government Spokesman remained unknown. However, The House debated this Government conduce on a Motion on Adjournment under S-0- 20 on August 29, 1969. .During This debate, the Then Deputy Leader of Government Business in The House, Hon. P.J. Ngei, M-P., rendered an apology acceptable Co the House.ii) Although the Leader of the Opposition was absent when his conduct in channeling his views through The press was raised in The House, he responded Co Mr. Speaker's request for apology. He rendered an apology that was accepted by the House.iii) The Minister for Education, despite persistent requests for a suitable apology, did not himself to offer any. No further specific action was taken against him.<Header> THE ROLE OF THE CHAIR </Header >i) On these three occasions, the Chair, did not take a firm stand. It was obvious, from the expression of Mr. Speaker Slade, that he did not have the power and mandate to either require an erring Member Co apologise, or come out any other form of disciplinary measure.On occasion i), he in part said - 'Members of the Public, including editors, are free to criticize in the press anything that is said in Parliament so long as such criticism does not amount to contempt of Parliament. But it is an unwritten rule of this and many other Parliaments that our own Members should not carry any of our debates outside the House .... and I do urge Members of Government to use this form and no other  for the purpose of answering the speeches which have already been made by the more Chan 60 Backbenchers 	 (ii) On this occasion, in a Communication from the Chair. Mr, Speaker, said in pare  that I reminded you that no debate which is taking place here should be pursued by any honourable Member outside this House whether in the press or otherwise .... I say again that such conduce by Hon. members is in effect, contempt of their own Parliament, and I Crush that Mr. Odinga will make a suitable apology(iii) On this occasion, a Communication from the Chairwhile reiterating, the position stated above, added further clarification as to what matters, members are debarred from debating or discussing outside the House. Hence  only debates continuing; concluded or any specific things raised during debates on Sub-concave Motions which end with resolutions; must, not be debased, discussed, or replied Co outside the House, by any Member. All other matters raised as Questions, Points of Order, Motions on Adjournment, can be debated, discussed outside, since no resolutions or decisions are taken. The Chair, accordingly exonerated the then Minister for Education from any wrong doing.  On September 30, 1969, the Chair gave further guidance arid explicitly the moving of the Mocion of October  7, 1969; In response to a Point of order by the then Member for Butere Hon. Shikuku, M.P. as to what seeps the House could cake on the persistence failure by the Minister for Education o- render an apology, Mr. Speaker, along with reiterating the position sacked earlier, acknowledged the absence of neither a Standing Order nor any power of The committee of Privileges as The law now Stands  'Which enables The SpeakerTo demand an apology for such ton duce; to is Theirresponsibility To This House not To do these things	Well, Hon. members, I have To leave to ac that ...... untilsuch time as an Hon. "Member sees fit to resolve it definitely, by some kind of substantive Motion in this House, either for amendment of the National Assembly Powers and Privileges Acc, or other-wise'. 6.	There would appear not To have: been any much a do about This form of procedure, after adoption of the October17, 1969 resolution.. Io was revisited in The Third Session of the Fourth parliament. On July 14, 1981, a considered -Ruling was given by the Deputy Speaker, the Hon. Moses K. arap Keino, M.P. on whether a debate then before the House had been continued outside. The Chair expressed is satisfaction that no direct reference had been made To the subject then before the House.	was father ruledthat, any ambivalence references made were not contemptuous.    Solution to the saga surrounding Hon.Mwamzandi's Motion on April II, 1990, arising from press report of-the views expressed by the Minister for Health at, Kathiani on April 9, 1990 could be by taking into account issues;(i)On April 11, 1990, when debate was due to resume, having been interrupted on April 4, 1990 it was the view of some Members that the response given to a question on cost-sharing by the Minister for Health during a public function at Kathiani High School affected this Motion in two ways:It was a violation of the accepted practice of  House, debarring are Member to debate, discuss or respond to anything raised in the House relating to a matter under debate or likely to come up for debate, leading to a definite resolution decision;It has offered what would have formed part of the Minister's response to this Motion; thus some Members (especially the Mover and his Seconder) felt, it had ore-emptied any response by the Minister, which thus, had been pre-emptied and -overtaken by the response at Kathiani	(ii)	A brief analysis of Hon. Mwamzandi's motion as appearing on the Order Pier of Wednesday, April 4, 1990, reveals its main proposals to be:	''The inability of the unemployed and financially handicappedto meet their part in the cost-sharing policy for medicaltreatment; hence, the need for Government to raise(tax) from the employed to provide free 	it,services to them.  Indeed the exposition on cost sharing, in .medical areas .variously expounded by Government officers, both in the House and outside, goes far beyond the proposals in the Honorable Member's Motion. At any rate, the proposals in this Motion have never been intimated as points of negotiations or impediments to implementation of this policy, at. Kenyans would not be. denied medication ac public health facilities due to inability to pay  whether such inability is temporary, prolonged or permanent. However, debate in the House on this Motion with its likelihood to spill into the other areas of the cost-sharing policy, could not in the ultimate hinder simultaneous public discussion of the policy by MinistersA brief analysis of the press coverage of the statement by the Minister for Health, on Monday, April 9 19 9 0 at Kathiani High School, reveals that:-It was a general clarification of a pertinent hir.ge in the implementation of the general policy. On page 4 of the 'Daily Nation' of Tuesday April, 10 1990, the Minister is reported to have directed his staff not to deny the poor medication for non-payment. He neither referred to the unemployed and financially handicapped nor the need to raise funds from the employed to give the former free medication. There seems to be, a distinction between the poor and the unemployed and financially handicapped. , The former could exist regardless of being employed, while the latter are not necessarily the former. And it would appear, Hon. Mvamzandi's concern was for the latter.Additionally, a look at the statement to the House on the afternoon of Wednesday, April 11, 1990 by the Minister for Health, reveals that his statement at Kathiani was extempore and was mace under strongly mitigating circumstances. therefore, appeal to the Hon. Members and caution that it is in your own interests that the debates and discussions taking place here should not be extended outside this Chamber. </Newspeech>(applause ) -	Thank you 	<Header> POINT OF ORDER </Header ><Newspeech>MR.

KILlKO: Mr. Speaker, Sir I wish to direct another point of order to the Ministry of Health. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: How many points of order do you have? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KELIKCJ: Mr.' Speaker, Sir, we in this House have to protect the Government where it is losing millions and millions of shillings I have many documents here which show that  corruption  exists in the Ministry of Health. I will be brief. Owing to .corruption in the tender system, in 1965/86 the Government lost Shs.163,862,630.40. I will lay on the ±as Table this document. In 1988/89 the Government lost Shs. 10,545,020/-." In 1989/90 the Government will lose Shs.!40 million. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Kiliku If you have any evidence, take it to the police. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

At a timewhen I was away for a long time, the Daily Nation  incidentallyit calls itself the paper that serves the nation" came up withthis quotation "The Attorney-General has conceded that Mr.Mibeiis still the Attorney-General".Now, where did I concede andwhat did1 I conclude? There was nothing of the sort. There isno question of somebody acting  this is a temporary discharge offunctions in the absence of the incumbent Minister. It is theprerogative to designate a person to discharge such duties wherehe finds it necessary. I think I should demand an apology through.the Chair." In 1983 I complained many times about  thisnewspapers and even threatened to invoke my powers  and close it down. It seems as if the newspaper has persisted in its reporting for too longAlthough the House-has been misled, the position is very clear: Hon. Mibei was  temporarily exercising the functions of the Attorney-General, except those covered by Section 26 of our Constitution. Therefore, we cannot have two attorney- generals at the same time. On the return of the incumbent Minister, we do not revoke the order that gave another Minister power to exercise those functions because the law is clear that the functions exercised until the incumbent Minister returns from abroad.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wanted to register that  complaint and give you good news from your counterpart in Newzealand. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>Mr.SPEAKER: I hope the Daily Nation staff have heard that, complaint "by the Attorney-General and will tackle it. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I rise on a point of order on the same issue of newspapers. I think it is time the newspapers exercised a bit more caution in making headlines and quotations.On May Day, The Standard newspaper came out with a statement that I do not like Luos in trade unions. Not only did they say that, but they went ahead to say that the Ministry of Labour was doing nothing while the trade unions were squabbling. I think both issues need to be clarified. First of all, the statement that I do not like Luos in trade unions was made ex parte by Mr. Ochino, who is an officer of the trade unions. He is the secretary-general of the Petroleum Workers Union. I think it was unfair for the newspaper to make it look like a reality that I do not like Luos in trade unions without quoting the man who said it.Mr. Speaker, Sir, Mr. Ochino has a lot of problems in his trade union. He is at loggerheads with a lot of the officials and they have complained to the central body of the unions and they have called a meeting to discuss Mr. Ochino. It is because the central body did this  which they are empowered by the constitution to do  that Mr. Ochino was fuming. He could not face them, so he went to the Ministry. The Ministry of Labour has no powers to intervene in internal matters of unions because the unions are autonomously registered. So long.as a trade unionperforms its job within its constitution, the Ministry cannot interfere. It isonly the Registrar of Trade Unions who can take note of the goings on. The Ministry of Labour can only send observers to record what is going on, and that is what I did. When I heard that there was going to be a meeting of the union, I had to send observers to get first-hand information, and that is a responsibility I have to carry out. That is what I did, and it does not mean that I am against any particular group of people.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also know that this particular officer is a member of the Central Organisation of Trade Unions (COTU) board, and that he has been present in all COTU meetings. Recently when COTU was appointing the various officials on its board, Mr. Ochino agreed to sill the appointments. There is no place where Mr. Ochino objected to a single appointment. It is only after the appointments were made that he came out to say that the appointees were all Luhyas. I would like to know whether Mr. Murugu is a Luhya. I would also like to know whether Mr. Omanga, who was appointed to the board, is a Luhya. Mr. Omanga is a Luo. What is this about Mr. Mugalla and I colluding to get rid of Luos in the COTU board?Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a matter which concerns the nation's industrial relations and I cannot keep quiet. The fact of the matter is that Mr. Ochino also has correspondence with a foreign power which is not in the best of relations with Kenya, and this has been drawn to his attention. Being so, Mr. Ochino is fuming because facts which are unpleasant to him are being told to him. It is also true that Mr. Ochino has been convicted in a magistrate's court of dishonesty. In the circumstances, if he had not appealed against the conviction he would be out of the union under Section 29(2) of the Trade Unions Act. Once you are convicted of a crime you cannot hold office. Mr.. Ochino has avoided being deregistered by making an appeal on the issue, and he knows that the appeal will take a very long time to be determined.Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are the facts and I would like newspapers, in circumstances like this that are national issues, to really find out the truth before coming out with headlines which cause alarm and, sometimes, despondency. They should not come out with statements based on untruth and ex parte statements. I want to ask newspapers to be national and patriotic and not to try to undermine the social order of the nation. If Mr. Ochino knew my background, he would have known that my local village comprises 50 per cent Luo population and, perhaps, he would not have said what he opined upon, having a propensity towards tribalistic feelings. I have no, and I have never had tribalistic feelings. Mr. Ochino, probably has tribalistic feelings and, for that reason, thinks that everybody else has. Idisown Mr. Ochino's statement totally because it is not true.Thank you very much. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Hon. Members besides whatthe hon.Minister has said, I think what is more important is that the Abasania and the Luos are brothers</Newspeech>.<Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. With regard to the point of order raised by the Minister, we have heard only one side of the story in this House. Unfortunately, our Standing Orders do not allow Mr. Ochino to come and defend himself here. Do you think the Minister has been fair to talk about somebody who cannot defend himself in the House since the House may take what the Minister has said as the fact? Perhaps, there might be something that Mr. Ochino and the Minister have not told us? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING(Mr. Nassir): Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Spika. .Ninasimama kwa jambo la nidhamu kuhusu maneno yaliyo— tamkwa na Mbunge wa Changamwe, mhe. Kiliku.Nilikuwa sina haja ya kujibu maneno yaliyotamkwa na mhe. Kiliku kwa sababu mimi mwenyewe naona haya kuyatamka hapa. Kama ikiwezekana, Serikali ingeya- chunguza maneno yaliyotamkwa na mhe. Kiliku katika Mombasa Stadium wakati wa sherehe za Mei Dei.Bw. Spika, mhe. Kiliku ni mtoto hbdari; husema sana lakini huenda akipita mipaka. Mhe. Kiliku alipozungumza wakati wa-sherehe za Mei Dei aliwaaaibia watu walivyo na taabu katika Kenya, jinsi mshahara ulivyo mdogo na jinsi nyumba zinalipiwa kodi kubwa, na halafu mwisho akasema, "Mtoto huyu tuliye naye, mungu atujalie tuzae mtoto mwengine", na amemsema kwamba alikuwa anaongea juu ya Shariff Nassir. Hayo . ni maneno ambayo hayaelekei.Ingawa hivyo, ninamshukuru Mtukufu Rais kwa imani yake na uongozi wake, lakini sijui atastahimili zaidi kwa muda gani. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in order to please my "hon. colleagues. I withdraw and apologise.I would like to thank the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance for the steps that have been taken against officers who misused public funds. 	Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Members of the Public  Accounts Committee for their dedication, devotion and determination in their work. This has enabled them to produce this Report which covers all Government Ministries and Departments. In his Preface to the Report, the Chairman makes the following  observations:"While making recommendations . the Committee noted with concern that issues raised in the previous Reports kept on recurring. Glaring among them being the continued hurried preparation of accounts and their submission for audit without taking due care to ensure their accuracy."I agree entirely with the  observation made by the Chairman here.' These issues have been recurring every financial year. I do not know why these issues keep on recurring every year. I would urge the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance to take action against those people who mismanage our finances. No officer. should be allowed to squander public funds.' The Chairman continues to make the following observations.	"The format of the Report and Recommendations isthe same as" in the past. We wish, however, to register our displeasure with some Accounting Officers who neglect to respond to the queries raised by the Controller and . Auditor-General in time. Most of the accounting issues the Committee dealt with could have been cleared well in advance if the Accounting Officer cared to respond  to them promptly."I quite agree with these observations. Action should betaken against Accounting Officers who do not perform their dutieswell.- The Government should get rid of Accounting Officers who are-incapable of performing their duties  well because we are tired ofhearing this : same old story every year. I believe that we havevery efficient people in this country who should be  employed toreplace these Accounting Officers who are not working properly I would now like to refer to Paragraph 8 of the Report -Paymaster General s Account. This paragraph reads as follows	For the last four years, the Paymaster General'sAccount has been overdrawn and the position at the end of.each financial year was as follows :Year	Overdraft kshs—	1984/85	1,209,660,154.151985/86	2,957,178,736.701986/87	6,476,882,949.151987/88	'9,703,042,287.10"Mr. Speaker, Sir, this leaves one wondering as to why the Paymaster General's Account should be overdrawn. You can see here that the overdraft has been growing every year. I think we need proper financial supervision and management in this country.' What is going to stop the overdraft figures from going up each year? It appears as if there is nobody who supervises the operations of the Paymaster.General's Account. It is therefore any sincere hope that the Office, of the "Vice-President and Ministry of Finance is going to be more vigilant regarding the position of these overdrafts.Mr. Speaker, Sir, Paragraph. 9 of the Report reads asfollows :-"The continued overdrawing of the Paymaster General's Account continues to be a cause for concern : especially considering that such overdrafts constitute unauthorized  borrowing .Interest payments in respectof such overdrafts which in 1987/88 amounted to KShs.951,255,290.-A0 have been charged to the Consolidated Fund." Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a very dangerous thing for Government Ministries to borrow money without authority. The  Govern¬ment is losing a lot of money through unauthorized borrowing by Ministries. So, the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry, of Finance should be very vigilant to ensure that such things do not recur in the future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, paragraph 10 states as follows:-"While the Paymaster-General's Account with the Bank as at 30th June, 1988 showed an overdraft of Kshs.9,703,042,287.10, the total (net) Cash Books overdraft as reflected in all the Ministries/Departments and the Consolidated Fund Services Cash Books was Kshs.9,890,083,211.65 (OD)."This is the reason why sometimes we do not have money for our developmentprojects because we allow money to be spent without ensuring that it is spentproperly. The main thing here is that we should supervise how money is spentbecause if we do not do so; at the end of the day, we shall find that we have nomoney at all.Paragraph 23 on page 11 of the Report states as follows:-"As in the previous years the control of imprests remained unsatisfactory. According to records held by various Ministries and Departments, imprests totalling Kshs.23,117,909.95 which should have been accounted for 	by 30th Junewere still outstanding as at that date. Outof this figure, a total of Ksh.3,383,374.80 was due from officers on Job Group ‘M' and above..." </Newspeech><Header> QUORUM </Header ><Newspeech>MR. A.I. MOHAMMED: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. There is no quorum in the House. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Yes,, there is no quorum. Ring the Division Bell. </Newspeech>(The Division Bell was rung)<Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Continue now, hon. Bidu. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was quoting paragraph 23 and wishto continue."In addition, out of the total imprests of Ksh.23,117,909,95 outstanding as at 30th June, 1988 imprests totalling Ksh.18,436,138.55 were still out¬standing as at 30th September, 1988 with an amount of Ksh.7,372,285.15 still due from officers on Job Group 'M' and above and Ksh.11,063,853.40 from other officers.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have a regulation in the Government to theeffect that all outstanding imprests should be accounted for within 24 hours.Here we are talking about past years; the imprests are still outstanding andnobody has been sued for non-remittance of the outstanding figures. For howlong can we continue having public funds in the hands of people? For how long are going to have officers in Job Group 'M' and above not remitting their outstanding imprests? I take it that this problem occurs deliberately. If it is true that there is that regulation pertaining to the remittance of outstanding imprests, why has it not be invoked to recover all these amounts?It is high time the office of the Vice—President and Ministry of Finance, although I have made praises in that direction, became more effective and more accurate in ensuring that all public funds are accounted for. It is meaningless for us to have the Public Accounts Committee labouring on this issue of outstanding imprests without a solution. These things are not done by small persons but by those senior officers in Job Group 'M and above. We . have to ask the question: what are we fearing? What is the office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance fearing so as not to sue these officers who have not remitted their outstanding imprests? It is the prime duty of those concerned to ensure that those who have flouted Government regulations are dealt with legally, and if there is misappropriation, then the culprits should be taken to courts.We are still wondering because most of the outstanding imprests which should have been accounted for three to four years ago are still in the Public Accounts Committee reports. This is not through the work of the junior officers but those senior ones. I would request the office of the Vice-President and Ministry for Finance to take drastic action and ensure that outstanding imprests do not take so long to be accounted for, as required in the existing regulations.The amounts reflected in the Report here are huge while we always have problems, as hon. Members of Parliament, when we seek Government funding of various projects. We are normally told that such projects will be imple¬mented "when funds are available.." Here is a lot of money outstanding by Government officers; this money is being robbed by some individual through failure to account for it and just keeping quiet. During the preparation.  of our national Budget for this year, this things will come into play and, probably, we will be told that there is not enough money to distribute evenly to all the Ministries because of various factors. The problem is that most of the required funds are still in the hands of some individuals.Mr. Speaker, Sir, since I see that it is time for another Order, I beg to support. </Newspeech>  <Header> MOTION FOR THE ADJOURNMENT </Header >Adjournment to a Day other than the Next Normal Sitting Day<Newspeech>THE VICE PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR FINANCE (prof. Saitoti): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ,move that this House do now adjourn until Tuesday", 5th June, 1990.In moving this Motion of Adjournment, permit me, Sir, to make a few observations. First of all, I believe that the recess which is going to do afforded to the hon. Members, will give us an opportune to visit our constituencies. But much more important is the fact that the rains are overwe should interact with our people. especially' the farmers and exchange views on the ways in which we can boost  food production for our people in this country.I am sure that hon. Member will take opportunity where it is still	people and urge them to plan's more- trees. T-ois. isimportant because ire must ensure that the desert does not encroach, upon ourcountry.Sir, at this juncture, allow me to say that Parliament is going to adjourn after having transacted some very substantial business. It is a  matter of great pride and satisfaction that our Parliament is a shining in the African continent where business is deliberated freely in an open atmosphere. This must be repeated because -re are able to do so under the umbrella of cur one Party, Kanu. There are many people who hare been preaching wrong views to the effect that no democracy can within the ambit of £ on political party.The believe that Kenya offers a fine example of the operation of democracy  a one-party system. It is important to draw the attention of Se hon. Members to the transact obsess m a serious manner.I commend hon. members for the seriousness with which they have handledcomplicated views and the calmness that they have demonstrated. 'This House has demonstrated maturity in handling difficult and complicated matters. This has  been, done according to the wishes of the electorate to whom we are answerable.I  say this because we have recently heard some noises being madeoutside Parliament by a few misguided elements who have attempted to make.aspersion to this House. Some of them have  to the effect that Parliament should be scrapped. This	hon. House is here to stay because its Members have "been elected by the peoples. We also know that theelectorate	confidence in this House and its Members. Perhaps, what hashappened is that because of the seriousness with which this House hasconducted itself is total commitment to the welfare of the people and itsrefusal to be used as a platform by those who have no interest of wananchiat heart is what has made the disgruntled elements unhappy. The can onlysympathies with them  and pronounce it Loudly and clearly that we shall not be used as stooges by the disgruntle elements who have no interest .of the nation at heart.At this juncture, it is important to reflect an the great stabilitythat this nation enjoys, Kenya is like an island in a sea of chaos. hisExcellency the President has done a lot for this country. He has brought aboutnational unity to this country, and today, we are sere united than ever beforedue to the efforts of the President. He has made us consider ourselves asKenyans rather than as different tribes. Of course, there are a few people whostill believe in tribalism but they are being reduced one by one day by day,whereas the nationally-oriented people are getting more and more in this country.The important thing is that we must safeguard the stability whichthe President has brought to this nation. we shall only do so by supportingthe President in the various ways in which he is helping to build this country.At all times, we must ensure that we follow the Nyayo path which is the onlyTray of building this nation. One thing which must be rejected totally ? we to consolidate the national unity which we have, are those views which havebeen exposed by a number of dissatisfied elements the are advocating  multi¬parties in this country.  We have experience of what multi-parties can do	to that countryThen we had several parties in this country, there was chaos and people were killed. vie do not want to go back to a situation whore blood is going to be shed because of tribalism, we reject tribalism,and we want national unity. More important, we want to ensure that, men we leave this world, our childrenand future generations will have a country which they will know iras consolidated properly by those who were there before. Vie do not want to leave.heritage of disintegration in this country.That is fundamental to all of us as we go on recess. and  we should	use the opportunity to no Id many Kanu meetings and continue to support our party political system. we should show everybody how much we love our Party. we should also demonstrate to everybody that we are true defenders of this country.	with those few remarks, I beg to move. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY(Mr. Biwott) : Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise tosecond this motion on  Adjournment. In doing so, I would like to pay glowingtribute to His Excellency the President for the manner . which he has led thiscountry to greater heights of because, stability and  I would alsolike to thank him for the timely action which he took recently by raising the	salaries and wages of junior civil servants..who really needed them at this time when pricesof commodities have gone up. It was a tremendous job and it also shews how hecares for his people. It also shows how a one-party system cares for itswanarchi through its leadership.As the Vice-President and Minister for Finance who is also the ..Leader of government Business has said, it is time for us, after having done a let of work here, to go home and participate fully in the activities that take place in our respective constituencies.I would like to encourage the hon. members to take greater interest  in their district development committees in order to wananchi hon to use these committees to launch projects that can create employment . they should also assist in kanu mentorship drives, More so, the hon. Members should preach that theyare supposed to Breach... 	It is our duty as leaders to safeguard the peace and stability that we haveachieved in this country. we all know that we have been able to achieve unity in this country through the leadership of Yanu as only political partyin this country.. It is only-through the under standing of the past history ofpolitics in this country, that we are able to know what is good for this country.It is in the interest of peace and stability for us as hon. Members to alertour constituents about the need safeguard our system of one party and make themaware of the things that are good or bad far them ;he must teach our people tobe able to differentiate between an enemy arid a friend Unless we do this itwill be very difficult for many of our people to appreciate what we are g doingfor this country. It would also be difficult for most of the people to knowin advance, the dangers caused by some of their colleagues who are being visedby .their foreign mattersMr. Speaker,  Sir, we know that most of the people who have been talkingabout a multi-party system of Government are in themselves ineffective and whatthey tell cur people, is not what they do* One of these misguided peoplehappens to be a religious leader who was unable to solve the Katakwa issue.The Katakwa issue became very complicated for this religious leader and if hewas unable to solve such a small issue, how would he be able to solve a mush more complicated issue that would arise if Kenya today was plunged into a tribal or a religious conflict. It is worth noting that our problems today are created by. the puppets in this country who happen to be failures in life. If you look at each one of these people individually, you would find that they have done nothing for this country. These people are incapable of leading even a small section of the community let alone leading a whole district or province.So, I would like to take this opportunity, ;Mr. Speaker, Sir, to appeal to all Kenyans to be honest with themselves and to support only those things that can help tb develop Kenya. Our people should stop supporting ideals that please outsiders, things which could, turn chaotic in the future. These outsiders push-cur people into dangerous positions and then runaway leaving them to suffer the consequences. I would like to appeal, to all Kenyans too on the watch cut for these type of people. Our people should think in terms of brotherhood and try and help one another to live in unity in order to maintain the peaceand stability that we have achieved, in this country over the years. In orderto safeguard these achievement we must strive to be united^ under the leadershipof His Excellency President Daniel axap Moi.with those few remarks, I beg to secondi,(Question proposed)MR. JALEESSA: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me thisopportunity to say a few things en this very important Motion. I would like tosay straghtaway that I support this Motico as Moved by His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance. This Motion has came at the right tinebecause there  has been ploity of rain and we are happy to have this chance togo home and guide farmers in their farming activities.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to say somethingabout the current debate that is going on regarding the issue of multi-partysystem of Government. I think sometimes it would be a great deal of waste oftime to keep on replying to the statements made by people outside, this House.I believe that doing so tends to make these people prominent, and there is goingto be no end of this kind of debate. Today we will be talking about Bishop Ckullu,tomorrow we shall be talking about Rev Njoya and the day after tomorrow, we	shall be talking about Mr. Shikuku. As I have said, I think replying to these criticstends to give them publicity in the eyes of the world and therefore, I thinkthe best thing to do is to ignore them so that they get tired of talking. After all, we know that all Kenyans are united Tinder the leadership of HisExcellency the President and they support one-party  system of Government inKenya and that is siough. Secondly, the Constitution of Kenya is very clear onthis issue and therefore, I do not see any reason why we should be replying to the statements made by these people since this is going to be an endless exercise.Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is one particular critic whom I would like to mention-because I think he has gone too far, and this is Mr. Shikukuo Mr. Shikuku has gone to the extent of suggesting that this Parliament should be  scrapped. I consider this remark to be very serious particularly because it has been made by a person who has been a Member of this House. This man usedto boast how he was conversant with the Standing Orders of this House and the Constitution of Kenya and used to say that he respected this House as the Supreme authority in this land. It is therefore very strange to hear this sane person saying that Parliament should be scrapped.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to say something about the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife. I am sure that hon. Members read in the newspapers that the Director of Wildlife had laid off some staff in the Department of Wildlife. I would like- to say that I commend the Director for this timely action because these are people who have been colluding with poarchers and other bandits and we have been knowing some of them. We have been reporting the activities of some of these people and therefore, this is a timely action and we support the Director for this wise move. However, this action is not enough. Yesterday,  I put a Question to this House regarding the recruitment of Game Warden Trainees. However, none of these Game Warden trainees has been taken from Isiolo District, for the last 10 years. However, I was surprised to feed from the newspapers that some names of people who were purportedly . from Isiolo District were given as Game Warden trainees. The truth of the matter whois that none of the people come from Isiolo and I feel that the Assistant Ministeranswered this Question  not his homework well; and therefore, mr.Speaker, I would like  to appeal to him to go and do his homework properly and bring the  correct answer to this House. We do not want tribalism to be practised in this country and we must as leaders condemn this evil practice. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to talk about cost-sharing in hospitals. At the moment, we are being perturbed about this cost sharing because we do not know -what criteria is being used to arrive at this cost sharing. Therefore, we need a proper guideline from the Minister so that our people, particularly the staff of the Ministry, can know who should pay-for this cost sharing and who should be x exempted. At the moment, there are patients who can hardly afford to pay for their treatment, but I have not seen anybody being exempted from paying. Therefore, we must have a clear cut policy  guideline as to how this cost sharing is arrived would like to know who is supposed to pay and who is supped to he exempted from paying. At the moment, there is a lot of confusion and although we support the whole ideal of cost sharing, we would like justice to be done. The Government stated that those patients whoare unable to pay should be exempted, but how do you determine those who are unable to pay? There ought to be a formulary for arriving at this conclusion Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the .inception of the district focus far rural development programme, our people have been able to participate in decision making right from the grassroot level. However, time and again, we have expressed our concern regarding the composition of the district development committees. This is because the whole system is dominated by heads of departments. We have respect for these people because they are technically qualified, but unfortunately</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Tour time is up, Mr. Jaldessa. . </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. JALEESSA: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. with those few remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KIILU: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for givingme a chance to air  my views and  join my colleagues on this Motion further Adjournment.People who are elected like to visit the electorate and it is our time now that we have recess visit our electorate so that we can advise them regularly on what they should do as far as development is concerned. But it would be good that we should also support the Government and the President of thiscountry because he does a lot to our poor people, and if we canemulate him or follow his example, it would be very good. Our people would feel that they are well-represented. However, there are some people who do not follow what our President does because of their behavior, the way they talk, the way they a present them¬selves and so on. I am sure a father is happy when he sees his children doing well. Therefore, it would. be advisable for all hon. Members and even senior civil servants in this country to follow the example of the father of the nation. But whoever is not satisfied with things it would be better for them to resign quietly and keep quiet so that other people can be led the way the President of this country is doing in leading the nation.Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are a few negligent leaders because of the nature of the work they do, and that is why, in most eases, you find hon. Members complaining when they bring questions here. But to some extent, they are given irrelevant answers because some civil servants do not get proper answers to give to Ministers when such questions come to be answered. We discover this because of the way Back-benchers are replied to here by Ministers. Sometimes one is given an answer which is quite contrary to what he has asked. An hon. Member knows his area very well. So, he can tell whether the answer is correct or wrong. Even if an answer was wrong, you cannot argue deeply about this matter because, most of the	Ministers defend their civil-servants because they do not wanttheir mistakes to be seen through that channel. Therefore, itwould be advisable that whoever feeds this House with wrong information he should: resign quietly. That would be. better and he would alsohelp the local people whom we represent. There are some peoplefrom the rural areas,  who do not knowNairobi. They do not know various Ministries and their offices,and that is why a, we represent their cases into this House.Mr. Speaker, Sir, right now a survey team is in my area doingallocation of plots, and the area been, neglected simply becauseit is near Tana Biver which is owned by Tana and Athi Hi versDevelopment Authority (TARDA). The people there have never beenassisted and they have been complaining. They have been askingthe Government to go there and find out why that area has beenleft out. I also remember asking a question here concerningChangosi in Masinga Sub, location, and I was surprised to hear anAssistant Minister for Lands and Housing, hon. Mutiso, telling the House that there is no such an area in Masinga Constituency  Yet he is the former Member for that areal This was pathetic. So, I would request the Government to find out what can be done about those areas.The other thing is about TARDA assessment. I have seen some people being paid Sh.700 and yet from Masinga up to Machakos, assessment is Sh.100.00... How can they pay Sh. 7.00 for Masinga? with those few remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAHIHU: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to rise and support this Motion for the Adjournment. Mr. Speaker,  Sir, a1low me first to congratulate His Excellency the President who has been very mindful of Kenyans problemsas recently as yesterday. He directed that Local Authoritiesshould not go on increasing house rents day after day. It is also important to mention that Local Authorities are part and parcel ofCentral Government, and if they have to do a thing of that naturewhich affects everybody, it is important that they consultwith the relevant minister Mr. Speaker, Sir, something that worries me quite a bit isthe community of students that we are now sending to universitiesafter 8-4-4 examinations It takes about four years for them to come outas graduates and I think it is time now for the planners in theGovernment system to organise a scheme of work so that when they complete their studies, or after graduating, there will be somethingfor them to fall back to. It is a big challenge that after studentsgraduate either from here and overseas, they can hope to come backand contribute to the national development of the country,   Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to congratulate HisExcellency for the mindful feelings he has in starting Nyayo Wards.Hyayo Wards have become part and parcel of the hospital ^systemin this country. Perhaps we are about  only country in Africathat thinks about its sick people We have been assured several times 	through the Ministry of Health that no sick poor person in Kenyawill be denied medical care. This is very unique. But I wouldlike to recommend that the Ministry should gives a little further with the support of the Treasury funds so that even the missionary hospitals which are not sufficiently funded could be assisted even much more. If they are not taken over by the Government, then Government should find, a solution to see how best they could be assisted This is in areas where there are no Nyayo wards or  Government hospitals, but there are missionary hospitals. I am sure themissionary hospitals appreciate very much the little support theyget from the Government, but they need possibly a little more.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to express my thanks on the question of Government support in all areas of development, and much more, I would like to mention the question of maintaining Government, institutions, especially roads. The roads-should be given a very special attention. The hon. Vice-President and  Minister for Finance is very much concerned about the poor state of our roads, and I fully support him in his endeavour to allocate funds to the various Ministries. But it is also important not to let roads  go too bad to an expend that when we come to repair them, we would have to spend much more money than we would have done before. There is a sign of negligence on the part of officers for instanoe, in some areas, you just cannot drive on the roads. If, for example, you want to drive from Murang'a to Nairobi, you would have to drive through Sagana first so that you can come via Markup to Nairobi because from Murang'a to Makutano, the road , is very bad and, as such, it takes you so much time. The road is full of potholes. Also, if you were to drive from Murang'a to Nyeri, you would have to avoid passing through Earatina. Maybe you would have to find a way through Othaya because perhaps that road has recently been repaired. you would have to try to avoid driving through Karatina because of potholes. So, there is an urgent need for all these things to be attended to. So, there is an urgent need If or these matters to be attended to.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am very happy that we now have aninvestment promotion centre. The public has been informed whereto go for information when they.want to invest in this  countryHowever, there is, one bottleneck which, perhaps, the  Government.If you want to manage should look into hotel in Mombasa, you need at least30 licences.	With those few remarks, I support the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAGARA: Thank you very much, Sir. Speaker, g forgiving me this opportunity to contribute to this Motion. WhenPresident opened this session, he outlined some veryimportant matters for us to tackle during this session.' However,we. now have to go back to our constituencies to assist indevelopment before we come back to this House.The President has been very vocal on education issuesin this country. We have gone a long way in enrolling a goodnumber of students in our universities, secondary and primaryschools. However, this year looks a bit different in that theMinister for Education is not coming out clearly with regard touniversity admission for the 1989 form Six qualifiers. Perhaps,the Ministry is again waiting for the President to come up witha solution to the problem.' But the Minister for Education isauthorised to inform Kenyans who are supposed to join our universities for many years now, Form Six qualifiers with 10-points have been joining ± university. Now these is confusion: certain professorsand other spokesmen have  been giving differing information, on university admission. I, therefore, urge the Minister for Education through the Chair, to tell the country whether form Six leavers  working very hard to make the public that,aware produce is very much required by this country for consumption, use as a luxurywho obtained 10 points and above stand a chance of being admitted into our universities as it has been in the past. Considering that the 1939 Form Six qualifiers are the last lot from the old system of education, they should be given as much consideration as -those of the 8-4-4 system of education in university admission. At the moment, parents, among them hon. Members in this House, are patiently waiting for a word from the Minister for Education. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Agriculture has been.add export. However, at moment only 50 per cent of our tea leavesare being delivered to the tea. factories. It is very sad for us to encourage the farmers to produce to the satisfaction of this nation and at the same time disappoint them by not being able  deliver that produce to the factories where it is required. Each one of us knows that tea is a leader in foreign exchange earning.Yesterday we were talking about big people, plus a few hon. Members in this House, who have imported mercedes Benz cars using the foreign currency earned by our tea. Now, why are we able to import such cars, while we are unable to "buy tractors and maintain the roads which assist in. the earning of foreign .currency for our country? I come from a tea growing area and' I know that for the last three days, tea leaves have not been collected. I have no where else to turn to for a solution to this problem: I am lucky to have this opportunity to tell our farmers that, perhaps, it is the Kenya Tea Development (KTDA) that has let the in down, and that it has been, letting them down for a long time. thank you very much sir </Newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING(Mr. Nassir): Absante  Spika kwa nafasi hii.

MWENDWA: Let me, Mr. Speaker, Sir, start by congratulating His Excellency the President for the high quality leadership that he has shown this country and which, naturally, brings with it the peace that we have and the ability to follow the philosophy of peace, love and unity. By following that philosophy, His Excellency has maintained and preserved peace in this nation. It is important for any nation to have peace in order to develop. The President is, indeed, the foundation of our development.Having said that. Sir, I would like to say how grateful we should be' to the Almighty God for the blessings of the rains. There has been rain throughout the country for the last three years and there has been rain this year. But, with 	rain, of course, comes water and with water comes soil erosion and the problemsof roads. It has been said by many people, and I dare say it, that there will always be complaints about the state of roads throughout the country. Let me add to that and hope that the Minister concerned will have the energy and foresight to be able to do something about our roads.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to say something about ability, by which I mean intelligence and-ability to do things in schools and other places. It is important for us in this country for us to identify ability early, train .it and retain it. We should ensure that after doing all that, there is no brain drain so that our trained brains do not go anywhere. We should be very careful v	in finding methods of ensuring that that does not happen. It is from this group	of able people who have been identified, trained and retained that we get suchactivities like research, teaching at universities and other places. Let me say 	that research is the only known way by which, the frontier's of knowledge can goforward. That cannot go forward without this ability I am talking about.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must say that we have plenty of the ability I am talking about, and I must say that I am very happy- Last time I talked about the selection to university not being geared to a predetermined standard but to select according to the performance of this year because ability is plenty and the differences are only because of the performances. I was,'therefore, very pleased to see that the authorities concerned did adjust the level at which people would be selected for university admission. That was very good indeed, and it was a clear indication of the understanding by the authorities that be of our educational system. It was also an indication that in Kenya we have people full of ability who can go to university. Even if the performance varies from year 2	to year, that will not make any difference because one presumes that universities	will be able to train this ability as much as they can. It is from that thatwe get the people who are versed with research work and who enhance the frontiers of knowledge.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to repeat one thing about roads, and say that the Minister concerned should do all he can to rectify the situation. I know it is a very difficult job but despite that he should ensure that every house gets some little milk, as we say in our place. As we go round repairing the roads, the Minister should make sure that all places do get  their deserved attention.With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR AGULTURE AND SOCILA SERVICES (Mr. Njiru): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by my colleagues in supporting this Motion. .First of all, let me take this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency the President for the very able manner in which he has steered leadership in Kenya. Again, I want to congratulate him for the way he has made Kenya earn a good name internationally Of particular importance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to observe the fact that of late we have had some very disgruntled elements - professor of doom - who have been trying to preach multi-party system in this country. For the benefit of those who were not there during the struggle for Independence, I would like to say that we used to have political parties even based on district level. There was the Nyeri Congress, Embu African Democratic Party and others everywhere. Thereafter, we started forming political parties that were semi—national such as the Nairobi Peoples Convention Party, Nairobi Congress and so forth. We went ahead that way and by the time we were approaching -Independence time the situation became very serious. We had Kanu, Kadu, APP, KPU and so on. All those parties multimately . ended , up. being based on tribal lines We hence, started seeing the "killing" of the weak tribes.What is most surprising now, Sir, is to see the people we thinkare God-fearing conducting prayers taking spiritual matters and putting themaside and. starting to be advocates of amulti-party system. I hasten to add that this advocacy is by some, not all, religious leaders. The fact of the matter is that we were not caught by surprise when we heard religious leaders, like Bishop Gitari and Bishop Oku coming up with such suggestions. Their acts were not unexpected. We know that some of them have been making overseas trips and we even know the deliberations they have gone there for. All those acts are totally against the interests of this country. So, it is shocking to see these people coming up with such suggestions. At the same time, these things are being advocated by some tycoons.If you go back to the ordinary people, not a single one of them is interested in the multy—party system in this country. This is because our people know that, ultimately, it is them who will suffer. When trouble errupts in-this country, the rich tycoons will easily bundle their wives and close relatives into planes and desert this country. Thereby, they will leave people slaughtering each other here. It is a high time when we, as leaders, more so now that we are going on Recess, to hold public rallies everywhere to identify all those who are advocating for a multi-party system in this country. We should also reveal whether such advocacy is for the interest of the ordinary mwananchi or for the tycoons themselves.	The truth of the- matter is that some of these tycoons and ambitious .people served the colonialists in very high levels and are now trying to grab the chance to become  leaders of this country. I do not know how many presidents, or governments, we want for this country. When they have no such opportunity to become leaders, they think that they can get a chance at that leadership through the formation of other parties.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT(Mr. Ogle): Ahsaiite sana, Bw. Spika, kwa kunipa nafasi hii. Kwanza, kabisa, ningependa kuichukua fursa hii kumshukuru na kumpongeza Mtukufu Rais kwa kutu- ongoza vizuri, jambo ambalo limetuwezesha kuishi kwa hali ya amani kama ilivyo sasa. Kuahirishwa kwa Bunge, kama .vile Mtukufu Makamu wa Rais na Waziri wa Fedha alivyosema, kutatuwezesha sisi, kama Wabunge, kuweza k uwatembelea wananchi na, pia, kuwaandikisha wanachama wa Kanu ambako kote nchini wako tayari kwa raara ya kwanza kuonyesha wazi kwamba wanakenya ni wafuasi wa Kanu asilimia 100.Nikiungana na Wabunge wenzangu ambao wametangulia kusema kuhusu ripoti arabazo tumezisoma kwenye magazeti, kuhusu-watu fulani wanaotaka kuwe na vyama vingi vya kisiasa hapa nchini, ningependa kusema kwamba tukitaka kujua sababu za watu hawa wachache kutaka vyama hivi vingi tufikirie sana. Imeseme^' kana mara nyingi kwamba raapendekezo haya yanatokana na jinsi kuna mageuko ya kisiasa huko Ulaya mashariki. Je, sisi tuko Ulaya mashariki? Tumesema raara nyingi kuwa ni lazima tuwe Wafrika halisi a wenyeji wa nchi hii; ni lazima sote tuwe wazalendo wa Kenya. Kwa hivyo, wale wanaotuambia kuwa tuwe na vyama vingi vya kisiasa, kama ilivyo huko Ulaya mashariki, ni vibaraka wa wakoloni ambao ilichukua mwungano wa Bara zima la Afrika kupigana nao ili waondoke hapa. Kwa sababu milki ya mwisho ya wakoloni karibu iangamie, wakoloni hawa wanatafuta njia nyingine nyingi za kuwafanya warudi hapa Afrika. Njia yao ya kurudi hapa ni kuwatafuta vibaraka wachache katika nchi zote za Kiafrika ili wazushe ghasia.Sisi ni watu wazima hapa. Juzi tulikuwa tukiambiwa kwamba Rais wa nchi anafaa kukaa usukani kwa vikao viwili tu. Tunajua ni nchi gani duniani zina mipango kama hiyo, na inadhihirisha wazi kuwa vibaraka hawa wametumwa na wenzao katika nchi hizo ili kuwe na mipango ya kisiasa kama hiyo hapa. Makelele haya yote tunayoyasikia yanatokana na jinsi vibaraka hawa wametumwa. Je, ni kwa nini wasiongee kuhusu kikao kimoja tu cha urais, ama vikao vitatu? Hii ni kwa sababu vibaraka hawa wamepata mapeni kadha na wakaambiwa, "Sasa nendeni mseme kama mlivyotumwa.kusema."Bw. Spika, watu wengine wamekosa kuchaguliwa katika uchaguzi na sasa wanafikirr kuwa-wanaweza kuwa-na-nafasi za uongozi, hata kuwa Rais,.kupitia kwenye vyama tofauti vya kisiasa. Je, ikiwa mtu kama huyo ameshindwa kupata idadi ya kura 5,000 katika uchaguzi, je, sasa atakuja*kuiongoza nchi gani hapa? Serikali ya Mtukufu Rais imejitolea kuyalinda maisha ya wananchi na, kwa hivyo, hatutasimamishwa na chochote kile katika juhudi ya kuhakikisha kwamba maisha ya wananchi wa Kenya yamelindwa kikamilifu.Sisi tunaongea kila mara kuhusu demokrasi, lakini- "nyirabo" hizi bila kweli kuilinda demokrasi etu zitakuja kuiangaraiza nchi yetu. Hatuwezi kuruhusu jambo lolote kuharibu demokrasi hi yetu. We are prepared to say that we"are not ready"for that kind of destructive democracy. Hawa watu wachache wameenda mbali sana.Nilimsikia mhe. Nassir akisema kwamba tuwaache hawa wanaosemasema kuendelea tu, lakini tutawaacha hivyo namna gani? Ni kwa njia gani tutawaacha kuendelea"kuharibu amani hapa nchini? Si tuna magereza ya kutosha nchini? Wale wanaotuambia kuwa hatuna demokrasi ndio ambao wanauana wakati kuna uchaguzi katika nchi zao. Ni wapi nchini tumesikia kisa cha mpigania kura akiuawa? Hii si siri. Ninawaomba wale ambao wameshindwa kuingia hapa Bungeni wajaribu : kungojea miaka mitano ya kikao cha Bunge iishe na wapiganie viti vya Bunge. Kama mpinzani fulani alishindwa kwenye uchaguzi, na sasa ana njaa, ingefaa aende kwa Makamu wa Rais na Waziri wa Fedha, ama katika Wizara ya Biashara ili wapate leseni za biashara na njaa yao iishe. Sasa wengi wao huombaomba kwa Wazungu na kuwa kama maskini.Bw. Spika, pia ningependa kuomba kwamba Idara ya Upelelezi ifanye uchunguzi mkali kwa sababu kuna watu wengine ambao wameanza kufura matumbo kwa sababu ya kupatiwa pesa na Wazungu.Kwa hayo machache, naunga mkono. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TECHNICAL TRAINING AND APPLIED TECHNOLOGY (Prof. Ongeri): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand to support this-Motion for the Adjourn¬ment, knowing fully that our top priority, when we go back, is the maintenance of peace and unity in this land. It is quite evident and clear that this "shadow-boxing" which has started in Kenya is a prelude which is being orchestrated by individuals who: know who their grand-masters are. These individuals have started a language which is geared towards character assassination, and this is the modus operandi that they will now move from individual to individual to character assassinate thosei other individuals who are for this nation. It is quite clear that there is a game going on in this country; we are not blind to this game. These people have gone through the capitals of the world, colluded and agred that for us to survive, we must be harrassed. Why should Kenya be harrassed?Sir, this nation has grown and expanded in every single sphere through quality leadership; this nation has expectations for the future. The "people, and even the Jua Kali groups, are happy and excited about the opportunities ahead of them. They want to feel that they now belong to society. Why should somebody..think that he can now prescribe a pill to this nation? We neither need "Panadol" nor "Codeine". We have our own prescription for our own democracy; we know which direction we must move in. "shadow-boxing" which has started in Kenya is a prelude which is being orchestrated by individuals who: know who their grand-masters are.

We have our own prescription for our own democracy; we know which direction we must move in.	THE MINISTER FOR TECHNICAL TRANING AND APPLIED TECHNOLOGY (ctd):mr. Speaker, Sir, I know that there are a few individuals who want to discredit the leadership of this nation and we as mature leaders cannot allow this sort of thing to a continue. I have had intensive meetings with my constituents and  I have  realised that they do not understand this business of multi-parties. They are busy in their farms; they only want to know how their tea will reach the tea factories. They are a busy wanting to know how their children will go to secondary school or university and how they will be able to grow in terms ox wealth. I feel that we are being diverted from grappling with the problems of this nation to  rhetorics which have no substantive £ value to this nation. So, Parliament must reject rhetoric. certain person has had the audacity to say that this  Parliament is useless. He should have said that this Parliament is less noisy because hon. Members are very s busy transacting business of the House for the good of this nation. Let -us not try to play around with words because we are dealing with humanity. If there is one single person who has understood humanity - and expressed the value of humanity i it is no . other person than His Excellency the President. You cannot challenge him. Because of his independence and approach to the over¬view problems of Kenya, we are  being fought as a nation. I said that foreign powers should not try to  transplant  their democracy on to us.: We know a what democracy is all about. It  only last night when I was watching television and interestingly enough Mikhail Gorbachev is being riduculed now because  he rushed into this question of multi-party systems. He is now having it rough and I think they now want to see the African  Continentplunge into turmoil because they are chasing this animal called multi-party system. what is wrong with our single-party  system? what is wrong with  our Kanu? They should be discussing about the  evils, if any, that may ce there. we should not "be rushed into a situation which will breed chaos in  this land. Some of these people are educated people at the cleric level; some cf them are highly placed individuals; some of then have camouflaged themselves, even in this Parliament, to try and misdirect this nation.I beg to support."THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Kibaki) : Thank you, Mr.Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to join my colleagues in saying a few words before we go into recess. First of all, I would like to appeal to hon.: Members,  during the recess, to join in our public health campaigns by encouraging their constituents to under¬take public health work such as building latrines, cleaning water, immunisation of children and all other things that we are" doing. This is because £ after all, as Members of Parliament, we want to have healthy constituents. we should encourage them to be healthy.Having said that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe that we should focus our attention where the genuine challenge, which faces Kenya, really lies; that is the presence of unemployment and what we should do to reduce unemployment, particularly of the young men and women in this country In fact, I thank His Excellency thePresident for appointing a Committee to look into this matter. This is the biggest problem facing this country. But we also know instinctively that the biggest employment opportunities will lie in  developing the land  intensively. We need to develop the land which is now arid and semi-arid. It is too much to expect that we shall industrialise rapidly enough for the present generation of school leavers to benefit. In fact  the answer lies in  employment in land. I of us should "be thinking of what we  can do to join in the development of the land so that whatever is saved in Kenya is directed towards that direction  towards land development. I say this because, foreign capital,  although it has "been very significant .in our nation is going to be less in the next 10 years. We will be deceiving ourselves if we do not accept the "challenge that with the. changes in  Europe and that with the creation of one uniform market in the whole of what is now E.E.C. and with the opening of Eastern Europe, a lot of capital will go there. So, for us to attract what little we have been attracting, we shall have to think and about this matter and give greater incentives to foreign capital than we are giving today. But in the final analysis it is the savings available in this nation that are going to make all	that difference.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know that during this period, when we are in recess, we shall all wish our brothers and sisters in South Africa where they have started talks today, between the African National Congress and the Pretoria Government, so that they can have peace and  create a society which is truly non-racial something approaching what we have built here in Kenya. We wish them well and we should pray for them.Sir. Speaker, Sir, also during our recess, let us join Kanu. Let us. agree that the true answer to the people who are talking about multiparty is for us to go and join Kanu. By joining!the party we will make it more powerful so that we have an instrument which cannot be shaken because it founded in the people. The party then will not be bothered by a hai handful of people who will go on saying that we want a  multi-party system for this country, we shall say we are satisfied with Kanu. So, let us make Kanu stronger by joining it. Let us make sure that we are members of Zanu Let us correct whatever little problems we have in Kanu;	we have small problems in Kanu but h these are tiny. You do not thr$ir away your best article just because it has a little problem.' You take care of it; you clean whatever little  spot there is and you go on wearing your shirt You do not change it just because others are changing theirs  Kanu is our party and -let .us make it stronger. This is a genuine answer. Talking will never end. we know people who talked about different things-over the last 40 years.  Talking never changed anything; what changed anything was action and action is to joing Kanu. Once we are strong then these other people can go on talking about multi-party systems  until cattle comes home and nothing will change.With those remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. MWAMZANDI:  Absante sana, Bw. Spika, kwa kunipa nafasi hii.Ningetaka kusema, kwa ujuzi kabisa, ama kwa Kiingereza, with experience  which is the best teacher. Ningetaka kugusia kuhusu mapendekezo ya watu fulani kuhusu vyama vingi vya kisiasa. Inamo 1963, tulipoingia hapa, tulikuwa na zaidi ya vyama vitatu vya kisiasa na chama kilichokuwa kikiongoza ni Chama hiki cha Kanu. Mambo niliyoyaona wakati huo si we si kupenda kuyaona tena kwa sababu nilishuhudia kwamba vyama vingi vya kisiasa havisaidii kamwe. Wakati huo mimi nilikuwa mwanachama wa chama cha Kenya African Democratic Union(KADU) artbayoViiikuwa ni kama opposition party. Hii. ni kwa sababu wanachamawa chama hiki walikuwa hawapewi huduma zozote na Serikali. Tulikuwa-tunanyimahuduma hizo kabisa. Nifikiri Waziri wa Afya, Bw. Kibaki, anaweza kuniunga mkono kwa jambo hilo. Wakati huo mwanachama wa KADU akiomba huduma fulani kama vile kupij^rwa barabara yake lami alikuwa ananyimwa hata. kutiliwa ile tunayoita murrain. Kwa hivyo, wakati huo huduma za aina yoyote zilikuwa hazipewi wanachama wa KADU. Lakini wakati huo huo wale waliokuwa kwa.chama cha Kanu-walikuwa wakipewa huduma hizo. Pia hata wakati huo mwanachama wa Kanu ambaye hakuwa ni Mbunge alikuwa akipewa huduma hizo ambazo Mbunge aliyekuwa mwanachama wa KADU alikuwa akinyimwa. Kwa hivyo, singependelea tuwe na vyama vingi ambako mimi niwe mwanachama wa chama cha kupinga Serikali. Singependelea jambo kama hilo kabisa. Kwanza singependa huo mpango wa kuwa na vyama vingi katika nchi yetu. Hii ni kwa sababu wakati kulikuwa na vyama vingi hapa nchini kulikuwa na taabu nyingi sana kwani huduma za jamii hazikuwa zimesambazwa sawa sawa.Wakati huu kazi ya wanachama wa opposition party wal^Jcuwa ni kaigjtu. Hii ndiyo sababu tulikubali kukivunjilia mbali chama cha KADU ili tuwena chama kimoja cha Kanu iri tuwe na sauti moja. Tangu tulipofanya hivyo, huduma za jamiii zimesambazika.sawa sawa katika nchi hii. Hii ndiyo sababu sipendelei kabisa mpango wa kuwa na- vyama vingi katika nchi hii.Bw. Spika, hao watu wanaotaka vyama vingi, sijui walitumwa na naniwaanzjk kuzungumzia juu ya jambo hilo. Nimesikia ati Bishop Okullu hutoka huko Nyanza. Ingekuwa bora zaidi kama watu wa Nyanza wangesimama na kutoa habari katika magazeti yetu kumuambia kuwa hawamuungi mkono. Nafikiri mtu mmmoja aliyesimaraa kumpinga ni National Chairman wa Kanu. Wananchi wa Kenya hawana haja na vyama vingi kwani haja ni mambo manne tu. Kwanza haja ya kubwa ni chakula asubuhi, mchana na jioni. Hii.ndiyo haja yao kubwa. Pili, ni dawa wakiwa waagonjwa. Ingekuwa vizuri kama Waziri wa Afya angetekeleza ilS.ahadi yake kwamba mtu akiwa hana pesa atatibiwa. Hii ni kwa sababu mtu akikosa dawa huilaumu Serikali na kusema kuwa-Serikali ni mbaya kwa sababu mtu akiwa mgonjwaakienda hospitali hawezi kupata.dawa mpaka awe na pesa. Jarabtf kama hili linaha-ribu sifa na jina la Serikali na la kiongozi. wetu. Mjigonjwa aendapo hospitalinina kuulizwa pesa hujisema kimoyomoyo: "Serikali gani hii? Mirai nafa na waowanataka nitoe shs.20.00?" Kwa hivyo, W'izara ya Afya inafaa kuliondoa jambo hili kabisa.Bw. Spika, jambo lingine wapendalo watu ni mahali pa kulala salama. Sijui basi ni wananchi wa wapi ambao wanataka tuwe na vyama vingi katika nchi hii. Ingefaa -kama yule aliyemtuma huyo mtu aliyeleta mambo haya ya kuwa na vyama vitatu aambiwe kuwa huo rapango wake si mzuri kamwe. Kwa hayo machache, naunga mkono. </Newspeech><Newspeech> THE MINISTER FOR RESEARCH, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (Mr. Muhoho): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this Motion a£ Adjournment of the House since it was opened by His Excellency the President. This is a good time for us to go back to our constituents and consult with them. The essence of the representative Government is the ability of the elected members to go back to their electorates and share views andconsult with them on the number of issues affecting them as well as giving thema brief of what has been happening in the House like the various Bills thathave been passed. So, this is an auspicious occasion to take a breakIt is also a good time for us to go and join the rest of the wananchiat this time of good rains to assist the country in massive tree, planting.And on that note, I would like to invite all those hon. Member who will beavailable to join the students of Kenyatta University College and us in plantingtrees at the  university this coming Saturday. The aim of plating thesetrees is to create an avenue from Nairobi to Thika trans-passing the whole of Juja Constituency. This is a reality. So, to repeat, I would like to invite all those people who will be able, to come to this exercise.During this time of Recess, we have the opportunity of holding  meetings with our people, particularly to explain and educate the younger generation on the merits of. Kanu and the Kanu Government. We should not forget that by 11th June, 1990, Kanu will be 30 years since it was founded. During  these 30 years, the Government and the Party have both done a lot for this country. So, we should sit back and take stock and be able to explain to our people our achievements. We should try to crystalise the results of our labour and the good work that the Party and the Government have done for this country.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Kanu Manifesto vowed to bring Independence to this country and definetly it did that. Kanu also spoke of natinal unity. Indeed the Government has achieved that. The Party also spoke of education for all its people and this too has been achieved. The Government also promised to provide health facilities to its people and I am proud to say that it has done so. There are a lot of merits on what the Party has achieved for this nation. So, during our Recess we should try and use our time to expound all the and create awareness about nationalism in the younger generation.The people of Kiambu are proud to boast about the foundation ofthe Party because the Pary was founded there on 11th June, 1960. We would' like to tell everybody loud and clear" that those who want a multi-party system of Government should exclude the people of Kiambu. We have absolutely no interest in any other party because we are proud to have been given that privilege by the Kenyans to form Kanu and we are there to support this Party. If anybody wants something else apart from Kanu and its Government, we are not going to be a party to that issue. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSITANT MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Ogle): Tell them!THE MINISTER FOR RESEARCH, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (Mr. Muhoho): Yes, I am telling them loud and clear! This is the time for us to  strengthen the Party The only way, as one previous speaker said. of showing that we love our Party is by enrolling our Ra people into the Party. The only way of defending the Party is by ensuring-that every Kenyan becomes a member of the Party. There is no reason why all Kenyans cannot be  members of the Party. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we should also take this opportunity to visit each other and hope that very many hon. Members will use this opportunity to visit our research stations and institutions in the country. I beg supports Mr. Speaker left the ChairThe Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Wabuge) took the Chair</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. FALANAA: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, forgiving  this opportunity to contribute to this Motion. First of all I would when we talk of multi-parties, it  is like saying multi kenya or we divide Kenya. we are comfortable with one Kenya; on party: are government	and one President. Those advocating for  multi-party systems. are enemiesof unity. I do not know how people can be tired of peace and unity. Those advocating for multi-parties are fed up with being united and having peace and that is why they want problems. In my opinion, those  people who are after multi-parties are enemies of peace and unity and that is why they want problems in Kenya..Secondly , I , would like to take this opportunity to.thank His Excellency  the President for the way he has. defended our is one-party	Karnu.one onlyneeds to look back and see what the President has done with this party. He. has appointed directors at Kanu Headquarters who are able and learned people andthe involvement of women and youth in the party. I would like to also than the President for the way he has expanded and strengthened the party.4while on this, I. would like to appeal to the hon. I-Iembers to help the President in the promotion of Kanu. For heaven's sake if you cannot do anything to defend this nation and to promote the party, at be good and pre¬serve what the President has built. kana huwezi kujenga, usikubali Kanui bornoke.	we .are all Kanu members because it is the only party that we have, and .we love it. There are some petty issues which arise at the grassroots level ofKanu and we should not use the party  to finish each other, we should not  make people dread the party by saying Ujkichesa, Kanu iakmaalisa.. For heaven's  sake, as we go on recess, we should preach that Kanu  being the only party we have 	and belong to are should love  and defend it expulsion should only come as alast resort and there should be some organs to discipline those who have gone wrong, when there are extreme cases which Kanu Branches cannot deal with, then such matters should be forwarded to the Headquarters for action. Some of the petty issues can be dealt with even by elders other than by the Kanu we should "protect and defend" the Party's instead-of-using-it forpetty issues. we should leave no loopholes for the multi-party advocates to hit out at the Party, iie should preserve the good r.anc 01 the Party at all tines.As hon. Kioaki said, instead of rnaicing a lot of noise, we shouldgo back hone and recruit as many Kanu members as we canr. and be ready tofight those advocating for a multi-party system. I would like to appeal,at this juncture, to my fellow colleagues, Ministers, to assist thePresident, particularly at this Recess time by going out to visit .the other constituencies; they should not just be seen to visit tneirown constituencies  They are appointed to those positions to representwhole country ana not their constituencies. The condition roads in this country need to be looked into seriously and, for that reason, the Minister for Transport and Communications should try and visit all areas of the country and see for his himself the conditions there. Liost of the roads in the country are in very bad shape because of the recent heavy rains. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIRWA: Thank you very much, Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this x opportunity to contribute on this Motion for the Adjournment. Many of my hon. colleagues have contributes on the issue of the multi-party system that is being advocated by some people in the country today. While I do not want to  well on that issue at length, my appeal to the leaders of this country is that a lot of talk will not solve this problem. Whatwe - need to do, as leaders of this nation, is to act respon¬sibly. By saying so I mean that we should make good examples at all times so that we do not create a situation where those advocates for the multi-party system are going to get a loophole and start criticizing us because of our preference for a singlepartySir, we know that as hon. Members of this august House, we are respected by the ordinary wananchi who also holds in  high esteem, the Parliament we have. However, the most important thing is to always look dignified in this House. We know that we are free to produce a bit of humour in the House but it is  pathetic to note that during the Session that we are going to complete today, many of the insults we saw in the House being traded amongst hon. Members did not augur well for the welfare of this nation. It good that whenever we have matters in this House, we consider them as very important sand leave all jokes aside, so that we look responsible to the rest of the countrymen.There has been a tendency of mutual distrust between hon. Members, or leaders in this country. It is better for us to come out and be straight such that when there is an important issue to be addressed to the public, we address that issue in the expected manner, instead of attacking things wildly. We know that when ones shoots wildly, he is likely to destroy a lot more than one intended to destroy. I urge leaders in this House to always be responsible so that whenever we make statements, we do so knowing .we are justified and can prove our claims.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are some issuesthat are, at times, created by the problems that arise in our variousMinistries. We know that currently we have a hitch as far as oureducational, system is concerned. We know of the old system wherewe had the. Form  leavers and now we have the 8-4-4 system ofeducation. All these students who have completed their respectivegrades are looking towards the Government w assistant  get"opportunities for  further studies, or employment opportunities.There is an issue that should be seriously considered by the Ministry of Education and given the consideration it deserves.  The Ministry of  Education should not merely give the issue apassing glance and think that the public is going to ignore it.These are the problems that we ought to solve so that we do not leave any loopholes to these people who are .proposing the formation of multi-parties, otherwise, they will come up and say, "Look at  the way the Government is operating.  Many things, I am sorry to say, are left to His Excellency the President to intervene at the last foment. When things go wrong, His Excellency "the President comes in and says, "This is the direction we are going to follow." We should remember that we have Ministers who have been charged with the responsibility of looking at the welfare of the various Ministries.I am calling upon the Ministers to be very serious and be courageous enough. We should make decisions in this House so  that the welfare of the country is taken into consideration,  We should not be seen at the fore-front of indecisiveness, but rather. we must decide whether those decisions are right or wrong. In that way we shall be seen to be doing something. This is the crux of the matter. We are just hearing of multi-party systems, but we know that if we do everything that  is in our responsibility, many of these things will not arise. As we know every system has its own graduations and therefore in everything that we do, we must he sure that we are doing the right thing. We .know that a multi-party system of Government or a one-party system of Government is meaningless to the masses of this country, it is meaningless to the common man in Chelangani, lock or in another part of this country. what is. important is the welfare: of each individual in this country and this is the crux of the matter. If every Sinister, every hon. Member and every  civil servant would put the  interest of the ordinary in this country first, then we would not have any problem in this country. The civil servants must be civil enough to make sure that this country saves every cent that they lay their harping on for the  welfare of its people. They must make sure that the right amount voted for projects is a spent on those projects and this is the only way to safeguard many of the problems we are now facing and we shall not leave any loophole to allow  our people to say, "the multi-party system of Government is better the a one-party system of Government. with those few remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech>MR. KAMUTU: Thank you very much, Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker for giving me this opportunity to join my colleagues in supporting this Motion for theAdjournment of the House. I said would first of all, like to take this, opportunityto thank His Excellency the President for what, he did recently in Dagoretti.- Hon.	Members must have read in the newspapers how his Excellency assisteda sick woman lying on the roadside. It was as the President was passing along the road that he saw this very sick women and he stopped his motorcade and used one of his  own security cars to drive this lady to the hospital. This was a very great act of mercy and it clearly job shows how humane our President is; it shows how our President cares about the welfare of everybody in this country. Had the President not stopped to pick up this poor lady from the roadside, and take her to hospital, I have no doubt that  die would have died because he had waited at the roadside far five hours. I have been told that not less than 17ivehicles passed to the  lady without shopping. However, the President stopped and picked up this poor lady and took her to kx hospital.This action tells all about President tells us what kind  of a Presidentwe have in this country; it tell us that we have a President who loves the peopleof this country.  Therefore, on behalf of all the Eagoretti people, Iwould like to thank the President most dearly for this very humane action. Iwould like to take this opportunity to assure the President  that Sagoretti peoplesupport him fully and that they  are intending to take their personal thanks to him in .the very near future.Having said tha£, I would .Inow like to say..  something about the multi¬party xs system of Government.  Today, if any human being insults his mother or father, he is ocursed by God. Is we know the Kanu Party is over mother and father and therefore, anybody who insults Zanu stands to be ccursed. He do not have another party in this country apart from - kanu and we must all support it.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, as we go into recess, I would like to urge the Ministry of Health to  examine the plight of AIDS in this country. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we cannot afford to turn our backs and say that we do not have AIDS in Kenya because it is there. It is a killer disease and it is a pity that, as much as the Minister for Health himself is working hard organising his Ministry very well, there are some doctors who are letting down the whole Ministry. Some, doctors are sending AID patients home because, presumably, they are saying that some of the hospitals are overcrowded. This is very serious because this terrible disease can escalate, and that can be very serious for the country. I propose that a re-examination be done in this regard so that AID rehabilitation centres could be set up in urban areas so that AID patients in this country, at least, as they spend their last days in life, they can be looked after properly. More importantthan that, they should also be taken away from the society so thatthe escalation or spread of this deadly diseases can be curtailed or minimized. This is not because we hate them, but it "is because we have to fight against the escalation of this Therefore, I propose that not only for Nairobi alone, but also for all urban centres in the country. This is extremely very important.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAITG'OLI: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this very important Motion.This Motion calls upon us, as leaders, and as we go to recess,  to be responsible leaders of this nation. We advocate nothing but one-party system. This is what we stand for and also common mwananchi.While appreciating the good work done by some of our Ministers, some of from the Bank-bench sometimes feel cheated or horrified when some Ministers stand up in this House and say or allege sthat there are some people? who are doing this and that and hedoes not name them. A responsible Minister, says or alleges in this House that there are some people who are "touching" the President, but they are not capable or even ready to tell us who .those people are Then the. country is put into disarray. Why talk about some people, if you are not prepared to name them? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MUTESTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr .Chesire ): On a point of order "Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The hon. Member is using a word "cheated". He. says that we are being cheated in this House. First of all,, that is unparliamentary" language, and secondly, can he substantiate what he really means by saying that "we are being cheated in this House by Front Benchers"?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not what is "burning" the hon. Assistant Minister. I am saying what happens here, and the point is that hon. Nassir said here "what I. have said. But if the hon. Member was here, then he should keep quiet, and let me continue with my contribution.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I appreciate that we area one—party state. We advocate, for it and the common mwananchi alsosupports a one-party: state. That is loud and clear that we want a one-party state. But when a Minister stands here and says "When we were here...", as if he wants to be little the role played by the Vice-President -and Minister for Finance, advocating for a one party, system, even he appeared on V.o.K., implying that he did not defend the one-party state and I heard him very well, and when I say that  an hon. Member wants me to substantiate his when it has been said here, several times. I wonder what they want me to do.  The teething problem now is what will happen to those f Form Six qualifiers who will not enter university and who have no other chance in future. The Ministry should tell us where these chaps will go.	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, although the 8-4.-4 system of education is succeeding, I said here that the number of its-Form Four leavers would be very big. I remember very well the Minister told me that 38,000 candidates would be admitted into our universities, but now only 16,000 applicants will be admitted and we are worried about where  2,000 applicants will As hon. Members of this House we are also saying that the medical fees should be abolished. This is because most ordinary wananchi  I am not referring to	people likeMang'oli, KLbaki.or ELliku - the Shs.20/- being charged; 3d they are no longer going for treatment  when, onehas headache he just prays God and hopes that it will disappear.'	The Minister should, therefore  be brave  enough and accept that this medical fees should be abolished.We are happy that cost-sharing through the Harambeemovement is a success: we. have built schools and dispensariesthrough this movement and a so we should continue. providingother facilities in the same manner.In Webuye we have a planned dispensary and I want itsconstruction to start." Last year it had been provided for out I donot know what happened to the money. We also have manydevelopment projects that have not been implemented.' Ministriesshould find out how many Motions we have passed so that they canimplement them during our recessWith those few remarks, I beg to support." </Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ANDINTERNATIONAL COOPERATION (Mr. Munyi): Thank you very much, Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to say something about this very important Motion. I would like to try and enlighten our detractors. They should look at countries like Mozambique and Angola which have political problems We should know that enemies of unity in Africa would like Africa to have many political parties so that they can infiltrate them. Unity under a one-party system makes it difficult for enemies to infiltrate. It is hard to see how Angola operates with somebody like Savimbi operating in the same country with his own party. It is through the two parties in Angola that enemies are agitating for this and that in that" country. This is why I insist on. us maintaining unity under a one-party system; many wananchi should thus enrol as Eanu members This will unify the whole of our country and form a "fortress" for us. This House scaas is an example of unity; even those who are criticizing this Parliament should know that we cannot allow enemies to interfere with our unity. Since we are all united, we cannot allow any enemy to destroy our country. Each one of us is committed to the protection of our country because. His Excellency the President has shown us the way. He has given us examples and he has demonst¬rated to the whole world that he is a great leader. His Excellency the President loves everybody and he does not like squabbles. He does not want anybodyto be mistreated.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is only yesterday that His Excel¬lency the President said no to those local authorities that had proposed to increase their house rents and rates. That indicates how he is mindful of the	welfare of his people. The unity we are enjoying should continue so thatwe can become a good example to our neighbours.Having said that, Sir, I would like to appeal to the Minister for Public Works to look into the situation of our roads. In many parts of Kenya, including Nairobi and elsewhere, roads are in a terrible condition. I want to appeal to the Minister concerned with roads to ensure that those provinces which were not considered for graders and other machinery that came from Japan recently and give them the service they deserve. He can even talk to the World Bank to ensure that roads in all provinces are repaired. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THe Assistant Minister for Lands Housing $ physical Planning(M.Bomet):		,Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda. Ninakushukuru kwa kunipa nafasi hii ili nami niweke sauti ya watu wa Rongai katika Hoja hii.Wakati huu, sisi Wakenya tulio na akili timamu tunajua tunaenda wapi. Tunajua hivyo kwa sababu hatukufuata maongozi" yoyote ya mtu. Watu wengine walisema watafuata maongozi ya kijamamaa na mengineyo, lakini Kenya, ikiongozwa na Hayati Mzee Kenyatta, ilikata shauri kwamba tutafuata African socialism. Tulizungumza hapa kutoka -1963 hadi 1966, kila wakati tukipanga njia tutakayofuata. Tulikata shauri kamili kwamba tutakuwa na chama cha Kanu, na vyama vile vingine vya kisiasa vikavunjwa. Kwa hivyo, mtu kutuuliza tutafuata njia gani baada ya miaka 26 ya (Jhuru ni kama kuambia mzee arudie siku zake za utotoni akue tena na aoe bibi. Ninashangaa kwa sababu wale wanaozungumza jambo lax kuwa na vyama vingi vya kisiasa ni watu wa makanisa. Je, ikiwa Bibilia inasema kwamba Kaisali apatiwe kile chake na serikali ipatiwe kile chake, ni kwa nini watu wa makanisa wanaingilia siasa. Kazi yao iko katika makanisa. Hivi majuzi tuliona watu wengine waliokuwa wakisema kwamba Jesu ni coninan. Ni kwa nini watu-hao-waliposema kwamba-Yesu ni conman,maaskofu, mapdre-na waumini wengine hawakuwajibu watu hao walioliharibu jina la Yesu. Ni. kwa nini wanaingilia siasa sasa? Kama watu waliochaguliwa na wananchi, tunasema kwamba Kanu inatosha kuiongoza nchi hii. Viongozi hawa wa Kanisa wanasema pia kwamba watu wa Ulaya ya mashariki wamebadilika, lakini walibadilika kwa sababu walikosa nia. Sisi hatujakcsa njia, na tunajua mahali tulipo.Katika Kenya, hatujawahi kuona watu wetu wakifa njaa wala wakipigana wenyewe kwa wenyewe. Watu wengine, kama Wazaire, wanasema tuwe na mwongozo wa kisiasa'wa vyama vingi, lakini tangu watu wa Zaire wajitawale, hawakuwa na chama kmoja tangu walipojitawala. Sisi tunasimama pamoja chini ya Kanu. Watu wote wa Rongai na Nakuru nzima tunakifuata Chama chetu, Kanu. Ikiwa kuna wengine wetu wanaobabaika, hii ni shauri yao. Ningependa kusema kwamba kama kungekuwa na njia ya kufanya majaribu, hata ikiwa ni kwa miezi miwili tu, ili ionekana kama watu wetu watavikubali vyama viwili vya kisiasa, wale ambao wangeanzisha majaribu haya wangebaki peke yao, huku watu wa Kenya wote wakijiunga na Kanu na Rais Moi bila tashwishi yo yote hata kidogo.	- ;Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ningependa kumaliza mazungumzo yangu kwa kusema kwamba.habari hii ya kuibiwa kwa pesa zaumma ni jambo la hatari sana na la aibu kubwa. Kila mara sisi huambiwa kwamba pesa hizi za umaa zitachungwa zaidi mwaka ufuatao, lakini zinaendelea kutumiwa vibaya mwaka baada ya mwaka, na hii ni hatari. Mtu akitumia vibaya pesa za Serikali, anafaa kufungwa jela, kisha mali yake iuzwe ili mali ya umma aliyotumia vibaya irudishwe. Watu hawa waalifu wameizoea tabia hii mbaya kwa kuwa wanajua kwamba hata wakitumia pesa za umma vibaya, hakuna ye yote atakayewafuata. Ninawaonya wafanyakazi wa Serikali wajue kwamba ikiwa kutakuwa na mzozo katika nchi hii, damu ya watu wa nchi hii itawachafua wao wenyewe wala siyo sisi tulio katika bunge hili kwa sababu sisi tulio hapa hatuna pesa taslimu tunazogawana hapa, bali tunazungumza tu hala!fu wao wenyewe wanapokea pesa taslimu ambazo wanatumia vibaya. Hii ni hatari kubwa ambayo ni lazima iangaliweNaunga mkono. </Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. In view of the importance of this Motion and the fact that there are many hon Members who would like to contribute to it, I beg to move that we extend our sitting time up to 7.00 o'clock this evening.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): I sympathize with the sentiments expressed by the hon. Member, but, looking at the Motion before us, you find that our hands are very much tied. The Order Paper says that debate on this Motion is limited to a maximum of two hours, and there is no way we can bend this provision, as this would be very difficult.Your may proceed, Mr. MMaitsi.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. M'Maitsi): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this Motion on Adjournment. First of all, I would like to express my thanks and congratulations to His Excellency the President on taking care of the interests of the youth, who form close to 80 per cent of our community. His Excellency the President has helped a lot by giving a directive recently that shs.150 million be set aside to assist the youths who are coming out of school to start projects of their own which will then enable them to start their own businesses.I would like to touch on the Party issue.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have heard a lot of talk about multi-party systems. But I wonder why it is becoming something very gross whereas it is only four people in the whole of Kenya who are advocating for such a change. I do not believe that 24 million Kenyans can be moved by the wishes of only four people. These wishes are not for the betterment of Kenya they are not going to benefit Kenyans. IS main concern here is that out of these changes these people are advocating for, we shall have 80 per cent of the population being affected adversely when they have not mentioned anything to do with multi-parties.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that if a father in the church goes against the regulations of the. church the bishop will take very stem action against him. When Kanu which is the father and mother of this nation took action against! a former colleague of ours here one of the clerics came out and said that that former colleague was speaking for the people. we have a responsibility. When we are appointed Government Ministers, we sign a letter of appointment. In that letter of appointment we have instructions and we sign and agree to follow those instructions. If you are not willing to follow those instructions, like a former colleague of oursIf you are not willing to be respons¬ible to His Excellency the President, the Government and to the people of Kenya, then are free not to sign that document. So, since our former colleague did not wish to follow the instructions contained in that document, I do not see why one of clergymen had to mention that.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, you will find that a few people have decided to become prodigal sons and daughters of this nation. We should forgive then and help then to see what His Excellency the President is trying to do for this nation. This is because what he is doing for this nation is for the good of the majority of the people of this nation. We stand here for the majority, of the people. Being a one-party democracy. we are here to talk for the majority of the people. What His Excellency the President is doing is what people of this country want. I believe that all of us in this House want to work for the good of our people. We are responsible for them and we should stand firm and help.His Excellency the President to educate wananchi regarding the policie; of the party and Government. We should explain to them what the Government is doing for them instead of wasting a lot of time running after people who do not know where they are going g to or coming from.I also believe that no child can shout at anyone without the support of his father. These people who have been advocating for these changes must be having "fathers" outside this country. We in Kenya have only one father and that is His Excellency the President. Where are those other "fathers" and who are they? If these people want to preach to us about the wishes of those "fathers" they should get out of this country and go to live under the roofs of those "fathers" of theirs and not under the roof of President Moi.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like to ask Government officers all over the country to try and show wanachi what the priorities of their areas are. They should advise the people well.With those remarks, I beg to support.(Question put and agreed to)<Header>ADJ0URNMENT</Header><Newspeech>THE Temporary DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Hon.

NIZAI asked the Minister for Labour what the total contribution of Mr. Hwadzidze Kiti Ngala, N.S.S.F No.OO3-674-O96, is, and how much he has been paid.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr.Amin): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Rational Social Security Fund, has not received any contributions in respect of Mr. Kiti Ngala, N.S.S.F. N0.OO3-674-O96. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. NDZAi: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant Minister's answer that the N.S.S.F has not received any contributions in respect of Mr. Kiti Igala, could he tell this House why Mr.Nagala was given an N.S.S.F Number in the first place. I understand that once a person is issued with an N.S.S.F. Number, he automatically becomes a member of the Fund and consequently his contributions axe remitted to the Fund by the employer. What is the point in issuing a person with the N.S.S.F. Number in the first place,if no contributions are remitted to the Fund by the employer?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as far as I understand, the employer requests the N.S.S.F. to issue his employee with a number and after the number has been issued, the employer then continues to remit the contributions in respect of the employee to the N.S.S.F. However, in this particular case, the employer has not remitted the contributions in respect of this employee to the N.S.S.F.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr.. NDZAl: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mr. Kiti Ngala was an employee of the Ministry of Health until his time of retirement. It is surprising to hear the Assistant Minister telling the louse that no contributions in respect of Mr. Ngala were remitted to the Fund. Could he tell the louse what step he has taken to follow up this matter with the Ministry of Health with a view to finding out why the Ministry did not remit these contributions?</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. AMUIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Six, my Ministry has written to the Ministry of Health asking them to give us details of the cheque they submitted in respect of their various employees who are members of the N.S.S.F and as soon as we receive these details, we shall be able to ascertain whether or not Mr. Ngala's contri¬butions were remitted in which case, we shall pay if they were actually remitted</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASIKE-NDOMBI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the N.S.S.F. has a whole range of inspectors. Secondly, the Fund has a provision for penalty for the employers who fail to submit contributions in respect of their employees; I think it is 5 per cent per day. Once an employee has been issued with a number, like it was the case with Mr. Kiti Igala, he automatically becomes a member of the Fund. Could the Assistant Minister tell this louse what x practical steps the Ministry has taken by my of sending inspectors to the Ministry of Health to follow up this matter?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, as I said earlier on, we have sent a number of letters to the employer asking them to submit details of contributions  in respect of the various employees but we have not yet received this infor¬mation. If they delay in sending us this information, obriously, my Ministry is going to take the necessary action.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

What we are now intending to do is to send them/reminder and if they do not respond, we shall definitely take the necessary action.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NDZAI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant Minister's reply that sometimes an employer may writes one cheque in respect of contributions from his various employees who are members of the Fund, can he tell us how he would be able to determine the contributions of this employee just by getting the number of that cheque?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I have said that we have written and if they do not pay in time again, obviously the Ministry will take action.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, employers are required to pay within 15 days all the contributions to the N.S.S.F. Now if this man cannot be paid because the contribution have not been received by the Ministry, it is for the Ministry to go and make arrangement for the employer to submit the contributions.  Will the Assistant Minister take action now and ask the employer to submit the contributions immediately so that this man can be paid?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR.

Sir. we shall go into it and see that the officers do the job. and not just sit in offices. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr.Kiliku: Mr. deputy speaker sir what is so technical thew minister tell us what is the problem here?the Minister tell us what is the problem here? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. OKWANYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. the hon. member  oughtto know what a feasibility study of a project is It involves costs:and many either factors. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. WAMBUA: Mr. Deputy speaker Sir. could the Minister us how long does the feasibility study will take because this tobe quite a long period from the tine this work  was promised? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr.OKWANYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it all depends onwhat the study is all about. It can take many months or a fewmonths, if it is only a small little study. .But in a study like this one, you need to take a bit of time.MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. could the Minister tell  us how much approximately will these feasibility studies cost the Government? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr.OKWANYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. we shall know at the end of it. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Would the Minister tell this House when that programme will actually start. Will it start this during financial year, or next financial year?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKWANYO: I cannot give the exact year or when that programme shall be started because I do not know how long the feasibility studies shall take, but it may start during this Financial Year.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASIKE-NDOMBI: The Minister has said thatfeasibility studies shall take place, and I think he has initiatedsteps towards that goal. Some Budget will soon be read I can the Minister, therefore, assure this House that the project shall be included in the next Budget; so that hon. Mwamzandi can pass that information  his constituents, <Newspeech>MR. OKWANYO: I cannot promise that the project shall be included in the next Budget because I So not know the results of the feasibility studies yet.      <Newspeech>MR. WASIKE-NDOHBI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker,Sir. I think the Minister is misleading this House. He has already told the House that the feasibility studies will take place. Now he is telling us that he cannot assure this House that the project shall be included in the next Budget. Is he not misleading this House and taking us for a ride?</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>MR. OKWANYO: I anticipate the feasibility studies to be completed by the end of this Financial Year, but I cannot assure this House that it will be included in the next Budget because we do know the costs involved yet.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: The Minister seems not to understand what the hon. Members are asking him. This Question was first asked sometimes last year, and at that time he told the House that feasibility studies were being done. The hon. Member has now asked him how long the feasibility studies shall take, and the Minister has told us that will depend on a many other things Why can the hon. Minister be specific and tell us the exact period that the feasibility studies shall take.I hope he has not engaged experts from abroad. He should make use of local experts to carry out the feasibility studies at Msambweni. Why should those feasibility studies take so long?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKWANYO: Sir, as soon as the feasibility studies are over, we shall not keep them in our safe. We shall implement as the project soon as possible, and that is why I am asking the hon. Members to be patient until we complete those studies. I do not know exactly when the studies were started. I would like to promise this House that we shall speed up those studies, shall ask the people doing those feasibility studies to speed them up.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Minister, did you say that you do not know tha cost of the feasibility studies?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKWANYO: I said that we cannot know cost of the project until it is completed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Kiliku's Question!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Sir, would I be in order to ask a supplementary question on hon. Mwamzandits Question, before asking my Question?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Okay, go ahead.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Sir, how can the Minister start carrying out feasibility studies without any estimates. The Minister should know the estimates of the feasibility studies. We are already working the 1988/92 development plan, therefore, unless he has not done his homework properly, he should of all the feasibility studies in his Ministry. I think the Minister should give us the estimates of that feasibility studies so that we can study it.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. OKWANYO: Estimates are different from the actual costs of the feasibility studies. Those are two different things".</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Okay, let us go on to Mr. Kilikus</Newspeech>Question.Question No.183Protection of Small-scale FishermenMR. KILIKU asked the Minister for Regional Development what plans he has to protect the small-scale fishermen in Mombasa District from stiff competition they are facing from the non-indigenous fishermen who use deep sea vessels for fishing.<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is there anybody from the Ministry of Regional Development? We shall leave that Question until the end then.Let go on to Question No.198.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir I am sorry Sir, I thought you were moving on to Questions by Private Notice before you repeat Question No. 171.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, we have not yet completed Oral Answers to Questions. Can we move on to Mr. Kubo's Question.</Newspeech>Question No.198Measures to Alleviate Wheat Flour Shortage       MR. KUBO asked the Minister for Supplies and Marketing that in order to minimise the shortage of wheat flour in Taveta and the whole country in general, would he in consultation with the Price Controller adjust profit margins to the wholesellers and retailers in order to enable them to stock enough quantity of the commodity for the consumers.      <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is there anybody from the Ministry of Supplies and Marketing?        Can we now go back to Mr. Nuno's Question</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR. NUNO: Mr. "Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to apologise for coming in late.</Newspeech>Question No.171Assistant Chief for Damajaley LocationMR. NUNO asked the Minister of State, Office of the President what steps he is taking to appoint an Assitant Chief for Damajaley Location in Liboi Division.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Keen): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The post has already been advertised and short listing has also been done. The interviews shall be done in May, and therefore, an Assistant chief shall be appointed to that post to serve that sub-location.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASIKE-NDOMBI: Sir, it takes the Government very many years to fill the post of an assistant chief or chief.  Would the Assistant Minister from now onwards make sure that when those posts fall vacant, they are filled as soon as possible?MR. KEEM: Sir, my. Ministry will try its best to fill vacant posts as soon as it is practicable.<Newspeech>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: What is the Assistant Minister doing 	so that such posts can be given to educated people who can read and write, and who can also understand our national goals.Is the Assistant Minister trying to move from the traditional method of appointing assistant chiefs and chiefs who were illiterate</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KEEN: While appreciating the suggestion by the hon. Member, I would like to inform him that my Ministry, has from time to time taken the educational background of any appointee into serious consideration. But above all, we consider the appointees qualities of leadership, integrity, and their high performances.We consider all those factors as a criteria of appointing chiefs and assistant chiefs.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAHKANU: Arising from the reply by the Assistant Minister and hon. Wasike-Ndombis observations, is it not becoming a trend in the Office of the President - particularly with regard to the officers in the field that they only respond to issues after they have raised here in Parliament. Recently, I raised a Question on one location in Bungoma District - Kibagi Location. That is a Location but it has only one assistant chief and one chief, althought is heavily populated. I would like to request the Assistant Minister to ask his field officers to be more responsible.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is your supplementary question? Are you giving some advice?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: My question is this Does the Assistant Minister agree with me that his officers in the field are not responsible enough? They only respond to issues after they have been raised here in Parliament.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEEN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, having been a district commissioner," the hon. Member should know better. My officers throughout the Republic are fairly sensitive to the demand and population density in the various locations and sub-locations. Therefore, we have not overlooked these issues when considering the appointment of chiefs and assistant chiefs.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Very well. We must move on now. Mr. Kipkorir, can you ask your Question for the second time?</Newspeech>Question NO. 187Joint Loans Board Loanees in Elgeyo/MarakwetMR. KUBO, on behalf of Mr. Kipkorir, asked the Mini¬ster for Commerce how many people from Kerio East Cons¬tituency have been granted loans by the District Joint Loans Board, Elgeyo/Marakwet, during the last five years.     <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE (Mr. Karingi): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.    The people from Kerio East Constituency who have been granted loans by the Elgeyo/Marakwet District Joint Loans Board during the last five years are only 11.</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR. ARTE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister tell the House how much money was available to the Elgeyo/Marakwet District Joint Loans Board for disbursement during those five years in question?</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>MR. KARINGI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I can only give a breakdown of the amounts involved. In the year 1984 an amount of KShs.18,000/- was given out by the board as loans. There were no applications for loans received during 1985. During the year 1986 we gave out KShs.20,000/-.</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>MR. ARTE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I have asked a specific question as to how much money was available to the district joint loans board during the five years in question and the Assistant Minister is giving us the figures that were given out each year. Can he answer the specific question I have asked?the five years in question was KShs.924,000/-</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>MR. LEWA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister tell us how many loan applications were received by the board during those five years and how the 11 applicants were considered successful?</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>MR. KARINGI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in 1984 there were only four applicants, and all of them were granted loans. During the year 1985 there were no applications received. We do not have the records pertaining to the year 1986, but the information I have here indicates that three applications were approved. We had a total of 15 applications during.the year 1988, out of which only six were approved.</Newspeech>     <Newspeech>MR. ARTE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister tell us how much money, out of the KShs•924,000/— allocated for the five years in question is still awaiting disbursement? What is the balance?</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>MR. KARINGI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, joint loans fund is a revolving fund and, therefore, it is not possible for me to be specific at the moment to say how much money is still remaining and awaiting disbursement.</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>MR. ARTE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. We do not understand what the Assistant Minister means by saying the joint loans fund is a revolving fund. In any case, they must have the balance indicated in their books. Can he tell us what balance is remaining because we want to know whether the money was given to the right people?</Newspeech>      <Newspeech>MR. KARINGI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have explained very clearly the- number of applications we received during the five years and how muchmoney was dished out. I do not think that the question of the balance of the money is important so long as no applications have been received for it to be utilised.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAMUYU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has just told us that only 11 application forms were approved, but he could not tell us how many applications were received in 1986. That shows that his records are not available. Can he tell us why those records are not available?</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. KARINGI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, although. I said that we did not have records for the year 1986, I did:say that during the year in question we approved three loan applications. It is quite possible that those were the only applications received during the year.</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR. KAMUYU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I asked a specific question as to why records of such importance should go missing, and it appears that the Assistant Minister is; not addressing himself to the facts. Can he answer my question?</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>MR. KARINGI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not agree with the hon. Member that what he* has asked now is what he had asked before. However, I would like to inform him that it is quite normal for documents to miss. If he wants us to go looking for the 1986 records, we will do our best to make them available.</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>MR. P.G. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister tell us what efforts the Ministry is making to find out why there were so few appli¬cations during the five years?</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>MR. KARINGI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the district joint loans board operates on district basis. It is not up to the Ministry of Commerce to go round inviting applicants to come for the money. Those who are aware of the existence of the facility and we have our district development officers are welcome to borrow the money. It is not the onus of the Ministry to go round soliciting for people to come forward and borrow the money.</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR. P.G. GODANA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I do not think the Assistant Minister is in order to say that it is not his Ministry's work to create the awareness of the facility. I thought that the fund was there to serve the wananchi and, therefore, it is the duty of the Ministry to create awareness amongst wananchi.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARINGI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, creating awareness is not the same as going round inviting people to come for loans. The purpose of having distric development officers in every district is to ensure that all enquiries relating to these matters are answered, and that includes ways of finding funds to assist small traders. I am sure that our officers in the field have created that awarenessand it is up to individual businessmen to come forward and avail themselves of the opportunity.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIILU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister tell us how one qualifies to get this loan?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARINGI: Well, one must be a businessman.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIILU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. What I asked is whether the Assistant Minister could tell us how one qualifies to get these loans. What explains the boards refusal to approve some applications and accept others?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARINGI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is not free money; it is money that has to be paid back. We have a way of vetting the applicants. For one to qualify for these loans, he must meet the conditions laid down in the application forms.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in view of the fact that the people in this area seem not to be using this money adequately, could the Assistant Minister.think of cutting off this allocation and taking it to other parts of the country where it can be fully used? In his answer, the Assistant Minister said that there are people there who have not applied for this money' although they are aware that they can do so.</Newspeech>     <Newspeech>MR. KARINGI: I am sure, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that since this fact has been noted, it will be well taken care off and, perhaps, some of this money may be given, to Turkana.</Newspeech>Question No. 179Rehabilitation of Malke Daka Irrigation SchemeMR. NUNO, on behalf of Mr. Jaldessa, asked the Minister for Agriculture what plans he has to rehabilitate Malke Daka Irrigation Scheme, in Isiolo District.<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY (Mr. Otieno): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture, I beg to reply.    Plans are underway to rehabilitate Malke Daka Irrigation Scheme, and funds have been set aside in the next financial year for this purpose.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from the Minister's reply, could he be kind enough to tell us how much money has been allocated for this purpose?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OTIENO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the forward Budget, we have a total of £120,000 for this project.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.G. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Minister tell us what specific work this money is supposed to be used on and when exactly the project is supposed to begin?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OTIENO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Malke Daka Irrigation Scheme and other similar schemes were developed through the use of heavy machinery with irrgation water supplied through pumping, which proved to be a very expensive undertaking for the Government of Kenya. Hence, the Minister of Agriculture was requested to review the mode of implementation of the schemes. In view of this, a review mission was set up to look into the sustainability of the schemes, taking into consideration the following issues: an alternative system of irrigation, water supply to the schemes, provision of finances, technical expertise, plans and other inputs. The review mission recommended that Malke Daka and other two schemes, Merti and Galfaza (??) should be gravity-fed. Funds are available for the rehabilitation of Malke Daka Irrigation Scheme, and the Government has earmarked the amount of money. I have stated for this purpose.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. P.G. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister has still not told us when this rehabilitation is going to start.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OTIENO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sorry I cannot give the exact date, but, for all I know, money for this work has already been set aside, the project report, is ready and the necessary designs are also ready. So, work should start any time now.</Newspeech>Question No. 183 Protection of Small-Scale FishermenMR. KILIKU asked the Minister for Regional Development what plans he has to protect the small- scale fishermen in Mombasa District from the stiff competition they are facing from non-indigenous fishermen who use deep-sea vessels for fishing.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Okwara):Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to apologise to the House and my friend, hon.Kiliku.\I beg to reply.The new Fisheries Act, 1989, empowers me, as the Minister responsiblefor fisheries, to restrict areas of operation</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. ogur): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Hon. Okwara just said that he apologises to the House without elaboration. It was difficult for him to say that he was apologising for coming late. Could he say this now?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Indeed, I remember coming across the same problem last week with another hon. Member. You have to assign a reason to everything that you say, Mr. Okwara. It is not sufficient to say that you apologise even if the reason for it looks obvious.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Okwara): Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Once more, I apologise to the House and to hon. Kiliku. I wish to state that I got to the office late and found my officers still sorting out one or two things.</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Mutiso): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Let me inform the hon. Member through you that he was out of order to keep on standing when you were giving your ruling. So, he should acquaint himself with the Standing Orders of the House.</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: You are overruled, Mr. Karauri. Proceed, Mr. Okwara.</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Okwara):  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I was saying, the Fisheries Act of 1989 empowers me, as the Minister responsible for fisheries, to restrict areas of operation of any fishing vessels within our waters. In this respect, my Ministry issues licences to fishing vessels of all sizes. I have, therefore, directed that all vessels operated by non-indibenous fishermen be restricted to deep waters and beyond the territorial waters of 12"miles from the shore. Foreign fishing vessels will be subjected to the provision of the 200-mile exclusive economic zone as stipulated in the Law of the Sea Convention. In this way, foreign fishermen will not readily interfere with local fishermen in Mombasa District.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has given us a very short reply, contrary to the written answer. What I have here is a different reply from the one he has given. Could he tell me what reply he has given because it is different from the reply I have which he signed.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. OKWARA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I hope that hon. Kiliku got the answer he wanted. If the answer I have given is irrelevant and he did notunderstand it, he should say so. However, this is the original reply to this Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister give the complete reply? He has only read out a part of it two paragraphs and left out the third and fourth paragraphs.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKWARA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not have to read out the whole reply, and I am sure that hon. Kiliku is satisfied with the answer I have given. If he is not, then I will read out the other part of the reply.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAMUYU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. When a Question is put in this House, it ceases to belong to the hon. Questioner and becomes the property of the House. Therefore, is the Assistant Minister in order to read out only a half of the answer to this Question. Can he read, out the full answer for the benefit of this House because we do not have a copy of the written reply, like hon. Kiliku does?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKWARA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, when a Question isasked in this House the most important point is whether that Question¬ is answered properly and I think I did answer this Question properly. But if the hon. Member is interested in the last part of the written reply, I am ready to read it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASIKE-NDOMBI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. According to our Standing Orders if a written reply is handed over to the Questioner, then the Minister has got to read that reply in full to the House. If a reply is not written then the Minister is entitled to give a short reply and then hon. Members will ask supplementary questions. But in this case a full written reply has been handed over to hon. Kiliku. Could the Assistant Minister, instead of just sitting down, read the remaining portion of that written reply?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.OKWARA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, reading a reply is one thing but making hon. Members understand that reply is another thing. I have asked hon. Kiliku to tell me whether he has understood my reply. But if he just wants me to read the written reply, then that is not a problem. I will just do it. So, in order to make my friend, hon. Kiliku, feel happy this morning</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. A.K. KINYANJUI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for the Assistant Minister to say that he is reading the answer to make hon. Kiliku happy? The Question is now the property of this House and the Assistant Minister is giving his reply to the House and not to hon. Kiliku alone. <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Could hon. Okwara take the House a little bit more seriously?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKWARA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Question was What plans does the Minister have to protect the small fishermen in Mombasa District"</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to read the Question on the Order Paper instead of answering it fully?</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: He does not know the Standing Orders!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKWARA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not think the issue of knowing Standing Orders does not arise here.However, my Ministry has developed small size fishing boats which are appropriate for use within the in shore areas. These boats are being built in our own Boat Yard and they will be sold to fishermen at fairly reasonable prices they can afford. We are doing everything possible to assist the small scale fishermen to generate income and raise their standards of living and that of their families.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Assistant Minister for that good reply.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I seek the guidance of the Chair because this House needs to be properly guided. When a Question is fowarded to a Ministry, the Minister responsible comes to answer that Question in this House. Is it necessary for the Minister to read the answer or just reply? If the hon. Questioner, who has been supplied with a written reply, is not satisfied with the reply, he can ask supplementary questions. I seek your guidance here, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, because this kind of think could create a lot of problems in this House. Could stand and reply to a Question without having to read the written reply. Do I have to read the answer? Is there any Standing Order requiring a Minister to read the answer? Is it not enough just to answer the Question?</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Karauri should have known that you used Standing Order No.l to make your ruling.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Is it logical?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! I will not allow hon. Members to communicate directly to each other without address¬ing the Chair. But it does appear to the Chair that the portion of the written reply read by hon. Okwara is very useful indeed from the point of view of the hon. Questioner.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Kbaki): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. We are not being-fussy. But hon. Wasike-Ndombi said	that "according to our Standing Orders"	Since he said that it was "according" to our Standing Orders it is important that we should make it clear that there is no such a Standing Order. This is because according to the Standing Orders we know these are Oral Questions and if by the courtesy of the Minister and the Clerk of the National Assembly, the hon. Questioner is given a copy of a written reply, the Minister is not forced to actually supply that written reply. He can come here and answer orally. But if a written reply is demanded then it is written, and given to the hon. Member as a written reply. Since hon. Wasike-Ndombi said that it is "according to our Standing Orders" it is important that we know that there is no such a Standing Order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASIKE-NDOMBI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Kibaki has been in this House since its inception and I remember that I am one of the people who went to Kampala to request him to come and become the Executive Officer of Eanu. I was referring to Standing Order No.39. This particular Standing Order reads as followers"If a Member indicates that he desires a written answer to his Question, six copies of the answer shall delivered to the Clerk within 14 days after the day on which it was forwarded to the Minister and the Clerk shall cause it to be circulated in the Official Report of the House" The copies have been circulated</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: What is wrong with that one?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WASIKE-NDOMBI: So, if copies have been circulated and in order for that answer to into the HANSARD, the Minister standing to answer should read a complete written answer.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: We must move on. There are certain matters that fall within the province of what the Chair considers for the convenience of the House. At the time it did appear to the Chair that it was appropriate to get to hear what hon. Okwara had in paragraphs three and four as specifically	requested by hon. Kiliku. However, the little dialogue now between hon. Kibaki and hon. Wasike-Ndombi on whether or not Standing Order are explicit in this regard, is really a very straight foward matter because the Standing Order you have jus read, Mr. Wasike-Ndombi, does not cover that particular aspect. But in the light of what hon. Kiliku has said regarding Standing Order No.l, the Chair can specifically request that a Member of the Front Bench reads the answer if it deemed to be in the best interests of this House.<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Kibaki) : On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The hon. Member is referring to Standing Order No.39 which refers to questions other than these Questions appearing on the Order Paper. All the Questions appearing on the Order have not been requested for written replies. These are Oral Questions Questions requiring written replies are replied and the replies are sent to the hon. Questioners. The Ministers do respond to these requests from hon, Members. So, these Questions on the Order Paper do not require written replies. I just wanted to clarify this point otherwise in future written replies are going to demanded for these Questions whereas these Questions require oral answers</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. WASIKE-NDOMBI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Six. It is a serious matter when a statement like that one comes from a very senior Cabinet Ministers Can the Minister, for Health tell us under which Standing Order we receive these written answers?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I do not propose to open a discussion or some debate on this particular issue because I do not think it is pertinent at this point.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker , Sir, in his good reply, the Assistant Minister said that boats are being built in their boat-yard and will be sold to the fishermen at a fairly good price. Could he tell us the price of each boat and when they are going to be completed?</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. OKWARA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, since these boats are not yet built immediately they are completed we shall inform the House their prices.</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR. KUBO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the Assistant Minister's concern on this issue, could he assure the House that the boats being built are going to be affordable to the fishermen? This is because the boats might end up being too expensive to the fishermen which will defeat the goals of the Ministry of equipping these fishermen with boats.</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR. OKWARA: Yes, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, since these boats might be too expensive to the fishermen, could they arrange to sell them to the fishermen after they have paid a downward payment? That is, after this downward payment the fishermen should be allowed to pay the balance in instalments. If they demand cash on delivery the fishermen might not afford to buy these boats.</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR. OKWARA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I ask hon. Kiliku to be patient until we have built the boats</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR. KAMUYU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell us the various proposed prices and sizes of these boats?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKWARA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we shall have medium, large and huge boats, which the hon. member can afford</Newspeech> (laughter)<Newspeech>MR. KAMUYU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the Assistant Minister is joking. He should not do that because we are here talking about serious matters which concern the welfare of the Coast Province people which is being threatened by the deep fishing fishermen. The people have to be protected by this House and the Government. After all, that is what this House and the Government are for. Could he tell us the various proposed prices and sizes of these boats that they are building?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKWARA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if hon. Kamuyu has been involved in manufacturing he should know that there is no way you can price goods before the work is completed. He should be aware of this. As I have,assured" the House, the prices will be fairly reasonable for the fishermen to afford these boats.</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR. KAMUYU: On a point of .order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is deliberately or through lack of knowledge refusing to answer my question. My question is very important because the fishermen have to start preparing their budgets early in order to have enough money to buy these boats. So it is important that they are told the proposed prices and sizes. If the does not know them, then we can give him more time to go and bring that informatin back to this House.</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>MR. OKWARA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the boats are not ready yet.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBO: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Since the Assistant Minister has said that he does not have enough details on this Question, could he give an undertaking to this House that he is going to get more details and come back to the House with the right information?</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>MR. OKWARA: MR. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is no need for me to go back for more information. As I have stated very clearly, the boats are being built. When they are finished, then we shall price them.</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>MR. A.K. KINYANJUI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Any undertaking-by the Government must have a feasibility study. Is the Assistant  Minister telling us that in their feasibility studies there were no indications of prices? Is that what he is telling us?</Newspeech>    <Newspeech> MR. OKWARA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as of now we have no prices.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the Assistant Minister has not answered the question that has been put to him. He has been asked to tell the House whether, before the commencement of this work any feasibility studies were done. If they we were done, what were the prices of these boats? Were any feasibility studies done?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. OKWARA: No. Mr. Deputy Speaker, sir.</Newspeech>(several hon. Members stood up)<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I am going to allow only one more point of order. We must proceed on.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Since the Assistant Minister has said that these fishermen are going to be given loans, could he tell us the terms and conditions of these loans, especially the question of interests?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. BIDU: Jibu swali, Bw. Waziri Msaidizi na kama hujui jibu lake basi tuambie!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKWARA: Siwezi kukosa kujua! This is a straightforward matter!</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Are you bewitched?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKWARA: No, I am not, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The fact is that these boats will be sold and the fishermen will be given loans to purchase them.</Newspeech>(several hon. Members stood up)<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order, hon. Members, we must move to the next Question.</Newspeech>Question No. 198 Measures to Alleviate Wheat Flour Shortage<Newspeech>MR. KUBO asked the Minister for Supplies and Marketing whether, in order to minimise the shortage of wheat flour in Taveta and the whole country he could, in consultation with the Price Controller, adjust profit margins to the wholesalers and retailers in order to enable them to stock enough quality of the commodity for the consumers.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Mudavadi): Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I reply, I would like first to applogise for not having been here earlier on. I was held up at the office by some consultations. Having said that, I beg to reply.I wish to reiterate that the policy of my Ministry is to ensure that there is no wheat shortage in the country. It is in line with this,as I have stated in this House before, that wheat and wheat products are distributed in accordance with the consumption zones to ensure, equitable supply. Accordingly, the suppliers are monitored regularly.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the case of Taveta, which receives wheat flour from the three Mombasa millers, our records show that Taita Taveta District has an average supply of 1,000 x 90 kilogrammes bags of wheat flour per month.tIt may also be noted that wholesalers and retailers profit margins are not the only determinants in having products reach the consumer. There are other factors involved, such as those described in the Legislative Supplement NO. 23 of 14th April, 1989. However, wholesalers' and retailers' profit margins will therefore be taken into account along with all other related factors during the next price review exercise. <Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: While appreciating the Minister'3 reply, "can he tell" us why "there "is a shortage of wheat flour in the whole country? As I am speaking now, there is no bread in Bungoma District. Since the Minister told us in his main reply that there is wheat flour in the country, can he tell us where it is so that the wananchi can. go and bray it from there?</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR. MUDAVADI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I have pointed out the Ministry is making every effort to ensure that there is adequate distribution of wheat throughout the country.' One of the factors that may be leading to the issue that hon. Mang'oli has just raised is the question of the brand of wheat flour. It would appear that the consumers have developed a particular liking to one kind of brand, therefore, leaving others which do not appear to appeal to them.</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Bw. Naibu Spika, tunataka Waziri atueleze kule rigano ina ke pelekwa. Bii ni kwa sababu wiki mbili  ilizopita,meli mo ja iliwasili Kilindini Port na tani 13,000-ra ngano. Juzi meli nyingine iliwasili na tani 26,000 xa ngano. Kabla ya meli hizi kuwasili, ngano ilikuwa imejaa katika mabohari na ilikuwa ikipelekwa kwa millers kila wakati. Nilipogundua kwamba hakuna unga wa ngano kule Mombasa, nilikwenda katika viwanda vya millers na nikapata kwanmta wanaendelea na kazi kwa masaa 24 kwa siku.Ajabu ni kwamba, hat a wale watu wanaokaa karibu na viwanda hivi hawaupati unga huo wa ngano. Ingefaa Waziri achunguze kule huu unga wa ngano unaopelekwa baada ya kutoka kwa millers. Sii ni kwa sababu unga huu hauonekani katika masoko yetu hapa nchini na inaonekana pengine kuna watu wanaupeleka nje ya nchi hii.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUDAVADI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, normally, when the wheat is off loaded, it goes to millers and the flour so produced is taken by the wholesalers. If there is a problem with the wholesalers, then the Ministry will look into it.</Newspeech>I would like to say very clearly that the wheat that is imported is distributed fairly in the country.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KOBO: Sir, my main concern is that even after this wheat has "been milled, the traders are reluctanct to take the product "because there is no profit margin at all Can the Minister tell us the factory price of one bale of flour at Mombasa and for how much it is sold at Taveta by wholesalers and what the retailers get because that is where the problem lies? Wholesalers have boycotted this business because there is no profit margin whatsoever.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUDAVADI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the full price list and profit margins, as far as wheat flour is concerned, are be reflected very clearly in Kenya Gazette Supplement No. 26. However, I will just pick an item out of it. For instance, if we take the 24 kilogramme bag,a wholesalers from from millers at Ishs.192.25 this is in Taita-Taveta District and he sells it to the retailers at Kshs.196.65. The profit margin the there is K3h3.4.40. The retailer then sells the two kilo gramme bag at Kshs.l7."50 and his profit margin is. Kshs.9.25. la other words, the retailer sells the whole bag at Kshs.205.90.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KYONDA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to hint to the Minister that there is something more than what he is telling us. This is because the whole House and, perhaps, including himself, knows that there is shortage of wheat flour in the country. It seems as if matter is not being tackled properly. According to the Minister, the wholesaler in Taveta makes a profit of Kshs.4.40 after buying the flour in Mombasa. We know that the cost of transportation has gone up drastically and, perhaps, a bale of flour will cost this wholesaler Kshs.lO/= or Kshs.5/= if he is lucky to transport from Mombasa to Taveta. There is a problem here.to sell his products from Nairobi to Elgeyo Marakwet, he would not be making any profit of whatever margin. However, I would like to point out that millers in Western Province, for example, can buy wheat from Kisumu and Eldoret.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANGOLI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. In view of the seriousness involved in this matter, could the Ministry of Supplies and Marketing liaise with the Ministry of Finance as a matter urgency, with a view to looking for ways and means of raising the profit margin if wheat-flour wholesalers and retailers, even if it means raising the producer price of wheat This is the only way to ensure that we have enough supply of wheat flour in the country.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir6</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I thought that the Minister was going to respond to the point raised by hon. Mang'oli first.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUDAVADI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thought I had already cleared the point raised by hon. Mang'oli when I said that my Ministry, in conjunction with Treasury, is going to review the profit margin of wheat flour retailers and wholesalers. I would also like to clarify the point I made regarding the profit margin in Taita-Taveta. I gave this as an example of profit margin for the traders in Taita-Taita specifically since these profit margins vary from place to place and when the price controller sets up these prices, he takes into consideration the aspect of transport.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Shall we now move on to Question by Private Notice</Newspeech><Header>QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE</Header>Stoppage of Mrs. Kamau's Salary<Newspeech>MR. MWERU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Health, the following Question by Private Notice:-Why was the salary of Mrs. Pauline Wambui Kaaiau p/No.150409, Designation No.l, Murang'a District Hospital stopped with effect from 2nd March, 1990 and when will she he paid?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.I would like to inform the hon. Member that the salary of Mrs. Pauline Wambui Kamau, Nursing Officer I, Murang a District Hospital, whose P/No. was 150409, was stopped on 2nd March, 1990 when she absconded from duty immediately after transfer from Murang'a District Hospital to Myeri Provincial Hospital "where"she had reported" for duty on 20th February, 1990 and her whereabouts is still unknown by her superiors. Therefore, my Ministry is sot in a position to release her salary until she report a for duly and explains the reasons for her unauthorized absence.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MWERU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant Minister's reply that Mrs. Kamau's salary was stopped because of her absconding from duty, would he agree with me that the Ministry itself has already admitted that she had applied for ten days off and 30th days of her annual leave before she was transferred to Nyeri Provincial Hospital? In view of this, it is highly inconceivable why her salary was stopped when we know very well that from 20th February, when she was supposed to report for duty and 2nd March, is barely 15 days. Is it really in order for the Assistant Minister to say that this officer absconded duty when she had already applied for leave and the Ministry has already agreed to this point?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Yes, this lady absconded her duty since she was not seen in her duty station and up to now, we still do: not know where she is and this is why her salary was stopped.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWERD: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister said that his Ministry has already written to Mrs. Kamau's duly station, indicating that she had applied for ten days off and 30 days of her annual leave. Is the Assistant Minister in order to say that they do not know of Mrs. Kamau's whereabouts when she had already applied for leave to facilitate, her transfer to Nyeri  Provincial Hospital?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I am talking now, we do not know where Mrs. Kamau is. She is neither at Murang'a District Hospital, nor is she at Nyeri Provincial Hospital and we cannot give her a salary under these circum¬stances until we come to know of her whereabouts. As far as we in the Ministry are concerned, she is not anywhere.</Newspeech>       <Newspeech>MR. MANG'GLI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Six, the hon.- Questioner is saying that this lady was on leave and when she was till on leave, her alary was stopped. Therefore, could the Assistant Minister tell this House why her salary was stopped while she was on leave?</Newspeech>       <Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this lady should "by now he at Nyeri Provincial Hospital and not in Murang'a District Hospital and I have informed the hon. Questioner that as fax as my Ministry is concerned, Mrs. Pauline Kamau is not anywhere. Nobody approved her leave and the hon. Questioner knows that she is not in her new duty station at Hyeri and we cannot therefore, give her any salary.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. MANG'OLI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in view of the fact that this lady is supposed to he on leave and it is unfortunate that her salary was stopped, could the Assistant Minister assure this Souse that as soon as the hon. Member asks this lady to report to her new station at Hyeri, her salary will be paid?</Newspeech>     <Newspeech>MR. OGOR: The officer in charge is responsible for authorizing leave for officers in his duty station, such as Mrs. Pauline Wambui Kamau. In the case of this lady who is a Nursing Officer Grade I, no leave was approved and we have to confirm from the Provincial Matron in Nyeri that Pauline has reported for duty in her new station before we can pay her any salary. However, this has now been done and we therefore cannot send her salary.</Newspeech><Header>POINT OF ORDER</Header>    <Newspeech>MR. MOMAFTI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. My point of order involves two Ministries, that is, the Ministry of Public Works and the Ministry of Agriculture. At the moment, we are having a very serious problem in our three main towns, namely, Kisii, Keroka and Nyamira in that the roads leading into these three towns are completely impassable. At the moment, our tea is rotting in Kitutu Masaba because the roads in this area are in very had condition. Two weeks ago, Tombe Tea Factory was not functioning due to lack of fuel owing to lack of transport. At the moment, the main road, from Metamaywa-Mochenwar Gesima-Mosobeti it completely impassable and my people are not moving at all.At the same time, business in this area is at a standstill. Similarly, the road between Kisii and Nyamira township is in a very bad condition and Iwould like to have a joint statement from the two Ministries regarding this terrible situation.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WAMETO: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Last week while I was contributing to a Bill in the louse, I made some remarks about the tendering of drugs in the Ministry of Health and I was asked to substantiate what I had said, and. I said I would do so this morning.First of all, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to congratulate the present Minister for Health for conducting, a Marambee to collect money to pay for the hospital bill which Mr. Gakuo incurred at a private hospital after having spent quite a considerable time in Nyeri Provincial Hospital without treatment.Mr. Deputy Speaker. Sir, this is a very serious matter and I to put it to the Minister that it would be quite in order for Mr. Gapal to are the doctor and the Ministry for neyligence because for a recon involved in an recident, and is admitted in a hospital to stay for a while year without treatment is a very serious matter sate, it reflects badly on the Ministry. It also leads down the Part because it is the voters who then complain. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. to come back to the point I talked about the tendering system in the Ministry of Health I would like to draw the attention of the House to a letter written by Uni Impex, Import and Export Ltd., 12th Pinch Road. Dabin, Isle of Man, united Kingdom. This letter was written on 6th March, 1990. and addressed, to the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Health, Mr.Daniel Mbiti and as follows and quete 'Participation in Quotation of national Public Health laboratories - Requirements by Uni Impex, Inport and Sport Ltd. Quotations No. 25/88/89. 27/88/69, 28/66/69 and 29/83/69Dear Sir,We are constrained to commit to writing our extreme annoyance and protest strongly about the fail-are by your Department to consider tenders, bids as cited above, and furthermore, its failure to explain any reasonable grounds for such failure.We, as you have doubt, also have read written newspaper reports in this country which appear to suggest that officials in your Department are not acting as expected" of public servants. Perhaps that, in fact, explains matters about which we protest.We consider that we have been the subject of adverse and discriminatory treatment, and thus we formally" protest by virtue of the failure to consider cum bids and what we read in the Press, we fear, with good reason, that there appear to be vested interest., inflrexing the adjudications of the tender awards. leaving aside what appears in the Press, we rhetorically ask, "That possible justification and merit can  there be in making awards atsuch exerbitant and inflate?, prices when viewed in the light of price which we have bid?"    We now hereunder respect our comrencending prices at notation- The Minister of Kenya Item One anted VDPI Wits -1.000 for testing VDPI. Uni Impex, the complainnunt - price was which is equivalent to Sh.l6l.00 at the time per kit, out the successful bidder price was Sh.340.00 per hit. This is very obsoure obscure firm here called Tabo Firm which is being run by a person who was originally house servant of man who flouted a company and gare it to his servant. This is very clearly shown in the Industrial Review under the heading "During Teachers Scandal." This is helding the health of the people of Kenya at rish. Hen. Members can see the price difference there. If the the tender Minister could have awarded the Uni Inner Itf.., the would have saved Sh.188,000,00.             Item Three - Clinitest. Tablets - 6,000 bottles. Uni Imper price was £3.5 which is equivalent to 3h. 117.40. The successful bidder - Tabo Firm -/ Sh.228.75 per "bottle. The Ministry stands to lose 3h.568, 100.00. Deathrow Sticks which do the same thing as Glucose Sticks - Uni Impex would have sold then at Sh.365.00 per packet, but the successful bidder, the Tabo Firm, was selling them at Sh.1,110.00 per pachet. Price difference was Sh.735,000.00. I do not Konow why the Ministry" has got so much money to waste.                Item 14 — Multistix strips - Uni Impex price was ,15.95 per packet Deutsemark and the successful bidder was selling at 11.70 U.S. Dollars per packet. The price difference was 38,640 U.S. Dollars. It was handed over to a company called H.R. Gcodear which is in London and has relationship with Tabo Firm. The Brutish High Commission says they cannot trace its address in London.Item 16 - Uristix Strips- That is 4.95 Deutsemark which is equivalent to Sh.51.00 per packet. The successful bidder was given at Sh.110.00 per packet. Who is benefiting from the difference? The price difference the Ministry should have gained was Sh.708. 000.00.Quotation No. 27/88/89 - Item No. 76 - Test tubes- 300Gross. uni Impex price was 6.5 Dollars, equivalent to Sh.137.00 cud the successful bidder was given at Sh.720.00 per Gross. The price difference was 3h.174.900.00.Petri Dishes - 300 Gross - Uni Impex price was 79.2 Dollare per Cross which is equivalent to Sh.1520.00, but Tabo Firm, the successful bidder was Sh.4,320.00 per Gross. The price difference is KSh.836,700.00.niversal Bottles - 500 Gross - Uni Impex price was21. 25 U. S. Dollars - which-is-equivalent to Sh.-7-22.50.The successful "bidder's price was Sh.4,200.00 per Gross, Price difference was Sh.l,738,250.00. These were being ordered when there were plenty1" of them in -the store to last the Ministry for nearly a year or so, but they were still ordering more. So, the total difference if the Ministry had ordered: from Uni Impex they would have saved Sh.7,707, 250.00.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the writer of this letter, Tan Bayd, for and on behalf of Uni Impex Import and Export Ltd says:-"We fail to comprehend how the Ministry can justify this sheer waste of public funds. This wastage can only occur if principles of public accountability are non¬existent. We can only say that we find this experience shocking, unnerving and disheartening.while the Minis try withholds payments of our out¬standing invoices on the pretext of non-availability of funds, it seems to show lack of concern about losing millions of shillings in irregular tender awards. How- ironical I"We can only sympathise with the patients who have to share the burden of the excessive expenditure incurred by some irresponsible civil servants. We await your reply with interest.Yours faithfully, Tonya BaydThat is paper No.l, and I will lay it on the Table.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: How long will the next paper take because I think you have taken quite a bit of time.?</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, you are the custodian of the Standing Orders of this House, and therefore, if you make a ruling, I have no choice but to obey. I was asked by the House to lay the papers on the Table, and I cannot just lay them there as if I am deaf and dump. I have to say something about them, but I will await your ruling, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I have no ruling to make, Dr. Wameyo. I was only enquiring as to how long the other, papers shall takeDR. WAMEYO. As long as I have the papers to present.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: In that case, Dr. Wameyo, may I request that you lay all the papers that you have on the Table, and then we can proceed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO: I will obey, your ruling, but it will hurt the hon. Members.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Can you be able to make a very brief summary of all the papers. If you present all your papers the same way, you are likely to take the whole month.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO: We have a big problem on drugs. Hospitals have no drugs. The Ministry of Health is interferring with the supply of drugs to Government, hospitals. The Government decided that it will be buying drugs directly from manufacturers. The Ministry is applying delaying tactics by buying drugs from individuals, who are not manufacturers there by interferring with the health of the people of this country and enhandesing us who happen to be party leaders.</Newspeech><Newspeech>All these letters have been sent to the Ministry, and,therefore, they are aware of them. What I have read, out proves to hon. Members that we have a problems on drugs, and therefore, I will just lay the papers on the Table. The Minister will go through them, if he has not done so already, and then tell the House</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: What about making some photo copies.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO: Do not worry, The photo copies have been taken care of. I will not lay this particular news paper cutting on the Table, because it is available in the streets. Laying this document on the Table is just like the laying The Standard on the Table, because it is available everywhere.</Newspeech>(Dr. Wameyo laid the papers on the Table)<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Kibaki): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say three things on that matter.Firstly, I would like to say that it is true that I have had problems with the staff in the Ministry. The hon. Members are aware that we asked the assistance of the police, at a certain stage, in relation to this case, and two other cases, where there were obvious misdeeds. In fact, some of those cases are still with the police, and the people, who had been charged are cut on bond, andtherefore, it would not be proper for me to comment on each of those cases. That is one point which I wanted to make clear.Sir, the second point that I would like to make clear is with regard to that particular company which was being used by some particular officers to purchase those drugs which are needed for public health departments. That particular company is called Tap Firm. Before that matter was taken to the Industrial Review, which was quoted by the hon. Member - we had already taken action. The Permanent Secretary, Mr. Daniel Mbiti, had already stopped those purchases so we did not lose any money, It is true that we should pursue that matter and take action early, but it is quite improper for anybody to insinuate, either by quoting the Industrial Review, or by making a statement in now in the month of May, that we took no action, while in fact, we took action in the month of February. We took action at the appropriate time to stop those activities. In fact, the senior officer in-charge of that particular department was among the people who were suspended at that time, and who will have to answer charges. Although no money was actually spent, there was obvious commitment so the money could have been spent if they were not discovered in time. The documents had gone through all the processes, and letters might have been issued, but no money had been paid. In view of the changes being brought by the new officers at our Heaquarters, those issues were spotted, action taken, and the people who were involved were suspended.Therefore, Sir, I believe that we deserve some commendation on matters where we took action at the appropriate time. The would hon. Member should not come here in May, and pretend that the issues are happening now and that the Ministry is denying the people the drugsand spending excessive money. I am not saying that the hon. Member has not right to do that he has, but he should not indicate that we are being discovered when we are the ones who discovered what was going on in our Ministry and took action immediately. There is a very major difference in that sequence of events.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Why did you not inform us?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Kibaki): Sir, we did notneed to do that, we took action. According to the administrative procedure those people were suspended, and the matter referred to the police. The matter was not llegislative therefore we could not have brought it to Parliament.Equally, it is true that Uni-Impex who appears in atleast 12 different company names, is the same person, who this House was told by a previous Minister of Health - that he had been recommended by the Criminal Investigation Department (C.I.D.) and the Attorney-Generalts Chambers, that he be excluded totally from bidding for Government supplies, in view of the previous misdeeds. He is the same person who appear under the name of Uni-Impex he has at least different names. The hon. Members should make sure that those type of people who have been identified by our Govern¬ment machineries, do not use our institutions to embarance each other.     As concerns Tab Pharm, it is one case where we can say that the Ministry took a serious action.   While on the same issue, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me say that these are the same people who were making details available to The Standard newspaper for publication attacking the Director of Medical Services, who is part of discover¬ing these things and taking action. They are now saying that he was being hostile. When our senior civil servants are taking action to safeguard certain positions, they deserve commendation; it should not be the other way. Perhaps, most important is one of the changes that have been brought by the senior civil servants in my Ministry is that there should be a Drug Procurement Committee, which will incorporate the provincial medical officers of health. That way, there will not be the question of attacking the Director of Medical Services and saying that he makes decisions alone. As regards the case The Standard newspaper was talking about, the man was every opportunity to tender but he did not do so. Perhaps, more important, he went and sought the assistance of the same people behind Uni—Impex, who had also been barred from these tenders.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, these are two issues in that one, there is a campaign by people who are aggrieved because their previous misdeeds in the Ministry of Health have been discovered. They are doing a campaign agains senior civil servants. The second issue of Tab Pharm has been taken very seriously and the people involved have been suspended. The police have been involved in the matter and it will be resolved that way. It is for this reason that I want to plead that we are taking the action that we should take. If we took some action a couple of months ago, we should not be made to look as if these misdeeds are being done infront of our eyes. Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is it now? I think we have to close this matter, Dr. Wameyo, because I cannot open debate on the same. I am sure that you have made your point. The Minister has responded, and I think the Ministry will take the matter very seriously.Hon. Cheruiyot, did you have something to say?</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR CO-OPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Cheruiyot): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I just wanted to remind the House that today is Wednesday, and we normally have our prayers on Wednesdays in the Chapel. The few hon. Members who have been going there have benefited tremendously. We take some time to listen to some speakers who are invited by the Speaker and you, Sir, and I think we are very lucky to have people who can lead us in prayer. It is a time you can commit your time to the Lord and shoulder your problems there for only half an hour every Wednesday.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: What are you saying? What are you saying?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR CO-OPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Cheruiyot); Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am just informing hon. Members who may not be aware of the existence of the Chapel to set aside one hour every Wednesday for prayers. <Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I am a Muslim, and I have always understood that Christians go to church on Sundays. The existence of the Parliament Chapel has been there for a long time. If what the hon. Minister has said becomes the trend, will it not disturb the business of the House since I think we will be required to rise early?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I think you can take that in good spirit. As a -matter of fact, I think even Muslims are welcome to the Chapel for prayers.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Omido): On a point of information, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The service the hon. Minister has talked about takes only a few minutes. We go for service for half an hour and after that we go for lunch. We do it in time before 2.30 when Parliament resumes for its afternoon Session.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: We must proceed now. What is it, Archbishop Ondiek?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Archbishop Ondiek):_ Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to correct hon; Mwamzandi's statement and inform him that Christians do not go to church on Sundays alone.

KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the following Motion:- THAT, in view of the fact that the tenants of Chaani and Mikindani Site—and—Service Scheme have not been given adequate loans to develop their plots, and while noting that the Mombasa Municipal Council has threatened to reposses the said plots unless they are developmed immediately, this House calls upon the Government to issue the tenants with title deeds to- enable them acquire loans from financial institutions for development. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Motion is an indication of corruption among our officers in various Government departments. It also shows that how people have suffered due to that corruption. Sir, Chaani Site-and-Service Scheme was sponsored by the government, and I thank the Nyayo Government for being mindful of the welfare of the low-income people. The project was meant for the low—income group on the understanding that plot allottees would be given KShs.36,000/- to develop them. Unfortunately, when the money was given by the Government, it was not allocated adequately.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOY: How can you substantiate that?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: I have substantiated that remarks very many times here but, unfortunately, hon. Boy has not heard me. I have substantiated the fact that plot allottees in Chaani Site-and-Service Scheme were not given adequate money to develop their plots. If hon. Boy wants to be a good "boy" to the Minister, he should keep quiet and allow me to speak.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS,HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Mutiso): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I am sure that you will agree with me that hon. Kiliku is imputing improper motives to hon. Boy by saying, "If hon. Boy wants to be a good boy to the Minister". Can he withdraw that remark because it is not allowed in our Standing Orders.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: That was just a joke. Let me continue.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. We take whatever we say here very seriously. Should hon. Kiliku joke in this House when he knows that we do not entertain jokes in this House? I think he should withdraw the remark he made against hon. Boy and apologise. Hon. Boy is Hon. Boy Juma Boy and he should not be told to be a good boy. Hon. Boy Juma Boy is a hon. Member of this House and not a boy. Unless hon. Kiliku withdraws that.remarks, the people of Matuga will think that they elected a boy to represent them here.<Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was appealing to theMinister because he loves the people</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOY: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Hon. Kiliku is trying to evade withdrawing his remark and apologising to the House. He avoiding his remark, "If you want to be a good boy to the Minister". He should withdraw this remark and apologise to the House because it is a very damaging utterance. He alleges that I want to be a good boy to the Minister.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I did not mean to call hon. Boy a young man; I was only referring to hon. Boy by his name.(Laughter)Is there anything wrong with hon. Boy being a good boy to the Minister?The Minister's love for the people is not questionable, and this Motion is very straightforward. I am calling upon the Minister to rescind that notice because Mombasa Municipal Council has threatened to repossess these plots by June, 1990 if they will not have been developed then. The people there cannot develop these plots because the money that was to be given to them for developing the plots was not given. These people have been given quit notices. So, the Minister should help these people so that their plots may not be repossessed by Mombasa Muncipal Council until these people fail to develop them after they have got money for this purpose.Meanwhile, I request the Minister to make proper arrangements so that these people may get title deeds, which will be enough security against which they can get loans from financial institutions for developing their plots. We cannot blame the Government because it did its job by giving money to Mombasa Municipal Council early enough to enable these people to develop their plots. Unfortunately, this money was not given to the people adequately. it is only that some corrupt officers in the Government are making it difficult to implement Government policies, of which this is a very good example. Money was given, but it was not forwarded to the people who were eligible to get it. I am not asking about where the money went; all that the Motion is seeking is that the Minister helps these people to get title deeds for their plots so that they may get loans for developing the plots. It will not be good to wait until June, 1990 for all these plots to be repossessed and given to other people. Who are these other people besides the ones who were supposed to be given funds? When the Minister replies to this Motion, he should note that in future, when the Government is giving money to local authorities, it must have its own representatives to see that the money is properly utilised. We had the same problem in Kisumu Town as we now have in Mombasa, and the Minister is aware of this, although I do not have as many details on the problem in Kisumu as I do on the problem in Mombasa. If we get money from a foreign donor and the money is not utilised accordingly, this discourages donors from giving us more money in future. We talk about the grilling of people by Kanu, but most of this grilling should be directed against those corrupt officers who have misappropriated Government money because they are very dangerous. We cannot - develop if our people are not patriotic or when they do not address themselves to the economic problems we have. Time has come when leaders should address themselves to the economic challenges we have today. We have political Independence, and the only independence we are now fighting for, which we- have not yet achieved is economic independence. Unless our officers are patriotic enough to address themselves to the economic problems of this country, this economic independence will be delayed.This project was meant for people who were then earning about Shs.800/= per month, but the little money that was to be given to them went somewhere else, and they did not get it. They were supposed to get Shs.36,000/= each, and yet.no disciplinary action has been taken against those who were beyond the misappropriation of these funds. Why should we encourage such behaviour? Just like other developing countries, we are now falling victim to structural adjustment, programmes imposed by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and we cannot escape the effects.Mr. Deputy Speaker left the Chair The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mwamzandi) took the ChairThe development of these plots has been delayed because somebody somewhere was  corrupt. If these people had been given-money at that time, they could have developed their plots, but the cost of development has now become too high because the Kenya Shilling has been devalued almost to the tune of 46 per cent since 1984. If the plots were to be developed at a cost of Shs.36,000/= each at that time, we now need almost three times as much as that figure because of the present economic process.I call upon the Minister to help these people. At the same time, I thank the Minister for Land, Housing and Physical Planning, hon. Mbela, who has been quoted by the local Press as having gone round the places where we have such projects. He has been quoted as having visited Kisumu, and he recently issued some documents relating to housing here in Nairobi. The Minister is very active, and I request him to extend the same working spirit to these people to enable them to develop their plots.It is high time that the Mayor of Mombasa Municipal council quits or resigns his job because he has failed in the implementation of Government projects.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the Government "borrowed money from the World Bank so that this money could be advanced to our people, and the people have not received the money, then it means that the money must, have gone to wrong people. So, the Mayor of Mombasa should resign now.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Mbori): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have been listening to hon. Kiliku's keen contribution. But you will find that he has gone as far as stating that there is an officer who misappro¬priated the funds that were meant for the plot allottees in Chaani and Mikindani. Would I be in order to mention the name of the officer he has in mind?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MS. KZLIKU: Mr. Temporary-Deputy Speaker, Sir, for how many times am I going to substantiate these things? The same Assistant Minister asked me to substantiate the same thing last year and I brought a list of names to hm. I gave him a list of the people who were supposed to get that money but they never got it. I also asked the Assistant Minister to tell us where that money went if it was not misappropriated</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOY: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Hon. Mbori asked a specific question. The hon. Member has been talking about a certain corrupt officer. He has been asked by the hon. Assistant Minister to substantiate his remarks by mentioning the name of that particular officer. Is he in order to try to evade giving substantiation here? He should mention his name or Table documents here to prove that that particular officer really corrupt.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILISU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I did not refer to a corrupt officer; talked about corrupt officers" of the Mombasa Municipal Council. The Mayor of Mombasa' is number one; secondly we have the Town Clerk. I am talking about that particular time and not now. I am talking the time when this money was given.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. BOY: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The hon. Member has categorically referred to the Mayor of Mombasa. Can he substantiate that the Mayor AND THE Town Clerk were in involved in corrupt practices? He must prove that the Mayor was personally involved in that kind of thing.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILISU:., Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I mentioned the Mayor because he is boss. He is the one who chairs all these meetings. He is responsible for every problem that may face the Mombasa Municipality." He is a responsible officer. The Town Clerk is the "Accounting Officer" If the Town Clerk had accounted for this money properly, the people should have been given their money</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOY: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Hon. Kiliku has referred to the Mayor as a person." We know that the Mombasa Municipal Council has many officers.' If there is an officer who is corrupt, then hon. Kiliku should mention his name in the House. He cannot generalise the issue by saying that the Mayor is the top man in the Municipal Council of Mombasa. Is he not imputing improper motives?</Newspeech>   <Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will not withdraw that one because the when the money was given the Mayor and the Town Clerk were there. If the Mayor and the Town Clerk had acted carefully, no junior officers under them could have misappro-priated that money.</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mwamzandi): Hon. Kiliku, could you tell the House how the Mayor of Mombasa misused that money?</Newspeech>    <Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Chaani and Mikindani Site and Service Scheme was meant for people who are earning about KShs.800/- per month. They were supposed to get KShs.36,000/- each. That was stated very clearly in the contract.I appreciate the fact that a few of them have been given that amount each. But you will find that the majority of the people have not been given that money.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Why?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: I do not know. The hon. Assistant Minister should tell us why they have not been given that money. So, as I said earlier on, if these people failed to implement the contract agreement, then it means that that money was misappropriated.'1 I say this because these people - the plot allottees - were not given the money according to the contract agreement.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOY: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Hon. Kiliku has stated categorically that the Mayor of Mombasa was involved in misappropriation of funds. Is it the Mayor who supplied the names of those people who were given plots or was he canvassing for other people? Hon.. Kiliku should be specific; he should not generalise the issue. This is because he has stated that the Mayor was involved in corrupt practices.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not know what is wrong with hon. Boy Juma Boy. I did not say that the Mayor was personally involved. I said that he had failed as the Mayor of Mombasa Municipal Council and that as a result of this he should resign. I said that he has failed as Mayor. If he not failed then these people could have received their money. If you are trying to cover corruption friends- If hon. Boy Juma. Boy is covering corruption.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr: Ogle): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. It is not my intention to interrupt hon. Kiliku, hut I think we all heard him very clearly say that the Mayor of Mombasa was involved in corrupt practices. I think we should not accept anything short of subtantiation or withdrawal of that serious allegation.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, tomorrow I will bring a copy of today's  HANSARD to prove that I said that the Mayor had "failed". I pity hon. Boy Juma Boy and his friends for covering corruption."' If you are covering corruption you are not worthy being a Member of Parliaments A person who covers corruption should not be elected to this Housed The Government borrowed money from the World Bank and this money was misappropriated and a Member of Parliament is covering that corruption.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER POR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Mbori): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I am surprised that the hon. Member for Changamwe continues to use the word "corruption" in a manner which, I think, leave quite a lot to be desired. Could he mention the names of the officers he thinks acted corruptly in handling those funds? He should not confuse the Mayor with other officers. This is because the Mayor is an elected councillor. He should tell us what he means by  misappropriation?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am very bitter because those plots will be repossessed in June, 1990. These plots which belong to the people who elected me are going to bere-possessed in June, this year. Nobody in this House is going to silence me when I am talking about the problems facing those who elected me to come to this House. If you are covering corruption</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mwamzandi): Order! Hon. Kiliku, I think you have been requested to substantiate your remarks and in your substantiation you mentioned the Mayor and the Town Clerk. So, I think the House is entitled to a further substantiation or a withdrawal of those remarks. Your time is over but I will give you a little more time so that you can clear that point.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr.' Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not going to withdraw those remarks regarding such naked corruption. Government borrowed money from the World Bank with the intention of loaning the same money to wananchi but the money never reached those wananchi.

Naibu Spika wa Muda.Kwanza kabisa ni ngependa kumshukuru mhe.Kiliku kwa kuileta Koja hii ambayo inaambatana na uls mwito wa Mtukufu Rais wa. kuyajali maslah i ya watu wengine. Kinase ma hivyo kwa sababu wananchi wanao- husika bap a wanahitaji usaidizi. Lengo kubwa lakuanzisha mpango huu wa nyumba wa Chaani na Mikindani ; lilikuwa ni kuwaokoa watu wenye map at o ya chini kutokana na shida ya nyumba.' Kwa hivyo ningependa kumshukuru Waziri wa Ardht na Nyumba kwa kujaribu kusawazisha makosa mengi katika Wizara yake.Ningependa kumuomba Waziri ayasawazishe haya maafa yanayokumba service schemes.Hakuna faida kwa mwananchi wa kawaida asiye na mapato yoyote ambaye araepewa kiwanja lakini kwa kuwa hakupewa mkopoj hakuweza kukiendeleza- apokonywe. kiwanja hicho. Huu ni uonevu. Kwa kuwa manispaa ya Mombasa inataka kuwapokonya viwanja hawa wananchi kwa kuwa hawawezi kuviendeleza, basi ni wajibu wa Wizara kuilazimisha Manispaa ya Mombasa iwapatie watu hawa hiyo mikopo kama bado pesa hizo ziko. Baada ya hapo ndipo manispaa hii inaweza kuwashurutisha kuwapokonya viwanja hivyo. Hakuna haja ya kuwatisha watu hawa. Sote tunajua kuwa tisho ni kitu kibaya sana. Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, sote tunajua kuwa maskini kupata lazimatajiri akubali na mnyonge kupata ni lazima mwenye nguvu akubali. Ninafikiriwakati umefika ambako tuseme, tajiri kupata ni lazima maskini akubali. TunatakaWizara hii ichunguze;kwa nini hawa wanyonge wanatishwa na manispaa na kwa ninijambo hili linatokea na hall Serikali ni watu wote wawe maskini, vipofu, viwete,wenye mali au wasio na mali. Kwa hivyo, si vizuri kwa Manispaa ya Mombasa kuwa¬tisha watu hawa hali inajua unnij wazi waz kuwa wananchi hawa hawana kitu chochote kwani pesa walizoahidiwa hawakupewa. Hata sijui ni kwa nini jambo hili haliku- chunguzwa. Haya ni masikitiko makubwa ambako mikopo ilitolewa na Serikali ili ipewe watu hawa kuviendeleza viwanja vyao lakini hawakupewa. Jambo linaloshangaza ni kuwa Wizara inayohusika imenyamaza kimya na haichukui hatua yoyote. Kwa hivyo, ningependa kupendekeza kuwa uchunguzi ufanywe ili ijulikane ni kwa nini pesa hizi hazikupewa wananchi waviendeleze viwanja vyao. Nafikiri mambo yote haya yanatokea kwa sababu hakuna uangalizi bora. Kama si hivyo, basi wananchi wangeweza kuzipata hizo pesa zilizotolewa na World Bank kama mikopo kwa wananchi hawa. Sasa Manispaa ya Mombasa inawatisha hawa wananchi ili watu wakubwa wakubwa waje wakavinyakue viwanja hivyo. Wakati umefika kwa watu kuwa na imani na watu maskini. Itakuwa ni dhuluma, dhambi na hasara kubwa kama wananchi hawa watapo- konywa viwanja hivyo. Ikifanyika hivyo, mackini ataenda wapi?Kwa hivyo, kunahitajika utaratibu ufanywe ili hawa watu wapewe hati za kumiliki mashamba ili waweze kupata mikopo ya kuviendeleza viwanja vyao. Pia hati hizi zitaweza kuwasaidia mashini  kutaka kwa benki za nchihii. Kwa hivyo, ningependa kumuoraba Waziri asiipinge Hoja hii. Ningependapia kumuoraba alifikiriepjamlola kutoa hati hizi ili wananchi hawa waweze kusaidiwa kwanihaikuwa makosa yao kutoviendeleza viwanja hivi. Makosa yalitokana na wenyekuitoa raikopo hiyo. Kwa hivyo, wananchi hawa wakipewa hati hizi za kumilikimashamba wataweza kutafuta njia za kuweza kuviendeleza viwanja vyao.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, Manispaa hii ya Mombasa inafaa kuwatendeahaki wananchi hawa. Ikiwa wamepewa kitu wawapatie wananchi wafanye jambo fulanini wajibu wao kuhakikisha kuwa jambo hilo limetendeka. Waswahili huseraa: Nahodhawengi hufanya chorabo kiende mrama. Hii ina maana kuwa ikiwa waendeslaj wa mturabwini wengi basi mtumbwi huo huzama. Kwa hivyo, mambo mengi ya Manispaa ya Mombasayanaharibika kwa sababu kuna werevu wengi sana huko. Sisi ni wawakilishi wa kulawatu 22 milioni ambako wengi wa watu hawa ni maskini. Kwa hivyo, ni wajibuwetu kuhakikisha kuwa matajiri hawaumizi maskini. Kwa hivyo, ni wajibu wa teatammoja wetu anayependelea maendeleo kuhakikisha kuwa haki inafanyika. Lazimatuangamize mambo karaa vile magendo, kusengenyana na kutotenda haki. Bila hakihakuna chochote kinachoweza kufanyika.Kwa hivyo, Waziri asimamapo hapa tunataka aipitishe Hoja hii kwanikama sote tujuavyo yeye ni mtu wa kusikiza mambo, mwenye kujua mengi na anajuataabu inayowakabili wananchi wadogo wadogo wenye viwanja. Kwa hivyo, kwa kuwayeye ni Waziri wa Nyayo anafaa apitishe Hoja hii ili hawa wananchi wasiendeleekutishwatishwa ovyo ovyo.Kwa hayo machache naiafiki Hoja Hii.</Newspeech>(Question proposed) <Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, This is a straightforward Motion. As is the case with such Motions, the Mover calls upon one or two people to support his arguments which, in actual fact, should be done fairly.This Motion is urging the Government to see to it thatthose people who were allocated these plots are given loans andtitle deeds in order to develop them. Secondly, the Motion statesthat the Mombasa Municipal Council is threatening to repossess thesaid plots if the allottees do not develop them. This is a¬very dangerous trend because it seems that already thereare people who have maneuvered a way of having these plots repossessedand allocated to them. The Minister who is responsible for this, should ensure that this unfair treatment does not arise.We were told that these plots were allocated a long time ago and that money was set aside by the World Bank so that each allottee could be given a loan ranging from Kshs.36,000/= to Kshs.41,000/= for the development of those plots.  We were also told that the purpose of these loans was to enable the allottees to build houses to live in.According to the Mover of this Motion, these allottees have not been given the said loans. If that is the case, then it is upon the Minister responsible to furnish this Souse with an adequate reply as to where this money went.: It is damaging the reputation of this country if that money which was given by the World Bank, has not been given out to these allottees. If this is the case, then there must be misappropriation or misapplication of that money. This money might have found its way to an unintended project. This will be very bad in respect of the World Bank because financiers would always like to see that the money they provide goes to the intended projects. The Minister responsible should clear the air so that the bank which gave this money can know where it went. If that money was never given, then we should he told that also.when I was murmuring to hon. kiliku, I was surprise to learn that each allottee was given a loan ranging from Kahs.4,000/= to Kshs.6,000/=. Sir, that money, if it were given, could have done almost nothing. If the money from the world Bank is not there, these people should he given title deeds so that they can acquire loans from the GovernmentsI am worried at the issue of giving these people title deeds because with the behaviour of our people, these plots might he sold to other peopled The intention of the Government is to settle people and it is unfortunate to see the same people who have been given the opportunity to settle selling their land or plots. After these title deeds have been issued, it would not be surprising to find that the allottees have sold them and become the "rich men".Hon. kiliku should advice these people not to sell their plots after getting the title deeds. I am saying this because I have experience in a similar case. I fought for the settle¬ment o f people at Diani Complex and the President was kind enough to allocate each family one acre of land. Surprising now, allthese plots belong pother people other than the original allottees.If the hon. Member is being pursued by his constituents so that they get the title deeds in order to sell the plots, then that is a very dangerous trend. If these people sell their plots, they will become squatters elsewhere. They should request their hon. Member of Parliament to get them title deeds so that the develop those plots through bank loans,	 Sir, the problem at the Coast Province is acute and thatis why there are many squatters there. Some squatters are therepurposely because there is no reason for someone to sell his landand then go to squat on another person's land. Within no time,land in the Coast Province will be very scarce.: For example, theKisii people have an acute land problem and you hardly see somebodywith more than 10 acres. You just see people with half acre, one; acre or twoacres. Taking into account the country's birth rate, land at theCoast will soon be very scarce.The hon. Member should, therefore, advice his peoplenot to sell their plot after getting, title deeds but to develop them.With these few remarks, I support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. B0Y: Asante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipatia  nafasi hii ili niseme machache juu ya Hoja hii muhimu.

Naibu Spika wa Muda, ninaiunga So ja hii mkono kwa sababu, ikiwa mwenye paploti ataweza kuifanyia kazi inayoweza kulete maendeleo, jambo hili litakuwa lamanuu kwa nchi. yote kwa jumla. Hinapozungumza katika Bunge hili, ninafahamuwazi kwamba katika Mpango wa Makao wa Mbuguni katika sehemu ya Matuga, kulizlkawakati ambapo waliokuwa na ploti ambazo hawajazifanyia kazi, waliambiwa kwambawatargrang anyva ploti hizo. Ili kalichunguza jambo hili kwa makini, kamatimaalum iliundwa ya kuangalia nl ploti gani ambazo hazifanyiwi kazi ya maendeleo.Ajabu ni kwamba kamati hii ilifanya kazi. ya mapendeleo na ikawa watu wenginevalipokonywa ploti zao ingawa walikuwa wamezifanyia kazi, aa wamepanda mitikatika ploti hizo. baada ya hapo, walifanya second plot allotment na taabu .ikatokea wakati mtu alipewa ploti, na baada ya kwenda katika ile ploti, akakuta liko na mwenyewe kwamba liko na mwenyewe na limejaa miti au mimea mingineKwa hivyo, loja kama hii ni muhimu 3ana na si si kama tfabunge, ni lazimatuwe viongozi wanaofikiria Kenya nzima. Wakati mhe. Ziliku alipoileta Zoja hiihapa Bungeni, alieleza taabu za watu wake katika sehemu fulani na sisi kamaWabunge, ni lazima trunruunge mkono katika Soja hii.

It is true that Standing Orders No.76 says that a Member must be responsible for the accuracy of any facts he alleges. However, I do not think I will allow Mr. Boy. to pursue this point much farther because if you look at Standing Order No.73 (4), you would find that it says:-No Member shall impute improper motive to any otherMember except upon a specific substantive Motion calling in question, the conduct of that Member.I am saying this because, I think my colleague, hon.  MwamzandLi, when he was in the Chair, ruled that this matter would be ruled upon by the Speaker later. So, I think we should leave the matter until the Speaker gives a ruling on it. The Speaker may ask hon. Kiliku to substantiate or direct the louse to the right otherwise. Therefore, at this juncture, I would appeal to hon. Boy to leave that issue alone.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. Boy: Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, nitaliacha jambo hilo, lakini niligusa jambo hili kwa sababu nilikuwa nikitaka kueleza lengo la Hoja hili. Kama tunavyofahamu, huwezi kufanya maendeleo oil a kuwa na pesa. Kwa mfano, Ikiwa  unataka kujenga nyumba katika ploti yako, hi lazima isz utahitaji pesa nyingi sana. Sasa ukienda kwa benki kuomba mkopo wa kujenga nyumba, yule meneja atakuulisa, Wapi cheti chako cha kuniliki hiyo ploti? Hata ukienda katika building societies, watakuuliza vile	vile. Ajabu ni kwaniba watu katikaManispaa ya Mombasa hawana vyeti vya kimili axdhi, Kwa hivyo, tungemwomba Waziri wa Ardhi, Hymaba na Mipango ya Miji afikirie jambo hili na kuwasaidia wananchi wachache ambao hawajapata vyeti vya kuntiliki ploti zao, wazipate.Kama tunavyofahamu, watu wote si sawai kuna matajiri, kuna maskini, na kadhalika. Hayo ni mambo ya Mwenyezi Mungu . Wale ambao wana maailioni  ya pesa hawawezi kulinganishwa na wale ambao hawana hata shilingi moja. Kama tunavyofahamu, si makosa ya mtu yeyote kutokuwa na pesa na kwa hivyo, hatuwezi kusema wale wasio na pesa asm za toizifanyia ploti zao maendeleo, wapokonywe ploti hizo. Hawa watu ni wakenya na sasa tukiwapokonya ploti zao, je, watakwenda wapi? lilo ndilo tatizo kubwa katika sehenm hii na ni lazima Waziri az afanye npango wakuhakikisha kwaaiba wenye ploti ambazo hazina vyeti vya kuniliki ardhi, wanapatiwa vyeti hivyo.	Kama watu hawa hawana pesa za kuzifanyia maendeleo ploti zao, basi ingefaakama wangesaidiwa na Serikali  kwa kupatiwa mikopo midogo. Tungetaka NationalSousing Corporation iwapatie watu hawa mikopo midogo ya kuweza kujenya nyumbakatika ploti hizi. Tunafahamu kwamba National Sousing Corporation, inawahitaji werre ploti wawe na vyeti vya kumiliki ardhi na kwa hivyo, ni lazima vfizara. iwasaidie kuvipata vyeti hivi. Kuna watu maskini ambao wana ploti katika sehemu ya Mombasa. Si si tunanrwomba Waziri awafikirie sana hawa watu kwa vile hawana pesa zozote katika benki. kama vile maiajiri wengine wana mamilioni ya pesa. Kuna watu wengine ambao hawaoni Shs.lOO/- kama ni pesa wakati kuna wengine Shs.lOO/- ni kama msahara wao wa mwezi mzima. Kuna wengine ambao Shs.100,000/- ni pesa kidogo lakini kuna wengine ambao wanaveza kuanguka wakiziona Shs.lOO,000/- Sivyo ndivyo watu walivyoumbwa, na kwa hivyo, hatuwezi kuwafikiria watu wote kuwa sawa.Kwa hivyo tunasema kwamba ni lazima ule aruda wa kuzifanyia maendeleo hizo ploti, uzidishwe inpaka Juni mwaka.hun ili Waziri aweze	 kuchunguza kesi zao. Ikiwa mshaharawa mtu ni Shs.800/- kwa mwezi, atawezaj'e Jcnay kujenga nyumba ya Shs.100,000/-.Mtu kama huyo jo hawezi hata kulipa karo kwa watoto wake na kwa hivyo, nilazima watu kama hawa wafikiriwe kwa makim. Satutaki kuwe na skstesz ubaguzikatika mambo haya. Tungetaka haki ifanywe ili watu maatHrri wawe wakisaidiwa.Kwa hayo machache, naunga mkano.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MP. KIPKORIR: Thank you,  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, sir for giving me the opportunity to support this Motion. We know that in Kenya we are a nation that is developing and therefore, Kenyans should be moving forward to develop this country. Part of the development is by allocating wananchi with a plot or a piece of land. It is high time	Kenyans become co-operative in order to hastendevelopment. we have to consider the welfare of other people. we should not frustrate Kenyans. It is the duty and responsibilityof the Government to see that the welfare of all the Kenyans is well protected all over the country. we should make improvements rather than destroy what we have already achieved because by taking away plots from wananchi it is as if we are destroying then. So, we are not here to destroy the nation but to lead it. We car. build this nation by allocating land to other people, if it is possible to do so. However, for the lucky ones with snail plots, they should be given time to look for finances to develop their plots.They should not be arrested or frustrated, because they are our	people. If financial institutions cannot allow money to be borrowed, then how do we expect then to develop?Even in financial institutions, no money can be borrowed without title deeds. How do we expect a nwananchi to acquire a loan without a title deed order to develop a plot? I am appealing not only for the tanants of the Mombasa Municipal but for everybody in this country. :we must appreciate the wav the President, of this country is working. He is being very mindful of the welfare of other people. So, if you are an Administrator of a politician, you should also consider the welfare of other people. Also if you ore a famer. Witch doctor and so on, you should respect this nation, regardless of whatever you have.We are elected into this House to protect the interests of The majority of the nationals, and we have to be very sincere. We must always speak the truth and be honest to all the Kenyans. We should not allow anything had into this country. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are taking about one party system. Kanu is ruling this country ; it is very sincere and the spokesman of everybody. Kanu Nanifesto says that you should respect your colleagues and honour them. We must accord equal respects to everybody because we are human beings, and we all need love. We also need peace and unity. How shall we achieve them if we are destroying other people? If we tell them to quit, where are they going to go ? are they not citizens of this country? Why did we initially allocate them plots? We did so because they were Kenyans. So, we should not change our minds and destroy whatever we have achieved. In this country there are some rich people who have no interest of this country, but they would like to hear people quarrelling or problems arising here and there. It is because they are satisfied and have, got everything. However, everybody, whether rich or poor, need love, peace and unity. If we do not have those three elements, I think, we are going to end up in problems, and we are not going to allow that. We want every person wherever he is, to be a good leader in the country. Let every person set a good example to others so that there is development everywhere in the country. Our President has set up a very good example to as I think we are here to speak on behalf of our people, and. we are also here to protect the welfare and interest of everybody, whether rich or poor. we want everybody to be straightforward and do things systematically. I appeal to the Minister for Lands and Housing to issue title deeds to the poor people of this country. Let them also go and develop their land and I am sure they will be very happy anybody else. They will feel proud of their country.Are you crying here?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR: I am not crying, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, but I am saying that we should co-operate because it is our duty to do so and make sure that everybody enjoys in this country.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MANG’OLI: on a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. With all the seriousness of this House, I think, some of us are getting tired. When matters involving this nation are being discussed, some Ministers are just joking with the hon. Member who is contributing to a very important Motion. Are we here to play, or was the hon. Member really crying? Can we be told?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. wabuge ): I think the hon. Member is ably contributing on this Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am feeling very sympathetic to those squatters who are being thrown away from their land. So, I am only requesting the Minister to issue then with title deeds. I am very sincere, but I am not crying, as the hon. Member is trying to allege. I am trying to express myself and tell the truth only. So, it is my wish that every hen. Member in this House will support this Motion because we have the welfare of everybody at heart. Therefore. I would like to appeal to the Minister to issue title deeds to these people because you cannot get funds iron any financial instigation without security, say,Like title deed. I would also want demarcation of plots to be done all over the country, especially in my area. I have a very small team of  officers in my area doing demarcation work, and I would like the Minister to increase the number so that people can get title deeds, in order to develop their plots. In my area, keric Valley, we havea fertile land, but we have no title-deeds, and  would, like  theMinister to help us in this respect. He should see to it that everybody in this country is enjoying.with those few remarks, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LANDS AND HOUSING (Mr. Mbela ) Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me achance to reply.I have been listening carefully to the contributions being made by the various hon. Members. Theircontributions were good, with the exception of the remarks by I the Mover of thisMotion, who ma.de me distressed because the language that he was using.He made some allegdosm on corruption against of my officersin Mombasa. Sir, this scheme is not new to me. I was oneof the initiators of that scheme, when I was serving the Governmentas a Permanent Secretary, and I therefore, know the details whichwere involved in the planning of that scheme. The Kshs.36,000/-that the Mover talked about was introduced in 1979. The purchasing power of our currency at that particular time was reasonable.If one had his contributions to make, he  would have been givena house, but we are now talking about 10 years later, andinflation has grown at a very fast rate.In addition and that 16 where the mistaken conclusion ofcorruption came from  the disbursement of Kshs.36,000/- is done on the basis of the amount of work that an individual allotee of a plot has done. If you draw some little money and do some work,and then go and show the work that you have done, then you are allowedto draw some more money and continue developing your plot.On that basis, some of the people who were originally alloted thoseplots have been 4blec:toi. complete their houses. There are some people,who have been given some of that money, but unfortunately, they used most ofit for other purposes and only used very little in building thosehouses. As result you find a situation where some individual gotmoney from the Municipal Council of Mombasa  M moneywas channelled through the council  and yet no work has been done on their plots.  That money was given us from of loans must be paid. It is the policy of the Government, that, when you are given a loan you should pay it back. The loan has appreciated because of the interest rates, but there is no way that it can be written off.Sir, having said that as an introductory note, I would like to say that the Government led by His Excellency Daniel arap Moi, is mindful of the peoples welfare. There is no activity that is taking place by accident. Everything that is being done has already been properly planned. We are extremely active all over Kenya in trying to make sure that we survey and demarcate land so that title deeds can be issued. We firmly believe that there no meaning full development that can take place without title deeds. I an sure, Sir, that you must have come across some of the projects that His Excel¬lency the President himself has come up with to protect the welfare of his people. In fact, as introduced, this Motion is typical Government policy and there is no need of any having to introduce any amendments or opposing it. These are exactly the thoughts of His Excellency the President in his efforts to make sure that the lot of the people he is governing is happier at the end of the day.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, with the introduction of the district focus for rural development strategy, we have surveyors stationed in every district. Those surveyors have their programmes to follow, and each senior surveyor, with his team, is given a number of tasks which he must complete by a particular day. That way, we have been able to produce a lot of title deeds. Even before this Motion came up, we were involved in discussions with the Mombasa Municipal Council because we felt that they were too anxious to have surveying done by private firms. We felt that the required surveying could be done by Government officers because it would be cheaper that way since the Government would be reimbursed by the individual plot allottees. So, we are already in consultation and we should be proceeding in ensuring that surveying should be done so that title deeds can be produced.Sir, having said that, I would like to say that I am scared about theproduction of more title deeds particular for this particular scheme. Our experiencehas been that immediately these people were allocated plots, a number of them sold their plots. If you fly above the Mikindani area, you find that a lot of these people have now discovered new ground and sold the plots that had been given to them. I realise that it would be unfair to restrict the sale of these plots, but I wish there was a way in which we could stop the people being in such a hurry to sell their plots. If it is intended that the lives of the people should be made more comfortable by giving them title deeds to enable them acquire loans to develop their plots, I think they are undermining the same policy by trying to sell the plots. That is my fear, and it is supported by actual transactions thatare taking place where plots were allocated to the low income  groups, as it was intended, but immediately they tried to convert the plots into money and continued to live as squatters.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I believe that given title deeds, the individuals concerned will be able to raise money from financial institutions. However, I would like to categorically say that when the title deeds are produced in the next few months, they will be deposited with the Mombasa Municipal Council. The money that was obtained from the World 3ank was a loan to the Kenya Government and it had to be repaid. It is the Municipal Council of Mombasa which will pay my Ministry for onward transmission to the World Bank. So, the title deeds will be given to the Mombasa Municipal Council so that an individual can go and collect it when he clears whatever debts is outstanding If an individual negotiates with a financial institution to get a bigger loan the cost of construction at present is definitely quite high  he can pay off the municipal council and obtain his title deed to enable him to carry out much more development.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to support this Motion because it is in line with the Government policy which we continue to follow to make sure that we continue to serve wananchi. As I said earlier, no meaningful development can be achieved without land being supported by title deeds.With these remarks, I would like to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LEWA: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to contribute to this Motion, which I am glad the Minister supports fully. The essence of the Motion is very much in line with our own efforts to ensure that shelter is provided to every Kenyan. Every Kenyan* should be accorded modern shelter regardless of his income or social status. Site and service schemes were, therefore, designed to take care of the low income members of our society, and it is important for us and the Government to review these schemes to ensure that they are actually implemented to benefit those for whom they were originally intended.It is obviously of concern to note that the Shs.36,000/= which was to be given in 1979 was not, in fact, disbursed 11 years later. One wonders what the Ministry has been doing in these 11 years. Did it review the schemes in question in order to establish that this money was not enough? If so, what other arrangements were made to ensure that the people who were allocated these plots got enough funds to develop their plots? Today, Shs.36,000/= cannot even adequately be used to build the foundation of any house regardless of its size. To me, this site and service, scheme is a failure in the sense that all that the National Housing Corporation, in conjunction with local authorities. I am quoting my own experience in Kilifi  does is to clear the site and provide drainage and some paths. Thereafter, allocation of plots is done, but nobody remains on siteTo supervise construction Money is also disbursed in small bits 1 bet the said Shs.36,000/= was not disbursed at once; maybe it was given in quarters. Therefore, you find that people put up houses which have no definite pattern. Some of the houses look rectangular, other circular and others even oblong. This, to say the least, creates slums in some areas. I appreciate that individual tastes have to be involved, but there must be some element of uniformity, particularly if we want to encourage people to put up reasonable houses because most site and service schemes happen to be in upcoming towns. We expect the Assistant Minister for Land, Housing and Physical Planning to know very well there is a department for physical planning	</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>DR.

Mrs. Ogot five minutes to contributed</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mrs.Ogot):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank you for giving me these few minutesto contribute on this very important Motion by hon. Kiliku. The tenants ofChaani and Mikindani Site and Service Scheme did not get the the opportunity.to build their houses because the money was too little and may not have reachedthem on time. We know that the House will pass this Motion and allow them todevelop their plots. I would like to inform the Assistant Minister for LocalGovernment, Mr. Mbori, that towns need to be planned first before plot allocationis done. There are very many small towns which might later on be graded tourban and town councils where plots are issued at random without any planningbeing done first. I would like to emphasise that town planning must be donebefore plot allocations are made. When these plans are being made, factorslike sites for shops and markets where women carry out their trade, securityhouses, health clinics, nursery schools and so on, must be taken into conderation.After all these have been taken care of then plots can be allocated to individualsand not to councillors, Members of Parliament or any other big shots who willgrab the plots and leave nothing to the wananchi. After this allocation thentitle deeds must be issued. Since the foreign loan that the Government mightacquire to service such a scheme might not be enough for all the tenants, with title deeds they can get loans from the local banks and other financial institutions.I would like to appeal to the tenants of such plots not to sell them to other people who might have other plots elsewhere.With those few remarks, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, first and foremost I would like to thank the Minister for accepting this Motion without amending it, the hon. Members who spoke in support of this Motion and Dr. Wameyo who raised the quorum to enable other hon. Members to come back to the House. I would like to assure the House that I will ensure that my people do not sell the plots when they get the title deeds. I will ensure that they use the title deeds as securities for developing the plots. I will personally approach theMinister so that we can look for a financial institution that will offer theseallottees the best lending terms. I think the best financial institution wouldbe one that will give the allottee a period of 10-15 years to repay the loans.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I moved this Motion because ofthe gravity of the matter. I got worried a bit when I realised that my peoplewere being denied what is rightfully theirs by a few individuals. We hon.Members of Parliament are here to take care of the interest of the people whoelected us. We are here because of these people and not because of a few officers whoare trying to deny our people their rights. This is the reason why in movingmy Motional was a bit emotional. When moving this Motion, I thought that the Minister would oppose it thus forcing my people to be denied their rights. It is for this reason that I must once again thank the Minister and other hon. Members for their support. I would like to suggest that any such matters that may be existing elsewhere in the country be accorded the same response.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

This cannot be, by any standards, be described as sub standard.Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is the intention of my Ministry to outup houses for District Officers throughout the Republic, including the D.O. for Mwatate, who live in a rented houses, when funds becomeavailable.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MCKARO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am very surprised by the answer given by the Minister with regards to this house, which is being referred to. In fact. I do not know where this house is at the moment: As far as I know, there is not a single Government house today in Mwatate, and I also know that one of my D.O. sis currently living at Wundanyi District Headquarters.. One of them is, in fact, living in one of these sub-standard houses that I am talking about. This is where even bathroom and toilet facilities are being shared. I would like to know the, number of the houses the Minister is referring to?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NAMWERA:  Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me correct one mis¬conception. said that the D.O. Mwatate lives in a self-contained rented house which was built in 1987, and the house is in ;wundanyi. He is not the only D.O. who lives in one place and works in another. We have rented many houses for D.O.'s throughout the Republic.This house is in Wundanyi and the telephone number is Tundanyi2257, and the house was built in 1987.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MCEAEO: Mr. Speaker: Sir, when the first D.O. was appoint¬ed in Mwatate Division in 1937, he was living in a house which was rented. One side of this house was being used by  a family   and the D.O. was given the other side to live in. In 1989, sometime early last year, the D.O. was removed. He was kicked out of that house, and he went to live at the sisal estate with a friend. He was then again kicked out, and this is when he went to live at Wundanyi. But then he went to ;7undanyi because he was appointed to perform the duties of a D.0.1, another D.O. was appointed to look after Mwatate. This D.O. even now is living in a rented sub-standard	house where facilities like bathroom and toilets are being shared.I am getting a bit surprised, and I am requesting the Minister to be kind enough to these Government officers and put up houses for them as soon as possible. The D.O. in Mwatate should not be staying in Wudanyi which, is 19 kilometres away from his duty station.Wundanyi is another Division and I do not want my D.O. to be stay¬ing in another Division.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this house cannot, by any stretch of imagination, he called sub-standard. The house which the D.O. lives in belongs, to a Mr. Myambu Mwambuuand the Government pays a rent of KSh.850.00 per month. I admitted that the D.O. for Mwatate lives at Wundanyi, and he is not the only one.. We have rented very many houses for D.O.'s living in one division and working in another. When funds become available, we shall put up a house in Mwatate for the D.O.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Sneaker, Sir. the Minister has been told that the D.O. Mr. Mwatate is sharing toilet facilities with anotnerfamily, and he seems to be disputing that fact when he says thatthe D.O. lives, in Wundanyi. Is there any justification, with allthat untarmacked road full of potholes, that the D.O. for Mwatate tobe living in Wundanyi ?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, unless my understanding of the term "self-contained" is wrong, when you live in a self-contained house you do not share facilities of the house with anybody. The district officer in question lives in a self-contained house and he does not share the toilet with anybody else unless he has visitors. The toilet .is for him and his family if he has any.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MCHARO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, every day I go to Mwatate I pass through that place and I know how bitterly my district officer is complaining. In fact, we have even gone to an extent of raising money on Harambee basis, out of sympathy for our district officer, to build him a house. When the Minister says that the district officer is not living in a sub-standard house I get surprised because  the district officer himself and the wananchi of that area are complaining. The district officer is the senior most Government officer in a division and I do not understand why the Minister has no mercy on this man. Can the Minister tell us when he is going to set money aside, as a matter of urgency, to put up a house for the Mwatate District Officer? Otherwise, the officer will cease to be given the kind of respect he deserves from wananchi.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NABWERA: Before I say anything else, let me say that the hon. Member attended a sub—district development committee meeting in Mwatate Division, where the sub-district development committee took a decision to collect money and start the construction of a house for the district officer in Mwatate. I would like to appeal to my hon. colleague that as the Office of the President continues to look for money to build a house for the Mwatate District Officer and other district officers throughout the country who live in rented houses, he should appeal to wananchi to help if he wants the house put up immediately.Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is in the Office of the President's plan that the house for the District Officer, Mwatate, should come in the 1991/92 Financial Year. The House is aware that the country is going through a very difficult financial period, and it is very difficult for the Office of the President to be categorical. I will have to add that we will build the house during the 1991/92 Financial Year, depending on the funds being made available and this House approving such expenditure.</Newspeech>Question No. 184<Header> Current Rate of Inflation in the Country </Header> MR. KILIKU asked the Vice-President and Mini¬ster for Finance what the current rate of inflation is and what steps the Ministry is taking to reduce it.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Keah): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The rate of inflation in Marcha, 1990, was 10.6 per cent. The average inflation recorded for all income groups in Nairobi over the past 12 months fluctuated slightly from 11.2 per cent in March, 1989, to 11.5 per cent in July, 1989, falling to 10.6 per cent in January, 1990 and slightly rising again to 10.6 per cent in March, 1990. From these figures, we can conclude that while we should continue our present policies of trying to reduce inflation further, it is by no means out of control.Coming back to the specific question of what measures the Ministry is taking to reduce the existing rate of inflation, I would like to state that, one, we have been controlling the fiscal deficit. It was 6.57 per cent of GDP in 1986/87, and went down to 3.87 in the last fiscal year. As was announced in last year’s Budget Speech, we are targeting a deficit of 4.2 per cent of GDP in 1989/90. Secondly, the financing of the deficit has been increasingly from non-inflationary sources- Firstly, our friends abroad have been providing us with highly concessionary non- project loans and grants and, secondly, local borrowing has been from non-banks and by means of long term bonds. Thirdly, the money supply, which was growing in the region of 20 per cent per annum in late 1989, is now growing at about 10 per cent. Fourth, interest rates have been raised to encourage savings and dumpen the demand for credit which could expand consumption. Fifth, by liberalising imports, we have increased the number of goods available on the market. This particularly applies to making imported intermediate inputs readily available. Sixth, action to enhance growth by encouraging investment has caused the economy to maintain the roughly five per cent growth of the previous four years.These actions, Sir, include amending the Foreign Investment Protection Act establishing the Cabinet Sub-Committee on investment and the manufacturing	under bond programme. Seventh, by constantly working on getting the prices of all goods and factors of production right, we have avoided a building up of suppressed inflation and have ensured that scarce factors are used in their most productive roles.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the reply given by the Assistant Minister, I think one of the factors which is causing right inflation in the country is the frequent increase of commodity prices. Could the Assistant Minister assure this House that we will no longer have these frequent increases of prices of essential commodities? This increase is causing inflation on those people with fixed income.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEAH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is impossible for me to make a categorical statement to the effect the hon. Member is asking because in most countries in Africa, Kenya included, there are international events which are beyond the control of the national governments- Those events are usually the major sources of inflation When these events take place, the price mechanism must really adjust itself. Of particular importance to my hon. colleague in this regard is the international price of oil. As the price of the crude oil purchased by this country rises, as it did in Kenya in the last one year, this is translated into a higher cost of energy locally. This higher cost of energy in turn becomes an input in the cost of production of most of the goods and services produced in the country, resulting in higher prices of these goods to the consumer.Another source of inflation which is really beyond our control is the rising price of imported raw materials and spare parts required by the Kenyan industry, and these import costs eventually affect the price of goods and services in' the country. We have to import many of these raw materials for our growing industry and, because their prices are high, we inevitably have to absorb those prices, thereby creating a situation where our own cost of production goes up this is why I cannot assure the House, that we will check the increasing costs as a sort of definite debanture.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTUA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant Minister's reply, is he aware that we are suffering because of frequent increases in the prices of essential commodities and the rising cost of living? What is he going to do to rectify the situation?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEAH: Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am aware and I would like ray hon. colleague to be aware, too of the circumstances which create this problem so that hon. Mutua, this hon. House and I may understand and appreciate the problems that are faced by our economy. This is due to factors beyond our control.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MIS0I: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we appreciate that comprehensive answer from the Assistant Minister, we know that since the price control mechanism was removed in the case of a number of items, this has become a very serious problem for the consumers in this country. Commodity prices have continued to be increased by manufacturers and importers. What mechanism does the Ministry have to ensure that necessary price increases are in line with the factors the Assistant Minister has enumerated to us? Does the Ministry simply go along withrecommendations and requests from importers and industrialists? Does he havethe necessary manpower to check stastical findings, and so on?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEAH: Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can assure the House that the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance, in conjunction with the Ministry of Planning and National Development, has enough qualified personnel to monitor these prices. Nairobi prices, for example, are monitored on a monthly basis whereas those in Mombasa, Kisumu and Nakuru are updated on a quarterly basis, and we have statisticians and economists whose work is nothing but to deal with stastics from various companies. I would like to assure hon. Dr. Misoi that we have the required personnel and that both these two Ministries are doing their work as perfectly as possible.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the Economic survey of 1988, it is said on one of the pages that Kenya's inflation rate has been caused by nothing else but the decontrol of prices, and that this is why we have an inflation rate of double digits. Could the Assistant Minister tell this House how come that the Government decided to decontrol the prices even of essential commodities? This is a major decision which was not made in this House. Most businessmen are taking advantage of decontrolled prices to exploit our people. In order to avoid this exploitation of people, could the Government assume the original system of controlling the prices, especially of essential commodities?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEAH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, decontrolling prices is one of our policies contained in Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1986 for economic development of our nation, and this policy Paper was passed by this august House. I. would like to inform hon. Kiliku that not all prices are decontrolled at the moment. Some prices are still under control while others have been decontrolled. The reason whywe have been decontrolling some prices is that we believe that in doing this, scarce factors of production will be utilised more efficiently. The decontrol mechanism dictates to companies to be sure that they are competitive. So, we are using this economic mechanism to foster our economic growth ahead.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in his reply, the Assistant MinisterSays that interest rate have been raised so as to encourage savings and demand  for credit. However, this is a developing country, and we need credit so that we may invest. Investors have been hit hard, and we should not expect any creation of employment if there is a credit squeeze in the economy. What are we going to save and where is it going to come from if we have made nothing? Investors are complaining that there is no money. Could the Assistant Minister tell this House why the government has decided to have a credit squeeze, which has hit investors hard contrary to the Government policy of creating more employment?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KEAH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I appreciate the fact that hon. Kiliku would like to have money for investment purposes but, before money can be made available for these purposes, it must first be saved. So, this is a chicken and egg situation where you cannot borrow from a non saving situation. You have to save first in order to make funds available for borrowing. If savings, therefore come first, it is important to encourage savers to save, hence the increase in interest rates so as to make savers attracted to saving rather than to consuming. From savings, we can go ahead and borrow.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWEMJE: on a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to say that the idea .of - decontrolling prices is to adjust the prices from the manufacturers and so on, when eventually they control the price of the final product? For instance you will find that they decontrol the prices of fertilisers and at the end of the day they control the price of milk.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question.

NUNO asked the Minister for Health what is delaying the opening of the Health Centre at Liboi new site, since it was completed, during last financial year, 1988/89.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur) : Mr. Speaker,Sir, I beg to reply.I wish to inform the hon. Member that the opening of LiboiHealth Centre has been delayed by the bad weather which made roadsimpassable and this delayed the completion of the project. The workhas already resumed and it will be completed in 1990/91 financialyear. About 87 per cent of the work has already been completedMR. NTJNO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister hastold us that during the 	1988/89 Financial Year the roads inthat area were impassable.- I come from the North-Eastern Provinceand I know that the Assistant Minister cannot convince this Housethe roads were impassable for the whole of the 1988/89 FinancialYear.: Could the Assistant Minister tell the House what caused thedelay in the completion of this project?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the informationmade available to my Ministry the roads in that area were impassableand that at one time a lot of construction materials were stolen whenthe lorries got stuck in the middle of "nowhere". As a result of these problems the contractor also got delayed.Even if the roads "become impassable for only three months that isalso considered to be time of the year.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. FALAITA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. There is some confusion here. The hon. Questioner is hot talking about the completion of the Health Centre. According to the Question here the Health Centre was completed during the 1983/89 Financial Year. what has delayed the opening of the Health Centre? But you can see here that the Assistant Minister is telling us that the project will be completed during the 1990/91 Financial Year. Which is which now? We are not asking for the completion; we are asking for the opening of the Health Centre ! </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR:	Speaker, Sir, if there is anybody who iscompetent to say whether a health centre has been completed or not, it is me. That particular health centre is not. complete because it has no toilet, facilities, windows and doors.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SALAT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the construction of this particular health centre was started in 1988 - about three years ago. The Assistant Minister now tells us that they were unable to complete the project because of bad weather which made roads impass¬able.' However, for the information of the Assistant Minister our area is a semi-arid area and as a result of this we do not get rain all the year round. Could the Assistant Minister, therefore, give us a more convincing answer as to why this health centre was not completed at the appropriate time? When are they going to complete the project?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGUR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the health centre will be completed during the 1990/91 Financial Year.

In any case, Sir, my Ministry does not direct by control land companies and co-operative societies. These are administered under the Companies Act and the Co-operative Societies Act which are not within the ambit of my Ministry. However, I believe this transaction will have to go through the Land Control Board which is controlled by  my Ministry and chaired by the Provincial Commissioner, Nairobi.I would, therefore, like to advice the hon. Member to take up the matter with the chairman of the relevant Land Control Board, that is, the Provincial Commissioner, so that the Board can withhold its consent if the transaction is considered to be irregular.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MYTENJE: Sir, I am surprised that the Minister saysthat he is not aware when I am, in fact, able to substantiate clearlywithout hesitation. I am also ready to Table a letter by the•lawyers of Embakasi Ranching Company which is selling to the inane of 200 acres of land to Tembo Co-operative Credit and Savings Society vide their letter dated 28th March, 1990, at the rate of Kshs.25,000/= per half acre plot which in total comes to Kshs.10 million.Could the Minister tell us the action he contemplates to take to make sure that a few directors of Embakasi Ranching Company Limited do notsell land belonging to the public to certain individuals for theirown benefit because this is tantamount to stealing.</Newspeech>(Mr. Mwenje laid the letter on the Table)<Newspeech>MR. MBELA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I still maintain thatl am not aware but, despite the fact of Kenya being are what it is,I managed to get an unofficial copy of the letter the hon. Memberis talking about and which is not copied to my Ministry. OfficiallyI am not aware of this but what I have done to make sure that thepublic is not robbed of their land is first of all, toplace a caveat on the property so that no further transactionscan be made. Secondly, I have instructed that the Nairobi LandControl Board follows the procedures we have introduced inevery district where no title deed is issued to an  individual unless the shareholding list is certified by either the district commissioner or provincial" commissioner.  In this particular case, there will be no further processing of title deeds with respect to Embakasi Ranching Company Limited while this matter is being investigated.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAMUYU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, now that the Minister has been made fully aware that this malpractice is going on, shall we take it that he has given an immediate directive that matter rests , until full investigation is done?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MBELA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am being asked torepeat myself. I said earlier on that having got this loudwhisper where I was given this letter a caveat was placedagainst the main title of this property. In addition, instructionshave been forwarded to the Provincial Comrnissioner, Nairobi to theeffect that no further title deeds should be processed untilhe has certified the names of the shareholders like is happeningin all other districts.In short, no sub-title deeds, would be issued for theland owned by the Embakasi Ranching Company Limited.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. MIS0I: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the Minister wasreplying, he mentioned the Ministry of Co-operative Development.Surprisingly, the purchasers Belong to a co-operative society.Could the Minister try to find out what is happening from thatMinistry? This is because where an issue touches two a Ministries,it is preferable that all the information should be made available.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MBELA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not quite right forus to say that we have nothing to do with land that is owned byco-operative societies. In fact, we have a lot to do with it.What we do not administer is the regulation and authority thatis required by the Commissioner for Co-operative 			  which lies with the parent Ministry. If there is anything to do with the annual returns  according to the Companies Act  then those go to the Attorney-General's Chambers. When it comes to the actual management of a piece of land, there are regulations which we have established and which we try to make sure are followed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENJE: Sir, I am very grateful that the Minister has agreed to institute an investigation into the affairs of this land. While the investigation is going on, would the Minister appoint a committee or commission to run the affairs of this firm because investigations will be difficult to carry out when the management still remains the same?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MBELA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am quite confident that the measures I have taken are adequate to protect the shareholders. As far as the criminal aspects of the directors, as alleged, are concerned, I believe it is something that the Provincial Commissioner Nairobi, can sort out and follow up.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

In 1987, it was handed over to Chepareria Primary School to be used as one of the classrooms. It started being used as a Private Members Club in 1988. I went there with the other leaders and we stopped the adminis¬tration from using this building which is inside the school compound where people go and drink Tusker and other beers.; All this is happening in a school compound where our youngsters are supposed to be moulded into a upright citizens of this country Can the Assistant Minister tell us how many classrooms there are in this school and if they are corresponding withthe school's population to the extent that ,one building can be surrendered for use as a club?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMTDO: Mr. Speaker, Six, as I have already told the House, this building was constructed in 1974 and according to the information available to me, between 1974 and 1984, this building was used by the chief of the area for his official duties. After that it was taken over by the district officer as a recreational place for Government officers. It is regreted that this building has been used as a social club, but this was a private property and the women had arranged with the district officer to use the building for this purpose and they were receiving a rent of Shs.150/- per month. However, it has now been agreed that this building will be transferred to the school, as part of the school premises.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr.ABASWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, hon. Lotim asked the Assistant Minister a very clear and straightforward question, namely, how many classrooms are there in this primary school and whether they correspond with the number, of pupils in the school.</Newspeech><Newspeech>ME. OMTLO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the school has four permanent classrooms and nine-semi-permanent classrooms.</Newspeech><Newspeech>ME. SPEAKER: Next Order please!</Newspeech><Header> POINT OF ORDER</Header> <Newspeech>DR. MIS01: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Thank you very much, for giving me this opportunity to make one small point of order. I would like to congratulate two bishops, who last week,issued veiy strong statements in support of a single-party-system.  These are the Rt. Rev. Bishop Muge of the diocese of Eldoret and the Bishop of the Methodist Church of Kenya, Bishop Imathiu. I think it is quite in order for us to take note of these statements and congratulate these two bishops. I am saying this because they are in support of the lawful rule of one party-system in Kenya. We have in many ocassians condemned all the dissidents and other disgruntled elements who have had the nerve to undermine the system of Government in this country and I believe we know k who these people are. These are people like Bishop Oku11u, Kr. Shikuku, Bishop Gitaxi and the rest. These are the few people who have given us headachein this country and it is important to note that these people will never learnanything. Their aim is to use any opportunity to distabilize the system ofGovernment in this country. Whereas we, as leaders, have spoken very wellabout the ruling Party Kanu, these people have, gone out of their way to discredit the party. However, it is our responsibility as patriotic leaders to strengthen the party and makes sure that it continues to serve this nation. We should strive to remove loopholes which may encourage these characters to keep on criticising the system of Government in this country. I would like to emphasize the importance of having Kanu branch chairman, secretaries, treasurers and all the other party official, who are highly disciplined. These officials must act in line with the code of conduct set out in the Kanu Constitution. I am saying so because if they: act against the constitution, the enemies of this country will exploit their weakness and failure.With those few remarks, I would to congratulate and thank these two bishops.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTAHT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (MR. omido): on a point of order,Mr. Speaker, Sir. I stand on a point of order, Sir, to seek you guidance ohthis matter of raising points of order. Since the beginning of the presentSitting, hon. Members have raised points of order which have later on turnedto be supplementary questions. Mr. understanding is that when points of orderare raised, they are directed to the Speaker, and therefore, it is the Speakerwho should respond to them. However, at the moment, it seems that when hon. Members raise points of order, especially during Question Tine, it is the Minister responsible to responds to the points of order. This trend appears to me to be departing from the Standing Orders of this House by allowing supplementary questions to raised under the guise of points of order. Secondly, I think it is the Speaker who should respond to these disguised points of orders rather than the Front bench responding to them. This is an important point and I am raising it for the benefit of the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I would like to say that hon. omido is out of order to criticise the Speaker on this matter. I am saying this because I have no doubt whatsoever that Mr. Speaker knows his job. Secondly, the Speaker is fully conversant with the Standing Orders of this House, including Standing Order No.1 which says:- "All matters not hereinafter expressly provided for shall be decided upon by Mr. Speaker".So, I think hon. omido is criticising the Chair and I am wondering whether Iwould be in order tinder Standing Order No.73 to discuss his uncalled for behaviour.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Hon. omido is, of course, in order to point out to theChair that certain hon. members are beginning to exploit the provision regardingpoints of order in this House when they really mean to raise supplementaryquestions and that is clearly understood. However, on the other hand, it isimportant far hon. Members to understand that our Standing Orders clearly givethem the authority to question the conduct of any hon. Member here. StandingOrder No.69 states:-“By indulgence of the Souse, a Member may may explain matters of a personal nature although there is no question before the House, but such matter may not be debated".So, hon. Kiliku is at liberty to raise the matter if he feels aggrieved as a Member of this National Assembly. After all, he is elected to represent such matters here. If you also read Standing Orders No.68, I am sure you would find a lot of explanation which would be of assistance to you. Before I sit down, I would like to remind hen. Members that they are honourable Members who are elected to represent the people of this country in this August House.</Newspeech>POINT OF ORDER<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. okondo): On a point of order, Sir. Speaker, Sir, last week when I was replying to a Question by hon. Kiliku regarding Mrs. Kinuya, I promised to let this House know what the consequences of our investi¬gations were. I am pleased to report to this louse that we have now dispatched a cheque for shs.29,000/- to Mrs. Kinuya through the District commissioner, Mombasa and she should be asked to go and collect the cheque when it arrives there. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR.

Kaaiwithi Munyi was contributing and, since he is not in and no Member wishes to speak, I will call upon the Mover to reply.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr.Mibei): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, I stand to thank all the hon. Members who have contributed to the Statute Law (Repeal and Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill. I agree with the hon. Member who said that we are updating our laws in various fields. We have the Law Reform Commission which is looking into the various laws, some of which were enacted a long time ago and, consequently, suggesting amendments which are regularly brought before this House to be debated. The debate going on in this House is one of those instances where we are updating our laws.The main thing in this Bill was the consideration of treatment that we give to petty offenders. I think we all agree that offenders sire taken to courts for punishment or for ways of rehabilitating them and it is only right that the society should consider and sympathise with petty offenders, some of who are lured into the breaking of law by other bad and notorious offenders. I would only appeal to the complainants that they should not complain when the courts decide to mete out a smaller sentence on some of the offenders. Through my experience, I have found out that when a court places an offender on probation for a minor assault, the assaulted complainant usually complains that his assailant should have been taken court. I think what we need to understand is that we should try to rehabilitate the offender so that he may not commit similar offences in future. As soon as the complainant complains to the police and the police have taken the offender to court, where the offender is convicted, he is given an opportunity to state his mitigating circumstances so that the court,using its own discretion, finds that the offender has some excuse for not beingpunished heavily, then the complainant should allow the court to exercise its discretion, either by placing the offender on probation, or by discharging him absolutely, or by applying suspended sentences, like the ones we have debated in this Bill. The courts in this country are manned by competent magistrates and judges who are trained in law. Wananchi, as laymen, should not interfere with the discretion of the courts.I am satisfied that the courts are doing good work in dispensing justice in this country and, by so doing, they are bringing stability to this nation. In this country we have the separation of powers where we, in Parliament enact laws and amend them and the Executive arm of the Government executes them. The Judiciary judges the breaking of the laws that we make in this House.Some of the points raised here concern the births and death regis-tration. I would like to appeal to wananchi to register birth of their children. I agree with various speakers that for our planners to know what todo in providing plans for education and health services, it is necessary to have the births of all children registered I have come across children who have encountered difficulties because they have various names. They have different names in their birth certificates, school certificates and identity cards. So, when they attend any interview, it is difficult to know who is who, and they are usually forced to swear affidavits showing that the names appearing in their birth certificates, school certificates and identity cards belong to the same persons. I think parents particularly should advise their children not to change their original names and choose some new ones when they are in school. Children read about different heroes in history, and some of them begin choosing some of the heroes names, such as Wilberforce with due respect to my hon. friend over there and others that we have never heard of before. These new names complicate matters when the children want to obtain their passports, jobs, and so on. So, I appeal especially to parents and teachers to guide school children not to change their names for different ones that do not appear in their birth certificates.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it was a concern of one hon. Member that seminars for magistrates should be held so that magistrates may understand what is required of them in passing sentences.</Newspeech> <Header>QUORUM</Header><Newspeech>MR. ole NAMPASO: On a point of order, Mr." Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I am afraid the House has no quorum at the moment.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): It is true there is no quorum in the House.</Newspeech> Ring the Division Bell.(The Division Bell was rung)We now have a quorumYou may go on, Mr. Mibei.<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Mibei): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was commenting on the suggestion that seminars should be heldTo update magistrates on the law. What I would say is that from time to time the Judiciary has been running courses and seminars for magistrates, and the Kenya Magistrates Association also holds conferences where magistrates and judges update themselves on the law. I am satisfied that we will be recommending that seminars be held from time to time for magistrates.One hon. Member said that professional behaviour should be reviewed before the renewal of magistrates and judges licences. There is a procedure to be followed when professionals apply for annual licences. There is a definite procedure for every professional body and those concerned have always been looking into the past records of applicants so that if a professional has messed things up and brought a bad image to his profession, he disciplined. Such a professional is also likely to lose his licence. I urge our different professional bodies to continue to apply disciplinary measures on those professionals who do not live up to the standard of their profession.Something was touched on the advertising of medicine in the Press and other media to the effect that something should be done to ensure that wananchi are not cheated by the media. There must be a board looking into such matters, and I think its members have heard what we have said in the House.We have also been informed of shortages and non availability of drugs in Government hospitals. I will also leave this to the Ministry of Health, which is more qualified to look into this matter. The Office of the Attorney General would only be concerned with prosecuting those who steal drugs from hospitals and those who are negligent in treating patients either by giving them over dosage or otherwise.I do not want to tire the House very much, but I appreciate that these are only small bits of amendments in our law and hon. Members have covered them very much in their discussions. So, with those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.</Newspeech>  (Question put and, agreed to) (The Bill was read a Second Time arid Committed to a Committee of the whole House tomorrow)<Header>MOTION</Header><Newspeech>MR. TUVA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, I beg to move the following Motion.THAT, this House adopts the Report of the Public Accounts Committee on the Government of Kenya Accounts  for the year 1987/88 laid on the Table of the House on 28th March, 1990.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Chairman of thisCommittee is now a Minister of State in the Office of the President.'- Hon. John Kyalo was appointed a Minister of State- in the Office ofthe President sometime in March, 1990, and. therefore he cannot movethis Motion today. I was a Member of this Committee and the otherCommittee Members were Hon. Makhanu Hon. Aden; Hon. Mcharo;Hon. Sagwima; Hon. Katurkana; Hon. Miruka-Owuor; Hon. Parsaoti andhon. Ibrahim Saiat. Another Member of that Committee was Hon. KabinguMuregi who was appointed an Assistant Minister last year.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Committee held34 meetings and all of them except one, were chaired by the Chairman,that is the Hon. John Kyalo. We did not have any problem of Quorumduring our deliberations; Members were present all the time todeliberate on the Report of the Controller and Auditor GeneralFor this reason, I must thank the Members of the Committee on behalfof the Chairman for the interest they showed in the deliberations ofthe Committee last year. Also, on behalf of the Chairman, I mustthank most heartedly, the Controller and Auditor General whoguided us all through the deliberations of the Committee. He wasassisted by his staff who also effectively represented him while he was away. 		Mr. Temporary, Deputy Speaker, Sir the Committee is work	would not have been complete without the services of the Head of Accountancy Services. We had him throughout our deliberations. He was always accompanied by the Head of Internal Audit. Also for everything to go on smoothly, the National Assembly Secretariat, led by the Clerk of the National Assembly, was always ready to assist us. Of course you all know that the deliberations of this Committee cannot be complete without the able hands of the Hansard Team the messengers and at the other members of staff who were involved. We had to interview the Accounting Officers whose accounts appeared in that Report of 1987/88. We had also to be assisted by the Supply Officers from Treasury. These are the officers who supply money to various Ministries. They used to sit with the Head of Accountancy Services and the Head of Internal Audit.We also had the occasion of meeting the Head of the Civil Service. We invited him to attend the deliberations of the Committee during the summary of all the deliberations of the Committee. We had to	pinpoint for him the observations that we had made duringour previous meetings. We also pointed out to him the weaknesses that we had come across. We discussed these matters with him in the presence of the Attorney General, the Permanent Secretary in theOffice of the Vice President and Ministry of Finance the Controller and Auditor General and also the Director of Personnel Management. However, a few problems arose during our deliberations. A few Accounting Officers were not prepared when they appeared before the Committee and there are a few instances where the Committee had to refer back the Accounting Officers and set another date when these Accounting Officers promised to be fully prepared to appear before the Committee. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir also the "programme" Had to be changed from time to time because of the inability of Accounting Officers to avail, themselves to the Committee on the days that had been arranged. The Committee also insisted on the Accounting Officers to appear in person instead of sending theirDeputies as their representatives. This is because in most cases these Deputies are not conversant with the issues that have been raised by the Controller Auditor-General in his Reports. There¬fore, in all the cases, the Accounting Officers appeared before the Committee.One problem that I would like to touch on here is the perennial problem of inaccurate accounts Some Accounting Officers have been submitting to the Controller and Auditor-General inaccurate accounts and this is a great weakness. Sometimes these accounts are written in a hurry. This is because the Accounting Officers leave everything : until the last minute, when they try to do everything in a hurry Sometimes the accounts are even submitted to the Controller and Auditor General without being signed. This has been happening in the past and it is still continuing and I hope that one day it will come to an end.Another problem that we observed is the over drawing ofthe paymaster-General's Account by Ministries. We have said it many times in the past that this means that the Accounting Officersborrow money without authority from Parliament. This contravenesour financial regulations In some cases Treasury is responsible for this kind of tiring when Accounting Officers over draw the Paymaster General. s Account We therefore ask Treasury to be mere vigilant and make sure that this practice is stopped. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the biggest sin committedby Accounting Officers in 1987/38 and I think the Treasury is also to blame is in connexion with pending bills. Almost every Ministry, including the National Assembly, had pending bills. The total amount of these pending bills wasK£.83,253 ,102. This meant that during the ensuingfinancial year, this amount of money was to take the first charge. This amount of money had to be paid first out of the money set aside for 1988/89 financial year. The money had to be paid to the suppliers. Therefore, this in itself disrupts development.If the estimates were meant to cover a certain expenditure both in Recurrent and Development Votes, this amount had to be used in paying the creditors. This means that the Government plans would not be a success. Using shs.3 million out of money that was meant for development projects is a worrying thing. This problem arose as a result of the circulars that the Treasury issued out to the Accounting Officers to restrain their spending because of lack of revenue col¬lection. So, when they are asked not to spend, according to the Printed Estimates, it means that they have to negotiate with the suppliers who have to wait for six months or even a year before they are paid for their supplies. We, therefore ask the Treasury to be more careful when the estimates have been made so that the Accounting Officers will not fall under the trap of pending bills. If pending bills are carried forward every year, it is going to affect the growth of the economy.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, although the Treasury is the custodian of Government funds, the Permanent Secretary in the Treasury has been spending money contrary to the thinking of the Controller and Auditor-General and that of the Public Accounts Committee. I have in rained when saying this use of the Ex-Gratia payments. Our understanding of this term is that somebody does not deserve to get some particular assistance or payment, but because of his position, a kind gesture is shown towards him by being given a token assistance. In fact, even insurance companies where they find that somebody does not qualify for payment but have pity on the person give him a little sum of money called ex-gratia payment. But with the Treasury it is the opposite of this. You will find in their case very able people, whocould even be some of us here, being assisted to pay custom duty for importedcars like Mercedes Benz and not cars like Minis, Morris Minors or Toyota Corollas. In this case, it means that the tax-payer is forced to assist this person to import his car. If Ex-gratia payments means this, then another definition has to be sought.The other weakness that we observed in the Treasury is the handling of Custom Bonded Ileuses. .Records, particularly in Thika, show that when a personimports consumption goods, a wrong tarrif is used in charging duty on thosegoods. As a result and because these people are highly educated and well drilledin reading the ad valorem taxes, they use these wrong tarrifs and as a resultthe Government losses a lot of money. By the time such a thing is discoveredby the Controller and Auditor-General such goods would have been removed fromthe bonded warehouses and as such it becomes very difficult to trace them andthe people involved.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other problems concerns thehandling of security bonds for goods that have also been in bonded warehouses.Records show that bonds have been cancelled when no tax hasbeen collected. It is also very difficult to get the culprits in this matterbecause some of the people whose bonds are being held by the Government could be out ofthe country. So we would like to ask the Treasury to be more vigilante", especially in the Customs Department, to ensure that records are properly kept and tax is collected as envisaged.The Government has been investing money in companies in the country like the sugar factories some of which have gone under and there is no likelihood that the Government will recover anything from them. The Public Accounts Committee observation and recommendation is that the Government should do all it can to see that some money is recovered when the receivers complete their work.The other problem concerns the Department of Defence where an amount of shs.50 million was set aside to buy land somewhere in the Rift Valley for practices. But this money by the end of June, It was paid to the Ministry of Lands and Housing. This was done, I think, to avoid returning it to the Treasury. While with the Ministry of Lands and Housing, this money in the books of the Department of Defence would be shown as having been spent when in fact it was sent somewhere so that it could go out of the books of this department. The Ministry held this money for one year and then in June, 1988, it returnedto the Department of Defence about shs.36 million which was used to buy houses somewhere in South for the departments staff, to make it worse, shs.36 million was paid to a developer without any sale agreement. As always we would urge the Accounting Officers to follow the laid down procedures because one day they will have to answer for this. Even by the time the Report was printed no sale agreement had been signed. This shows very well that these people do not have the interests of the state at heart. Mr." Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, another Ministrythat has had quries raised by the Controller and Auditor-General,year in year out, is the Ministry of Agriculture. Many items were raised but I will mention only one of them and that is the poor maintenance of GK vehicle that are left to rot at the Agricultural Information Centre. This matter has been brought up every year but there is no improvement. That is why we asked the Accounting Officer to be on the look-out and see that this department in every aspect operates according to regulations.Paragraph 106 of the Report which is about the Ministry of Health deals with the current discussion in the country about tendering of medical supplies. The Ministry of Health is notorious with irregular awards of contracts as is the Ministry of Public Works. Here is a good example where somebody has to pay for the damage so done. This paragraph ex-plains how the product	Called Absolute Ethyl Alcohol, in short, Ethenol AR was acquired irregularly. I will quote this paragraph as follows:"The Medical Stores coordinating Unit recommended to the Central Tender Board that the fifth lowest tenderer be awarded a contract to supply 500x2.;5 litre packs of the item at the price of Kshs. 625.00 per 2.5 litre pack and the Central Tender Board approved the award of the tender to the firm at that price.The firm was recommended for the award of the contract on the basis that they had submitted an acceptable sample of the item. The tender documents, however, indicate that the firm as well as the other firms which had tendered for the item did not submit an acceptable sample with its tender documents. It is not, therefore, clear, on what other basis the Medical Stores coordinating Unit recommended to the Central. Tender Board that this firm, which had not clearly submitted an acceptable sample, be awarded the contract in preference to the other tenderers who had quoted lower prices. If the tender Had been awarded to. the lowest tenderer at Shs.. 171.92 per 2.5 litre pack, Government would have saved Kshs.'226,540.00." sir after calling several officers concerned withthis particular award and having heard the evidence given bythe Accounting Officer, the Committee recommended that theofficer(s) responsible be surcharged a token sum of.,£shs.5,000/=each. This is going to be left to the Accounting Officer toidentify the people who misled the Committee and they should,therefore, be surcharged Ksh.5,000/= each.Paragraph 107 of the Report talks about the sameMinistry on the supply of 1,000 metres of white cloth material.I will quote this paragraph as follows:"During the year, a firm based in Kisumu was paid Kshs. 60,000.00 for the purported supply of 1,000 metres of white cloth material for nurses uniforms at the Provincial General Hospital. Although stores records indicate that 100 metres were taken on charge on 24th September, 1987, no such material had been received and the entire consignment had not been delivered by January 1988. No explanation has to-date been given for paying for goods which had not been received or for issuing a false certificate to the effect that materials had been received. In addition and as far as it has been possible to ascertain, the cloth material has not so far been delivered to Government and no explanation has been offered for this irregularity. No indication has also been given as to what action is being taken to have the material in question supplied or the amount irregularly paid recovered.The Accounting Officer tried to explain but the Committee made the following recommendation: The Committee recommended that the Accounting a Officer should ensure that the amount involved is recovered in full and further that disciplinary action including a token surcharge of Kshs.2,000/ be taken against the officer concerned.This is the kind of recommendation the Committee has been giving where it looks clear that people have been trying to defraud the Government through false dealings Money is always paid out but there is no evidence to show that the goods have been delivered. In this case, it looks a gentle way of stealing, from the Government.In the past Reports, we have s. seen how house leases have been handled by the Ministry of Public Works. We have also seen how the Government has been losing a lot of money. I am sure that all hon. Members have this Report (1987/38) where they will see that this has been repeated year in year out.One good example of careless handling by Accounting Officers was the winding up of the National Construction Corporation. It was this House which repealed the Act that governed the National Construction Corporation. For-date, there are no final accounts for this corporation and nobody knows where its assets are and even the liabilities are not very clear. Even the Accounting Officer himself does not have this information although this corporation has been wound up we have to get the final accounts in order to know what is owed to different firms. There is no trace of books of account and I think most of them are lost or burntTherefore, the Committee urges the Accounting Officerto finalities the winding up of the National Construction: Corporationby providing the final accounts.Paragraph 162 is about Aerodromes Department which is under the Ministry of Transport and Communications. There are many firms which are this department a lot of money in the formof outstanding revenue. Some of these firms are Government Department and private airlines whose air craft’s land at the airportSome of them issue bouncing cheques and some of the cheques cannotbe traced up to now. Some of the people who issued these cheques are from outside the country and it looks as if the Government has already lost some money. Therefore, we asked the Aerodromes Department and in particular the Accounting Officer of the Ministry of Transport and Communications to make sure that he tries to trace some of these cheques. Since they are in Government stores, I am sure that if effort is made, some of these cheques can be traced. Some of these cheques are now stale Sir.'There is an s. Act of Parliament which governs this period which. I think is called .An Act of Limitation. Some of these debts are so old that it is impossible to recover them. Therefore, we ask the Department of Aerodromes to be on the lookout not to be cheated again by foreigners, in particular.Under the same Ministry, in paragraph 166, you would find that the Kenya Airways was able to convince a certain banker that Treasury has given them the guarantee to borrow. However what the Treasury had issued to them are what we call letters of awareness" arid these letters of awareness were used by the Kenya Airways to borrow K.£7,500,000 Similarly, in another instance, cy using the same letters of awareness, Kenya Airways borrowed K.£750,000. We have seenmany times in this House occasions where Treasury has brought Sessional Papers requiring the Government to guarantee the borrowing of such monies. However, in this particular case, although the Controller and Audi tor-General brought up this matter several times no action was taken by Treasurer. Therefore we urge the Accounting Officer in the Ministry together with Treasury, to regular raise this matter. I am saying this because in the event of any action, I do not think that Government would be able to pay for Kenya Airways monies raised in this way since they do not have the blessing of this House. Therefore since the Minister for Finance is here, we urge him to take a serious note of what we are saying here and take the necessary action as recommended on page 474 of the Controller and Auditor-General' s Report.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to quote paragraph 189 which concerns the Ministry of Livestock Development. This is another example of irregular purchase of motor vehicles. The explanation here is rather complicated and therefore, I would like to quote what the paragraph says for the benefit of hon. Members who do not have the Report with them here. This is what the paragraph says:“Irregular Purchase of Motor Vehicles" 189. In Jane 1987, the Ministry of Livestock Development "bought a Volvo 240 GL, four door car described as new. and paid K.Shs.850 for it. However, on delivery, the vehicle which isa. 1986 model was found to have been registered under a civiliannumber and was therefore second hand. The vehicle has not so"far been allocated a Government registration number and still bears the civilian registration number. It is also not clear how theprice of K.Shs.350,000/- was arrived at and agreed on. The Ministry farther placed an order for two Peugeot 504 GR. four door saloon cars from the same company for a total of KShs. 740,000/- in the same month. Only one of the vehicles was however delivered and taken on charge but it has not so far been put to any use and has since been left lying idle and unregistered at the Kabeie Veterinary Laboratories Bulk Store since its delivery on 25th June 1987. Further, itI has been noted that the vehicle is not new but only repainted. The|second vehicle was not delivered and, the sum of K.Shs.370,000 relating thereto, was placed in a suspense account within the Ministry. Available information further indicates that the firm had not quoted the lowest price and that there were to other quotations for K.Shs.346,541/- and K.Shs.360,000/- respectively per vehicle. It is not clear why the Ministry decided to buy second hand vehicles from the firm at the price of a new motor car and ignored the lowest prices quoted for new vehicles.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is what the recommendation by the Public Accounts Committee regarding the above paragraph says:"The Committee heard the evidence given by the Accounting Officer that M/S Mig Safari irregularly sold two Volvo Vehicles at K.Shs.850,000/- each and was further informed that the same firm was to supply two Peugeot 504 CER saloon cars at a total cost of K.Shs.740,000/-. However, only one second-hand vehicle was supplied. "While noting that the firm has been taken to court, the Committee recommends that the Accounting Officer should institute disciplinary action against the officers implicated in these irregular dealings.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, according to the recommendation of thePublic Accounts Committee regarding this paragraph, one might perhaps thinkthat nothing much is being done, but I would like to inform this House thatTreasury is doing sane thing about this issue. At the end of my speech, I willexplain the action taken by Treasury regarding the issue.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Culture and SocialServices has committed the most serious sins during the last decade. If you lookat paragraph 205 and the subsequent paragraphs, you would notice that the samethings have been raised in the previous Auditor General's Report. Mention hasbeen made in these paragraphs of the malpractices that have been made in thisparticular Ministry. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Accounting Officer in the Ministryis the Permanent Secretary while the Accounting Officer in the National Assembly,is the Clerk while in the Attorney-General's Chambers, the Accounting Officer is the Solicitor General, we heard evidence from the Accounting Officer from the Ministry of Culture and Social Services that he was ordered to cancel a tender in favour of someday who had been appointed by somebody else. This was a case where we heard an Accounting Officer accusing somebody else. It is rather unfortunate to hear a big man like an accounting officer accusing somebody else. In paragraph 205, we are told the following:205. The Development Appropriation Account for Vote D.18 - Ministry of Culture and Social Services for the year ending 30th June, 1988 reflects an access of K.£1,871,513. The Excess was caused mainly by Deficiency in Appropriations in Aid of K.£2,702,354, against Gross Surplus of K.£830,841. An Over Expenditure of K£2,502,942 on Re-development District Stadia, an item where an amount of K£7,764,442, was spent against a provision of K£5,26l,500, also contributed to this excess vote.The Committee heard evidence from the Accounting Officerthat excess vote of Sh.l,87i,513 was caused by additional projects not included in the original estimates, reduction of k£l,670,000 in the Supplementary Estimates and deficiency in Appropriations in Aid amounting to ££2,702,354. The Committee's recommendation: "The Committee reiterates its recommendation under paragraph 234 of 1986/87 Report that Parliament dis¬allow the Excess vote until a full inquiry is made by a special committee appointed by the Government to probe into all aspects of expenditure incurred during the 4th All Africa Games and the report of the probe committee be made available to the Public Accounts Committees".Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we could not go further to discuss this matter because we were waiting for the report by the probe committee appointed by the Government. There are some documents that were not available to the Committee and therefore, it was impossible to carry on.An example of the problems that faced the Committee was the in availability of records. In the case of payment of allowances, a lot of money was given to the directors and departmental heads who were suppose: to give, this money to people below them in the Department. But,funny enough a lot of money cannot be accounted for to the tune of Sh.8,652,860.85 because there were no schedules attached to show who the recipients of this money were. Therefore, the Controller and Auditor General could not actually get any explanation from the Accounting Officer and we still ask the Accounting Officer to provide us with this information.There are so many such examples, as losses of equipment at Kasarani; property getting lost at Kasarani and yet Kasarani is an enclosed place, but somehow equipment got lost and nobody seemed toknow where this very expensive equipment went to. Therefore, we request all Accounting Officers to be more careful in handling their equipment because we have to explain all this to the taxpayer, how the money or goods have been handled or spent.I know that hon. Members are very keen to peal on this Report and. therefore, I will not take much of their time. However another Ministry that I would like to mention is the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. Although now Department of Broadcasting is a parastatal, this will re-appear in the report until that Department is wound up. The problem with the Broadcasting, in particular, is the collection of Appropriations in Aid and also arrears in Appropriations-in-Aid because some people were given services by the Advertising Department on television and also on radio. Some were given credit facilities but they did not honour their obligations by paying. Therefore, the Department of Broadcasting had a problem of trying to trace these people so that they could pay back the money, but up to now, a lot of money is still outstanding. I hope that one day all these peoplewill be trace and be made to pay.The Ministry of Tater Development is no exception. There were so many points raised by the Controller and Auditor-General on the Ministry of Water Development was reflecting “negative” salaries and this has been the case for some time. One reason was poor keeping of personnel records and another one was authorizing non-statutory deductions. These were deduction that could have been avoided but because they had been put in the payroll   like contributions to co-operative court recoveries, pay¬ments for tenant purchase houses and so on. That it means is that the Government is paying for these people by advancing them money. For example, if my pay slip total is supposed to show Sh.2,000,00 but I get a pay slip of Sh.2,500.00. The deductions are so much that the Government is advancing me Sh.500.00 on top of my salary due and, therefore, it means that the Government is, in fact, meeting some of my financial obligations. If I am not the only one who enjoys such a facility but almost half of the people in the Ministry, then this comes to a very large sum of money. This is one of the sins committed by the Ministry of water Development and we ask the Accounting Officer to be more vigilant to see that if this is not drastically reduced then it should be stopped completely. I amsure that sometimes our Vice-President and Minister for Financegets stomach; constipation because of such activities Accounting Officers. He does not know where to get the money today for people like these and also for advancing others.		Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the report on theMinistry of Commerce, you will find heads like Loss of Sugar, orTransportation of Sugar or Storage and Loss through Re-bagging,and Refer to Drawer (R.D.) Cheques. Therefore the Ministry ofCommerce is no exception. It has been plagued by these problems for years. Therefore, we urge the Accounting Officer, who hasbeen there for some time, to see that all these observations by theController and Auditor General do not re-appear in future reports.The Ministry of Education has a problem of recovering moneyadvanced to students as loans, university students and it was mademore serious because there were no proper records kept. Some ofthese students have completed their studies and they are supposedto pay because their loans have matured, but they cannot be traced.Sometimes there are no records to show how much a student owes theMinistry and, therefore, we ask the Accounting Officer to be morecareful and see that records are properly kept so that studentscan be traced. Also, those who complete their degree studies 	overseas, sometimes raising they have problem of raising enough money for their return today and the Ministry of Education has been kind enough to assist these students by asking our emphasis to advance them some money to buy return tickets home. With regard to those who get loans for studies locally. Normally they do not Some of them do not give proper records of address or place of work when they so that they can be traced what way come back here. Therefore, there is a lot of money outstanding. Also, records are not properly kept and you will find that the Ministry of Education is owed a lot of money on transportation. We urge those patriotic Kenyan students who have come back home through such kind assistance to avail themselves to the Ministry of Education and work out a scheme of repayment.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Report I am holding here also includes a Treasury Memorandum indicating what the Treasury has extracted from the various recommendations made by the Public Accounts Committee over the years. In this particular case, we have Treasury Memoranda on what action the Treasury has taken arising from the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee for the years 1976/77, 1977/78, 1978/79, 1979/80, 1980/81, 1981/82, 1982/83, 1983/84 and 1984/85. The Treasury has been following up the recommendations of- the Public Accounts Committee on the various actions to take, and under page 71 you can see what actions the Treasury has taken or the inability to take action because some people cannot be traced, others have retired, died or have been sacked in public interest. Under such circumstances, maybe Treasury has not been able to take action on the recommendations made by the Public Accounts Committee.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, under paragraph 116 - page 183 - you can see the action taken by the Treasury. These are just examples. Paragraph 116 was for the year 1977/78 and it dealt with irregular auction sale Lanet Beef Research Station. The Treasury Memorandum says that the accounting officer has confirmed that the full amount was recovered on 1st August, 1980. I am only surprised to see that it has taken so long to take action and report to the House. However, I have been assured by the Treasury and they will do their best and make sure that such Treasury Memoranda will be following the Report as soon as it is issued.Sir, under paragraphs 67 to 70 on page 181, you find that Treasury action is given here for loss of cash and stores. It is said here that the accounting officer has confirmed that three officers who were involved in the loss have since been convicted and jailed for three years. These are just examples, and I have been trying to show hon. Members that arising from our recommendations Treasury is taking action to see that the culprits are either taken to court or surcharged, only that the amounts so recovered are not equal to the losses reported.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the institution of Public Accounts Committee, as an arm of Parliament, is very important because Parliament is supposed to be the custodian of public funds. We are the people who legislate for taxation and, therefore, we have to make sure that the tax payer gets goods and services for which he pays. In case of any thefts, action should be taken through the office of the Attorney-General. This Committee is very important in all Commonwealth countries. Today we were visited by the Chairman of the Tanzanian Public Accounts Committee together with the Chairman of that country's Foreign Relations Committee. They came around here to find out how their High Commissioner is spending the money allocated to his office. From here they will go to Uganda and other overseas countries to make sure that the money given to their embassies is properly spent.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the Motion and request hon. Makhanu to second it.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I arise to second this Motion on the Report of the Public Accounts Committee for the year 1987/88. In doing so, I wish to thank this House for having afforded me the opport¬unity to serve in the Public Accounts Committee for a period of two consecutive years. At the same time, I wish to thank the Public Accounts Committee, particularly the Chairman, for the able manner in which they handled the matters that were raised, by the Controller and Auditor-General. As you will notice, the Public Accounts Committee has got its work up-to-date because we are talking about the Report for 1987/88, and I am sure that the Report for the year 1988/89 is just about to come out ready for discussion.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, going through the Report of the Public Accounts Committee, hon. Members will notice that there are three important issues that have been raised, and to which I invite hon. Members to read carefully. The bulk of the Report is actually the audit queries raised by the Controller and Auditor-General. They are written in paragraph form. The second aspect is the Committee's recommendations, and which the Committee wishes this House to deliberate on and adopt. The third aspect which has been touched on by the Mover of the Motion is the Treasury Memorandum which has been attached to the Report. I am sure that this must be the first time the Memorandum, has been attached to these Reports, and I wish to thank the Treasury for coming up with it will have a bit of time to talk about the Treasury Memorandum. And the actions that are being taken by the various Ministries.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when you read the Report and digest it, what comes out clearly is that increasingly we are getting a Civil Service which is becoming less accountable in the sense that management of public affairs in terms of finances is becoming an elusive factor. Through the period that the Public Accounts Committee met, we interviewed accounting officers and what one notices is that indeed, some of the accounting officers are least prepared and they seem not to be in charge of their various Ministries. In fact, on occasions the Committee had to call some accounting officers for a second and even a third time to clarify certain issues. In fact, the Committee was even tempted to recommend that there be appointed accounting officers, other than permanent secretaries, . to manage certain affairs in certain Ministries. We felt so because some accounting officers proved to be fairly incompetent. I can even cite four cases where account¬ing officers looked fully unprepared and openly incompetent.This goes a long way to show that when the top brass of the Civil Service is not patriotic enough to manage our affairs in terms of finances, we are heading for a situation that will produce things like corruption in our society. It is our duty to call upon public servants to be serious in their operations. Quite often you find I am sure hon. Members-have had similar cases in their own districts that instead of engaging themselves in the management of public affairs on behalf of the government, some civil servants are just out to make themselves, hunt down certain politicians, and so on, and this is not in good faith.What also comes up very clearly, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, is that there is a little bit of indecision in the Civil Service which has led to a lot of wastage of public resources in our Government. When you go round our provinces, you will find a lot of wastage in certain station of Government vehicles, for example, some of which may have been grounded for a simple mechanical default, such as a missing nut. Such a vehicle is left to lie idle for several years. If a quick decision is made either to auction the vehicle or dispose of it somehow in an appropriate manner, the Government may be able to retrieve some value from such a vehicle or avoid some loss. As it is now, however, there is a lot of wastage and, in the end the Government might probably not be able to recover anything from some of these resources. There is quite a lot of indecision that is increasingly creeping in due to sheer lack of responsibility on the part of civil servants, and this indecision is causing a lot of wastage.If I may touch on one or two other points  I am sure hon. Members have studied this report and made their own decisions concerning our recommendations I would like to discuss the issue relating to the Ministry of Culture and Social Services, with particular reference to the management of the Fourth All-Africa Games. The Mover of this Motion has clearly indicated that the Ministry of culture and Social Services can very well be described as the Ministry that has committed the most crimes in the last decade, although thereare many other Ministries that can equally. fit this description. This nationwas lucky in that the Government was spared the embarrassment arising out of the issue of the Fourth All-Africa Games. First of all, there was the Ministry of Culture and Social Services and then there was the Games Organising Committee, which had a secretariat. Unfortunately, the Games Organising Committee was given responsibility to organise the games but it was not given financial powers. When you read through the report before us, this point will come out very clearly". The committee was not given the necessary tools to carry out the responsibility allocated to it rather most of the authority needed especially in financial matters was vested in the Ministry.I am going to cite some cases which will clearly amplify this point. On this note, I would sincerely like, through the privilege of this House, to exonerate those able Kenyans who were seconded, appointed or selected to manage the Fourth All Africa Games they did a good job and, fortunately enough, five of them are hon. Members of this august House. As I have said, however, the Ministry of culture and Social Services placed its officers there and withdrew all financial decision making, including other necessary tools for the management of the games, from those in whom it should have been vested. This country was lucky in that the games were finally held very successfully and the Government was spared the embarrassment of a possible failure of the games. So,we must thank these officers and exonerate them from</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL HERITAGE (Mr. Lalampaa): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I do not want to interrupt my good friend, but could he declare his interest in this matter? Is he one of those officers to be exonerated or what is he talking about?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, my interest here is that I am a Member of the Public Accounts Committee, I am seconding this Motion and I am commenting on what is in this report here.Let me elaborate on what I am talking about. I have been in the Government system, and I know that there is a facility in this system called"single sourcing", when it comes to acquiring, Government supplies services andso on. Single sourcing has been very much misused in this country, as it was during the Fourth All-Africa Games as you will notice when you read through this report and interview those responsible the Ministry of Culture and Social Services, which was responsible for these games. It comes out very clearly that, through single sourcing, the leasing of computers you can read on page 93 and the following pages of this report was budgeted for about.Shs.5.8 million. Quotations were invited by the Games Organising Committee, but, as far as we can get from our interviews, we find that the recommendations of the Games Organising Committee were not followed; instead, the Ministry resorted to single sourcing by appointing somebody of its choice who, in the first instance, never even applied as a tenderer or contractor. In the end, the Government paid Shs.15.8 million, up from Shs.5.8 million.There was also the acquisition of transport. The Games Organising Committee, because of the nature of its appointment, was to look for transport to be used during the Fourth All-Africa Games. An exercise was carried out, tenders were advertised in the local Press, and individuals applied. I am sure some hon. Members applied to be allowed to let some of their vehicles be hired for the purposes of the games. On the eleventh hour, however, single sourcing was resorted to and an individual was given the contract whereas the individual had, in the first instance, not indicated that he was interested in the contract and never even responded to the advertisement for tenders. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, you will find thatthrough that single sourcing method, an amount of Shs.17 millionwhich was budgeted for transport was exceeded to the extent thatthrough single sourcing that individual was paid Kshs.34 million.Hon. Members should read this Report so that they are conversantwith the issues we are raising here. So, Shs.34 million was paidthrough single sourcing. These two cases and several others which am sure hon. Members will read about Hon. Members should readthe 1987/88 Report together with the 1986/87 Report of thePublic Accounts Committee if you marry the two Reports you will know what exactly I am talking about. The justification for this single sourcing method is that work is urgent. we were lucky in thesense that His Excellency the President agreed that Kenya wouldhost the 4th All Africa Games in 1987.The decision by Kenya to host the Games was reached in 1982. So, we cannot decided why single sourcing was resorted to at the eleventh hour. This kind of indecision led to wastage. It also shows an apparent lack of patriotism on the part of our officers. I am not saying that all public servants are not patriotic In fact some of them are doing a wonderful job for this country and we must commend them But those few who do things that tend to tarnish the good name of the Government should be weeded out.Finally, as the Mover of the Motion mentioned, there is a report by a probe committee which has not been made availableto the Public Accounts Committee for reasons best known to Government The Report has been published but I do not know what there is to hide about that Report. It may probably go to confirm what the Mover mentioned here; that the Accounting Officer was being ordered from    above to do certain things probably that is what the Probe Committee has revealed. But for the benefit of the entire country that Report should be made available to Parliament forscrutiny and further action.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Mover talked about Treasury Memorandum and this is published on page 171 of the Report. I must express my thanks to Treasury for its action and for its constant reminders to the Accounting Officers. Actual all that the Treasury Memorandum is about is that the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee are communicated through Treasury to the Accounting Officers. The Accounting Officers have to act on the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee But when you read through the Report you will find that some Ministries are not taking these recommendations seriously; they are not taking any action. The Mover said that action has been taken regardingjust a few cases. But in the majority of the cases, no action has been taken. On page 201 of the Report several paragraphs have been dedicated to the Ministry of Public Works but no action. has been taken on the issues raised  in those paragraphs. The Ministry has made no comments on the following issues Board of Survey on Unallocated  Stores; Irregular Determinationof Contract; Amounts Due From Government Ministries; Irregularities and Lack of Financial Controls and Poor Quality of Blankets. However the Ministry took action regarding the national Construction Corporation. So, you can see that out of about seven items action has been taken on only one items. This kind of thing runs through all the Ministries. So, it is our hope that Accounting Officers will take the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee very, very seriously. In this country we are lucky to have a system that works very positively, we have a system where theGovernment stands accountable to the people we want to enhance that system. But when certain officers fail to enhance our policies ofNo my brother you are making a mistake here; you had better do other duties." I say this because those officers who make mistakes are tarnishing our public accountability. So, we hope that when hon. Members go through this Report and if they particularly pay attention to our recommendations they should be able to come up with a decisive decision. We are not at war with our brothers in the Civil Service because the Civil Service is a very necessary arm of the Government. We are only trying to maintain the checks and balances for the common good of our people.With those few remarks, I beg to second the Motion.</Newspeech> (Question proposed)<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MUTISTSS FOR INFORMATION AITD BROADCASTHTG (Mr. Nassir) : Bw. rlaibu Spika wa Muda, nakuomba ili uwaombe watu wa magazeti wayaandike mambo matatu ambayo nitayataja hapa sasa hivi Kazi ya Public Accounts Committee inaonyesha kwamba Serikali yetu nachama chetu klmoja cha Sanu Hii  inaonyesha kwamba Serikaliyetu inafanya kazi kia njia nsuri sana.

WaziriMsaidizi ameliomba Bunge limuulize-ni nani ambaye hana-kiti ofisini katika "  tfizara yake. Kwa hivyo, tungependa atueleze huyo mtu ni nani na lama hiyo ni Wizara gani.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Nassir): Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, ningependa kulijulisha Bunge kuwa hiyo ni Wizara yangu na tayari nishapatiana jina la ofisa huyo na nina hakika hatua ifaayo itachukuliwa Ninayasema mambo yote haya kwa sababu hizi ni pesa za urama.Ungonjwa mkubwa unaotukabili ni ukosefu wa dawa katika hospitali za Serikali. Ingawa ni hivyo utaona kuwa katika kampuni nyingi za Serikaliambako kuna maofisa wengi wao wanatumia pesa.nyingi sana kuhudumiwa na madaktriambao wanahospitali zao wenyewe au wanatibiwa katika hospitali za watu binafsi.Pesa wanazotumia kwa matibabu hayo zinatosha kujenga Kenyatrta National na Coast General Hospital za dhahabu. Pesa hizi zingetosha kununua dawa hospitali hizi na hata madaktari wangeweza kulipwa mishahara mizuri. Pia pesa hizi zingeweza kutumiwa kuongeza vyumba vya private wings katika hospital, zetu za kuhudumia watu wakubwa kama Mawaziri na WaLsaidizi wao. Kama ingefanyika hivyo,basi pesa hizo zingekuwa zinaingia kwa Serikali. Lakini kwa kuwa watu wetu wapenda sana kwenda kwenye hizi hospitalibasi ndiyo sababu hospitali hizi zinazidi kuendelea na zetu zinazidi kuwa mbaya. Hii ni siasa ya ukoloni ambayo inafaa ifutiliwe mbali. Kwa hivyo, ni bora watu wote waende kwenye hospitali za Serikali ili tuwe na pesa nyingi hata kuweza kuwapatia masikini matibabuya bure- Utaona kuwa katika hospitali za Serikali wagonjwa hutibiwa hata kamawanafanyaikazi katika kampuni Joibwa .kubwa. Kwa hivyo, tunahitajika kuendelezahospitali zetu ili watu wetu waweze kuhudumiwa vyema katika hizi hospitali.Serikali yetu pia inapoteza pesa nyingi sana kuwakodishia nyumba watu wakubwa kama vile Mawaziri na Mawaziri Wasaidizi. Wakati mwingine nyumba hizi hukodishwa hata kwa shs.7,000.00 Mimi nimekuwa Waziri Msaidizi kwa muda wa miaka 14 na pesa zote nilizotumia kwa kukodishiwa nyumba zatosha kununua nyumba ambayo ningeweza kuishi humo bure. Lakini sisi tunawapatia matajiri pesa. Kwa hivyo, pesa kama hizi zinazotumiwa zinaweza kutumiwa kujenga nyumbaza kutumiwa na Mawaziri na Mawaziri Wasaidizi. Kwa hivyo, si vizuri kuendelea kuwapatia hawa matajiri pesa bila sababu yoyote.Kwa hivyo, Bw. naibu Spika wa Muda, ninafuraha kwa sababu katika Serikali wakikosa huambiwa. Hii ndiyo demokrasia. Mimi kama mwanachama wa Chama chetu nionapo makosa husema kuwa siyapendi. Hii ndiyo sababu nilisema kuwa ninataka waandishi wa habari vjaankiwe wale wagehi wote wanaoishi hapa kuwa demokrasia yetu ni ya kweli na hatufichi mambo kwa ssibabu tuna Chama kimoja. Kwetu mtu akifanya makosa huadhibiwa. Kwa hivyo, ningeiomba Idara ya Hazina i jaribu kuokoa pesa kabla hazi jaibiwa. Wanaweza kufanya hivyo, kwa kufanya uchunguzi wa matumizi ya pesa kila mara. Si vizuri watu kuruhusiwa kutunri. a pesa za Serikali vibaya halafu kila niwpJca. Wabunge war.aambiwa wafanye uchunguzi kuona vile pesa hizi zilitumiwa.Watafanya uchunguzi wa aina gani kama pesa tayari zimeliwanu.wakati tenda zinapeanwa au wakati gari la Serikali linanuliwa na nambari ya Serikali baao Naishukuru Ofisi ya Makau wa Sais na Wizara ya Fedha kwa kutengeneza Bajeti kuangalia juu ya bei za bidhaa, import licences na kadhalika lakini si vizuri Wizara hii izipatie Wizara pesa kwa mnajili ya taiziiumia; vibaya. Ingefaa Wizara hii iangalie kwa makini, juu ya matumizi ya pesa za Serikali. Ewa hayo machache, naunga mkono.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. P. S. MASINDE: Thank you, Mr. Temporary DeputySpeaker, Sir. I wish to take this opportunity to congratulatethe Public Accounts Committee for the wonderful job they have done I think they have been very thorough in their work and have done a good job.'The main thing this Committee discovered was themisuse of public funds by Ministries, parastatals theofficials concerned in looking after these funds. These peopledo not seem to be taking this issue seriously This Committeehas also recommended certain action which, if strictly followed,would help to cut down this extravagancy. I support them fully because I have looked at their recommendations and found them to be genuine and valid I hope that the Treasury and other affected Ministries will take appropriate action as quickly as possible. Sir the wananchi of this country who are committedto the development of our country, should not be reading the Reports of the Controller and Auditor-General and the Public Accounts Committee year after year whereas no appropriate action is being taken from this Report, .we all know what is happening. We know that we have Ministers in charge of these Ministries and Managing Directors in charge of parastatal bodies and yet we go on listening to the same story year after year without any action being taken. It is the high time Kenyans were committed to the save their country in whatever way and also work for the development of the country.I will start by commenting on the Ministry of Water Development.1 On a number of occasions, we have heard of pipes being supplied without being utilized. We have also heard of big water projects which have been started, a lot of money pumped in but are later left in abeyance or abandoned half-way.: We know that water is a very important commodity and that the ministry should utilize fully whatever little money it has to make sure that they supply water to the wananchi in order to fulfill their pro¬mise of supplying every home with clean water by the year 2000This cannot be done if the Ministry concerned is not going to take the situation seriously.Ministries should sit down and go through the amount of money that has been allocated to them and also appraise the job which that money has done. In this way, they will see whether the money has done the job it should have done to their satisfaction or not before they come up to ask for-supplementary Estimates and so on. Another Ministry in point is the Ministry of Transportand Communications." We have talked about various forms of communications ranging from water, road, air and so on. Communication is a problem in our country. Kenya Airways, which is a means ofcommunication, is having problems. It is not having problems because it has no money or because it is not making money but because of gross mismanagement.When we had the East African Airways, some of the excuses with, regard to failures were that it was difficult to get decisionsMade by the three Governments which owned the air line. Here we have our own airline which is a national flag flying throughout the world but out of negligence, we have embarrassed it to the detriment of our country.Sir, look at the condition of roads and bridges, especially during the rainy seasons. I know that there are bridges which were crudely built over 60 years ago, but they are hardly washed away during rainy seasons. However, when you look at roads and bridges which have been constructed recently, by the wonderful experts we have today, using better materials than those of 60 years ago, you find that they are the first ones to be washed away every time we have rains. When we are having bridges being washed away by rains, we are, in effect, having our money being washed away. For how long shall we continue having this sort of situation? We, still call our¬selves patriots of this country, at the same time.The Ministry of Planning and National Development has come up very well as far as the District Focus for Rural Development Strategy is concerned." However, there are certain procedures which were made for the officers in the districts to follow. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir I feel that some of these regulations should herevised and I am calling upon the Ministry of Planning and Rational Development inconjunction with Treasury to do this. Right now, we have the district development Committees which are doing their best in our development. These committees recommend projects for implementation on the basis of priority. In the districts, we have the district development officers who control the funds on behalf of the district officers who are the chairmen of the district development committees. He also have the district executive committees who determine the priority for the implementation of these projects, and then pass on their views to the district development committees. Sometimes the district development committees are bogged down with so much work that they may not have ample time to carefully look at these recommendations. I feel that this situation should be rectified so that the members of the district development committees fully get involved in determining the priority for the implementation of these projects right from the time these recommendations come from the sub-district development committees. This would make sure that these projects are given the proper priority for implementation.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I feel that the Rural Development Ponds should be scrutinized more. I remember at one time that the Minister for Planning and National Development informed us here this was going to be done, but up to this time, I do not think it is being done satisfactorily. Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to make sure that the funds released to the district development committees are properly used for the intended projects. The projects that are being undertaken through these funds should be properly supervised and monitored so as to make savings where necessary. At the moment, there are projects all over the country which were recommended by the district development committees and implemented half-way. This is a waste of public funds and something ought really to be done to complete these projects to save Government from losing a lot more money in these half-way done projects.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, at the moment, wananchi require medical services very badly, but you will find cases where health centres were startedAnd then left half-way completed. Other times you would find health centres which have been completed and have been left to lie idle because there areno staff to man them. Where health centres are operating, you would find that	more than half of the time, there are no drugs to treat wananchi. We have talkedin this august Souse about this problem quite often, but never seems to be solved and everyday that goes, things seem to be getting frombad to worse.The Ministry of Agriculture is another area which I would like to touchon. I would like to say that I have picked on these few Ministries, not becausethey are the worst offenders, but because they are very important Ministries,and every Kenyan depend on them. The Ministry of Agriculture should encouragefarmers to produce more of the food crops that do well in a given area. TheMinistry should be able to send field officers to the shambas to advise farmers on how best to grow these food crops in an economical manner. They should advise them on the type of spray they should 3b use far their crops and how much fertilizers they should use on their farms. This is because if a farmer uses too little or too much fertilizer on his farm, this would not help him to get the maximum yield. I do not think that the Ministries of Agriculture and Live stock Development are short of staff. I know that these two Ministries haveenough qualified officers who could be used to assist our farmers to produce more. I think these officers work for only two months after the Budget and after that they are rarely seen in the field. For most of the time, you will find them warming their comfortable chairs in the offices doing very little if nothing at all This is either because they have no fuel for transport or because there are no spare parts for their broken-down vehicles and therefore, they sit in the offices waiting for money. However, during the Budget, we allocate enough funds to run± these services and it is surprising to note that the officers work for only two months after the Budget.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, the Accounting Officers in these Ministries should be able to send their officers in the field to make sure that the money we vote here is properly used and controlled. We do not want to see officers sitting idle in office? to just wait for the end of the month for their salaries.We have voted this money to assist wananchi and we would like these officersto assist them. In some areas, we still have many land cases unsettled and the Land boardswhich are supposed to hear these cases, are given very small allocation of funds.Sometime, you would find that after a land board sits, its members are not givenany allowances and are told to report to the district commissioner's office,and when they do so, they either find that he is not there or there, is money.There are caseiy4here the land board members keep on chasing this money and theyend up even spending much more than they are given. This money ought to be givento them immediately after the sitting of the land board. These are the kind ofthings that are encouraging corruption and cause these land boards not to beefficient in their work.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would now like to say something about the Ministry of Local Government. Under this Ministry, we have local councils and the parastatal bodies belonging to the various Ministries. Today, there are several Ministries or parastatal bodies which axe creditors to this Ministry through services renders or through appropriations in-Aid. The surprising thing is that no effort is made to collect these debts and this encourages the.Accounting Officers to quickly jump into recommending far the increases of several taxes because they cannot made sufficient effort to collect their debts. I think the Accounting Officers and the Managing Directors in the various parastatal bodies should take note of this. Treasury should make sure that before accepting the increase in the price of any commodity, enough scrutiny is made regarding the effort the Ministry concerned has made in its debt collection.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, quite a number of tenders have been issued and in some cases, they are either inflated or irregularly awarded, something which encourages corruption and shoddy work. A firm checkup should be done on this and a team should be formed to rectify the situation. This team should be developed in districts and also in provinces so that they can also bring out the shortcomings of the activities of the public servants, but not only to wait for these shortcomings to be brought up by the Controller and; Auditor-General in the Public Accounts Committee.Finally, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, while I very much support the recommendations brought forward by the Public Accounts Committee, I would like to emphasise here that the culprits, the wrong doers, should be punished. He should be made to pay or be punished in a way effective enough to be a lesson to others. The question of transferring lazy officials or officials who have misappropriated funds from one place to another, in fact, is merely encouraging other people to do the same. It is not discouraging at all. Those found guilty should be punished and, if possible, made to suffer a little so that others can learn from the misdeeds of others. The Treasury, where possible, should have overall cowers of instituting these punishments to these wrong-doers. After all it is the Treasury that dishes out the money and, therefore, they should demand to know how the money has been spent and if not satisfied, they should institute the punishment, or follow it up until it is recovered.With those few remarks, I wish to support the Motion.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MWAMZAITDI: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.First of all, I would like to congratulate the Mover of the Motion for the able manner he has been able to move the Motion. I would also like to congratulate the entire Committee for the great work they have done in this report. Also, I would like to Congratulate the controller and Auditors General and his memberstaff for the good work he is doing to this Republic.It is normal that we annually have the Public Accounts as contained in our laws and regulations of the country, but would expect improvement in the report, or whenever the Centre and Auditor-General points at mistakes.We are surprised to hear some remarks which show that some members of staff and some accounting officers do not bother with queries raised by the Controller and Auditor-General. To support that remark, I would like to refer the attention of hon. Members to paragraph four of the Report. It is said:"The format of the Report is the same as in the past. We wish however, to register our displeasure with some accounting officers who neglect to respond to the queries raised by the Controller and Auditor-General in time."The fact that it is reported that some accounting officers neglect to respond to audit queries in time shows that whatever recommendations the Public Accounts Committee may make, the issues still remain the same. We have such people in every society who think that they are untouchable in the sense that they feel that they are very near some executive powers and they should not care. Those people are the ones who make Government transactions very difficult and ruin the smooth run¬ning of the Government.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have seen that some officers do not care about whatever may be said by the Public Accounts Committee. Their work is to sabotage whatever development plans we may make. We would like to see changesSir, the purpose of the Public Accounts Committee is to improve the accounting system in the Government and ensure that services are rendered to wana¬nchi.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President has seen it fit to increase the salaries of civil servants, and we would like to see them working hard to justify the increment. However, on the other hand, I have been surprised to see that whatever little money that has been increased will be taken away by the National Hospital Insurance Fund. I am a contributor of the Fund and I do not benefit from it. Many people have their salaries deducted and the money so" deducted submitted to the National Hospital Insurance Fund but they do not benefit from the Fund. It needs a rich man to go to hospitals like Aga Khan, Pandya Memorial, Nairobi or Mombasa. If you are poor you remain in Government hospitals and you do not benefit from the National Hospital Insurance Fund despitethe fact that they contribute to the Fund. What benefits does the Fund give the common citizen? "It only serves the rich. If one goes to Nairobi Hospital he finds that what the National Hospital Insurance Fund covers is very little and he ends up paying almost everything for himself.Sir, I do not see the reason why His Excellency should increase the salary of civil servants and, at the same time, some Minister somewhere takes the money to National Hospital Insurance Fund.I. suggest that the mode of tendering in any department can make you rich if it so wants, without you having to shed any sweat. We have seen people who cannot afford to do complete the intended work given tenders. We also have seen people who have quoted higher bids to the Central Tender Board given contracts while the lowest bidder is neglected. This is one way of making certain people rich. Why should you not choose the lowest bidder only to award a tender to the highest bidder? Is it because of the competence of the latter whereas all those who apply for the tenders are competent enough to be awarded the contract? We should always pick on the lowest or the middle bidder so that we may save a little money somewhere.Let me quote the paragraph relating to the Ministry of Health, with regard to an irregular award of contracts."During 1987/88, a number of irregularities . relating to the award of contracts were noted among them being:(a) Absolute Ethyl Alcohol (Ethenol) ARThe Medical Stores Coordinating Unit recommended to the Central Tender Board that the fifth lowest tenderer be awarded a contract to supply 500x2.5 litrepacks of the item at the price of Kshs.625.00 per 2.5  litre pack and the Central Tender Board approved the award of the tender to the firm at that price. The firm was recommended for the award of the contract on the basis that they had submitted an acceptable sample of the item. The tender documents, however, indicate that the firm, as well as all the other firms which had tendered for the item, did not submit an acceptable sample with its tender documents. It is not, therefore, clear on what other basis the Medical Stores Coordinating Unit recommended to the Central Tender Board that this firm, which had not clearly submitted an acceptable sample, be awarded the contract in preference to the other tenderers who had quoted lower prices. If the tender had been awarded to the lowest tenderer, at Kshs.171.92 per 2.5 litre pack, Government would have saved Kshs.226.540.00."Why should an officer behave that way?"The Committee heard the evidence given by the Accounting Officer and was concerned at the irregular manner in which the tender was awarded resulting in a loss of Kshs.226,540.00 to the Government.The Committee, therefore, recommends that the officer(s) responsible be surcharged a token Kshs.5,000/= each."		Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I. am sure that noaction will be taken against those officers. The Committee recommended a surcharge but no action will be taken. All Minister should sit in the Chamber to listen to what hon. Members are saying about this Report so that they can go back and discuss these matters with their officers. But funny enough, we have only one Cabinet Minister in the Chamber at this particular moment. Unless we put two or three Assistant Ministers to make one "Big Minister" But that is unacceptable. We have only oneCabinet Minister in the Chamber now the Minister for Supplies and Marketing, hon. Mudavadi.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL	SERVICES (Mr.  MakAnyengo): On a point of order,	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the hon. Member in orderto use the term "Big Minister" when the Constitution of this country does not talk of Ministers and Assistant Ministers? In our Constitution, Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers are referred to as "Ministers". Is he in order to say that we should put four or five Assistant Ministers together to make one "Big Minister"?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I said that we have only one Cabinet Minister in the Chamber now and that the rest are Assistant Ministers. EachCabinet Minister's car has a plate with letters "CM" on it while an Assistant Minister's car has a plate with letters "AM" on it.</Newspeech>   	<Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge) : Order  May be for     the benefit of the whole House, I should read Standing Order No.2(a) which reads in part as follows:"Minister" includes the President, the Vice President, other Ministers, the Attorney-General, Assistant Ministers, and any other person who holds temporarily any such office."So, hon. Mwamzandi’s statement is misleading.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have y	Assistant Ministers only in the Chamber now. The it Bigger Ministersare not here except hon. Mudavadi.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): I think hon. Mwamzandi knows very well that an Assistant Minister is a Minister. Also according to our Constitution and our Standing Orders here Ministers and Assistant Ministers have a collective responsibility. In other words if a Minister is not here and an Assistant Minister is here, I think the Assistant Minister, in his capacity as a Minister, takes notes of the proceedings of the House and when the Minister comes the Assistant Minister draws the attention of the Minister to what has been going in the House in the Minister’s  absence. If the Minister does not turn up in the Chamber, then the Assistant Minister takes it upon himself to reply to the debate on behalf of the Government. So, you are not in order to say that Ministers must be here.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MWAMZANDI: Thank you. I hope that they are taking notes so that when the Cabinet Ministers come</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES(Mr. Mak'Anyengo): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. In accordance with your ruling, could the hon. Member withdraw his remark and apologise? He should apologise for saying that two or three Assistant Ministers make one "Big Minister." ?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MWAMZAITDI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I be to withdraw that one because I do not want to embarrass my hon. friends. The hon. Assistant Ministers and particularly the Assistant Minister for Health, hon. Ogur, should ensure thatthese officers who have been recommended to be surcharged are really surcharged. Disciplinary action should be taken against these officers.The anti-snake venom is very important. But funny enough for those of us whocome from the hot climatic areas such drugs cannot be found in our hospitals.As a result people have been forced to revert to traditional medicine which we are not sure can combat these problem 100 per cent. After one has beenbitten by a snake even if he has been given this traditional drug he stillhas to go to the hospital where the poison has to be sucked out. If such drugsmiss in a hospital then it means that these medical officers are playing aboutwith people's lives. Let me go on quoting as follows:"The Medical Supplies Coordinating Unit recommended	that the second lowest/tender be awarded the contract of	for the PP of 8,000/mgs of the serlum at shs. 118.00per 10 miligramms and the Central "Tender Board approved the award of the tender to the firm at the same price. It is understood that the lowest tenderer who had offered to deliver the item at shs.122.per 10 mgs. Amps thatis, at shs.12.21 per 10 mgs was not awarded the tender on &	ground that the firm had asked for payment through irrevocableunconfirmed letter of credit. In view of the considerable savings which should have accrued to the Government if the offer by this firm  have been pursued, it is not clear why the Medical Stores Coordinating Unit and the Central Tender Board did not consider the offer and the implied mode of payment. Had the lowest offer been accepted the Government would have saved a sum of shs.846,320.00.This amount could even have been used to buy more of this anti-snake venomthat I have been talking about. The Report goes on as follows: a difference between the amount of shs.944,000payable to the firm which was awarded the contract and shs.768,000 which should have been paid to the lowest tenderer. The Committee therefore recommends disciplinary action including a token surcharge of shs. 5,000 to be taken against each of the officers 	concerned."Such irregularities start in the Ministry's Headquarters and when one goes to the hospital he hardly gets any drugs. When you go to the hospital they prescribe for you drugs to get from their pharmacy, but when you go there you do not get any. On many occasions patients are asked to buy drugs from private chemists. I personally have had such cases to handle. How can a poor personbe asked to buy certain things for an operation when he does not have the money? Will such a patient not die since he cannot afford to buy these things? The Ministry must improve its procedures on tendering. Corruption in that area must be curbed. If such things can happen in the Ministry's Headquarters how about in its departments? This is the reason. They there are -no drugs in the hospitals. In fact, drugs are being sold everywhere outside the hospitals. In fact, nearly everybody hats drugs in his house to sell. Sir, I wish there were a committee, as stipulated in our Standing Orders, which would allow us to help the Minister to determine where some of the medicine goes. This is just one example of several Ministries with a similar problem. You can imagine how much money is being wasted through negligence in all the Ministries. You must have seen how contracts are given to tenderers. A certain engineer is granted a tender and within a short time the constructed road is full of potholes.  Why is this Is it that the engineers standards are low and, if so, why are they awarded the tenders in the first place? You must, also, have read about some contractors who abandon the projects after they have been awarded the tenders. There was a Question here last week seeking to know why a given contractor abandoned a project. Why is this so?We must be careful so as not to waste public funds. We must help His Excellency the President. It is not fit for His Excellency the President to visit every part of the country to point out mistakes there himself. His Excellency the President has several Ministers. Why do we have to leave all the work to him? Why can the Ministers not help out in these matters? You always see a Minister keeping a low profile until the President tours an area and notices defects in some things and reveals them. We should improve our approach.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Any other hon. Member willing to contribute</Newspeech> <Newspeech> MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. the Public Accounts Committee ReportsAre debatable in Parliament and they are the property of the whole House, the Ministers, Assistant Ministers as well as Back Benchers. It looks as if the Front Benchers are just taking this as a Private Members Motion. I think they should be enlightened by the Chair so that they can know that this is a general Motion for the whole Souse, although it has been moved by a Back Bencher. A11 those in the Front bench are quiet because they think the issue concerns the Back bench only. Can the Chair assist here?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER(Mr. wabuge): Well, I think the hon. Member is right. The Motion before the House is the property of the whole House and there is no way, however, you force any Member to speak, if he does not wish to do so. I think the Ministers are talking note of the contributions so that at the time of replying they will respond to the remarks by the hon. Members. Once a Motion has been proposed, normally, it becomes the property of the whole House, and not of the Back Benchers.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>DR. MISOR: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think we all appreciate your explanation to the effect that the Motion before the House is the property of the whole House and, therefore, all hon. Members are expected to contribute on it. This is because the issues which have been raised are not just of relevance to Back Benchers they are relevant issues which affect the various Ministries and their departments. Therefore, the Ministers, as the custodians of those Ministries and departments, are supposed to respond to the comments being made here, and to support the work of this Committee, which is a select Committee of this House. I do not, however, see any of them showing any willingness to speak at all.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPGTY SPEAKER- (Mr. Wabuge):  Order.I think I made a clarification on that and said that if an hon. Member does not want to contribute, you cannot force him to do that, whether he is in the Front bench or the Back bench.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TECHNICAL TRAINING AND APPLIED TECHNOLOGY (Mr. Thuo): On a point of order Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. I very much appreciate the sentiments being expressed here, that the Motion is for the whole House. However, I think those of us who want to contri¬bute in the Front bench, including myself are looking at theremaining time and, possibly, that is what is hindering us from trying to catch the Speaker's eye. Therefore, we canbe excused.</Newspeech> 	 <Header>ADJOURNMENT</Header><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Order. Hon. Members, it is now time for interruption of Business. The House is, therefore, adjourned until tomorrow 3rd May at 2.30 p.m.</Newspeech> (The House rose at thirty minutes past Six o'clock)
